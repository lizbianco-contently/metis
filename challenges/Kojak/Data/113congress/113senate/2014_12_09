Mr. President, if the words Hemingway said so clearly--\n``man is not made for defeat''--applied to anyone in the world, they \ncertainly apply to Tim Johnson. He is a testament to this sentiment \nbecause he never ever acknowledged defeat. He refuses to be defeated.\n  Tim never lost an election. He served in the House of Representatives \nfrom 1987 to 1997--for 10 years. He served in the State legislature. \nThey weren't all easy votes and weren't all easy elections. He won his \nelection in 2002 by 524 votes. Hundreds of thousands of votes were \ncast, but he won by 524 votes.\n  Senator Tim Johnson refused to succumb to defeat because he knew he \nwas fighting for the people of South Dakota. He fought for South Dakota \njobs when he fought to keep Ellsworth Air Force Base open and running. \nIt was based near Rapid City, and he saved it from closing. He worked \nto this end, saving thousands of jobs, preserving a thriving economy \nbased on that Ellsworth Air Force Base.\n  During his tenure in the House and Senate he fought for water, which \nis so important. People from so many other States don't realize how \nimportant water is to States such as South Dakota and many Western \nStates. Water is something you always have to keep your eye on. He \nsecured funding for the Mni Wiconi Rural Water Project and the Lewis \nand Clark Rural Water System. Combined, those two projects provided \nclean drinking water to some 400,000 people. That is half the \npopulation of the State of South Dakota.\n  Without question though, Tim's biggest fight took place in 2006. I \ncan still remember that so clearly. I got a call from his chief of \nstaff saying: You need to go to the hospital. Tim has been taken by \nambulance to George Washington. So I went there because Tim had \nsuffered a very bad bleed on the brain. He was born with this \nsituation--no one knew of course--but it suddenly hit him. Lots of \npeople have this condition, but most people don't have a bleed on their \nbrain, but Tim did. I was there in the hospital with him. Barbara was \nthere, his daughter Kelsey, and his two boys, Brendan and Brooks, came \nin as soon as they could. One was serving in the military after having \nseen combat duty as a member of the U.S. Army. The other boy is a \nlawyer and is now a U.S. attorney in South Dakota.\n  It was a very difficult time for his family and a difficult time for \nhim especially. He was in surgery on more than one occasion. His life \nwas threatened. Many people don't survive this difficult situation he \nwas hit with. But he is a huge man. I, frankly, never realized how \nphysically big and strong he was until I saw him lying there in the \nhospital. But Tim met these physical challenges, and they were very \ndifficult. Ten months later he was back working in the Senate. He was \nhere on the floor.\n  After this incident, his physical body would never be the same, but \nhis mental capacity is better than ever. With the support of his wife \nBarbara, since 1969, and their three children, whose names I have \nalready mentioned, he made this remarkable recovery. It was all very \ndifficult. He had to learn to talk again, he had to learn to walk \nagain, and much of his life now is physically different than it was \nbefore. He is now, a lot of times, in a wheelchair, but he has never \nasked for any sympathy. He has pushed forward as he always has his \nwhole life.\n  Regardless of these changes to his body, his honorable, indomitable \nspirit is the same. One newspaper recently said, in speaking of Tim's \nreturn to the Senate:\n\n\n[[Page S6402]]\n\n\n       Loss of integrity is a greater handicap to any politician \n     and, once lost, cannot be regained with confidence. Johnson's \n     integrity has never been in question.\n\n  Tim Johnson has his integrity. He has his unbreakable determination \nto fight for the people of South Dakota and just fight to do the things \nhe needs to do.\n  Tim is retiring after 18 years in the Senate and 10 years in the \nHouse. To say he will be missed by the people of South Dakota is a \ngross understatement. He worked here with my predecessor, the \nDemocratic leader Tom Daschle, and they got so many good things done \nfor the State of South Dakota. Senator Daschle is missed as Tim will be \nmissed, but their friendship is something I have long admired.\n  To show the type of person he is, the person he beat by 524 votes \ncame back the next election and endorsed him--a Republican and long-\ntime Member of the House and Senate, Larry Pressler. He endorsed Tim \nJohnson in his reelection. That is the kind of integrity Tim Johnson \nhas. People admire him very much.\n  Tim Johnson leaves the Senate as he entered it, undefeated. I will \nmiss him very much. My wife will miss Barbara. They are members of a \nbook club, and I have seen their exchange of emails back and forth as \nto what books they should read, what they thought of the book, and \nwhere they are going to meet. So the Reids will miss the Johnsons. \nSouth Dakota will miss the Johnsons. But Tim will still proceed forward \nand be a great blessing to the State of South Dakota, as he has always \nbeen, and to his family.\n\n\n                               Tom Harkin\n\n  Mr. President, Abraham Lincoln once said:\n\n       I want it said of me by those who knew me best, that I \n     always plucked a thistle and planted a flower where I thought \n     a flower would grow.\n\n  Today I stand for just a few minutes to honor a man by the name of \nTom Harkin. Throughout his time in the Senate he has planted many \nflowers--so many we can't count them all. Tom Harkin's legacy of \nfighting for all Americans, particularly those who are disadvantaged, \nwill never be forgotten. In fact, no one in the history of this \ninstitution has done more for people who have a physical disadvantage, \nan emotional disadvantage, a mental disadvantage, and disadvantages \ngenerally, than Tom Harkin.\n  Tom's life wasn't easy. His father was a miner. His mother, a \nSlovenian immigrant, died when Tom was 10 years old. He and his family \npushed forward, living in a house without hot water or a furnace.\n  Not one to use his difficult upbringing as an excuse, Tom Harkin \npushed himself very hard. He attended Iowa State University. He came \nthere on a Navy ROTC scholarship. Upon graduation, he enlisted in the \nNavy and became an Active-Duty pilot--a naval pilot.\n  I have such admiration for naval pilots, for all pilots, really, but \nthinking of landing on an aircraft carrier out in the middle of the \nocean, that postage stamp size you have to try to find and land out \nthere is something Navy pilots do, and Tom Harkin did this.\n  In 1974 he was elected to represent Iowa's Fifth Congressional \nDistrict, a seat he held for 10 years. When he came to the Senate in \n1984, Tom, similar to President Lincoln before him, encountered many \nthistles.\n  He was especially motivated to help millions of Americans with \ndisabilities, as I have already said. Here is what Tom Harkin said \nonce:\n\n       I heard stories from individuals who had to crawl on their \n     hands and knees to go up a flight of stairs, who couldn't \n     ride a bus because there wasn't a lift or couldn't cross a \n     street in a wheelchair because there were no curb cuts. \n     Millions of Americans were denied access to their own \n     communities and to the American dream.\n\n  Tom did a lot to make sure people did have the ability to dream. What \ndid he do? He encountered the injustice faced by millions of disabled \nAmericans and responded by authoring the Americans with Disabilities \nAct.\n  People don't realize now what those disabled people had to go \nthrough. There was a big dispute here in the Senate and in the House as \nto whether Members of Congress should vote for this. It created a lot \nof issues for businesses. A former Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, James Bilbray of Nevada, was getting a lot of pressure \nnot to vote for this, but he voted for this, and here is why he voted \nfor it:\n  Just like Tom Harkin saw this long before many of us did, James \nBilbray had a friend whose daughter was confined to a wheelchair. This \nman wanted to visit Congressman Bilbray and his family here in \nWashington, DC. What an ordeal it was. They couldn't find a place with \na hotel room. They had trouble getting airline reservations. It was \nextremely difficult. So Jimmy Bilbray said: That is enough for me. I am \nvoting for this.\n  This landmark legislation that was pushed and pushed by Tom Harkin \nhas helped to move areas of employment, public services, \ntransportation, and telecommunications for people with disabilities. \nTom Harkin's work to protect the disadvantaged hasn't been just \nreactive, it has been preventative.\n  Tom has lost four siblings to cancer. In response to that heartbreak, \nwhat has he done? Senator Harkin fought to double the funding for \ngroundbreaking medical research at the National Institutes of Health. \nHe had a partner in this for many years, Arlen Specter from \nPennsylvania. They worked on that subcommittee, Labor-HHS, and \nAppropriations. Some will remember that this was an unbelievable thing \nhe did to force us to spend more money on medical research. But in \nhindsight, what a blessing this was for America and for Members of the \nSenate who voted for this. It was good for us, and it was good for the \ncountry. It was good for our constituents. With the extra money NIH \ngot, they have engaged in a landmark effort to cure cancer, heart \ndisease, and a myriad of other diseases.\n  We have a long way to go. Funding hasn't been adequate the last 6 \nyears. The only boost we got in NIH funding was in the stimulus, the \nfirst few months of the Obama administration where we got additional \nmoney. That was done as a result of the work by Tom Harkin and Arlen \nSpecter, and that money now is not there. We need to do more for the \nNational Institutes of Health.\n  Tom Harkin has been tireless. He worked to triple the funding for the \nCenters for Disease Control. In fact, in ObamaCare he is the one who \nwas responsible for the prevention title in that bill.\n  He has spent his career coming to the defense of the defenseless. A \nlongtime defender of human rights, Tom has worked to fight child labor, \nboth domestically and abroad. His tireless efforts gave him the U.S. \nLabor Department's Award for the Elimination of Child Labor.\n  I have spent much of my Senate life on the Senate floor. I can \nremember when I would look and see one of his staff come to the floor, \nand I thought: Oh, no. I knew we were in for some trouble. His name was \nRichard Bender. I really have such admiration for Senator Harkin's \nstaff, but it was epitomized when Richard Bender walked in this door \nbecause I knew Harkin was going to do something we had not planned. \nSometimes it took a lot longer to get things done because of Bender and \nHarkin, but in the end it was always better for our country.\n  So after a lifetime of service, Tom will finally be able to spend his \npost-Senate time in another direction, still involved in a form of \npublic service. I have such great admiration for Ruth, whom I know \nextremely well. I don't know Amy and Jenny, his daughters, but I do \nknow they are going to be able to spend a little more time with their \ndad and her husband.\n  On a side note, Tom Harkin is one of the few Senators who has been to \nmy home in Searchlight. I was there one day, and I got a call. He said: \n``Are you going to be home?''\n  ``Yes.''\n  ``Do you mind if we drop by?''\n  ``No, I don't mind if you drop by.''\n  So within an hour he was at my home in Searchlight.\n  So as Tom Harkin closes a chapter of service to the American people, \nI salute Tom Harkin on a job very well done. He has become the longest-\nserving Democratic Senator in Iowa's history, and he will be greatly \nmissed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/09/senate-section/article/S6402-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6402-S6403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker).

PICKERING\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a fallen \nsoldier from Kentucky who was lost in battle. PFC Brandon T. Pickering \nof Fort Thomas, KY, died on April 10, 2011, in Germany from wounds \nsustained on April 8 in Wardak Province, Afghanistan, when enemy \ncombatants attacked his unit with small arms fire and a rocket-\npropelled grenade. He was 21 years old.\n  For his service in uniform, Private First Class Pickering received \nseveral awards, medals, and decorations, including the Bronze Star \nMedal, the Purple Heart Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the \nAfghanistan Campaign Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, \nthe Army Service Ribbon, the Overseas Service Ribbon, the Army Good \nConduct Medal, the NATO Medal, and the Combat Infantryman Badge.\n  Says Tammy Moore, Brandon's mother:\n\n       To know Brandon was to know love and laughter.\n       When Brandon was boarding the plane to go back to \n     Afghanistan, he turned and looked at me and I thought, ``My \n     God, my son's a man.'' It was the first time I looked at him \n     and didn't see him as my little boy.\n\n  Brandon grew up in Fort Thomas, in northern Kentucky and attended \nWoodfill Elementary, Highlands Middle School, and Highlands High \nSchool. As a kid growing up he loved to fish and played baseball and \nfootball. Brandon also practiced tae kwon do as a kid, and he earned \nhis black belt by age 10.\n  Brandon's high school classmates and teachers remember him as an \nunassuming student with a big heart, a good sense of humor, and a \ndedication to helping others.\n  Says Highlands High School principal Brian Roberts:\n\n       As a school, we join the Fort Thomas community and the \n     family in mourning his loss.\n\n  Says former high school classmate Stephanie Orleck:\n\n       Even on bad days, I was always able to turn to Brandon to \n     bring out a smile on my face.\n\n  Brandon also had a mischievous side. His mother recalls:\n\n       Brandon loved a good prank. In high school he decided it \n     would be funny to place a mouse trap in another student's \n     locker. When the principal called him, he admitted it right \n     away.\n\n  That was the worst trouble Brandon ever gave his parents.\n  As a teenager, Brandon also enjoyed the freedom that came with his \ndriver's license.\n\n       While teaching Brandon how to drive, he told me, ``Mom, I \n     know you don't want to hear this, but this is the happiest \n     I've ever been.''\n       I told him, ``Brandon, I know you don't want to hear this, \n     but this is the most scared I've ever been!''\n\n  After graduating high school in 2008, Brandon attended Cincinnati \nState.\n  Tammy recalls:\n\n       After two semesters, he told me he was thinking of joining \n     the Army. I asked him to give school another semester and if \n     he still felt the same, I would support his decision. The \n     third semester came and went, and Brandon was firm on his \n     decision.\n\n  He enlisted and in September 2009 he left for basic training at Fort \nBenning, GA. After basic training he was stationed at Fort Polk, LA.\n  Tammy said:\n\n       There was a small town outside of Fort Polk named \n     Pickering; Brandon thought that was neat and so did I.\n       Brandon was an only child, but when he got to Fort Polk he \n     found brothers.\n\n  Assigned to Fort Polk in April of 2010, Brandon was assigned to the \n1st Platoon, Company C, 2nd Battalion, 4th Infantry Regiment, 4th \nInfantry Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division. He was soon \ndeployed to Afghanistan for Operation Enduring Freedom in October of \n2010. Part of a two-man machinegun team, Brandon was 6 months into his \nfirst combat tour when he was fatally wounded.\n  Brandon was flown to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany \nbefore he died. Because of this, his family was able to be with him \nbefore he passed away.\n  Brandon made one final gift by volunteering to be an organ donor. His \nfinal sacrifice was an offering of life for four Germans, including a \n6-year-old girl.\n  Tammy said:\n\n       Even in his death, Brandon saved the lives of four people.\n       I often wondered how I could have raised such a wonderful \n     human being and then I think, only by the grace of God.\n\n  The Fort Thomas, KY, road where Brandon grew up was fittingly renamed \nin his honor as a permanent reminder of his life and his deeds. The \nportion of River Road in Fort Thomas that runs from State Route 8 along \nthe Ohio River to South Fort Thomas Avenue next to the Cincinnati VA \nMedical Center is now named the Private First Class Brandon T. \nPickering Memorial Highway.\n  We are thinking of Brandon's family as I recount his story for my \nSenate colleagues, including his mother Tammy Moore, his father David \nPickering, his grandfather Thomas Pickering, and many other beloved \nfamily members and friends.\n  Brandon was laid to rest with full military honors at the Alexandria \nCemetery in Alexandria, KY. His tombstone bears the words, ``Live a \nlife worthy of my sacrifice.''\n  Tammy had some final thoughts on the words that mark her son's grave.\n\n       People should think about that--not just for my son, but \n     for all the sons and daughters, and the ones in the past.\n       What people have sacrificed to keep this country free--\n     freedom isn't free, and it's not cheap. It comes at a high \n     cost, and we all have a responsibility to each other and to \n     this nation.\n\n  I couldn't agree more with Tammy Moore's thoughts, and I want her to \nknow that this Senate certainly does recognize the responsibility we \nhave as a nation to honor and always remember the sacrifices of brave \nheroes like her son, PFC Brandon T. Pickering. We are in awe of his \nlife of service, and we are humbled by his final sacrifice. From \nGermany to Afghanistan to Fort Thomas, we can see the lives he touched \nand the people he left better off for having known him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/09/senate-section/article/S6403-2", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Congressional Record will show the \nintroduction of and prayer by our visiting Chaplain today, Father \nClaude Pomerleau of Portland, OR, a member of the Holy Cross priests. \nThat is as much of a thumbnail as saying any one of us is a U.S. \nSenator, period. There is a lot more to it.\n  Claude Pomerleau has been nearly 50 years a priest. I know because he \nis my brother-in-law, and my wife Marcelle and I, as well as his \nwonderful parents, Phil and Cecile Pomerleau, joined him in Rome nearly \n50 years ago when he was ordained a priest. My family--my parents, my \nbrothers and sisters, and also our children--has always had such a \nwonderful relationship with Father Pomerleau. It is great now to see \nthe young grandchildren come in and give him a hug and say: Hi, Uncle \nClaude.\n  I also look at his distinguished career. He is not just a brother and \nbrother-in-law, an uncle and friend, he is a man who has taught, speaks \nmany languages, and who has a Ph.D. from the University of Denver. He \nteaches now at the University of Portland even in semiretirement and \nalso in Santiago, where he is a well-respected visiting professor, and \nwhere I am told his Spanish is like that of a native.\n  He was born in Vermont. His parents are French Canadians, two people \nwho strongly practiced their religion, believed in it, and brought up \ntheir children speaking French at home. They instilled in him the \nvalues that really make our country great and make a human being even \ngreater.\n\n[[Page S6404]]\n\n  He has been a mentor. He has been a moral anchor for our family for \ndecades. I think of him being on the altar as a young altar boy at the \ntime Marcelle and I were married 52 years ago, and he has been part of \nour lives and our marriage ever since. He is the man we turn to when we \nwant guidance. He is a man both of us love greatly. And I would like to \nsay, as the longest serving Member of the Senate, what an honor it was \nto have him open with the prayer.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for allowing this.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/09/senate-section/article/S6404-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today for the first time the American people \nare going to learn the full truth about torture that took place under \nthe CIA during the Bush administration. I have served for 22 years with \nthe chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Dianne Feinstein. She is \ndignified. She is very thorough in whatever she does. She is \nintelligent and she cares a great deal. She has proven herself to be \nthe one of the most thoughtful and hard-working Members of this body. \nThe people of California are, as well they should be, very proud of \nthis good woman.\n  I am appreciative of the work the Senate Intelligence Committee has \ndone under her direction. We are here today because of her efforts. She \nhas persevered, overcome obstacles that have been significant, to make \nthis study available to the American people.\n  I am gratified for the work done by Democrats on the Intelligence \nCommittee. We are here today, again I repeat, because of their efforts. \nWe do not often mention, as certainly we should, the work of our \nstaffs. I want to throw a big bouquet to the intelligence staff. They \nhave worked so hard. Under the direction of Senator Feinstein, they \nhave worked for 7 years--7 years--working on this vitally important \nmatter. It is a report that was not easy, but they did it.\n  Here is what they did: Committee members and staff combed through \nmore than 6 million pages--6 million pages--of documents to formulate \nthe report. The full committee report is 6,700 pages long--7 years, I \nrepeat, in the making.\n  The unclassified executive summary, which is going to be released \ntoday, is more than 500 pages. I want everyone to understand, the \nSelect Committee on Intelligence, along with the House Committee on \nIntelligence, is the only group of people who provide oversight over \nour intelligence community. They actually have the ability to \ninvestigate what happened. No one else. Not the press, not Senators, \nnor the public, or outside organizations have the ability to \ninvestigate the CIA. But we did it. The implications of this report are \nprofound. Not only is torture wrong, but it does not work. For people \ntoday, we hear them coming from different places saying, It was great. \nIt was terrific what we did. It has got us so much.\n  It has got us nothing, except a bad name. Without this report, the \nAmerican people would not know what actually took place under the CIA's \ntorture program. This critical report highlights the importance of \nSenate oversight and the role Congress must play in overseeing the \nexecutive branch of government. The only way our country can put this \nepisode in the past is to come to terms with what happened and commit \nto ensuring it will never happen again. This is how we as Americans \nmake our Nation stronger. When we realize there is a problem, we seek \nthe evidence; we study it; we learn from it. Then we set about to enact \nchange. Americans must learn from our mistakes. We learned about the \nPentagon papers. They were helpful to us as a country. The Iran contra \naffair. I was here when it went on. It was hard on us, but it was \nimportant that we did this. More recently, what happened in that prison \nin Iraq, Abu-Ghraib.\n  We have three separate branches of government, the judicial, the \nexecutive, and the legislative branches of government. To me, this work \ndone by the Intelligence Committee, of which the Presiding Officer is a \nmember, cries out for our Constitution, three separate, equal branches \nof government.\n  We are here today to talk about the work done by the legislative \nbranch of government. We can protect our national security as a country \nwithout resorting to methods like torture. They are contrary to the \nfundamental values of America. So I call upon the administration, the \nIntelligence Committee, and my colleagues in Congress to join me in \nthat commitment, that what took place, the torture program, is not in \nkeeping with our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/09/senate-section/article/S6405-4", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6405-S6414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE STUDY OF THE CIA'S DETENTION \n                       AND INTERROGATION PROGRAM\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the leader for his \nwords and for his support. They are extraordinarily welcome and \nappreciated.\n  Today, a 500-page executive summary of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee's 5\\1/2\\ year review of the CIA's detention and interrogation \nprogram, which was conducted between 2002 and 2009, is being released \npublicly. The executive summary, which is going out today, is backed by \na 6,700-page classified and unredacted report with 38,000 footnotes \nwhich can be released, if necessary, at a later time.\n  The report released today examines the CIA's secret overseas \ndetention of at least 119 individuals and the use of coercive \ninterrogation techniques, in some cases amounting to torture.\n  Over the past couple of weeks, I have gone through a great deal of \nintrospection about whether to delay the release of this report to a \nlater time. This clearly is a period of turmoil and instability in many \nparts of the world. Unfortunately, that is going to continue for the \nforeseeable future whether or not this report is released.\n  There are those who will seize upon the report and say ``See what the \nAmericans did,'' and they will try to use it to justify evil actions or \nincite more violence. We can't prevent that, but history will judge us \nby our commitment to a just society governed by law and the willingness \nto face an ugly truth and say ``never again.''\n  There may never be the right time to release this report. The \ninstability we see today will not be resolved in months or years. But \nthis report is too important to shelve indefinitely.\n  My determination to release it has also increased due to a campaign \nof mistaken statements and press articles launched against the report \nbefore anyone has had the chance to read it. As a matter of fact, the \nreport is just now, as I speak, being released. This is what it looks \nlike.\n  Senator Chambliss asked me if we could have the minority report bound \nwith the majority report. For this draft that is not possible. In the \nfiled draft it will be bound together. But this is what the summary of \nthe 6,000 pages looks like.\n  My words give me no pleasure. I am releasing this report because I \nknow there are thousands of employees at the CIA who do not condone \nwhat I will speak about this morning and who work day and night, long \nhours, within the law, for America's security in what is certainly a \ndifficult world. My colleagues on the Intelligence Committee and I are \nproud of them, just as everyone in this Chamber is, and we will always \nsupport them.\n  In reviewing the study in the past few days, with the decision \nlooming over the public release, I was struck by a quote found on page \n126 of the executive summary. It cites a former CIA inspector general, \nJohn Helgerson, who in 2005 wrote the following to the then-Director of \nthe CIA, which clearly states the situation with respect to this report \nyears later as well:\n\n       We have found that the Agency over the decades has \n     continued to get itself in messes related to interrogation \n     programs for one overriding reason: we do not document and \n     learn from our experience--each generation of officers is \n     left to improvise anew, with problematic results for our \n     officers as individuals and for our Agency.\n\n\n[[Page S6406]]\n\n\n  I believe that to be true. I agree with Mr. Helgerson. His comments \nare true today. But this must change.\n  On March 11, 2009, the committee voted 14 to 1 to begin a review of \nthe CIA's detention and interrogation program. Over the past 5 years a \nsmall team of committee investigators pored over the more than 6.3 \nmillion pages of CIA records the leader spoke about to complete this \nreport or what we call the study. It shows that the CIA's actions a \ndecade ago are a stain on our values and on our history. The release of \nthis 500-page summary cannot remove that stain, but it can and does say \nto our people and the world that America is big enough to admit when it \nis wrong and confident enough to learn from its mistakes. Releasing \nthis report is an important step to restore our values and show the \nworld that we are, in fact, a just and lawful society.\n  Over the next hour I wish to lay out for Senators and the American \npublic the report's key findings and conclusions. I ask that when I \ncomplete this, Senator McCain be recognized. Before I get to the \nsubstance of the report, I wish to make a few comments about why it is \nso important that we make this study public.\n  All of us have vivid memories of that Tuesday morning when terrorists \nstruck New York, Washington, DC, and Pennsylvania. Make no mistake--on \nSeptember 11, 2001, war was declared on the United States. Terrorists \nstruck our financial center, they struck our military center, and they \ntried to strike our political center and would have had brave and \ncourageous passengers not brought down the plane. We still vividly \nremember the mix of outrage, deep despair, and sadness as we watched \nfrom Washington--smoke rising from the Pentagon, the passenger plane \nlying in a Pennsylvania field, and the sound of bodies striking \ncanopies at ground level as innocents jumped to the ground below from \nthe World Trade Center. Mass terror that we often see abroad had struck \nus directly in our front yard, killing 3,000 innocent men, women, and \nchildren.\n  What happened? We came together as a nation with one singular \nmission: Bring those who committed these acts to justice. But it is at \nthis point where the values of America come into play, where the rule \nof law and the fundamental principles of right and wrong become \nimportant.\n  In 1990 the Senate ratified the Convention against Torture. The \nconvention makes clear that this ban against torture is absolute. It \nstates:\n\n       No exceptional circumstances whatsoever--\n  Including what I just read--\n\n     whether a state of war or a threat or war, internal political \n     instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as \n     a justification of torture.\n\n  Nonetheless, it was argued that the need for information on possible \nadditional terrorist plots after 9/11 made extraordinary interrogation \ntechniques necessary.\n  Even if one were to set aside all of the moral arguments, our review \nwas a meticulous and detailed examination of records. It finds that \ncoercive interrogation techniques did not produce the vital, otherwise \nunavailable intelligence the CIA has claimed.\n  I will go into further detail on this issue in a moment, but let me \nmake clear that these comments are not a condemnation of the CIA as a \nwhole. The CIA plays an incredibly important part in our Nation's \nsecurity and has thousands of dedicated and talented employees.\n  What we have found is that a surprisingly few people were responsible \nfor designing, carrying out, and managing this program. Two contractors \ndeveloped and led the interrogations. There was little effective \noversight. Analysts, on occasion, gave operational orders about \ninterrogations, and CIA management of the program was weak and \ndiffused.\n  Our final report was approved by a bipartisan vote of 9 to 6 in \nDecember of 2012 and exposes brutality in stark contrast to our values \nas a nation.\n  This effort was focused on the actions of the CIA from late 2001 to \nJanuary of 2009. The report does include considerable detail on the \nCIA's interactions with the White House, the Departments of Justice, \nState, and Defense, and the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n  The review is based on contemporaneous records and documents during \nthe time the program was in place and active. These documents are \nimportant because they aren't based on recollection, they aren't based \non revision, and they aren't a rationalization a decade later. It is \nthese documents, referenced repeatedly in thousands of footnotes, that \nprovide the factual basis for the study's conclusions. The committee's \nmajority staff reviewed more than 6.3 million pages of these documents \nprovided by the CIA, as well as records from other departments and \nagencies. These records include finished intelligence assessments, CIA \noperational and intelligence cables, memoranda, emails, real-time chat \nsessions, inspector general reports, testimony before Congress, \npictures, and other internal records.\n  It is true that we didn't conduct our own interviews, and I wish to \nstate why that was the case. In 2009 there was an ongoing review by the \nDepartment of Justice Special Prosecutor, John Durham. On August 24, \nAttorney General Holder expanded that review. This occurred 6 months \nafter our study had begun. Durham's original investigation of the CIA's \ndestruction of interrogation videotapes was broadened to include \npossible criminal actions of CIA employees in the course of CIA \ndetention and interrogation activities.\n  At the time, the committee's vice chairman, Kit Bond, withdrew the \nminority's participation in the study, citing the Attorney General's \nexpanded investigation as the reason.\n  The Department of Justice refused to coordinate its investigation \nwith the Intelligence Committee's review. As a result, possible \ninterviewees could be subject to additional liability if they were \ninterviewed, and the CIA, citing the Attorney General's investigation, \nwould not instruct its employees to participate in interviews.\n  Notwithstanding, I am very confident of the factual accuracy and \ncomprehensive nature of this report for three reasons:\n  No. 1, it is 6.3 million pages of documents reviewed, and they reveal \nrecords of actions as those actions took place, not through \nrecollections more than a decade later.\n  No. 2, the CIA and CIA senior officers have taken the opportunity to \nexplain their views on CIA detention and interrogation operations. They \nhave done this in on-the-record statements in classified committee \nhearings, written testimony and answers to questions, and through the \nformal response to the committee in June 2013 after reading this study.\n  No. 3, the committee had access to and utilized an extensive set of \nreports of interviews conducted by the CIA inspector general and the \nCIA's oral history program.\n  So while we could not conduct new interviews of individuals, we did \nutilize transcripts or summaries of interviews of those directly \nengaged in detention and interrogation operations. These interviews \noccurred at the time the program was operational and covered the exact \ntopics we would have asked about had we conducted interviews ourselves.\n  These interview reports and transcripts included but were not limited \nto the following: George Tenet, Director of the CIA when the Agency \ntook custody and interrogated the majority of detainees; Jose \nRodriguez, Director of the CIA's Counterterrorism Center, a key player \nin the program; CIA General Counsel Scott Mueller; CIA Deputy Director \nof Operations James Pavitt; CIA Acting General Counsel John Rizzo; CIA \nDeputy Director John McLaughlin; and a variety of interrogators, \nlawyers, medical personnel, senior counterterrorism analysts, and \nmanagers of the detention and interrogation program.\n  The best place to start on how we got into this situation--and I am \ndelighted that the previous Chairman Senator Rockefeller is on the \nfloor--is a little more than 8 years ago, on September 6, 2006, when \nthe committee met to be briefed by then-Director Michael Hayden.\n  At that 2006 meeting the full committee learned for the first time--\nthe first time--of the use of so-called enhanced interrogation \ntechniques or EITs.\n  It was a short meeting, in part because President Bush was making a \npublic speech later that day disclosing officially for the first time \nthe existence of CIA black sites and announcing\n\n[[Page S6407]]\n\nthe transfer of 14 detainees from CIA custody to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. \nIt was the first time the interrogation program was explained to the \nfull committee, as details had previously been limited to the chairman \nand vice chairman.\n  Then, on December 7, 2007, The New York Times reported that CIA \npersonnel in 2005 had destroyed videotapes of the interrogation of two \nCIA detainees--the CIA's first detainee Abu Zubaydah, as well as Abd \nal-Rahim al-Nashiri. The committee had not been informed of the \ndestruction of the tapes.\n  Days later, on December 11, 2007, the committee held a hearing on the \ndestruction of the videotapes. Director Hayden, the primary witness, \ntestified the CIA had concluded the destruction of videotapes was \nacceptable, in part because Congress had not yet requested to see them. \nMy source is our committee's transcript of the hearing on December 11, \n2007. Director Hayden stated that if the committee had asked for the \nvideotapes, they would have been provided. But of course the committee \nhad not known the videotapes existed.\n  We now know from CIA emails and records that the videotapes were \ndestroyed shortly after CIA attorneys raised concerns that Congress \nmight find out about the tapes.\n  In any case, at that same December 11 committee hearing, Director \nHayden told the committee that CIA cables related to the interrogation \nsessions depicted in the videotapes were `` . . . a more than adequate \nrepresentation of the tapes and therefore, if you want them, we will \ngive you access to them.'' That is a quote from our transcript of the \nDecember 11, 2007, hearing.\n  Senator Rockefeller, then-chairman of the committee, designated two \nmembers of the committee staff to review the cables describing the \ninterrogation sessions of Abu Zubaydah and al-Nashiri. Senator Bond, \nthen-vice chairman, similarly directed two of his staffers to review \nthe cables. The designated staff members completed their review and \ncompiled a summary of the content of the CIA cables by early 2009, by \nwhich time I had become chairman.\n  The description in the cables of CIA's interrogations and the \ntreatment of detainees presented a starkly different picture from \nDirector Hayden's testimony before the committee. They described \nbrutal, around-the-clock interrogations, especially of Abu Zubaydah, in \nwhich multiple coercive techniques were used in combination and with \nsubstantial repetition. It was an ugly, visceral description.\n  The summary also indicated that Abu Zubaydah and al-Nashiri did not, \nas a result of the use of these so-called EITs, provide the kind of \nintelligence that led the CIA to stop terrorist plots or arrest \nadditional suspects. As a result, I think it is fair to say the entire \ncommittee was concerned and it approved the scope of an investigation \nby a vote of 14 to 1, and the work began.\n  In my March 11, 2014, floor speech about the study, I described how \nin 2009 the committee came to an agreement with the new CIA Director, \nLeon Panetta, for access to documents and other records about the CIA's \ndetention and interrogation program. I will not repeat that here. From \n2009 to 2012, our staff conducted a massive and unprecedented review of \nCIA records. Draft sections of the report were produced by late 2011 \nand shared with the full committee. The final report was completed in \nDecember 2012 and approved by the committee by a bipartisan vote of 9 \nto 6.\n  After that vote, I sent the full report to the President and asked \nthe administration to provide comments on it before it was released. \nSix months later, in June of 2013, the CIA responded. I directed then \nthat if the CIA pointed out any error in our report, we would fix it, \nand we did fix one bullet point that did not impact our findings and \nconclusions. If the CIA came to a different conclusion than the report \ndid, we would note that in the report and explain our reasons for \ndisagreeing, if we disagreed. You will see some of that documented in \nthe footnotes of that executive summary as well as in the 6,000 pages.\n  In April 2014, the committee prepared an updated version of the full \nstudy and voted 12 to 3 to declassify and release the executive \nsummary, findings and conclusions and minority and additional views.\n  On August 1, we received a declassified version from the executive \nbranch. It was immediately apparent the redactions to our report \nprevented a clear and understandable reading of the study and prevented \nus from substantiating the findings and conclusions, so we obviously \nobjected.\n  For the past 4 months, the committee and the CIA, the Director of \nNational Intelligence, and the White House have engaged in a lengthy \nnegotiation over the redactions to the report. We have been able to \ninclude some more information in the report today without sacrificing \nsources and methods or our national security.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record following my \nremarks a letter from the White House, dated yesterday, transmitting \nthe unclassified parts of report, and it also points out that the \nexecutive summary is 93 percent complete and that the redactions amount \nto 7 percent.\n  Mr. President, this has been a long process. The work began 7 years \nago when Senator Rockefeller directed committee staff to review the CIA \ncables describing the interrogation sessions of Abu Zubaydah and al-\nNashiri. It has been very difficult, but I believe documentation and \nthe findings and conclusions will make clear how this program was \nmorally, legally, and administratively misguided and that this Nation \nshould never again engage in these tactics.\n  Let me now turn to the contents of the study. As I noted, we have 20 \nfindings and conclusions which fall into four general categories: \nFirst, the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques were not an \neffective way to gather intelligence information; second, the CIA \nprovided extensive amounts of inaccurate information about the \noperation of the program and its effectiveness to the White House, the \nDepartment of Justice, Congress, the CIA inspector general, the media, \nand the American public; third, the CIA's management of the program was \ninadequate and deeply flawed; and fourth, the CIA program was far more \nbrutal than people were led to believe.\n  Let me describe each category in more detail. The first set of \nfindings and conclusions concern the effectiveness or lack thereof of \nthe CIA interrogation program. The committee found that the CIA's \ncoercive interrogation techniques were not an effective means of \nacquiring accurate intelligence or gaining detainee cooperation.\n  The CIA and other defenders of the program have repeatedly claimed \nthe use of so-called interrogation techniques was necessary to get \ndetainees to provide critical information and to bring detainees to a \n``state of compliance,'' in which they would cooperate and provide \ninformation. The study concludes both claims are inaccurate.\n  The report is very specific in how it evaluates the CIA's claims on \nthe effectiveness and necessity of its enhanced interrogation \ntechniques. Specifically, we used the CIA's own definition of \neffectiveness as ratified and approved by the Department of Justice's \nOffice of Legal Counsel. The CIA claimed that the EITs were necessary \nto obtain ``otherwise unavailable'' information that could not be \nobtained from any other source to stop terrorist attacks and save \nAmerican lives, that is a claim we conclude is inaccurate.\n  We took 20 examples that the CIA itself claimed to show the success \nof these interrogations. These include cases of terrorist plots stopped \nor terrorists captured. The CIA used these examples in presentations to \nthe White House, in testimony to Congress, in submissions to the \nDepartment of Justice, and ultimately to the American people.\n  Some of the claims are well known: the capture of Khalid Shaikh \nMohammed, the prevention of attacks against the Library Tower in Los \nAngeles, and the takedown of Osama bin Laden. Other claims were made \nonly in classified settings to the White House, Congress, and \nDepartment of Justice.\n  In each case, the CIA claimed that critical and unique information \ncame from one or more detainees in its custody after they were \nsubjected to the CIA's coercive techniques, and that information led to \na specific counterterrorism success. Our staff reviewed every one of \nthe 20 cases and not a single case holds up.\n  In every single one of these cases, at least one of the following was \ntrue: One, the intelligence community had\n\n[[Page S6408]]\n\ninformation separate from the use of EITs that led to the terrorist \ndisruption or capture; two, information from a detainee subjected to \nEITs played no role in the claimed disruption or capture; and three, \nthe purported terrorist plot either did not exist or posed no real \nthreat to Americans or U.S. interests.\n  Some critics have suggested the study concludes that no intelligence \nwas ever provided from any detainee the CIA held. That is false and the \nstudy makes no such claim. What is true is that actionable intelligence \nthat was ``otherwise unavailable'' was not obtained using these \ncoercive interrogation techniques.\n  The report also chronicles where the use of interrogation techniques \nthat do not involve physical force were effective. Specifically, the \nreport provides examples where interrogators had sufficient information \nto confront detainees with facts, know when they were lying and when \nthey applied rapport-building techniques that were developed and honed \nby the U.S. military, the FBI, and more recently the interagency High-\nValue Detainee Interrogation Group, called the HIG, that these \ntechniques produced good intelligence.\n  Let me make a couple of additional comments on the claimed \neffectiveness of CIA interrogations. At no time did the CIA's coercive \ninterrogation techniques lead to the collection of intelligence on an \nimminent threat that many believe was the justification for the use of \nthese techniques. The committee never found an example of this \nhypothetical ticking timebomb scenario.\n\n  The use of coercive technique methods regularly resulted in \nfabricated information. Sometimes the CIA actually knew detainees were \nlying. Other times the CIA acted on false information, diverting \nresources and leading officers or contractors to falsely believe they \nwere acquiring unique or actionable intelligence and that its \ninterrogations were working when they were not.\n  Internally, CIA officers often called into question the effectiveness \nof the CIA's interrogation techniques, noting how the techniques failed \nto elicit detainee cooperation or produce accurate information.\n  The report includes numerous examples of CIA officers questioning the \nagency's claims, but these contradictions were marginalized and not \npresented externally.\n  The second set of findings and conclusions is that the CIA provided \nextensive inaccurate information about the program and its \neffectiveness to the White House, the Department of Justice, Congress, \nthe CIA inspector general, the media, and the American public.\n  This conclusion is somewhat personal for me. I remember clearly when \nDirector Hayden briefed the Intelligence Committee for the first time \non the so-called EITs at that September 2006 committee meeting. He \nreferred specifically to a ``tummy slap,'' among other techniques, and \npresented the entire set of techniques as minimally harmful and applied \nin a highly clinical and professional manner. They were not.\n  The committee's report demonstrates that these techniques were \nphysically very harmful, and that the constraints that existed on paper \nin Washington did not match the way techniques were used at CIA sites \naround the world.\n  Of particular note was the treatment of Abu Zubaydah over a span of \n17 days in August 2002. This involved nonstop interrogation and abuse, \n24/7, from August 4 to August 21, and included multiple forms of \ndeprivation and physical assault. The description of this period, first \nwritten up by our staff in early 2009 while Senator Rockefeller was \nchairman, was what prompted this full review.\n  But the inaccurate and incomplete descriptions go far beyond that. \nThe CIA provided inaccurate memoranda and explanations to the \nDepartment of Justice while its Office of Legal Counsel was considering \nthe legality of the coercive techniques.\n  In those communications to the Department of Justice, the CIA claimed \nthe following: The coercive techniques would not be used with excessive \nrepetition; detainees would always have an opportunity to provide \ninformation prior to the use of the techniques; the techniques were to \nbe used in progression, starting with the least aggressive and \nproceeding only if needed; medical personnel would make sure that \ninterrogations wouldn't cause serious harm, and they could intervene at \nany time to stop interrogations; interrogators were carefully vetted \nand highly trained, and each technique was to be used in a specific way \nwithout deviation, and only with specific approval for the interrogator \nand detainee involved.\n  None of these assurances, which the Department of Justice relied on \nto form its legal opinions, were consistently or even routinely carried \nout.\n  In many cases, important information was withheld from policymakers. \nFor example, foreign intelligence committee chairman Bob Graham asked a \nnumber of questions after he was first briefed in September of 2002, \nbut the CIA refused to answer him, effectively stonewalling him until \nhe left the committee at the end of the year.\n  In another example, the CIA, in coordination with White House \nofficials and staff, initially withheld information of the CIA's \ninterrogation techniques from Secretary of State Colin Powell and \nSecretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. There are CIA records stating \nthat Colin Powell wasn't told about the program at first because there \nwere concerns that ``Powell would blow his stack if he were briefed.'' \nSource: Email from John Rizzo dated July 31, 2003.\n  CIA records clearly indicate, and definitively, that after he was \nbriefed on the CIA's first detainee, Abu Zubaydah, the CIA didn't tell \nPresident Bush about the full nature of the EITs until April 2006. That \nis what the records indicate.\n  The CIA similarly withheld information or provided false information \nto the CIA inspector general during his conduct of a special review by \nthe IG in 2004.\n  Incomplete and inaccurate information from the CIA was used in \ndocuments provided to the Department of Justice and as a basis for \nPresident Bush's speech on September 6, 2006, in which he publicly \nacknowledged the CIA program for the first time.\n  In all of these cases, other CIA officers acknowledged internally \nthat information the CIA had provided was wrong.\n  The CIA also misled other CIA and White House officials. When Vice \nPresident Cheney's counsel David Addington asked CIA General Counsel \nScott Muller in 2003 about the CIA's videotaping the waterboarding of \ndetainees, Muller deliberately told him that videotapes ``were not \nbeing made,'' but did not disclose that videotapes of previous \nwaterboarding sessions had been made and still existed. Source: E-mail \nfrom Scott Muller dated June 7, 2003.\n  There are many more examples in the committee's report. All are \ndocumented.\n  The third set of findings and conclusions notes the various ways in \nwhich CIA management of the Detention and Interrogation Program--from \nits inception to its formal termination in January of 2009--was \ninadequate and deeply flawed.\n  There is no doubt that the Detention and Interrogation Program was, \nby any measure, a major CIA undertaking. It raised significant legal \nand policy issues and involved significant resources and funding. It \nwas not, however, managed as a significant CIA program. Instead, it had \nlimited oversight and lacked formal direction and management.\n  For example, in the 6 months between being granted detention \nauthority and taking custody of its first detainee, Abu Zubaydah, the \nCIA had not identified and prepared a suitable detention site. It had \nnot researched effective interrogation techniques or developed a legal \nbasis for the use of interrogation techniques outside of the rapport-\nbuilding techniques that were official CIA policy until that time.\n  In fact, there is no indication the CIA reviewed its own history--\nthat is just what Helgerson was saying in 2005--with coercive \ninterrogation tactics. As the executive summary notes, the CIA had \nengaged in rough interrogations in the past.\n  In fact, the CIA had previously sent a letter to the Intelligence \nCommittee in 1989--and here is the quote--that ``inhumane physical or \npsychological techniques are counterproductive because they do not \nproduce intelligence and will probably result in false answers.''\n\n[[Page S6409]]\n\nThat was a letter from John Helgerson, CIA Director of Congressional \nAffairs, dated January 8, 1989.\n  However, in late 2001 and early 2002, rather than research \ninterrogation practices and coordinate with other parts of the \ngovernment with extensive expertise in detention and interrogation of \nterrorist suspects, the CIA engaged two contract psychologists who had \nnever conducted interrogations themselves or ever operated detention \nfacilities.\n  As the CIA captured or received custody of detainees through 2002, it \nmaintained separate lines of management at headquarters for different \ndetention facilities.\n  No individual or office was in charge of the Detention and \nInterrogation Program until January of 2003, by which point more than \none-third of CIA detainees identified in our review had been detained \nand interrogated.\n  One clear example of flawed CIA management was the poorly managed \ndetention facility referred to in our report by the code name COBALT to \nhide the actual name of the facility. It began operations in September \nof 2002. The facility kept few formal records of the detainees housed \nthere, and untrained CIA officers conducted frequent unauthorized and \nunsupervised interrogations using techniques that were not, and never \nbecame, part of the CIA's formal enhanced interrogation program.\n  The CIA placed a junior officer with no relevant experience in charge \nof the site. In November 2002, an otherwise healthy detainee--who was \nbeing held mostly nude and chained to a concrete floor--died at the \nfacility from what is believed to have been hypothermia.\n  In interviews conducted in 2003 by the CIA Office of the Inspector \nGeneral, CIA's leadership acknowledged that they had little or no \nawareness of operations at this specific CIA detention site, and some \nCIA senior officials believed, erroneously, that enhanced interrogation \ntechniques were not used there.\n  The CIA, in its June 2013 response to the committee's report, agreed \nthat there were management failures in the program, but asserted that \nthey were corrected by early 2003. While the study found that \nmanagement failures improved somewhat, we found they persisted until \nthe end of the program.\n  Among the numerous management shortcomings identified in the report \nare the following: The CIA used poorly trained and nonvetted personnel.\n  Individuals were deployed--in particular, interrogators--without \nrelevant training or experience. Due to the CIA's redactions to the \nreport, there are limits to what I can say in this regard, but it is a \nclear fact that the CIA deployed officers who had histories of \npersonnel, ethical, and professional problems of a serious nature. \nThese included histories of violence and abusive treatment of others \nthat should have called into question their employment with the U.S. \nGovernment, let alone their suitability to participate in a sensitive \nCIA covert action program.\n  The two contractors that CIA allowed to develop, operate, and assess \nits interrogation operations conducted numerous ``inherently \ngovernmental functions'' that never should have been outsourced to \ncontractors. These contractors, referred to in the report in special \npseudonyms, SWIGERT and DUNBAR, developed the list of so-called \nenhanced interrogation techniques that the CIA employed.\n  They developed a list of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques \nthat the CIA employed. They personally conducted interrogations of some \nof the CIA's most significant detainees, using the techniques including \nthe waterboarding of Abu Zubaydah, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, and al-\nNashiri.\n  The contractors provided the official evaluations of whether \ndetainees' psychological states allowed for the continued use of the \nenhanced techniques, even for some detainees they themselves were \ninterrogating or had interrogated. Evaluating the psychological state \nof the very detainees they were interrogating is a clear conflict of \ninterest and a violation of professional guidelines.\n  The CIA relied on these two contractors to evaluate the interrogation \nprogram they had devised and in which they had obvious financial \ninterests. Again, it is a clear conflict of interest and an avoidance \nof responsibility by the CIA.\n  In 2005, the two contractors formed a company specifically for the \npurpose of expanding their work with the CIA. From 2005 to 2008, the \nCIA outsourced almost all aspects of its detention and interrogation \nprogram to this company as part of a contract valued at more than $180 \nmillion. Ultimately, not all contract options were exercised. However, \nthe CIA has paid these two contractors and their company more than $80 \nmillion.\n  Of the 119 individuals found to have been detained by the CIA during \nthe life of the program, the committee found that at least 26 were \nwrongfully held. These are cases where the CIA itself determined that \nit had not met the standard for detention set out in the 2001 \nMemorandum of Notification which governed the covert action. Detainees \noften remained in custody for months after the CIA determined they \nshould have been released. CIA records provide insufficient information \nto justify the detention of many other detainees.\n  Due to poor recordkeeping, a full accounting of how many specific \ndetainees were held and how they were specifically treated while in \ncustody may never be known. Similarly, in specific instances we found \nthat enhanced interrogation techniques were used without authorization \nin a manner far different and more brutal than had been authorized by \nthe Office of Legal Counsel and conducted by personnel not approved to \nuse them on detainees.\n  Decisions about how and when to apply interrogation techniques were \nad hoc and not proposed, evaluated, and approved in a manner described \nby the CIA in written descriptions and testimony about the program. \nDetainees were often subjected to harsh and brutal interrogation and \ntreatment because CIA analysts believed, often in error, that they knew \nmore information than what they had provided.\n  Sometimes CIA managers and interrogators in the field were \nuncomfortable with what they were being asked to do and recommended \nending the abuse of a detainee. Repeatedly in such cases they were \noverruled by people at CIA headquarters who thought they knew better, \nsuch as by analysts with no line authority. This shows again how a \nrelatively small number of CIA personnel--perhaps 40 to 50--were making \ndecisions on detention and interrogation despite the better judgments \nof other CIA officers.\n  The fourth and final set of findings and conclusions concerns how the \ninterrogations of CIA detainees were absolutely brutal, far worse than \nthe CIA represented them to policymakers and others.\n  Beginning with the first detainee, Abu Zubaydah, and continuing with \nothers, the CIA applied its so-called enhanced interrogation techniques \nin combination and in near nonstop fashion for days and even weeks at a \ntime on one detainee. In contrast to the CIA representations, the \ndetainees were subjected to the most aggressive techniques \nimmediately--stripped naked, diapered, physically struck, and put in \nvarious painful stress positions for long periods of time. They were \ndeprived of sleep for days--in one case up to 180 hours; that is 7\\1/2\\ \ndays, over a week, with no sleep--usually in standing or in stress \npositions, at times with their hands tied together over their heads, \nchained to the ceiling.\n  In the COBALT facility I previously mentioned, interrogators and \nguards used what they called rough takedowns in which a detainee was \ngrabbed from his cell, clothes cut off, hooded, and dragged up and down \na dirt hallway while being slapped and punched.\n  The CIA led several detainees to believe they would never be allowed \nto leave CIA custody alive, suggesting to Abu Zubaydah that he would \nonly leave in a coffin-shaped box. That is from a CIA cable on August \n12, 2002.\n  According to another CIA cable, CIA officers also planned to cremate \nZubaydah should he not survive his interrogation. Source: CIA cable, \nJuly 15, 2002.\n  After the news and photographs emerged from the U.S. military \ndetention of Iraqis at Abu Ghraib, the Intelligence Committee held a \nhearing on the matter on May 12, 2004. Without disclosing any details \nof its own interrogation program, CIA Director John\n\n[[Page S6410]]\n\nMcLaughlin testified that CIA interrogations were nothing like what was \ndepicted at Abu Ghraib, the U.S. prison in Iraq where detainees were \nabused by American personnel. This, of course, was false.\n  CIA detainees at one facility, described as a dungeon, were kept in \ncomplete darkness, constantly shackled in isolated cells with loud \nnoise or music and only a bucket to use for human waste.\n  The U.S. Bureau of Prisons personnel went to that location in \nNovember 2002 and, according to a contemporaneous internal CIA email, \ntold CIA officers they had never ``been in a facility where individuals \nare so sensory deprived.'' Source: CIA email, sender and recipient \nredacted, December 5, 2002.\n\n  Throughout the program, multiple CIA detainees subjected to \ninterrogations exhibited psychological and behavioral issues including \nhallucinations, paranoia, insomnia, and attempts at self-harm and self-\nmutilation. Multiple CIA psychologists identified the lack of human \ncontact experienced by the detainees as a cause of psychiatric \nproblems.\n  The executive summary includes far more detail than I am going to \nprovide here about things that were in these interrogation sessions, \nand the summary itself includes only a subset of the treatment of the \n119 known CIA detainees. There is far more detail--all documented--in \nthe full 6,700-page study. This briefly summarizes the committee's \nfindings and conclusions.\n  Before I wrap up, I wish to thank the people who made this \nundertaking possible. First, I thank Senator Jay Rockefeller. He \nstarted this project by directing his staff to review the operational \ncables that described the first recorded interrogations after we \nlearned that the videotapes of those sessions had been destroyed. That \nreport was what led to this multiyear investigation, and without it we \nwouldn't have had any sense of what happened.\n  I thank other Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, one of \nwhom is on the floor today, from the great State of New Mexico. Others \nhave been on the floor who voted to conduct this investigation and to \napprove its result and make the report public.\n  Most importantly, I want to thank the Intelligence Committee staff \nwho performed this work. They are dedicated and committed public \nofficials who sacrificed a significant portion of their lives to see \nthis report through to its publication. They have worked days, nights, \nand weekends for years in some of the most difficult circumstances. It \nis no secret to anyone that the CIA does not want this report coming \nout, and I believe the Nation owes them a debt of gratitude. They are \nDan Jones, who has led this review since 2007, and more than anyone \nelse, today's report is a result of his effort. Evan Gottesman and Chad \nTanner, the two other members of the study staff, each wrote thousands \nof pages of the full report and have dedicated themselves and much of \ntheir lives to this project. Alissa Starzak, who began this review as \nco-lead, contributed extensively until her departure from the committee \nin 2011.\n  Other key contributors to the drafting, editing, and review of the \nreport were Jennifer Barrett, Nick Basciano, Mike Buchwald, Jim \nCatella, Eric Chapman, John Dickas, Lorenzo Goco, Andrew Grotto, Tressa \nGuenov, Clete Johnson, Michael Noblet, Michael Pevzner, Tommy Ross, \nCaroline Tess, and James Wolfe; and finally, David Grannis, who has \nbeen a never-faltering staff director throughout this review.\n  This study is bigger than the actions of the CIA. It is really about \nAmerican values and morals. It is about the Constitution, the Bill of \nRights, our rule of law. These values exist regardless of the \ncircumstances in which we find ourselves. They exist in peacetime and \nin wartime, and if we cast aside these values when convenient, we have \nfailed to live by the very precepts that make our Nation a great one.\n  There is a reason why we carry the banner of a great and just nation. \nSo we submit this study on behalf of the committee to the public in the \nbelief that it will stand the test of time, and with it the report will \ncarry the message: ``Never again.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                     Washington, December 8, 2014.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Feinstein: I write in response to your \n     letters to the President transmitting versions of the \n     executive summary, findings, and conclusions of the Senate \n     Select Committee on Intelligence's report regarding the \n     Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) former detention and \n     interrogation program.\n       The President believes that the Agency's former detention \n     and interrogation program was inconsistent with our values as \n     a Nation. To reflect our values, one of his first acts in \n     office was to sign an Executive Order that brought an end to \n     the program.\n       Since the Committee first delivered a version of its \n     executive summary, findings, and conclusions of the report \n     (report) in April, the Administration has worked in good \n     faith with the Committee on the declassification effort. On \n     August 1, the Administration provided a version of the \n     report, as well as minority and additional views that would \n     declassify 85 percent of the text. Since then, at the request \n     of the Committee, the Administration has continually sought \n     to reduce further the redactions in the report in a manner \n     that also protects U.S. national security. We have \n     appreciated the constructive dialogue with the Committee over \n     the last few months, which allowed us to work through more \n     than 400 of the Committee's requests for declassification.\n       Today, we are delivering to the Committee a version of the \n     Committee report, as well as minority and additional views, \n     that are over 93 percent declassified. The minimal redactions \n     are the result of a considerable effort by the Director of \n     National Intelligence, working with the CIA, Department of \n     Defense, Department of State, and other agencies, to review \n     and declassify hundreds of pages of information related to \n     the historical CIA program.\n       As we have shared with you in prior letters and \n     conversations, the President supports making public the \n     declassified version of the Committee's important report as \n     he believes that public scrutiny and debate will help to \n     inform the public's understanding of the program and to \n     ensure that such a program will never be repeated. As we have \n     also shared with you, in advance of release of the Committee \n     report, the Administration has planned to take a series of \n     security steps to prepare our personnel and facilities \n     overseas. We have already initiated those security \n     precautions and will continue to implement them consistent \n     with prior conversations about the timing of the Committee's \n     expected release of its report.\n       The Committee report reflects a significant five year \n     effort, and we commend the Committee and its staff on its \n     completion. The report also reflects extraordinary \n     cooperation by the Executive Branch to ensure access to the \n     information necessary to review the CIA's former program, \n     including more than six million pages of records. We must \n     now, however, begin to look forward to the future. The men \n     and women in the Intelligence Community are fundamental to \n     America's national security. They perform an important \n     service to our country in very trying circumstances. They \n     make extraordinary sacrifices to keep the American people \n     safe, often without any expectation of credit or \n     acknowledgment. As they carry on the nation's critical work, \n     they have the President's support and appreciation, as I know \n     they have yours.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                W. Neil Eggleston,\n                                         Counsel to the President.\n\n  I very much appreciate your attention, and I yield to Senator McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I wish to begin by expressing my \nappreciation and admiration to the personnel who serve in our \nintelligence agencies, including the CIA, who are out there every day \ndefending our Nation.\n  I have read the executive summary and I also have been briefed on the \nentirety of this report. I rise in support of the release--the long-\ndelayed release--of the Senate Intelligence Committee's summarized \nunclassified review of the so-called enhanced interrogation techniques \nthat were employed by the previous administration to extract \ninformation from captured terrorists. It is a thorough and thoughtful \nstudy of practices that I believe not only failed their purpose to \nsecure actionable intelligence to prevent further attacks on the United \nStates and our allies, but actually damaged our security interests as \nwell as our reputation as a force for good in the world.\n  I believe the American people have a right--indeed a responsibility--\nto know what was done in their name, how these practices did or did not \nserve our interests, and how they comported with our most important \nvalues.\n  I commend Chairwoman Feinstein and her staff for their diligence in \nseeking a truthful accounting of policies I hope we will never resort \nto\n\n[[Page S6411]]\n\nagain. I thank them for persevering against persistent opposition from \nmany members of the intelligence community, from officials in two \nadministrations, and from some of our colleagues.\n  The truth is sometimes a hard pill to swallow. It sometimes causes us \ndifficulties at home and abroad. It is sometimes used by our enemies in \nattempts to hurt us. But the American people are entitled to it \nnonetheless. They must know when the values that define our Nation are \nintentionally disregarded by our security policies, even those policies \nthat are conducted in secret. They must be able to make informed \njudgments about whether those policies and the personnel who supported \nthem were justified in compromising our values, whether they served a \ngreater good, or whether, as I believe, they stained our national \nhonor, did much harm, and little practical good.\n  What were the policies? What was their purpose? Did they achieve it? \nDid they make us safer, less safe, or did they make no difference? What \ndid they gain us? What did they cost us? What did they gain us? What \ndid they cost us? The American people need the answers to these \nquestions. Yes, some things must be kept from public disclosure to \nprotect clandestine operations, sources, and methods, but not the \nanswers to these questions. By providing them, the committee has \nempowered the American people to come to their own decisions about \nwhether we should have employed such practices in the past and whether \nwe should consider permitting them in the future.\n\n  This report strengthens self-government and ultimately, I believe, \nAmerican security and stature in the world. I thank the committee for \nthat valuable public service.\n  I have long believed some of these practices amounted to torture as a \nreasonable person would define it, especially but not only the practice \nof waterboarding, which is a mock execution and an exquisite form of \ntorture. Its use was shameful and unnecessary, and, contrary to \nassertions made by some of its defenders and as the committee's report \nmakes clear, it produced little useful intelligence to help us track \ndown the perpetrators of 9/11 or prevent new attacks and atrocities.\n  I know from personal experience that the abuse of prisoners will \nproduce more bad than good intelligence. I know victims of torture will \noffer intentionally misleading information if they think their captors \nwill believe it. I know they will say whatever they think their \ntorturers want them to say if they believe it will stop their \nsuffering. Most of all, I know the use of torture compromises that \nwhich most distinguishes us from our enemies--our belief that all \npeople, even captured enemies, possess basic human rights which are \nprotected by international conventions the United States not only \njoined but for the most part authored.\n  I know too that bad things happen in war. I know that in war good \npeople can feel obliged for good reasons to do things they would \nnormally object to and recoil from. I understand the reasons that \ngoverned the decision to resort to these interrogation methods, and I \nknow that those who approved them and those who used them were \ndedicated to securing justice for victims of terrorist attacks and to \nprotecting Americans from further harm. I know their responsibilities \nwere grave and urgent and the strain of their duty was onerous. I \nrespect their dedication, and I appreciate their dilemma. But I dispute \nwholeheartedly that it was right for them to use these methods which \nthis report makes clear were neither in the best interests of justice, \nnor our security, nor the ideals we have sacrificed so much blood and \ntreasure to defend.\n  The knowledge of torture's dubious efficacy and my moral objection to \nthe abuse of prisoners motivated my sponsorship of the Detainee \nTreatment Act of 2005, which prohibits ``cruel, inhuman or degrading \ntreatment'' of captured combatants, whether they wear a nation's \nuniform or not, and which passed the Senate by a vote of 90 to 9.\n  Subsequently, I successfully offered amendments to the Military \nCommissions Act of 2006, which, among other things, prevented the \nattempt to weaken Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions and \nbroadened definitions in the War Crimes Act to make the future use of \nwaterboarding and other ``enhanced interrogation techniques'' \npunishable as war crimes.\n  There was considerable misinformation disseminated then about what \nwas and wasn't achieved using these methods in an effort to discourage \nsupport for the legislation. There was a good amount of misinformation \nused in 2011 to credit the use of these methods with the death of Osama \nbin Laden. And there is, I fear, misinformation being used today to \nprevent the release of this report, disputing its findings and warning \nabout the security consequences of their public disclosure.\n  Will the report's release cause outrage that leads to violence in \nsome parts of the Muslim world? Yes, I suppose that is possible and \nperhaps likely. Sadly, violence needs little incentive in some quarters \nof the world today. But that doesn't mean we will be telling the world \nsomething it will be shocked to learn. The entire world already knows \nwe waterboarded prisoners. It knows we subjected prisoners to various \nother types of degrading treatment. It knows we used black sites, \nsecret prisons. Those practices haven't been a secret for a decade. \nTerrorists might use the report's reidentification of the practices as \nan excuse to attack Americans, but they hardly need an excuse for that. \nThat has been their life's calling for a while now.\n  What might come as a surprise not just to our enemies but to many \nAmericans is how little these practices did aid our efforts to bring 9/\n11 culprits to justice and to find and prevent terrorist attacks today \nand tomorrow. That could be a real surprise since it contradicts the \nmany assurances provided by intelligence officials on the record and in \nprivate that enhanced interrogation techniques were indispensable in \nthe war against terrorism. And I suspect the objection of those same \nofficials to the release of this report is really focused on that \ndisclosure--torture's ineffectiveness--because we gave up much in the \nexpectation that torture would make us safer--too much.\n  Obviously, we need intelligence to defeat our enemies, but we need \nreliable intelligence. Torture produces more misleading information \nthan actionable intelligence. And what the advocates of harsh and cruel \ninterrogation methods have never established is that we couldn't have \ngathered as good or more reliable intelligence from using humane \nmethods.\n  The most important lead we got in the search for bin Laden came from \nusing conventional interrogation methods. I think it is an insult to \nthe many intelligence officers who have acquired good intelligence \nwithout hurting or degrading prisoners to assert that we can't win \nthese wars without such methods. Yes, we can, and we will.\n  But in the end torture's failure to serve its intended purpose isn't \nthe main reason to oppose its use. I have often said and I will always \nmaintain that this question isn't about our enemies; it is about us. It \nis about who we were, who we are, and who we aspire to be. It is about \nhow we represent ourselves to the world.\n  We have made our way in this often dangerous and cruel world not by \njust strictly pursuing our geopolitical interests but by exemplifying \nour political values and influencing other nations to embrace them. \nWhen we fight to defend our security, we fight also for an idea--not \nfor a tribe or a twisted interpretation of an ancient religion or for a \nKing but for an idea that all men are endowed by the Creator with \ninalienable rights. How much safer the world would be if all nations \nbelieved the same. How much more dangerous it can become when we forget \nit ourselves, even momentarily.\n  Our enemies act without conscience. We must not. This executive \nsummary of the committee's report makes clear that acting without \nconscience isn't necessary. It isn't even helpful in winning this \nstrange and long war we are fighting. We should be grateful to have \nthat truth affirmed.\n  Now, let us reassert the contrary proposition: that is it essential \nto our success in this war that we ask those who fight it for us to \nremember at all times that they are defending a sacred ideal of how \nnations should be governed and conduct their relations with others--\neven our enemies.\n  Those of us who give them this duty are obliged by history, by our \nNation's highest ideals and the many terrible sacrifices made to \nprotect them, by our respect for human dignity, to make\n\n[[Page S6412]]\n\nclear we need not risk our national honor to prevail in this or any \nwar. We need only remember in the worst of times, through the chaos and \nterror of war, when facing cruelty, suffering, and loss, that we are \nalways Americans and different, stronger, and better than those who \nwould destroy us.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \na seated position.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I come to the floor to wholly \nsupport the comments of my colleagues, the Senator from California and \nthe Senator from Arizona, to speak about a matter of great importance \nto me personally but more importantly to the country.\n  The Senate Intelligence Committee's entire study of the CIA's \ndetention and interrogation program--I will just call it the program--\nis the most in-depth, the most substantive oversight initiative the \ncommittee has ever taken. I doubt any committee has done more than \nthis. It presents extremely valuable insights into crucial oversight \nquestions and problems that need to be addressed by the CIA.\n  Moreover, this study exemplifies why this committee was created in \nthe first place following the findings of the Church Committee nearly \n40 years ago, and I commend my friend and the committee's leader, the \nSenator from California, for shepherding this landmark initiative to \nthis point. For years, often behind closed doors, without any \nrecognition, she has been a strong and tireless advocate, and she \ndeserves our thanks and recognition.\n  It is my hope and expectation that beyond the initial release of the \nexecutive summary and findings and conclusions, that the entire 6,800 \npages, with 37,500 footnotes, will eventually be made public--and I am \nsure it will--with the appropriate redactions. Those public findings \nwill be critical to fully learning the necessary lessons from this dark \nepisode in our Nation's history and to ensure that it never happens \nagain. It has been a very long, very hard fight to get to this point. \nEspecially in the early years of the CIA's detention program, it was a \nstruggle for the committee to get the most basic information or any \ninformation at all about the program.\n  The committee's study of the detention and interrogation program is \nnot just the story of the brutal and ill-conceived program itself; this \nstudy is also the story of the breakdown in our system of governance \nthat allowed the country to deviate in such a significant and horrific \nway from our core principles. One of the profound ways that breakdown \nhappened was through the active subversion of meaningful congressional \noversight--a theme mirrored in the Bush administration's warrantless \nwiretapping program during that same period.\n  I first learned about some aspects of the CIA's detention and \ninterrogation program in 2003 when I became vice chair of the \ncommittee. At that point and for years after, the CIA refused to \nprovide me or anybody else with any additional information about the \nprogram. They further refused to notify the full committee about the \nprogram's existence. My colleagues will remember there was always the \nGang of 4, the Gang of 6, or the Gang of 8. They would take the \nchairman and vice chairman, take them to the White House, give them a \nflip chart, 45 minutes for the Vice President, and off he would go. \nSenator Roberts and I went down by car and were instructed we couldn't \ntalk to each other on the way back from one of those meetings. It was \nabsurd. They refused to do anything to be of assistance.\n  The briefings I received provided little or no insight into the CIA's \nprogram. Questions or followup requests were rejected, and at times I \nwas not allowed to consult with my counsel. I am not a lawyer. There \nare legal matters involved here. They said we couldn't talk to any of \nour staff, legal counsel or not, or other members of the committee who \nknew nothing about this because they had not been informed at all.\n  It was clear these briefings were not meant to answer any questions \nbut were intended only to provide cover for the administration and the \nCIA. It was infuriating to me to realize I was part of a box checking \nexercise that the administration planned to use, and later did use, so \nthey could disingenuously claim they had--in a phrase I will never be \nable to forget--``fully briefed Congress.''\n\n  In the years that followed I fought and lost many battles to obtain \ncredible information about the detention and interrogation program. As \nvice chair I tried to launch, as has been mentioned, a comprehensive \ninvestigation into the program, but that effort was blocked.\n  Later in 2005, when I fought for access to over 100 specific \ndocuments cited in the inspector general report, the CIA refused to \ncooperate.\n  The first time the full Senate Intelligence Committee was given any \ninformation about this detention program was September 2006. This was \nyears after the program's inception and the same day the President \ninformed the Nation.\n  The following year when I became chairman, the vice chairman, Kit \nBond, and I agreed to push for significant additional access to the \nprogram. For heaven's sake, at least allow both the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee and the House Intelligence Committee, on a full basis, to be \ninformed about this and also to include our staff's counsel on these \nmatters. We finally actually prevailed and got this access. I think I \nwithheld something from them until they agreed to do that which enabled \nus to have much-needed hearings on the program, which we proceeded to \ndo.\n  As chairman, I made sure we scrutinized it from every angle. However, \nthe challenge of getting accurate information from the CIA persisted. \nIt was during this period that the House and Senate considered the 2008 \nIntelligence Authorization Act and a potential provision that set the \nArmy Field Manual--which is the only way to go--as the standard for the \nentire American Government, including the CIA. This would have \neffectively ended the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, a term \neerily sanitized in bureaucratic jargon for what, in a number of cases, \namounted to torture.\n  As chairman, I knew the inclusion of the Army Field Manual provision \nwould jeopardize the entire bill. I thought it might bring it down. \nPeople would think it was too soft or too radical or whatever, but I \nwas committed to seeing the bill signed into law. In the end, it was an \neasy decision.\n  I supported including the provision to end the CIA's program because \nit was the right thing to do. I did it because Congress needed to send \na clear signal that it did not stand by the Bush administration's \npolicy.\n  The House and Senate went on to pass the bill with bipartisan votes. \nAlthough the Bush administration vetoed the bill to preserve its \nability to continue these practices, it was an important symbolic \nmoment.\n  In the same period, I also sent two committee staffers, as our \nchairwoman has indicated, to begin reviewing cables at the CIA \nregarding the agency's interrogations of Abu Zubaydah and al-Nashiri. I \nfirmly believed we had to review those cables, which are now the only \nsource of important historical information on this subject, because the \nCIA destroyed its tapes of some of their interrogation sessions. The \nCIA destroyed those tapes against the explicit direction from the White \nHouse and the Director of National Intelligence.\n  The investigation that began in 2007 grew under Chairman Feinstein's \ndedication and tremendous leadership into a full study of the CIA's \ndetention and interrogation program. The more the committee dug, the \nmore the committee found, and the results we uncovered are both \nshocking and deeply troubling.\n  First, the detention and interrogation program was conceived by \npeople who were ignorant of the topic and made it up on the fly based \non the untested theories of contractors who had never met a terrorist \nor conducted a real-world interrogation of any kind.\n  Second, it was executed by personnel with insufficient linguistic and \ninterrogation training and little, if any, real-world experience.\n  Moreover, the CIA was aware that some of these personnel had a \nstaggering array of personal and professional failings--enumerated by \nthe committee's chairman--including potentially criminal activity, that \nshould\n\n[[Page S6413]]\n\nhave disqualified them immediately not only from being interrogators \nbut from being employed by the CIA or anybody in government.\n  Nevertheless, it was consistently represented that these \ninterrogators were professionalized and carefully vetted--their term--\nand that became a part of the hollow legal justification of the entire \nprogram.\n  Third, the program was managed incompetently by senior officials who \npaid little or no attention to critical details. It was rife with \ntroubling personal and financial conflicts of interest among the small \ngroup of the CIA officials and contractors who promoted and defended \nit. Obviously it was in their interest to do so.\n\n  Fourth, as the chairman indicated, the program was physically very \nsevere, far more so than any of us outside the CIA ever knew. Although \nwaterboarding has received the most attention, there were other \ntechniques I personally believe--one in particular--that may have been \nmuch worse.\n  Finally, its results were unclear at best, but it was presented to \nthe White House, the Department of Justice, the Congress, and the media \nas a silver bullet that was indispensable to saving lives. That was \ntheir mantra. In fact, it did not provide the intelligence it was \nsupposed to provide or the CIA argued that it did provide.\n  To be perfectly clear, these harsh techniques were not approved by \nanyone ever for the low-bar standard of learning useful information \nfrom detainees. These techniques were approved because the Bush \nofficials were told, and therefore believed, that these coercive \ninterrogations were absolutely necessary to elicit intelligence that \nwas unavailable by any other collection method and would save American \nlives. That was simply not the case.\n  For me, personally, the arc of this story comprises more than a \ndecade of my 30 years of work in the Senate and one of the hardest \nfights--I think the hardest fight--I have ever been through. Many of \nthe worst years were during the Bush administration.\n  However, I did not fully anticipate how hard these last few years \nwould be in this administration to get this summary declassified and to \ntell the full story of what happened. Indeed, to my great frustration, \neven after months of endless negotiations, significant aspects of the \nstory remain obscured by black ink.\n  I have great admiration for the President, and I am appreciative of \nthe leadership role he has taken to depart from the practices of the \nBush administration on these issues. His Executive order formally ended \nthe CIA's detention program practices, and that is a good example. It \nis a great example.\n  It was, therefore, with deep disappointment that over the course of a \nnumber of private meetings and conversations I came to feel that the \nWhite House's strong deference to the CIA throughout this process has \nat times worked at cross-purposes with the White House's stated \ninterest in transparency and has muddied what should be a clear and \nunequivocal legacy on this issue.\n  While aspiring to be the most transparent administration in history, \nthis White House continues to quietly withhold from the committee more \nthan 9,000 documents related to the CIA's programs. I don't know why. \nThey won't say, and they won't produce.\n  In addition to strongly supporting the CIA's insistence on the \nunprecedented redaction of fake names in the report, which obscures the \npublic's ability to understand the important connections which are so \nimportant for weaving together the tapestry, the administration also \npushed for the redaction of information in the committee's study that \nshould not be classified, contradicting the administration's own \nExecutive order on classification.\n  Let me be clear.\n  That order clearly states that in no case shall information fail to \nbe declassified in order to conceal violations of law and efficiency or \nadministrative error or prevent embarrassment to a person, \norganization, or agency.\n  In some instances, the White House asked not only that information be \nredacted but that the redaction itself be removed so it would be \nimpossible for the reader to tell that something was already hidden. \nStrange.\n  Given this, looking back, I am deeply disappointed, rather than \nsurprised, that even when the CIA inexplicably conducted an \nunauthorized search of the committee's computer files and emails at an \noffsite facility, which was potentially criminal, and even when it \nbecame clear that the intent of the search was to suppress the \ncommittee's awareness of an internal CIA review that corroborated parts \nof the intelligence committee's study and contradicted public CIA \nstatements, the White House continued to support the CIA leadership, \nand that support was unflinching.\n  Despite these frustrations, I have also seen how hard Chairman \nFeinstein has fought against great odds, stubborn odds, protective \nodds, mysterious odds, which are not really clear to me. I have tried \nto support her thoughtful and determined efforts at every opportunity \nto make sure as much as of the story can be told as possible, and I am \ndeeply proud of the product the committee ended up with.\n  Now it is time to move forward. For all of the misinformation, \nincompetence, and brutality of the CIA's program, the committee's study \nis not and must not be simply a backward-looking condemnation of the \npast. The study presents a tremendous opportunity to develop forward-\nlooking lessons that must be central to all future activities.\n  The point has been made--I thoroughly agree--that the vast majority \nof people who work at the CIA--and there are tens and tens of thousands \nof them--do very good work and are working very hard and have \nabsolutely nothing to do with any of this. But if this report had not \nbeen released, the country would have felt that everybody at the CIA--\nand the world would have felt it--was involved in this program. It is \nimportant to say that that was not the case. It was just 30 or 40 \npeople at the top. Many of the people you see on television blasting \nthis report were intimately involved in carrying it out and setting it \nup.\n  The CIA developed the detention program in a time of great fear, \nanxiety, and unprecedented crisis. It is at these times of crisis when \nwe need sound judgment, excellence, and professionalism from the CIA \nthe most.\n  When mistakes are made, they call for self-reflection and scrutiny. \nFor that process to begin, we first have to make sure there is an \nabsolutely accurate public record of what happened. We are doing that. \nThe public release of the executive summary and findings and \nconclusions is a tremendous and consequential step toward that end.\n  For some, I expect there will be the temptation to reject and cast \ndoubt, to trivialize, to attack or rationalize parts of the study that \nare disturbing or are embarrassing. Indeed, the CIA program's dramatic \ndivergence from the standards that we hold ourselves to is hard to \nreconcile. However, we must fight that shortsighted temptation to wish \naway the gravity of what this study found.\n  How we deal with this opportunity to learn and improve will reflect \non the maturity of our democracy. As a country, we are strong enough to \nbear the weight of the mistakes we have made. As an institution, so is \nthe Central Intelligence Agency. We must confront this dark period in \nour recent history with honesty and critical introspection. We must \ndraw lessons, and we must apply those lessons as we move forward. \nAlthough it may be uncomfortable at times, ultimately we will grow \nstronger, and we will ensure that this never happens again.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I know the time for recess for \ncaucus is approaching and I know there are other Members on the \nDemocratic side who want to speak. It is now time for a Member from the \nRepublican side to speak.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the recess be delayed for 5 minutes so \nthe distinguished Senator from South Carolina might speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is ordered.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you very much. I have been a military lawyer for \nover 30 years. That has been one of the highlights of my life--to serve \nin the Air Force. During the debate about these\n\n[[Page S6414]]\n\ntechniques, I was very proud of the fact that every military lawyer \ncame out on the side that the techniques in question were not who we \nare and what we want to be.\n  We are one of the leading voices of the Geneva Convention. We have \nstood by the Geneva Convention since its inception. I am convinced that \nthe techniques in question violate the Geneva Convention. I am also \nconvinced that they were motivated by fear, fear of another attack. Put \nyourself in the shoes of the people responsible for defending the \ncountry right after 9/11. We had been hit. We had been hit hard. \nEverybody thought something else was coming.\n  As we rounded these guys up, there was a sense of urgency and a \ncommitment to never let it happen again that generated this program.\n  Who knew what, when? I do not know. All I can tell you is the people \ninvolved believed they were trying to defend the country and what they \nwere doing was necessary. Did they get some good information? Probably \nso. Has it been a net loser for us as a country? Absolutely so. All I \ncan say is the techniques in question were motivated by fear of another \nattack, and people at the time thought this was the best way to defend \nthe Nation. I accept that on their part.\n  But as a nation, I hope we have learned the following: In this \nideological struggle, good versus evil, we need to choose good. There \nis no shortage of people who will cut your head off. The techniques in \nquestion are nowhere near what the enemies of this Nation and radical \nIslam would do to people under their control. There is no comparison.\n  The comparison is between who we are and what we want to be. In that \nregard, we made a mistake. No one is going to jail because they should \nnot, because the laws in question--the laws that existed at the time of \nthis program--were, to be generous, vague.\n  I spent about a year of my life with Senator McCain working with the \nBush administration and colleagues on the Democratic side to come up \nwith the Detainee Treatment Act which clearly puts people on notice of \nwhat you can and cannot do. Going forward we fixed this problem. How do \nI know it is a problem? I travel. I go to the Mideast a lot. I go all \nover the world. It was a problem for us. Whether we like it or not, we \nare seen as the good guys. I like it.\n  Sometimes good people make mistakes. We have corrected the problem. \nWe have interrogation techniques now that I think can protect the \nNation and are within our values. The one thing I want to stress to my \ncolleagues is that this is a war of an ideological nature. There will \nbe no capital to conquer. We are not going to take Tokyo. We are not \ngoing to take Berlin. There is no air force to shoot down; there is no \nnavy to sink. You are fighting a radical extreme ideology that is \nmotivated by hate. In their world, if you do not agree with their \nreligion, you are no longer a human being.\n  The only way we can possibly defeat this ideology is to offer \nsomething better. The good news for us is that we stand for something \nbetter. We stand for due process. We stand for humane treatment. We \nstand for the ability to have a say when you are accused of something. \nOur enemies stand for none of that. That is their greatest weakness. \nOur greatest strength is to offer a better way.\n  When you go to Anbar Province and you go to other places in the \nMideast that have experienced life under ISIS--ISIL--and Al Qaeda, the \nreaction has almost been universal: We do not like this. When America \ncomes over the hill, and they see that flag, they know help is on the \nway.\n  To the CIA officers who serve in the shadows, who intermingle with \nthe most notorious in the world, who are always away from home never \nknowing if you are going back: Thank you. There is a debate about \nwhether this report is accurate line by line. I do not know. Is this \nthe definitive answer to the program's problems? I do not know, but I \ndo know the program hurt our country.\n  Those days are behind us. The good guys air their dirty laundry. I \nwished we had waited because the world is in such a volatile shape \nright now. I do fear this report will be used by our enemies. But I \nguess there is no good time to do things like this.\n  So to those who helped prepare the report, I understand where you are \ncoming from. To those on my side who believe that we have gone too far, \nI understand that too. But this has always been easy for me. I have \nbeen too associated with the subject matter for too long. Every time \nour Nation cuts a corner, and every time we act out of fear and abandon \nwho we are, we always regret it. That has happened forever. This is a \nstep toward righting a wrong. To our enemies: Take no comfort from the \nfact that we have changed our program. We are committed to your demise. \nWe are committed to your incarceration and killing you on the \nbattlefield, if necessary.\n  To our friends, because we choose a different path, do not mistake \nthat for weakness. What we are doing today is not a sign of weakness. \nIt is a sign of the ultimate strength--that you can self correct, that \nyou can reevaluate and you can do some soul searching, and you can come \nout with a better product. The tools available to our intelligence \ncommunity today over time will yield better results, more reliable \nresults. The example we are setting will, over time, change the world.\n  To defeat radical Islam you have to show separation. Today is a \ncommitment to show separation. The techniques they employ to impose \ntheir will have been used for thousands of years. They are always, over \ntime, rejected. The values we stand for--tolerance, humane treatment of \neveryone; whether you agree with them or not--have also stood the test \nof time. Over time, we will win, and they will lose. Today is about \nmaking that time period shorter. The sooner America can reattach itself \nto who she is, the worse off the enemy will be.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) residents of remote Alaska villages suffer \n     disproportionately from crimes and civil disturbances rooted \n     in alcohol abuse, illicit drug use, suicide, and domestic \n     violence;\n       (2) the alcohol-related suicide rate in remote Alaska \n     villages is 6 times the average in the United States and the \n     alcohol-related mortality rate is 3.5 times that of the \n     general population of the United States;\n       (3) Alaska Native women suffer the highest rate of forcible \n     sexual assault in the United States and an Alaska Native \n     woman is sexually assaulted every 18 hours;\n       (4) according to the Alaska Native Tribal Health \n     Consortium, one in two Alaska Native women experience \n     physical or sexual violence;\n       (5) according to the 2006 Initial Report and \n     Recommendations of the Alaska Rural Justice and Law \n     Enforcement Commission, more than 95 percent of all crimes \n     committed in rural Alaska can be attributed to alcohol abuse;\n       (6) the cost of drug and alcohol abuse in Alaska is \n     estimated at $525,000,000 per year;\n       (7) there are more than 200 remote villages in Alaska, \n     which are ancestral homelands to Indian tribes and \n     geographically isolated by rivers, oceans, and mountains \n     making most of those villages accessible only by air;\n       (8) small size and remoteness, lack of connection to a road \n     system, and extreme weather conditions often prevent or delay \n     travel, including that of law enforcement personnel, into \n     remote villages, resulting in challenging law enforcement \n     conditions and lack of ready access to the State judicial \n     system;\n       (9) less than \\1/2\\ of remote Alaska villages are served by \n     trained State law enforcement entities and several Indian \n     tribes provide peace officers or tribal police without \n     adequate training or equipment;\n       (10) the centralized State judicial system relies on \n     general jurisdiction Superior Courts in the\n\n[[Page S6415]]\n\n     regional hub communities, with only a handful of staffed \n     magistrate courts outside of the hub communities;\n       (11) the lack of effective law enforcement and accessible \n     judicial services in remote Alaska villages contributes \n     significantly to increased crime, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, \n     domestic violence, rates of suicide, poor educational \n     achievement, and lack of economic development;\n       (12) Indian tribes that operate within remote Alaska \n     villages should be supported in carrying out local culturally \n     relevant solutions to effectively provide law enforcement in \n     villages and access to swift judicial proceedings;\n       (13) increasing capacities of local law enforcement \n     entities to enforce local tribal laws and to achieve \n     increased tribal involvement in State law enforcement in \n     remote villages will promote a stronger link between the \n     State and village residents, encourage community involvement, \n     and create greater local accountability with respect to \n     violence and substance abuse;\n       (14) the United States has a trust responsibility to Indian \n     tribes in the State;\n       (15) the report of the Indian Law and Order Commission to \n     the President and Congress entitled ``A Roadmap to Making \n     Native America Safer'' and dated November 2013 found that the \n     crisis in criminal justice in the State is a national problem \n     and urged the Federal Government and the State to strengthen \n     tribal sovereignty and self-governance and for Congress to \n     create a jurisdictional framework to support tribal \n     sovereignty and expand the authority of Indian tribes in the \n     State; and\n       (16) it is necessary to invoke the plenary authority of \n     Congress over Indian tribes under article I, section 8, \n     clause 3 of the Constitution to improve access to judicial \n     systems in remote Alaska Native villages and provide for the \n     presence of trained local law enforcement.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to improve the delivery of justice in Alaska Native \n     villages by--\n       (A) encouraging the State and Indian tribes to enter into \n     intergovernmental agreements relating to the enforcement and \n     adjudication of State laws relating to drug and alcohol \n     offenses; and\n       (B) supporting Indian tribes in the State in the \n     enforcement and adjudication of tribal laws relating to child \n     abuse and neglect, domestic violence, and drug and alcohol \n     offenses; and\n       (2) to enhance coordination and communication among \n     Federal, State, tribal, and local law enforcement agencies.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Madam President, I rise today as the vice chairman of \nthe Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to respond to the public \nrelease of the declassified version of the executive summary and \nfindings and conclusions from the committee's study of the CIA's \ndetention and interrogation program.\n  This is not a pleasant duty for me. During my 4 years as the vice \nchairman of the Intelligence Committee, I have enjoyed an excellent \nrelationship with our chairman, Senator Dianne Feinstein. We have \nworked closely to conduct strong bipartisan oversight of the U.S. \nintelligence community, including the passage and enactment of \nsignificant national security legislation. However, this particular \nstudy has been one of the very, very few areas where we have never been \nable to see eye-to-eye.\n  Putting this report out today is going to have significant \nconsequences. In addition to reopening a number of old wounds both \ndomestically and internationally, it could be used to incite unrest and \neven attacks against our servicemembers, other personnel overseas, and \nour international partners. This report could also stoke additional \nmistreatment or death for American or other Western captives overseas. \nIt will endanger CIA personnel, sources, and future intelligence \noperations. This report will damage our relationship with several \nsignificant international counterterrorism partners at a time when we \ncan least afford it. Even worse, despite the fact that the \nadministration and many in the majority are aware of these \nconsequences, they have chosen to release the report today.\n  The United States today is faced with a wide array of security \nchallenges across the globe, including in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Syria, \nIraq, Yemen, north Africa, Somalia, Ukraine, and the list goes on. \nInstead of focusing on the problems right in front of us, the majority \nside of the Intelligence Committee has spent the last 5 years and over \n$40 million focused on a program that effectively ended over 8 years \nago, while the world around us burns.\n  In March 2009, when the committee first undertook the study, I was \nthe only member of the Intelligence Committee who voted against moving \nforward with it. I believed then, as I still do today, that vital \ncommittee and intelligence community resources would be squandered over \na debate that Congress, the executive branch, and the Supreme Court had \nalready settled. This issue has been investigated or reviewed \nextensively by the executive branch, including criminal investigations \nby the Department of Justice, the Senate Armed Services Committee, the \nInternational Committee of the Red Cross, as well as other entities.\n  Congress has passed two separate acts directly related to detention \nand interrogation issues--specifically, the Detainee Treatment Act of \n2005 and the Military Commissions Act of 2006. The executive branch \nterminated the CIA program and directed that future interrogations be \nconducted in accordance with the U.S. Army Field Manual on \nInterrogation. Also, the Supreme Court decided Rasul v. Bush in 2004, \nHamdi v. Rumsfeld in 2004, Hamdan v. Rumsfeld in 2006, as well as \nBoumediene v. Bush in 2008, all of which established that detainees \nwere entitled to habeas corpus review and identified certain \ndeficiencies in both the Detainee Treatment Act and the Military \nCommissions Act.\n  By the time I became the vice chairman, the minority had already \nwithdrawn from active participation in the study as a result of \nAttorney General Holder's decision to reopen the criminal inquiry \nrelated to the interrogation of certain detainees in the CIA's \ndetention program. This unfortunate decision deprived the committee of \nthe ability to interview key witnesses who participated in the CIA \nprogram and essentially limited the committee's study to the review of \na cold documentary record. Now, how can any credible investigation take \nplace without interviewing witnesses? This is a 6,000-page report, and \nnot one single witness was ever interviewed in this study being done. \nThis is a poor excuse for the type of oversight the Congress should be \nconducting.\n  There is no doubt that the CIA's detention and interrogation \nprogram--which was hastily executed in the aftermath of the worst \nterrorist attack in our Nation's history--had flaws. The CIA has \nadmitted as much in its June 27, 2013, response to the study. There is \nalso no doubt that there were instances in which CIA interrogators \nexceeded their authorities and certain detainees may have suffered as a \nresult. However, the executive summary and findings and conclusions \nreleased today contain a disturbing number of factual and analytical \nerrors. These factual and analytical shortfalls ultimately led to an \nunacceptable number of incorrect claims and invalid conclusions that I \ncannot endorse.\n  The study essentially refuses to admit that CIA detainees--especially \nCIA detainees subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques--provided \nintelligence information which helped the U.S. Government and its \nallies to neutralize numerous terrorist threats. On its face, this \nrefusal does not make sense given the vast amount of information gained \nfrom these interrogations, the thousands of intelligence reports that \nwere generated as a result of them, the capture of additional \nterrorists, and the disruption of the plots those captured terrorists \nwere planning.\n  Instead of acknowledging these realities, the study adopts an \nanalytical approach designed to obscure the value of the intelligence \nobtained from the program. For example, the study falsely claims that \nthe use of enhanced interrogation techniques played ``no role'' in the \nidentification of Jose Padilla because Abu Zubaydah, a senior member of \nAl Qaeda with direct ties to Osama bin Laden, provided the information \nabout Padilla during an interrogation by FBI agents who were \n``exclusively'' using what is called ``rapport-building'' techniques \nagainst him more than 3 months prior to the CIA's ``use of DOJ-approved \nenhanced interrogation techniques.'' What the study ignores, however, \nis the fact that Abu Zubaydah's earlier interrogation in April of 2002 \nactually did involve the use of interrogation techniques that were \nlater included in the list of enhanced interrogation techniques. \nSpecifically, the facts demonstrate that Abu Zubaydah was subjected to \n``around the clock'' interrogation that included more than 4 days of \ndietary manipulation, nudity, and more than 126 hours--which is about 5 \ndays--of sleep deprivation during a 136-hour period by the time the FBI \nfinished up the 8.5-hour interrogation shift in which Abu Zubaydah \nfinally yielded the identification of Jose Padilla. So during a 5-day \ntime period, Abu Zubaydah got less than 10 hours of sleep, yet the \nmajority does not acknowledge that this was an enhanced interrogation. \nIn light of these facts,\n\n[[Page S6418]]\n\nthe study's claims that the FBI was exclusively using ``rapport-\nbuilding'' techniques is nothing short of being dishonest.\n  More important, the actionable intelligence gleaned from the enhanced \ninterrogation of Abu Zubaydah that started in April of 2002 served as \nthe foundation for the capture of additional terrorists and the \ndisruption of the plots those captured terrorists were planning. His \ninformation was also used to gather additional actionable intelligence \nfrom these newly captured terrorists, which in turn led to a series of \nsuccessful capture operations and plot disruptions. By the study's own \ncount, the numerous interrogations of Abu Zubaydah resulted in 766 \nsole-source disseminated intelligence reports. That is an awful lot of \nactionable intelligence collected under the CIA program that this study \ntries to quietly sweep under the carpet in an effort to support its \nfalse headline that the CIA's use of enhanced interrogation techniques \nwas not effective.\n  The study also overlooks several crucial intelligence successes that \nprevented terror attacks against the United States and our allies \naround the world. Al Qaeda-affiliated extremists subjected to the \nprogram's enhanced interrogation techniques made admissions that led to \nthe identification of the man responsible for plotting the September 11 \nattacks, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, or KSM.\n  The program also helped stop terrorist attacks in the U.S. homeland \nand against our military forces overseas. Al Qaeda affiliate Abu \nZubaydah's statements to interrogators led to the identification of \nJose Padilla--an Al Qaeda operative tasked with conducting a terrorist \nattack inside the United States. The interrogation of KSM and Guleed \nHassan Ahmed disrupted Al Qaeda's plotting against Camp Lemonier in \nDjibouti, a critical base of operations in the war on terror in Africa \nand at that time home to some 1,600 U.S. military personnel. There is \nno telling how many lives this program saved in those particular \ninterrogations alone.\n  Intelligence gathered under the detention and interrogation program \nalso prevented terrorist attacks on our allies in the United \nKingdom. Terrorist plots against London's Heathrow Airport and Canary \nWharf--a major London financial center--were disrupted because key \nconspirators were apprehended and questioned on the basis of \nintelligence gathered using several interrogation techniques, including \nenhanced interrogation techniques.\n\n  Finally, information from detainees held in the program was critical \nto ascertaining the true significance of Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, the Al \nQaeda facilitator who served as Osama bin Laden's personal courier and \nthe man who ultimately lead CIA intelligence analysts and the Navy \nSeals to bin Laden himself.\n  For anyone interested in a nice, chronological survey of the \nsignificant intelligence gained from the program and how it was used to \ncapture additional terrorists and disrupt terrorist plots, I would \ninvite my colleagues to read two pages of our minority views. Pages 96 \nand 97 delineate exactly a chronology of significant intelligence that \nallowed for the takedown of individuals.\n  It seems as though the study takes every opportunity to unfairly \nportray the CIA in the worst light possible, presupposing improper \nmotivations and the most detestable behavior at every turn. The very \nenemies whom the program helped keep at bay for all of those years, as \nwell as adversarial nations, will be able to exploit what is \nessentially a dangerously insightful and instructive treasure trove of \ninformation about our intelligence operations. I am all for pointing \nout and correcting problems with the intelligence community and I have \nbeen very outspoken on some of them, but I prefer our oversight be \nconducted quietly and in a manner that does not jeopardize the national \nsecurity of the United States.\n  Ultimately, our minority views examined eight of the study's most \nproblematic conclusions, many of which attack the CIA's integrity and \ncredibility in developing and implementing the program. These \nproblematic claims and conclusions created the false impression that \nthe CIA was actively misleading policymakers and impeding the \ncounterterrorism efforts of other Federal Government agencies during \nthe program's operation. We found these claims and conclusions were \nlargely not supported by the documentary record and were based upon \nflawed reasoning.\n  Specifically, we found that:\n  No. 1, the CIA's detention and interrogation program was effective \nand produced valuable and actionable intelligence.\n  No. 2, most of the CIA's claims of effectiveness with respect to the \nuse of EITs were accurate.\n  No. 3, the CIA attempted to keep the Congress informed of its \nactivities and did so on a regular basis. As a member of the committee, \nI can attest to that.\n  No. 4, the CIA did not impede White House oversight. The White House \nwas very involved in doing oversight of the program.\n  No. 5, the CIA was not responsible nor did it have control over \nsharing or dissemination of information to other executive branch \nagencies or to members of the Principals Committee.\n  No. 6, many of the study's claims about the CIA providing inaccurate \ninformation to the Department of Justice were themselves totally \ninaccurate.\n  No. 7, the CIA did not significantly impede oversight by the CIA \nOffice of the Inspector General.\n  No. 8, the White House determined that the CIA would have the lead on \ndealing with the media regarding detainees.\n  These findings are not meant as a defense of the CIA. The CIA is \nfully capable of defending its own actions, and I know it will do so. \nRather, these findings are a critique of certain aspects of this \nparticular study. As a general rule, I want our committee findings, \nconclusions, and recommendations to be unassailable in every \ninvestigation we conduct. Unfortunately, that didn't happen, and I am \nvery concerned about the unintended consequences that will result from \nthe study's erroneous and inflammatory conclusions.\n  I imagine some members of the media may choose to repeat the study's \nfalse headlines contained in the report without checking the underlying \nfacts. By doing so they will only be damaging their own credibility. I \ninvite anyone who reads the study's executive summary and findings and \nconclusions to pay particular attention to how often the text uses \nabsolutes, such as ``played no role,'' ``no connection'' or ``no \nindication.'' Please then read our minority views to find the clear \ncounter examples that disprove most of these absolute claims. I suspect \nthe readers who make this effort will be disappointed, as I was, that \nthis study makes so many inaccurate claims and conclusions.\n  Our minority views also explain how this study was crippled by \nnumerous procedural irregularities that hampered the committee's \nability to conduct a fair and objective review of the CIA's detention \nand interrogation program. These procedural defects resulted in a \npremature committee vote in December of 2012 to approve the study \nbefore the text was adequately reviewed by the committee membership or \nsubjected to a routine fact check by the intelligence community.\n  Typically, once a Senate committee report has been approved, staff \nare only authorized to make technical and conforming changes. The \nexecutive summary and findings and conclusions released this week have \nundergone such extensive and unprecedented revisions since the study \nwas approved back in December of 2012 that the traditional concept of \ntechnical and conforming changes has now been rendered meaningless. \nAmazingly, the majority made significant changes in the substance of \nthe study for months after it was voted on by the committee. In \naddition, after we submitted our minority views, the majority staff \nthen went back and made a few changes to specifically correct some of \nthe more blatant errors that we identified in the views and that the \nCIA identified in their review. While I am pleased our views led to \nsome minor improvements in the study, those untimely changes required \nus to add text explaining the validity of our initial conclusions and \ncriticisms. Simply put, the documents released today are very different \nfrom the documents that were approved almost exactly 2 years ago by the \ncommittee at the end of the last Congress on a partisan basis.\n  Another significant weakness of this study is its disregard of the \ncontext\n\n[[Page S6419]]\n\nunder which the CIA's detention and interrogation program was \ndeveloped. It is critical to remember that the intelligence community \nwas inundated by a surge of terrorist threat reporting after the \nSeptember 11 attacks. The fear of a follow-on attack was pervasive, and \nit was genuine. The Nation was traumatized by the horrific murders of \nnearly 3,000 Americans and at the CIA there was no greater imperative \nthan stopping another attack from happening. This context is entirely \nabsent from the study.\n  In addition, everyone must remember that the CIA was directed to \nconduct this program by the President. I have spoken with a number of \nCIA officers over the years who remember the contentious debates about \nthe program at the time it was being considered, but at the end of the \nday the Agency did what the President directed them to do under the \ncolor of law and based upon opinions issued and updated by the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  Many of my colleagues continue to discuss the brutality of many of \nthe enhanced interrogation techniques. I agree that waterboarding, \nwhich only occurred against three detainees, is particularly severe. \nMany of the other techniques were not. By comparison, KSM, who was one \nof the detainees who was subjected to waterboarding, personally \nbeheaded Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, and a number of \nother U.S. citizens have been tortured and beheaded by Al Qaeda-\ninspired groups since.\n  In my opinion, the current threat level posed by ISIL and other Al \nQaeda-affiliated terrorist groups may be greater today than what we \nfaced prior to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. They are better funded, \nbetter equipped, and have recruited hundreds of terrorists who have \nAmerican as well as European passports. ISIL terrorists are using \nsocial media to encourage new recruits to conduct ``lone wolf'' attacks \nin their home countries such as the United States. They are murdering \nand beheading captured hostages and planning terrorist attacks against \nU.S. citizens.\n  In light of these significant threats, the President is still \nattempting to make good on a misguided campaign promise to close down \nGuantanamo Bay. It doesn't seem to matter to him that we are now down \nto the worst of the worst or that his own review groups have strongly \nrecommended against the release of these remaining terrorists. Instead, \nhe has returned to the pre-9/11 practice of treating terrorists like \nordinary criminals. We are reading terrorists their Miranda rights \ninstead of conducting extended intelligence interrogations to develop \nactionable intelligence that might lead to additional captures or plot \ndisruptions.\n\n  I think we would be better off if we were to return to a mindset \nwhere we attempt to capture the enemy and use authorized interrogation \ntechniques to obtain the actionable intelligence information needed to \nneutralize these dangerous terrorist organizations. While there is no \ndoubt there were indeed moments during the CIA detention and \ninterrogation program where interrogators exceeded their authorized \nlimits, such instances were relatively few and far between.\n  In this, my last week of service on the floor of the U.S. Senate and \nas the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, I wish to thank the \nmen and women of the CIA and the rest of the intelligence community and \nthe members of our Armed Forces who have served us so well since the 9/\n11 terrorist attacks. Their efforts and their sacrifices have not gone \nunnoticed. I will be forever grateful for their patriotic service to \nour beloved country. May God bless them all and may God bless the \nUnited States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I come to the floor to praise the public \nservice of and bid farewell to my friend and valued colleague from \nNebraska, Senator Mike Johanns.\n  With my remarks, I celebrate not just Mike's last 6 years in the \nSenate but also his 30-plus years in public service that will culminate \nwith the end of this term.\n  At the highest levels of government in both the legislative and \nexecutive branches, Mike's life of public service has been punctuated \nby great accomplishment. From the Lancaster County Board in Nebraska to \nthe Lincoln City Council, from his service as mayor of Lincoln to his \nservice as the 38th Governor of Nebraska, from his service as the 28th \nU.S. Secretary of Agriculture and throughout his tenure in the Senate, \nMike has demonstrated a commitment to those with muted voices in our \npolitical system, including small business owners, veterans, those \nimpaired by mental illness and most certainly America's farmers and \nranchers.\n  In the Senate, Mike's leadership and bipartisan efforts to repeal \npurposeless tax reporting requirements in ObamaCare, his championing \nnew trade agreements, and his contribution to the development and final \npassage of a new farm bill this year all describe a strong conservative \nlegislator committed to stimulating economic growth through reduced \ngovernment spending, lower tax rates, and reduced regulatory burdens on \nAmerican business.\n  I have appreciated Mike's partnership on key legislation, including \nhis joining me to cosponsor the bipartisan Congressional Accountability \nand Line-Item Veto Act of 2009. During the 112th Congress, we were both \ncosponsors of the Foreign Earnings Reinvestment Act, a bipartisan \neffort to let corporations reinvest earnings kept overseas by our high \ncorporate tax rates back into the American economy.\n  I was also proud to join Mike as an original cosponsor of his bill, \nthe Two-Year Regulatory Freeze Act of 2011, which sought to give the \nAmerican economy a much needed reprieve to burdensome and confusing \nFederal regulations that frequently hinder economic growth. Mike was \nalso an original cosponsor of the Jobs Through Growth Act, and many \nothers.\n  I am also grateful that he joined in helping replenish the Forest \nService's aging air tanker fleet. A decade ago the Forest Service had \nroughly 40 large air tankers to fight wildfires that burned millions of \nacres of land across Western States, including Nebraska and Arizona.\n  Today they own eight large air tankers. Senator Johanns and I saw an \nopportunity to transfer several excess Department of Defense aircraft \nto the Forest Service to temporarily address this shortage, and that \nhas happened.\n  While Mike and I have had disagreements along the way, I have always \nrespected his knowledge and experience as a farmer, foreign trade \nexpert, and the Nation's former Agriculture Secretary.\n  I am proud of the areas where we agree: reining in certain farm \nsubsidy programs, advocating for free trade agreements with Colombia, \nPanama, and South Korea, and even working together to kill the proposed \nUSDA catfish office--a little known $15 million program inside the last \nfarm bill that we both highlighted as wasting taxpayer money and that, \nfrom a trade perspective, was negatively impacting our cattlemen and \nsoy farmers.\n  We also agree on the need to help returning veterans seeking to \nreenter the workforce as beginning farmers, an effort he championed in \nour last farm bill. I have long applauded Senator Johanns for calling \non Congress to pass laws to stop farm subsidies from going to \nmillionaires while he was a sitting Secretary of Agriculture.\n  As much as I respect the substance of Mike's accomplishments in \npublic service, I have valued how he has achieved them with a quiet, \npurposeful dignity and, indeed, a vibrant sense of humor. He has never \nbeen opposed to bipartisan cooperation whenever it is needed to further \nthe interests of his constituents or the greater Nation.\n  For these reasons, his approach to governance in legislating has \nearned him the respect of colleagues and constituents across the \npolitical continuum. It should also serve as an example to all of us in \nthis body who remain behind.\n  In an email Mike wrote to his friends last February announcing his \ndecision not to seek reelection in 2014, Mike wrote: ``With everything \nin life, there is a time and a season.''\n  Well, to my friend and valued colleague, Mike Johanns, I bid fair \nwinds and following seas in all that he and his lovely wife Stephanie \ndo, and I thank him for his service and his friendship.\n\n[[Page S6420]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I rise and second what my friend and \ncolleague from Arizona said.\n  It has been a privilege of mine to serve in this body for 12 years--\nand I will be making some comments about that tomorrow--but during my \nearly years in the Senate the Secretary of Agriculture was Secretary \nMike Johanns.\n  Being a very active member of the Agriculture Committee and being \nchairman for 2 years during then-Secretary Johann's tenure, I had the \nopportunity to work with Mike on a day-to-day basis and, boy, what a \npleasure it is to work with one of the finest gentlemen and public \nservants I have ever known. He is smart, and he is political when he \nneeds to be political, but he has as much or more common sense as, \nagain, any public servant I have ever known.\n  For the past 6 years, he has been my next-door neighbor in the \nRussell building, so we see a lot of each other coming and going and \nhave the opportunity to visit on a regular basis.\n  As I leave at the end of this term, one of the real Members of the \nSenate I am going to miss is Mike Johanns. I publicly thank him for his \nservice and thank him for his commitment. I wish him and Stephanie the \nbest, but what I really thank him for is the great friendship he and I \ndeveloped over the years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I join the Senator from Arizona and the \nSenator from Georgia--my senior Senator, Mr. Chambliss--to rise for a \nminute and talk about Mike Johanns.\n  I want to amend that. I don't want to just talk about Mike Johanns, I \nwant to talk about him and Stephanie Johanns.\n  In the South what we have is what we call a two-for. Mike and \nStephanie are a two-for. They are a great pair for America, and they \nare a great pair for the State of Nebraska.\n  As a Senator from an agricultural State, I know the value that Mike \nbrought to the Cabinet of the United States when he was Secretary of \nAgriculture.\n  I know from his serving the State of Nebraska when he was Governor \nwhat a great job they did. I know the past 6 years, working side-by-\nside with Mike Johanns has been a real treat. He is a gentleman, and he \nis a scholar. He doesn't do anything where he doesn't know what he is \ndoing, and if he is not always right, he is almost always right because \nhe always has Stephanie there to guide him in the right direction.\n  I pay tribute to a great Senator, and a great personal friend, Mike \nJohanns, and his lovely wife Stephanie.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I wish to start by saying I so appreciate the kind words \nby Senators McCain, Chambliss, and Isakson. I see there are others in \nthe Chamber who may weigh in and offer a thought or two. I can't \nexpress how much I appreciate it.\n  I would like to offer a few thoughts--my farewell thoughts--today.\n  I rise, first, to convey a very deep and sincere appreciation to the \npeople of a really great State, the State of Nebraska. They have \nentrusted me with the high privilege and the solemn responsibility of \nrepresenting them in this body.\n  I am honored to have served as a Senator from Nebraska, and I hope \nand pray that I have done so in a manner that upholds the high \nstandards that Nebraskans have rightly established for their elected \noffice holders.\n  If I could turn back the clock 32 years I would do it again--from my \nfirst day as the county commissioner, throughout my service as a \nLincoln City Council member, as mayor of our capital city, Lincoln, as \nthe Governor of Nebraska, in President Bush's Cabinet, and now as a \nSenator. No doubt about it, if I could turn back the clock, I would \njust do it again.\n  I am so grateful for the trust placed in me and the support of so \nmany people who have made this service possible.\n  Let me start with the top of the list, and that would be my family. \nMy wife, Stephanie, has been an incredible pillar of support.\n  One of my best friends refers to her as ``spirited.'' That would be \nan understatement. She is a true partner. She has given her whole heart \nto public service--both her own service as a State senator and as a \ncounty commissioner when we first met--and to mine.\n  I thank my children, Justin and Michaela, who are now grown up. They \nhave their own families. We have five beautiful grandchildren. They \nhave been a source of true joy and pride. They too have cheerfully \nsupported me despite the sometimes long hours and the missed \nbirthdays--I could go on and on. It cut into that dad and grandpa time.\n  I offer a special word of thanks to the hundreds or thousands of \nvolunteers whom I could never thank individually. They went out there, \npounded the yard signs, walked the precincts, worked the phone banks, \nand they probably wrote checks when the bank account was pretty low. \nTheir belief in me is what has been inspiring in those campaigns.\n  Another group of people near and dear to my heart are my current and \nformer staff, campaign or government related. We have always called \nourselves Team Johanns. It is an extended family and for good reason. \nTheir hard work, their commitment, and their professionalism enabled me \nto represent and serve our great State and our country.\n  I have not only been truly blessed by the privilege to serve, but I \nhave been blessed by the privilege of meeting some very extraordinary \npeople.\n  In my various roles I have been with world leaders, spiritual heads, \ncultural icons, Presidents, Vice Presidents, Prime Ministers, Queens, \nand Kings--all memorable experiences to be sure. But I will say they \nare not the extraordinary people I speak about today. My real \ninspiration comes from ordinary people whom I have observed and watched \ndo remarkable, extraordinary things.\n  Each year for the past 6 years, I have had the privilege of selecting \na Nebraska family to be honored as ``Angels in Adoption.'' Each year \ntheir stories of unconditional love show the limitless capacity of the \nhuman heart.\n  One family, the Welchels of Harrisburg, NE, went from two children to \nseven. They adopted five children, all with special needs, but their \nselflessness did not stop there. They created a camp where these very \nspecial kids could share life's journeys. How powerful is that?\n  I have learned that heroes walk among us daily whose courage is \nrevealed in split-second decisions, and in that split second they put \nthe lives of others in front of their own.\n  Two Nebraskans did exactly that in 2012. A school bus had collided \nwith a semitrailer on a rural road near a community called Blue Hill, \nNE. These individuals, Ron Meyer and Phil Petr, arrived on this \nhorrific scene. They bravely ran onto that burning bus and pulled five \nchildren to safety. A witness who was there at the scene expressed \nabsolutely no doubt those five children would have perished, as others \nsadly did, if not for the remarkable courage of Ron and Phil.\n  I have been so moved beyond words by my conversations with the \nparents of our fallen men and women in uniform. I would call them to \noffer them my condolences, and I have found their strength to be so \nastounding. To a person, they speak with such passion about love of \ncountry and pride in their loved one's service, despite sorrow. They \nhonor their children with their patriotism. They honor their children \nwith their fortitude. Their grace through incomprehensible grief \ninspires immeasurable gratitude. May God bless them and all of the \nfamilies of the fallen.\n  Walking the streets of a tornado-ravaged community--and I have done \nthat too many times as Governor and as a Senator--I saw ordinary people \ndoing extraordinary things.\n  One stands out especially in my mind. I watched in amazement as Kim \nNeiman, the Pilger, NE, city clerk, attempted to take care of every \nconceivable need of every single resident following a devastating \ntornado that literally leveled this Nebraska community.\n  Her tireless advocacy, her raw determination was focused entirely on \nthe community she loved. She had virtually no regard for her personal \nloss.\n\n[[Page S6421]]\n\nYou see, her home was destroyed, and her life was turned upside down by \nthis tornado as well. But for Kim, community came first.\n  These are good people, and there are so many more like them. They \ninspired me, and they have motivated me to search for solutions to \nbreak through partisan rancor that too often dominates this government.\n  But they also fuel my optimism for the future. You see, I believe \nthat America's strength is in the fabric of which we are woven. The \nthreads of this fabric include both the character of our people and the \nwisdom reported in our Constitution.\n  It is a very strong and very durable fabric that withstands the \noverreach of any one President and the misguided policies of any one \nadministration.\n  That is why I look back, not with any regret--I would do it all over \nagain--but with gratitude. There were victories won during my time \nhere, and I am pleased to have lead some of those charges. But I have \nto admit many battles remain.\n  I would be dishonest if I denied some feelings of frustration about \nthe absence of the will to address issues of paramount importance to \nour country, but I know that no issue is powerful enough to shred the \nfabric of this great Nation. Rather, these challenges are overpowered \nby the ordinary people who do extraordinary things, by the character of \nour people, and by the wisdom of our Founders. So I reject the prophecy \nof hopelessness.\n\n  As the challenges we face grow more urgent--and they will--so grows \nthe collective fortitude to address them, and I believe that is about \nto intensify.\n  On January 3, I will officially pass the baton to Senator-elect Ben \nSasse, and I wish him the best. With the 114th Congress, there will be \na new day in this Chamber, a new majority, and a lot of new faces. I \nhope they embrace the new opportunities to exemplify true \nstatesmanship.\n  Although confidence in our Nation's ability to solve problems may be \nshaken, I still believe ordinary people can do extraordinary things--\neven here in Washington, DC. May God guide those efforts and may God \nbless this great country, the United States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/09/senate-section/article/S6421-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6421-S6424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTES TO MIKE JOHANNS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I had an opportunity to address the \nextraordinary career of the Senator from Nebraska the other day, and he \nwas on the floor, which was welcomed, and his staff was in the gallery. \nI wanted to say again, in a much shorter version, how much we all \nappreciate his remarkable contributions to our country, to his State, \nand to the Senate and wish him well in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I rise today to celebrate the legacy \nof my dear friend, my colleague, and my fellow Nebraskan, Senator Mike \nJohanns.\n  Senator Johanns has dedicated more than three decades of his life to \nserving the people of Nebraska and also this Nation. His career in \npublic service began at the local level, where he was elected to the \nLancaster County Board of Commissioners. He later joined the Lincoln \nCity Council, and eventually became mayor of Nebraska's capital city \nwhere he served for two terms.\n  Perhaps the most infamous decision Senator Johanns ever made \nthroughout his career in public service was in his days as mayor of \nLincoln. After an early season winter storm dropped more than a foot of \nheavy wet snow on Lincoln in late October, Mayor Johanns decided to \ncancel Halloween. He cited power outages and hazardous downed power \nlines.\n  As you can imagine, this news was not received well among some of \nthose Lincolnites. To this day, constituents haven't forgotten and they \nstill occasionally remind him of how he deprived an entire city of \ntrick or treats on that fateful October evening. He made up for it, \nthough, when he and his wife Stephanie treated children who came to \ntrick or treat at the mansion.\n  Fortunately, this incident didn't deal a death blow to Senator \nJohanns' political career. He went on to serve as Governor of Nebraska \nand was reelected to a second term.\n  As Governor, he focused on fiscal discipline and the responsible use \nof limited State tax dollars, principles he upheld here in the Senate \nas well. At one point, as Governor, he even vetoed an entire 2-year \nbudget proposal because it raised taxes to expand government power.\n  He also championed ambitious mental health reforms that allowed \npatients to receive care in the stability and in the security of their \nown communities where they could be near their loved ones. A decade \nlater, these reforms in Nebraska are still regarded as a major \nmilestone in improving mental health care.\n  Before he was a Senator or a Governor or a mayor or a city \ncouncilman, he worked on his family's dairy farm. That is not easy \nwork. And as Mike puts it, it is a job that builds character and \nhumility. Growing up on a dairy farm, he would milk cows every day \nbefore school, sometimes even taking the tractor halfway to town in the \nwinter months when the roads were so bad that the schoolbus couldn't \nget out to his farm.\n  This upbringing gave Senator Johanns a great appreciation and a deep \nunderstanding for the needs of our Nation's ag producers, so it was no \nsurprise when President George W. Bush selected him to lead the \nDepartment of Agriculture as its Secretary. Mike dutifully served in \nthis role, overseeing a new reform-oriented farm bill and opening doors \nto new global markets for our Nation's ag producers.\n  As Secretary of Agriculture, he saw firsthand the challenges facing \nhungry nations. It was in this role that he fell in love with the \npeople of Africa, and he has worked here in the Senate to develop food \naid programs that not only feed but also empower hungry populations \naround the world.\n  Senator Johanns has tirelessly worked for our State and our Nation. \nHe brought to the Senate a unique perspective, having served virtually \nevery level of government. His well-rounded approach to his work here \nreflects that rare wisdom. Many of us here have had the pleasure of \nworking closely with him because he always makes a point to work with \nhis colleagues regardless of party affiliation, whether it be on \ncomplex legislation or that annual Senate secret Santa tradition.\n  We are all familiar with the confident, peaceful demeanor he brings \nto the Senate, and his plain-spoken clarity will truly be missed once \nhe leaves Congress. This is who Mike Johanns is. It is who he has \nalways been: a quiet workhorse with a soft spot for the world's most \ndisadvantaged, and a burning desire to help wherever he can. Friends \nback home who have known him since before he began his career in public \nservice will tell you that he is the same man today he was back then--\nnever losing sight of his goal of helping people, never getting a big \nhead, and always putting Nebraska first.\n  The Senator's wife Stephanie has been by his side throughout every \nstep of this tremendous journey, always supportive and steadfast. \nAnyone who knows Mike knows he and Steph are inseparable. I am sure \nthey are both looking forward to having more time to spend with family \nnext year.\n  Mike, you are a statesman and a model citizen. I am thankful for all \nthe work you have done for Nebraska and for the entire Nation. You have \nset such a great example for your fellow Senators, and we all \nappreciate your dedication over these past 32 years. You have served \nNebraska with dignity and integrity. Good luck. I wish you and \nStephanie all the best. God bless you both.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, this is a bittersweet time for all of \nus. As you have heard, as we close the book on one term of Congress and \nlook forward to the next, we are here to say goodbye to one of our \nesteemed colleagues who is finishing his service in the Senate. It is \nalways tough, but it is especially hard for me with regard to Senator \nMike Johanns--a guy I consider a fine Senator, also a good friend, and \nsort of the perfect example of the statesman. Through his impressive \ncareer as mayor, Governor, Cabinet member, and Senator, as his \ncolleague has just said, he has displayed that.\n\n[[Page S6422]]\n\n  I first met Senator Johanns when he was Secretary Johanns. He was \nSecretary of Agriculture in the George W. Bush Cabinet, and that meant \nwe got to spend a lot of time together. I was the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative, and I truly believe I have traveled around the world \nmore with Mike than I have with my family. We went all over, from Asia \nto Europe to South America and Africa. We fought for farmers and \nranchers. Our ideal was that we could expand exports, and we were able \nto do that and make some progress with his hard work.\n  We went to far-flung corners of the world, such as Burkina Faso, to \ndeal with cotton issues important to U.S. farmers. We spent countless--\nand I mean countless--hours on something called the green room \nnegotiating sessions, trying to reach a deal in the Doha round of talks \nwith the World Trade Organization.\n  I remember one time Mike and I had the opportunity to brief reporters \nas we were going across Africa. We were racing across the Sahara desert \nto make our way to an airport. Because the airport had no lights, the \npilots insisted we get there while there was still light so they could \nsee where they were landing.\n  He taught me a lot, not just about arcane agricultural issues, such \nas what is a green box or an amber box subsidy in agriculture--fun \nissues such as that--but he also taught me a lot about negotiating and \nabout how, as we said earlier, to be a statesman.\n  We had some tough negotiating sessions, but Mike was always a proud \nand relentless representative and champion for the interests of our \ngreat country and the interests of the farmers and ranchers he knew so \nwell. He always did his job on the global stage with honor and with \ndignity. If there has ever been a more forceful advocate for American \nfarmers, whether it was there or here in the Senate, I don't know who \nit is.\n  In 2007, he told me he was going to leave the administration and go \nhome to Nebraska, and that he was considering running for the Senate. I \nnever thought I would be able to serve with him, because I didn't know \nI was going to follow him, but I knew when he told me that, he would be \nin the Senate and that he would put in the same level of dedication to \nthis body as he had as Secretary of Agriculture, and that has been \ntrue.\n  He is not flashy. His colleague from Nebraska has just called him a \nworkhorse. I hope he takes that as a compliment. I would. He has never \nsought out the cameras or, for that matter, sought out recognition for \nhis good work. He just does the right thing. A true statesman.\n  So, Mike Johanns, we are going to miss you. We are going to miss \nStephanie. And we wish you Godspeed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, the first time I met Mike Johanns was \nin Hutchison, KS. Hutchison, KS, is where we have the State fair every \nyear. I was somebody then. I was the chairman of the sometimes powerful \nHouse Committee on Agriculture, and I had made a pitch to get the \nSecretary of Agriculture to actually come to the fair, thinking that \nMike Johanns would be a far better speaker than myself and maybe I \ncould avoid some trouble. So I had the Secretary come and I made the \npromise that every farmer who wanted to ask the Secretary of \nAgriculture a question would have that opportunity. I hadn't bothered \nto tell Mike about it, but when he arrived on the scene, he nodded his \nhead and said: Fine. He had this yellow tablet under his arm, and with \nample staff, some who used to work for me, but that is beside the \npoint.\n  So cutting things short, all the activities in the State fair he \nattended, and he dutifully went around to every exhibit, and we finally \nended up in the amphitheater and there must have been 150 to 175 \nfarmers all lined up waiting to speak to or to question the Secretary \nof Agriculture. I thought to myself: Oh, my gosh, what have I done? The \nSecretary is coming in--I didn't know Mike that well at that particular \ntime--and what have I gotten him into?\n  But Mike didn't seem to be bothered at all. He was absolutely \ncomfortable, unflappable. He had the microphone and he sat down at a \ntable, put down the yellow tablet and said: Yes, sir, and what is your \nfirst question and what is your name? The individual would give his \nname and the question, and Mike would write down the question. He said: \nThank you very much for that. It will receive all of our attention. \nNext.\n  He went through the whole 125 or 150 and never answered a question, \nbut he wrote it down. Every farmer who came up later to me said: You \nknow, the Secretary wrote down my question. They were tremendously \nimpressed, as opposed to me. Silly me, I would have tried to answer \ntheir questions, and we would have been there 2 or 3 hours, Lord knows \nhow long. So I asked Mike: How do you get by with that? He said: Well, \nit saves a lot of time and you never get in trouble by what you don't \nsay, which always sort of stuck with me and what a class act he was.\n  County commissioner, mayor of Lincoln, Governor, Secretary of \nAgriculture, U.S. Senate. I suppose if I floated a balloon for you to \nbe President that you might--no, Stephanie wouldn't buy it and you \nwouldn't either. But that would be the logical next step, Mike, and I \nthink we certainly could and probably will do a lot worse. But at any \nrate, since I brought up Stephanie, Franki and I extend our very best \nwishes and love.\n  I do have somewhat of a minor discomfort, it isn't a quarrel--I would \nnever quarrel with Stephanie--but some degree of discomfort.\n  We have to have meetings around here a lot, and some of us stay for \nthe whole thing. We would always look around for Mike. He would be \naround for the fireworks and then he would leave and he would always go \nhome--because he had a home very close on Capitol Hill--to be with \nStephanie.\n  She is absolutely wonderful. She has the best smile ever. You cannot \nbe unhappy or in a bad mood ever when you see Stephanie.\n  So I would come to work in the Hart Building or here in the Capitol \nand I would happen to run into Stephanie and she would always come up \nwith that big smile on her face and say: Hi, Pat. How are things going?\n  What are you going to do? I mean, I am trying to be the curmudgeon of \nthe Senate, but Grassley keeps edging me out. So here I would be in \nsort of a bad or a grumpy mood and she would flash that smile, and I \nwould say: Just fine. Then I would be feeling pretty good and I would \ngo into the office. They would say: What is wrong? You have a smile on \nyour face. I would say, ``I've been Stephanized.'' I am truly going to \nmiss that.\n  I remember the time we were sitting probably right about here in the \nback. We had just concluded the farm bill for the first time, and then \nit took us 400 days to get the rest of it. Mike is an expert on \nagriculture program policy. Ask anybody else if they would like to talk \nabout agriculture program policy and you would get a high glaze after \nabout 8 seconds--but not Michael. Mike knows agriculture farm program \npolicy. We call it farm program policy in Nebraska and Kansas, but he \nknows an awful lot about it.\n  I asked him: How many people do you think in this body, in this \nSenate, absolutely understand farm program policy? He retorted: How \nmany people want to understand agriculture program policy? We decided \nthere were about 5 in the Senate and maybe about 10 in the House--which \nshows you why we have a tough time getting the farm bill done.\n  I relied on his advice and counsel when I was the ranking member. I \nam so sorry--I regret--should I have the privilege of becoming chairman \nof the Senate agriculture committee, I would look forward to a dynamic \nduo with regard to what we could accomplish. But Senator Johanns is \nlike Shane: Come back, Shane. Come back, Mike. But Shane rode away, and \nthe Senator is going to ride back to Nebraska. I give him that, and I \ngive him all of the success he can possibly have.\n  Six years is all this man has served. Some people have been here a \nlot longer. I have. You can accomplish a lot in 6 years. People say: \nWhat can you do in 6 years?\n  No. 1, you can work on legislation and you can know what you are \ntalking about and you can earn people's respect and you can be smart \nabout it. I don't mean smart smart. I mean just smart, so that what you \nsay and when\n\n[[Page S6423]]\n\nyou say it, people pay attention. That is precisely the kind of person \nMike is. You can have all the integrity in the world and you can do \nexactly what he says when he talks about the people of Nebraska.\n  The people of Kansas are very similar to the people of Nebraska. My \nonly complaint with the people of Nebraska is they chose to go play in \nthe Big Ten and are finding it a little more difficult than running the \ntrack meets they used to run against Kansas State and KU. But if you \nwant to go to the Big Ten and do that, why that is your business--but \nwe have the same kind of roots.\n  I have always said there are no self-made men or women in public \noffice. It is our friends and the people we represent who make us what \nwe are, and Senator Johanns has spoken so eloquently to that.\n  Michael, I was trying to think of a tag I could label you with that \nmight be noteworthy of everything you stand for. Others will do better \nthan I and others have already said that. I simply come up by saying \nthat you are an uncommon man with a very common touch, and I am going \nto miss you--and everybody in the conference is going to miss you and I \nsuspect everybody in the Senate is going to miss you for the way you \nhave conducted yourself and the job you have done for Nebraska.\n  We wish you all the best and we love you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, when Senator Mike Johanns stated in \nFebruary of last year that he had decided not to seek a second term in \nthe Senate, he did so in a way that revealed so much about his \ncharacter. There was no dramatic press conference, there were no weeks \nof rumors, there were no guessing games. Instead, there was just a \nsimple and brief press release.\n  Then, the very next day it was back to work for Senator Johanns, \ntraveling throughout the State of Nebraska for a series of townhall \nmeetings with the people he is honored to serve.\n  Nine months later, in October of 2013, his character again shone \nthrough. The Federal Government was shut down due to a massive failure \nto govern responsibly. It was stifling our economy and causing great \nharm to the trust the American people deserve to have in their \ngovernment.\n  As a key member of our Common Sense Coalition, Senator Johanns worked \neffectively and quietly to restore government operations and to restore \ncitizen trust in government. Again, no dramatics, no search for the \nlimelight, just solid results, just effective leadership.\n  Quiet, effective leadership guided by common sense has been the \nhallmark throughout the Senator's 32 years in public service. From \nLancaster County commissioner and mayor of Lincoln to Governor of \nNebraska and U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, he has been well informed, \nthoughtful, and untiring.\n  The old farm country saying that sowing is easy, reaping is hard \nperfectly describes his record of accomplishment and his determination \nto see any task to its completion. Most of all, the Senator from \nNebraska always does what he thinks is in the best interests of our \ncountry and of the people he so proudly represents.\n  In an interview shortly before he announced that he would be leaving \nthe Senate, Senator Johanns said he hoped he would be remembered as ``a \nguy who was good to work with.''\n  Working with Senator Mike Johanns has been more than just good. It \nhas been an honor and a privilege and I wish him and Stephanie all the \nbest.\n  Thank you for your service.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to also express my appreciation for \nSenator Mike Johanns and for his wife Stephanie.\n  I first met Mike shortly after I was elected Governor of my State. At \nthat time Mike was serving as Governor of Nebraska. Right away when I \nwent and visited with Mike I could tell this was somebody who was not \nonly somebody we could count on but who had the right motivation in \npublic service, had great ideas, and was somebody I could look to as a \nmentor, and I have ever since.\n  From his experience at the local level as commissioner, then as \nmayor, then as Governor, then as Secretary of Agriculture, and then as \na Senator, Mike has been somebody all of us have counted on and \nsomebody whose advice we have sought when we wrestled with tough \ndecisions.\n  So I just want to add my voice as well to the others who have \nexpressed our appreciation for Senator Mike Johanns and for Stephanie \nand to say how much we are going to miss him. We are going to miss him \nnot only on a personal level--because he is a great guy and a great \nfriend and somebody we can count on--but we are going to miss his \nadvice, his counsel, his participation in this process on behalf of the \nAmerican people.\n  I think Mike epitomizes the kind of approach we need to have in this \nbody to get work done--to listen, to think carefully, and to remember \nalways that we work for the American people, and he has a long and \ndistinguished career doing that.\n  He is somebody who will be truly missed, and I think he is somebody \nwho exemplifies the very best of this body and of public service on \nbehalf of our great Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, our colleagues know the Presiding Officer \nis a recovering Governor, I am a recovering Governor, Mike Johanns is a \nrecovering Governor. So we are sort of a support group for one another, \nmen and women who used to be somebody special. I am kidding because I \nthink we still are.\n  The Senator was talking about Michael, and I had the privilege of \nknowing him and his wife for a number of years. We were Governors \ntogether, and my wife Martha and his wife Stephanie were First Ladies \ntogether and define what the standards should be for First Lady or \nFirst Man, if you will, if you have a female Governor.\n  I will never forget when I first met him. I was talking about \nStephanie and how we know each other and so forth, and he told me this \ngreat story about--I think they were county commissioners together. It \nwas Lancaster County.\n  I might be mistaken, I think he used to be in those days maybe a \nDemocrat, and a long time ago I was a young Republican for Barry \nGoldwater, when I was a 17-year-old Republican freshman student at Ohio \nState, and later found out Hillary Clinton was a Goldwater ``Golden \nGirl'' at the Republican convention in 1964.\n  In any event, I just want to say one of the reasons he is so \nthoughtful, and I hope maybe the reason I am fairly thoughtful, is \nbecause we have the ability to work across the aisle and to see and \nappreciate the views of other people.\n  The story about how he and Stephanie, when they were on county \ncouncil together, they met, started liking each other, started dating, \nfell in love and later got married--they even had lunch together every \nday they were on county council, and every day he was Governor they \ncontinued to have lunch together and here, too, for many days. That is \na love, the kind you just don't see. You just don't see that very much.\n  I just want to say: You are such an inspiration to the rest of us, \nyou and your wife, the way you cherish each other and hold together and \nsupport each other and stand by each other. It is just a real source of \ninspiration.\n  There is an old saying: It doesn't matter who gets credit for \nsomething when you get a lot more done. You define that, a guy who \ndoesn't need headlines, a lot of attention. I hope the rest of us are \nthat way, but you define that for us.\n  We love working with you. We are going to miss you. We wish you the \nbest and wish you Godspeed. As we say in the Navy, fair winds. God \nbless you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am here to talk about the Intelligence \nCommittee report, but before the Senator leaves the floor, I just want \nto tell my colleague from Nebraska how much I appreciate his service. I \nnote for the body that in the effort to build a bipartisan coalition \nfor major tax reform, Mike Johanns was the Senator whose counsel we all \nthought we needed, and I thank him. I will have more to say about his \ncareer before the end of this week.\n\n[[Page S6424]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/09/senate-section/article/S6424-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6424-S6425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n      SSCI STUDY OF THE CIA'S DETENTION AND INTERROGATION PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have served on the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee for 14 years and came to the Senate floor in the spring of \n2005 to join with Senator Rockefeller in calling for the committee to \ninvestigate the CIA's interrogation activities and the possible use of \ntorture. In 2009 I joined my Intelligence Committee colleagues in \nvoting to approve Chair Feinstein's motion to launch an investigation \ninto these activities.\n  I said at the time, I continue to believe it today, that what this \ndebate over torture requires is an infusion of facts. Americans can \nhear me and other policymakers argue that the CIA's so-called enhanced \ninterrogation techniques constituted torture and did not work, and \nAmericans can also hear various former officials argue that these \ntechniques are not torture and that they produced uniquely valuable \ninformation. What is important is that today all Americans finally have \naccess to the facts so they can make up their own minds. Personally, I \nhope this report closes the door on the possibility of our country ever \nresorting to torture again.\n  Americans have known since the days of the Salem witch trials that \ntorture is an unreliable means of obtaining truthful information in \naddition to being morally reprehensible. But following the terrorist \nattacks of September 11, 2001, a small number of CIA officials chose to \nfollow the advice of private, outside contractors who told them the way \nto quickly get important information from captured terrorist suspects \nwas by using coercive interrogation techniques that had been developed \nand used by Communist dictatorships during the Cold War.\n  I would note that the CIA officials later paid these same contractors \nto evaluate the effectiveness of their own work.\n  CIA officials repeatedly represented to the public, to the Congress, \nto the White House, and to the Justice Department that the techniques \nwere safe, that they were only used against high-level terrorist \ncaptives, and that their use provided unique otherwise unavailable \nintelligence that saved lives. After 5 long years of investigation, our \ncommittee found that none of these claims held up. The CIA's so-called \nenhanced interrogation techniques included a number of techniques that \nour country has long considered torture. Furthermore, the CIA's own \ninterrogation records make it clear that the use of these techniques in \nthe CIA's secret prisons was far harsher than was described in \nrepresentations by the CIA.\n  CIA Director Michael Hayden testified that any deviation from \napproved procedures were reported and corrected, but CIA interrogation \nlogs described a wide variety of harsh techniques that the Justice \nDepartment's infamous torture memos did not even consider. Practices \nsuch as placing detainees in ice water or threatening a detainee with a \npower drill were often not appropriately recorded or corrected when \nthey happened. Director Hayden also testified that detainees at a \nminimum have always had a bucket to dispose of their human waste, but \nin fact CIA detainees were routinely placed in diapers for extended \nperiods of time, and CIA cables show multiple instances in which \ninterrogators withheld waste buckets from detainees.\n  CIA records indicate that some CIA prisoners may not have been \nterrorists at all. Some of these individuals were in fact ruthless \nterrorists with blood already on their hands, but one of the report's \nmost important findings is that this did not seem to be the case in \nevery instance. In one particularly troubling case, the CIA held an \nintellectually challenged man prisoner and attempted to use tapes of \nhim crying as leverage against another member of the individual's \nfamily.\n  At another point the CIA official noted in writing that the CIA was \nholding a number of detainees about whom we know very little, and the \nCIA on multiple occasions continued to hold people even after CIA \nofficers concluded there was not information to detain them. The review \neven found email records that described Director Hayden instructing a \nCIA officer to underreport the total number of CIA detainees. To this \nday the CIA's official response to this report indicates that senior \nCIA officials are alarmingly uninterested in determining exactly how \nmany detainees the CIA even held.\n  To be clear, the report doesn't attempt to determine the motivation \nbehind these misrepresentations. The report doesn't reach judgments \nabout whether individuals deliberately lied or unknowingly passed along \ninaccurate information. It simply compares the representations the CIA \nmade to Congress, the Justice Department, the public, and others to the \ninformation found in the CIA's own internal records, and it notes where \nthose comparisons reveal significant contradictions.\n  One of the biggest sets of contradictions revolve around the repeated \nclaim that the use of these techniques produced unique, otherwise \nunavailable intelligence that saved lives. CIA officials made this \nclaim to the White House, the Justice Department, the Congress, and the \npublic. The claim was repeated over and over and over again. Over the \nyears CIA officials came up with a number of examples to try to support \nthe claim, such as the names of particular terrorists supposedly \ncaptured as a result of coercive interrogations or plots that had been \nsupposedly thwarted based on this unique, otherwise unavailable \ninformation.\n\n  The committee took the 20 most prominent or frequently cited examples \nused by the CIA and our investigators spent years going through them. \nTwenty examples are going to seem like a lot to anybody who reads the \nreport, but the committee members who were working on the report agreed \nit was important to be comprehensive and avoid cherry-picking just one \nor two cases. In every one of these cases the CIA statements about the \nunique effectiveness of coercive interrogation techniques were \ncontradicted in one way or another by the Agency's own internal \nrecords.\n  I am going to repeat that because I think it is a particularly \nimportant finding. In every one of these 20 cases, CIA statements about \nthe unique effectiveness of coercive interrogation was contradicted in \none way or another by the Agency's own internal records. We are not \ntalking about minor inconsistencies. We are talking about fundamental \ncontradictions.\n  For example, in congressional testimony and documents prepared for \nWhite House briefings, the CIA claimed that a detainee had identified \nKhalid Shaikh Mohammed as the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks after he \nwas detained by the CIA and subjected to the CIA's coercive \ninterrogation techniques, but in fact CIA records clearly show that Abu \nZubaydah provided this information during noncoercive interrogations by \nthe FBI prior to the beginning of his coercive CIA interrogations and \ndays before he was even moved to the CIA's secret detention site. I \npersonally expected that there would be at least one or two cases where \nvague or incomplete records might appear to support the Agency's \nclaims, but in fact in every one of these 20 examples they and the \narguments for them crumble under close scrutiny.\n  The report that is being released today includes a number of \nredactions aimed at protecting our national security. I will say in my \nview some of these redactions are unnecessary and a few of them even \nobscure some details that would help Americans understand parts of the \nreport. Overall I am satisfied that the redactions do not make the \nreport unreadable and it would be possible for Americans to read the \nreport to learn not only what happened but how it happened, and \nlearning that is essential to keep it from happening again.\n  One of the reasons this public release is necessary is that the \ncurrent CIA leadership has been resistant to acknowledging the full \nscope of the mistakes and misrepresentations that have surrounded this \nprogram. Some of this resistance is made clear in the Agency's official \nresponse to the committee's report, and I suspect some of it will be \nechoed by former officials who were involved in the program.\n  Finally, I want to wrap up by reminding people about the documents \nthat have come to be known as the Panetta review. When former CIA \nDirector Panetta came to the Agency in 2009, he made it clear from the \noutset that he wanted to work to put the Agency's history of torture \nbehind it\n\n[[Page S6425]]\n\nand that he wanted to cooperate with the Intelligence Committee \ninquiry. He also sensibly asked CIA personnel to review internal CIA \nrecords and get a sense of what this investigation could be expected to \nfind.\n  The review got off to a solid start. It began to identify some of the \nsame mistakes and misrepresentations that are identified in our \ncommittee's report. Unfortunately, it does not appear that this review \never made it to the Director's desk. Instead, publicly available \ndocuments made it clear this review was quietly terminated by CIA \nattorneys who thought it was moving too fast.\n\n  Earlier this year the Agency conducted an unprecedented and secret \nsearch of Senate files in an effort to find out whether the committee \nhad obtained copies of the Panetta review. After it was found that \ncommittee investigators had in fact obtained the Panetta review, the \nCIA actually attempted to file unsupported criminal allegations against \nSenate staff members. After the search was publicly revealed by the \npress, the CIA's own spokesperson acknowledged in USA Today that the \nsearch had taken place and it had been done because the CIA was looking \nto see if our investigators had found a document the CIA didn't want \nthe Congress to have. Incredibly, that same week CIA Director John \nBrennan told reporter Andrea Mitchell of NBC that the CIA had not spied \non Senate files and that ``nothing could be further from the truth.''\n  I think this incident and the difference between what was said to \nAndrea Mitchell and what the Agency's own people said to USA Today \nreflects once again what I call an alarming culture of misinformation. \nInstead of acknowledging the serious organizational problems that are \nlaid out in this report, the Agency's leadership seems inclined to try \nto sweep them under the rug. This means organizational problems aren't \ngoing to be fixed unless they are laid out publicly, and there is also \na danger that other countries or even future administrations might be \ntempted to use torture if they don't have all the facts about the CIA's \nexperience. That is why the release today is so important.\n  In concluding, I thank all of the staff who have put in hours and \nhours and nights and weekends and time away from their families to get \nthis investigation completed. I praise Chair Feinstein and our former \nChair Senator Rockefeller, who together were resolute in pushing for \nthis kind of congressional oversight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/09/senate-section/article/S6425-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MARK UDALL\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. I close with just a word about our friend and colleague \nSenator Mark Udall of Colorado. I have had the pleasure of serving with \nSenator Udall on the Intelligence Committee and have admired his \ncommitment to American security and core American values. Many in the \nSenate would not know this because all of those intelligence meetings \nare behind closed doors, but Mark Udall is not a Senator who is afraid \nto stand alone. He is not afraid to fight for what he believes in. When \nthe fight to declassify this report got bumpy--and let me tell you it \ndid a lot of times. I think some of you heard this weekend we had an \neleventh-hour objection to the report getting out. People asked me what \nI thought, and I said it was not particularly surprising because there \nwere objections practically every hour on the hour for months and \nmonths. Yet when the fight to declassify the report got very difficult, \nsome people said: This is going to get buried forever. That is what \nhappens when you try to get accountability and transparency. Senator \nMark Udall made it clear that wasn't going to be allowed to happen on \nMark Udall's watch.\n  I am going to wrap up by saying to Senator Udall, I remember when we \nstarted this battle together and we got a handful of votes, sometimes \nlike 13 to 2 or whatever. We thought it was going to be a long time \nbefore there was reform. We went from those days to eventually getting \nup to 15 or 20 votes. Colleagues, today, to a great extent because of \nSenator Udall, in the last vote for real surveillance reform, we were \nup to 58 votes--58 votes for real surveillance reform. That, to a great \nextent, is possible because of the extraordinary service of my good \nfriend Senator Mark Udall from Colorado. We westerners always make sure \nwe stay in touch, and you know that is going to be the case with this \nparticular friend from the West, a wonderful Senator, Mr. Mark Udall.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today is a historic day, as \nSenator Wyden made clear, Senator Feinstein, Senator Rockefeller, and \nmany other Senators to follow.\n  Before I talk about my involvement in the efforts that were put forth \nto reach this day, I want to say to Senator Wyden, my good friend, you \nhonor me with those comments. I want to acknowledge that when you are \nin a fight, it matters whom you are in the fight with. It has been my \nprivilege and honor to fight on the side of transparency, on the side \nof protecting the Bill of Rights, and this has been a righteous cause. \nWe are going to continue to work to find the right balance between \nprivacy and security. As Ben Franklin famously implied, we can have \nboth, but we don't end up with both if we set aside the Bill of Rights \nand those fundamental principles that are enshrined into the Bill of \nRights. It has been my privilege to fight alongside you, and I wish you \nall the best. Yes, we westerners will stay in touch.\n  Turning back to the matter at hand, today, almost 6 years after the \nSenate Intelligence Committee voted to conduct a study of the CIA's \ndetention and interrogation program and nearly 2 years after approving \nthe report, the American people will finally know the truth about a \nvery dark chapter in our Nation's history.\n  I had two goals at the beginning of this long process, and I still \nhold those two goals today. First, I have been committed to correcting \nthe public record on the CIA's multiple misrepresentations to the \nAmerican people, to other agencies, the executive branch, the White \nHouse, and to Congress.\n  Second, my goal has been to ensure that the truth comes out about the \nterrible acts committed in the name of the American people. Why? \nBecause I want this to be our way of going forward, that neither the \nCIA nor any future administration repeats the grievous mistakes this \nimportant oversight work reveals.\n  This has been a careful and very deliberative process. We have \ncompiled, drafted, redacted, and now released this report. It has been \nmuch harder than it needed to be. Senator Wyden and many others pointed \nit out.\n  It brings no joy to discuss the CIA's brutal and appalling use of \ntorture or the unprecedented actions that some in the intelligence \ncommunity and the administration have taken in order to cover up the \ntruth. By releasing the Intelligence Committee's landmark report, we \naffirm that we are a nation that does not hide from its past but learns \nfrom it. An honest examination of our shortcomings is not a sign of \nweakness but of the strength of our great Republic.\n  We have made significant progress since the CIA first delivered its \nheavily--underline ``heavily''--redacted version of the executive \nsummary to the committee in August. The report we released today cuts \nthrough the fog the CIA's redactions created and will give the American \npeople a candid, brutal, and coherent account of the CIA's torture \nprogram.\n  As the chairman said earlier today, even when public tensions were \nhigh, our committee continued to work behind the scenes to successfully \nwhittle down 400 instances of unnecessary redactions to just a few. We \ndidn't make all the progress we wanted, and the redaction process was \nfilled with unwarranted and completely unnecessary obstacles, but all \ntold, after reviewing the final version, I believe our landmark report \naccomplishes the goals I laid out at the outset and tells the story \nthat needs to be told. It also represents a significant and essential \nstep toward restoring faith in the crucial role of Congress to conduct \noversight of the intelligence community. Congressional oversight is \nimportant to all of government's activities, but it\n\n[[Page S6426]]\n\nis especially important to those parts of government that operate in \nsecret, as the Church committee discovered decades ago.\n  The challenges the Church committee confronted four decades ago \npersists today--namely, how to ensure that those government actions \nwhich are necessarily conducted in secret are nonetheless conducted \nwithin the confines of the law.\n  The release of this executive summary is testament to the power of \neffective oversight and the determination of Chairman Feinstein and \nmembers of the committee to doggedly beat back obstacle after obstacle \nin order to reveal the truth to the American people. I have much more \nto say about these obstacles and about the critical importance of \nreforming an agency that refuses to even acknowledge what it has done. \nI will deliver those remarks soon. For now, I wish to congratulate the \nchairman and her staff on this very important achievement.\n  The document we are finally releasing today is the definitive history \nof what happened in the CIA's detention and interrogation program. We \nhave always been a forward-looking nation, but to be so, we must be \nmindful of our own history. That is what this study is all about. That \nis why I have no doubt that we will emerge from this dark episode with \nour democracy strengthened and our future made even brighter.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I see the distinguished senior Senator from Texas on the \nfloor seeking recognition. I have been told to come here at 3:30 p.m., \nbut obviously I yield to my friend from Texas and ask unanimous consent \nthat when he completes his remarks I be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank my friend from Vermont. All of this got pushed \nback a little bit with the laudatory speeches for our retiring \ncolleague from Nebraska. We are backed up a little bit, but I won't be \nlong.\n  I have to say that I came to the floor when the Senators from Oregon \nand Colorado were talking about Senator Feinstein's decision to release \nthis report. I get it that different people see the same subject matter \nsometimes through a different lens, but I can't think of any more \nreckless or irresponsible thing to do to our brave men and women who \nfight in our military, who have fought our wars for the last 13 years, \nand the intelligence community that has worked while risking their \nlives to keep us safe.\n  We all remember what happened on 9/11/2001, but apparently with time \nour memories have faded. What we do know for a fact is we would not \nhave avoided another attack on our own soil if it were not for the \ndedication and the patriotism of men and women in our intelligence \ncommunity who were operating under color of law. In other words, this \nisn't just something they decided to cook up; this was something that \nwas vetted at the highest levels of the Justice Department and the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  We had hearing upon hearing on these various enhanced interrogation \ntechniques. There were disagreements, but we do know they were \neffective in gleaning intelligence that helped keep Americans safer. \nThat is not just me saying that. Ask Leon Panetta, the immediate past \nDirector of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Defense--a proud Democrat but also a patriot in his own \nright. Ask John Brennan, President Obama's choice to be the current CIA \nDirector. He said virtually the same thing.\n  So much of this should have proven to be unnecessary after two \nseparate U.S. attorneys conducted criminal investigations. There was \none done earlier and then one done later when Attorney General Eric \nHolder reopened the investigation. These men and women who risk their \nlives to do what their government asks them to do to keep us safe were \nsubjected to at least two Justice Department investigations, and \nobviously no decision to proceed with any kind of criminal charges was \ndecided upon.\n  I think you have to wonder about the timing of this in a lameduck \nsession where we have basically three items of business to do before we \nbreak for the Christmas holidays and a new Congress. It is clear that \nthis report was pushed out in an attempt to make a political statement, \nbut I have to tell you that I think it is a reckless act, and it is a \ndisservice not only to the men and women who risked their lives but \nalso to the American people who should expect more of us.\n  This was not a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report. Once \nRepublicans on the Senate Intelligence Committee figured out what was \nhappening, they simply disassociated themselves from it. This is purely \na partisan report. There are absolutely no recommendations made for any \nreforms in this report. It was simply done to embarrass and to hold up \nour brave men and women who serve our country and the intelligence \ncommunity to ridicule, and it is a shame.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/09/senate-section/article/S6426-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6426-S6427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO RALPH HALL\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. I came to the floor to talk about another topic, and that \nis about my friend and fellow Texan Congressman Ralph Hall, who at the \nend of this year will be retiring from representing Texas's Fourth \nDistrict in the House of Representatives for more than three decades. \nIt is hard to speak to the entirety of Ralph's 34 years in Congress in \njust a few minutes. I will try. I would be remiss if I didn't mention \nsome of his greatest hits, so to speak.\n  Let me begin with what I admire most about Ralph Hall and why he is \nso beloved back home in Texas. Why would they return him election after \nelection over these many years?\n  First, Ralph is someone whom a lot of Texans look up to as a role \nmodel. He is a happy warrior. Having proudly served this country and \nTexas for over 50 years, he is a man of extraordinary character and \nremarkable integrity.\n  Thinking about Ralph, the first thing that comes to mind is his \nservice to others, from his military service to being the oldest and \namong the longest serving Members of Congress. Ralph has lived a life \nof service to others and leaves behind a considerable legacy--one that \nwill be long remembered and celebrated by people in my State and I \nbelieve the people of the United States too.\n  Those who know Ralph know he is the man who, wherever he goes--\nwhether it is back home or here in Washington--before leaving a room, \nhe will have hugged or shaken the hand of every person in the room, not \nto mention telling a few bad jokes and leaving everybody laughing in \nthe process. He is a man who truly cares about others, and that is \nevident by the way he arranged his desk in his Washington office. He \nsaid one of his favorite things about his office is the view. Even so, \nhe arranged his desk with his back to the window so others could sit \nand enjoy the view. This speaks to the kind of man he is, always \nputting other people first.\n  As I said, he is also well known for his excellent sense of humor and \nan occasional bad joke. He is a great storyteller and raconteur. He \ndoes have some pretty good stories to tell, though, from selling \ncigarettes to the famous outlaws Bonnie and Clyde, to putting President \nReagan on hold, to his interesting encounters and friendships with \nMickey Mantle, Muhammad Ali, Ted Williams, Neil Armstrong, John Glenn, \namong others. There are his many stories about flying Hellcat fighter \naircraft in the U.S. Army during World War II.\n  Ralph has led a full and exciting life. During his time in Congress, \nhe has not just been the hometown Congressman from Rockwall, TX; he has \nbeen the hometown Congressman to everyone he has encountered. It \ndoesn't matter who you are--Ralph just naturally wants to try to find \nout how he can be helpful to you, from the person he met on the street, \nto the colleagues in the Texas delegation, to the President of the \nUnited States. That is just the way he is.\n  Knowing Ralph, he probably has something up his sleeve that he is not \ntelling us about what he is going to do after he leaves Congress next \nmonth. In fact, when asked about his plans after leaving Congress, \nRalph mentioned he would probably go to work at Walmart because he has \nto have a job.\n  Ralph has always got to have something to do. But it goes to show \nthat no matter what he does next, he will not be slowing down anytime \nsoon.\n\n[[Page S6427]]\n\n  Ralph Hall will be greatly missed in this Congress. I am privileged \nto call him a colleague and a friend. I would like to wish him Godspeed \nand all the best as he continues to recover from a recent car accident \nat home in Rockwall. I look forward to seeing what he accomplishes in \nthe next chapter of his long and storied life.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I listened with interest to the tremendous \nstatement made by the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, earlier \ntoday. She has spoken of this issue on other occasions, and we \nAmericans should listen.\n  More than a decade ago the Central Intelligence Agency began \ndetaining and torturing human beings in the name of the war on \nterrorism. Then employees and contractors of the U.S. Government, paid \nfor by our taxpayers' dollars, abused and degraded, dehumanized people. \nThey stripped them of their basic humanity. But more than stripping \nthem of their basic humanity, they stripped America of its standing in \nthe world as the leader of promoting and protecting human rights. \nInstead of protecting us as Americans, by their actions they hurt all \nAmericans.\n  President Obama banned torture and cruel treatment when he took \noffice, but only now, because of the courage and conviction of Senator \nFeinstein and the other members of the Intelligence Committee and their \nstaffs, do we have a full and public accounting of the CIA's actions--\nan accounting the American people deserve.\n  The decision to release this historic report, as Senator Feinstein \nhas courageously said, has been difficult, but it was the right and \nmoral thing to do. If something is right and something is moral, no \nmatter how difficult it is, you should do it. Releasing the report \ndemonstrates that America--the America I love--is different. As \nAmericans, we cannot sweep our mistakes under the rug and pretend they \ndid not happen. We have to acknowledge our mistakes. We have to learn \nfrom our mistakes. In this case, we as Americans must and will do \neverything we can to ensure that our government never tortures again.\n  Five years ago, in 2009, I called for a commission of inquiry to \nreview the Bush administration's detention and interrogation program \nand other sweeping claims of executive power by the Bush \nadministration. I believe that in order to restore America's moral \nleadership, we have to acknowledge what happened in our name because \nmuch of the leadership we can show around the world is not based on our \nwealth or on the power of our military but on our moral leadership. Our \nNation needed back then a full accounting of the CIA's treatment of \ndetainees, and we need it today. With this report, at long last we have \nit.\n  This is not the first report to record or condemn the detention and \ninterrogation policies and practices that were used during the last \nadministration, but it is the first to fully chronicle the actions of \nthe most secretive of our government agencies, the Central Intelligence \nAgency. The final report lays bare the dark truth about their program. \nThat truth is far worse and it is far more brutal than most Americans \never imagined.\n  We have all seen the shocking pictures from Abu Ghraib. We have read \nthe cold, clinical description of ``harsh'' or ``enhanced'' techniques \nwritten by Department of Justice attorneys to justify such treatment. \nWe know that what was done at Abu Ghraib terribly diminished the image \nof the United States throughout the world. It did not make us safer by \none iota. In fact, many would argue it made us less safe.\n  The report makes clear one fundamental truth: The CIA tortured \npeople. That is the bottom line. No euphemistic description or legal \nobfuscation or pettifoggery can hide that fact any longer. The \nIntelligence Committee report shows that techniques such as \nwaterboarding and sleep deprivation were used in ways far more frequent \nand cruel and harmful than previously known. It shows that gross \nmismanagement by those in charge at the CIA and a shocking indifference \nto human dignity led to horrendous treatment and conditions of \nconfinement that went far beyond even what they had been approving. It \nturns out that the senior CIA leadership did not even know that \n``enhanced'' techniques were being used at one CIA detention facility. \nIn fact, in one instance, one of their prisoners died as a result, left \nshackled on a concrete floor in a dungeon room, and likely died of \nhypothermia.\n  This is America? This is what we stand for? This is the image we want \nto give the rest of the world? This American does not think so. This \nAmerican does not think so. It is not what brought my grandparents and \ngreat-grandparents to this country.\n  These so-called ``enhanced'' interrogation techniques were not just \nused on the worst of the worst either. In some instances, the CIA did \nnot even know whom it was holding. CIA records show that at least 26 \npeople detained by the CIA did not meet the CIA's own standard for \ndetention. Some of these individuals were subjected to--and this is a \nwonderful slogan--``enhanced'' techniques. What an evil slogan. Some \ndetainees were determined not even to be members of Al Qaeda.\n\n  Moreover, the CIA relied on contractors--not even CIA personnel but \ncontractors--who had no experience as interrogators to develop this \nprogram. They were happy to take American taxpayers' money. They did \nnot know what they were doing, but they said: Give us the money. \nEventually the CIA outsourced all aspects of the program to the company \nthese contractors set up. Did they make a few thousand dollars? No. \nThey made $80 million. This was a program out of control. It is yet \nanother reason why Congress has to exercise its oversight \nresponsibility.\n  The report also disproves CIA claims that torture programs were \nnecessary to protect our Nation, and that it thwarted attacks. How many \ntimes have we heard it before--that we need this to protect us; we need \nthis to protect us from another 9/11? We had all of the evidence we \nneeded to stop 9/11, but the government had not even bothered to \ntranslate some of the material that our intelligence people had already \nobtained. After the fact, they decided: We should really translate some \nof that material we have. Then we found it could have been stopped.\n  This program of torture did not make us safer. As laid out in \nmeticulous detail in the report, the use of these techniques did not \ngenerate uniquely valuable intelligence. In fact, the report thoroughly \nrepudiates each of the most commonly cited examples of plots thwarted \nand terrorists captured. That should not come as a surprise.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee held numerous hearings on the Bush \nadministration's interrogation policies and practices. What we heard \ntime and again from witness after witness is that torture and other \ncruel treatments do not work. But there are still some who continue to \nargue, even in the face of overwhelming testimony and actually now hard \nevidence to the contrary, that the program thwarted attacks and saved \nlives. They defend the CIA's action. They argue that the report does \nnot tell the full story. But these are often the same people who \nparticipated in the rampant misrepresentations detailed in this report.\n  The report shows that CIA officials consistently misled virtually \neveryone outside the Agency about what was actually going on and about \nthe results of the CIA interrogations--very similar to what we heard \nleading up to the war in Iraq after 9/11. I remember being in those \nhearings. I remember listening to the then-Vice President. I remember \nlistening to others in those secret hearings and thinking: It does not \nring true. I stated to others that I thought some of the things they \nwere telling us did not ring true.\n  I remember walking early one morning with my wife near our home and \ntwo joggers coming up, calling us by name. These were people we had \nnever seen before in the neighborhood.\n  One of them said, ``I hear you have some questions.'' He asked \nwhether I had asked to see a particular document.\n  I said, ``I haven't. I didn't know there was such a thing.''\n  He said, ``You might find it interesting to read.''\n\n[[Page S6428]]\n\n  So I did. Then I raised even more questions about what I read there, \nwhich totally contradicted what the Vice President and others were \nsaying. I mentioned that to some.\n  A few days later we are out walking again. Both joggers--my wife \nremembers this so well--they said, ``I see you read the document.''\n  I said, ``I did.''\n  ``But did they tell you about this other document?''\n  I said, ``I didn't know there was such a document.''\n  ``You may find it interesting.''\n  And so I then reviewed it. It was obvious from what I read that they \nwere withholding evidence that Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with 9/\n11, contrary to what the Vice President and others were saying; that \nthere were no weapons of mass destruction; and that in fact, they were \nactually well penned in by the no-fly zone we had set up. But instead \nwe rushed into war because we sought to avenge 9/11, even though they \nhad nothing to do with \n9/11. Now almost $3 trillion later, look at the mess we are in.\n  The report released today details how, like the run-up to the war in \nIraq, material that was held back from people who should have seen it. \nThis included Members of Congress, White House officials, even Justice \nDepartment lawyers who were being asked to review the legality of CIA \ntechniques.\n  In the coming weeks, as we go into the new Congress, we are going to \nhear a lot about the need for oversight. I would hope the new \nleadership would look at the report Senator Feinstein and her committee \nhave come out with, because this is where oversight should be--at the \ntop of the list. So too should the unprecedented spying by the CIA on \nthe congressional staff investigating this program. Just think about \nthat. They investigated Members of Congress who were asking them about \nthings they had done wrong. Then there is also the troubling pattern of \nintimidation, which includes the CIA referring its own congressional \noverseers to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. My God, \nwe are going back to the Joseph McCarthy days with things like this. \nThis report and those actions show a CIA out of control. It is \nincumbent upon all of us--Republicans and Democrats alike--in the \nCongress to hold the Agency accountable.\n  The Judiciary Committee should take a hard look at the role of the \nDepartment of Justice and its legal justifications for this program. \nMuch ink has been spilled criticizing the OLC opinion written during \nthe Bush administration by John Yoo, Jay Bybee, and Stephen Bradbury. \nThe OLC has always had a good reputation, but these opinions sullied \nthe reputation of that office, and they have been rightly repudiated. \nBut the report also demonstrates that even those opinions were the \nresult of key misrepresentations by the CIA about the seniority of the \npeople subjected to these techniques, the implementation of the \ntechniques, and the intelligence resulting from them.\n  As an institution, if we truly represent 325 million Americans, do we \nnot have a responsibility to examine the systemic failure that allowed \nthis to happen and then to ensure that it does not happen again?\n  Those who attack the credibility of this report are wrong. This \nreport is not based on conjecture or theory or insinuation. Anyone who \nreads it can see that this careful, thorough report was meticulously \nresearched and written. It is based on more than 6 million pages of CIA \ncables, emails, and other documents containing descriptions that CIA \nemployees and contractors themselves recorded.\n  I believe Senator Feinstein and the other members of the Intelligence \nCommittee who worked on this deserve our respect and our appreciation.\n  Intelligence Committee staffers, too, have dedicated years of their \nlives to this report. They have demonstrated courage and dedication in \nthe face of enormous challenges, because they thought first and \nforemost about the United States of America.\n  In the past year they were even threatened with criminal prosecution. \nWhy? For doing the job they are supposed to do for the United States of \nAmerica. But they would not allow themselves to be intimidated. They \nhave served their country well, and they have my deepest appreciation \nfor bringing us this truly historic study.\n  I thank their families, because they couldn't tell their families the \nthings they were reading. I imagine the families knew of some of these \nattacks on them. Their families too deserve our thanks.\n  I am disappointed that those same honorable staffers had to spend so \nmany months arguing with this White House about redactions to this \nreport--a White House that is supposed to be dedicated to transparency. \nThis report should have been issued months ago, and it still contains \nmore redactions than it should. I can think of some who will wonder why \nthe redactions are there, but I am gratified that we can finally shed \nlight on this dark chapter.\n  Among the many lessons we can take from this report is that Americans \ndeserve more government transparency, and that is essential to a strong \ndemocracy. Just yesterday the Senate unanimously passed a bipartisan \nbill, the Leahy-Cornyn FOIA Improvement Act. It significantly improves \nthe Freedom of Information Act. Today's release of this report is \nanother important victory for greater government transparency.\n  I strongly disagree with those who argue that the reports should not \ncome out and who have tried to pressure and silence Senator Feinstein. \nDon't place the blame on those who are telling the truth. Place the \nblame squarely where it belongs: on those who authorized and carried \nout a systematic program of torture and secret detention, which is in \nviolation of domestic law, and in violation of international law. But \nmore importantly it is in violation of the fundamental principles of \nmorality on which our great Nation was founded.\n  In trying times, such as those we faced after September 11 and those \nwe face now, we look to our intelligence, military, and law enforcement \nprofessionals to keep us safe. We are fortunate to have so many \ndedicated and talented people serving in the intelligence community, \nmilitary, and law enforcement. But one lesson for their sake, our sake, \nand our country's sake, is that we should never become so blinded by \nfear that we are willing to sacrifice our own principles, laws, and \nhumanity.\n  We are the greatest, most powerful Nation on Earth. We cannot turn \nour backs on our laws, our history, and our Constitution because we are \nafraid. This Senator is not afraid.\n  No matter what, our enemies are human beings. And no matter how \nhardened and evil they are, no matter how repulsive their actions--and \nmany are--no matter how horribly they have treated their own victims, \nwe do not torture them--because we don't join them on that dark side of \nhistory. We stand on the other side of history as Americans. \nGenerations of men and women have given their lives and many have even \nendured torture themselves in order to protect this Nation. They did so \nnot to protect our way of life, but to protect our principles, our \nunderstanding of right and wrong, of humanity, of evil.\n  The shameful actions uncovered by this report dishonored those men \nand women who have fought to protect what is the best of our Nation, as \nwell as the men and women even today who continue to put their lives at \nrisk for this country.\n  Americans know, throughout this country, that we are better than \nthis. As we heard after Abu Ghraib and we will hear now, we are better \nthan this and we should never let this happen again. Let's show the \nrest of the world, too.\n  I have spoken much longer than I normally do, but this is important \nto me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I also want to address the report that was \nreleased this morning by the Chair of the Intelligence Committee. I \ncome at this in a slightly different way than some of my colleagues, \nbecause I came to this process late.\n  I joined the Intelligence Committee in January of 2013. By that time \nthe report had been authorized, had been written, and actually had been \nfinalized. So I came to it as a final product and the decision was \nwhether it should be released.\n  Before talking about the report, there are two very important points \nthat should be made.\n\n[[Page S6429]]\n\n  No. 1, one of my problems with this discussion is that everybody \ntalks about the CIA. The CIA did this, the CIA did that. The fact is \nthe CIA as an institution doesn't do anything. People do things.\n  I have been around the world and met with CIA people in many \ncountries. I have met with them here. They are patriotic, they are \ndedicated, they are smart, and they are brave. The problem with this \nsituation is their reputation has been sullied by a relatively small \ngroup of people early in the prior decade.\n  So I want to make clear, at least as far as I am concerned, this is \nnot an attempt to discredit or otherwise undermine the CIA or the good \npeople who are there, but to point out that mistakes were made.\n  No. 2, I think we need to acknowledge that those were extraordinary \ntimes, the year or so after September 11. We thought there was going to \nbe another attack. There was a lot of pressure to uncover that \ninformation. It is easy, 10 years later, to look back and say: Well, we \nshouldn't have done this or we shouldn't have done that. I understand \nthat. We have to acknowledge that. However, those circumstances cannot \njustify a basic violation of who we are as Americans and what our \nvalues are.\n  The process is the report was completed and accepted by the committee \non a bipartisan basis. My predecessor, Olympia Snowe, voted in favor of \nthe acceptance of the report in December of 2012.\n  It was then sent to the CIA. They responded, a rather full response. \nIt took about 6 months, and then they submitted their response to the \ncommittee.\n  I knew the vote was going to be coming up last spring as to whether \nto release the report. I went to the secure site in one of our \nbuildings and sat down every night for a week and read this executive \nsummary, every single word--all 500 pages, all of the footnotes--and \nmade my own judgment as one who was in no way invested in this report. \nHere are the conclusions I reached. I must say, until I sat and read \nit, I didn't fully comprehend what this issue was, why we needed this \nlarge report, why we needed to do this study. After reading it, I was \nshaken and convinced that the report was important and should be \nreleased.\n  Basically, it has four conclusions. I am not going to go through them \nin detail, but No. 1 was: We committed torture. I am not going to argue \nthat. I would say, as I said repeatedly, read the report. No person can \nread the description of what was done in our name and not conclude that \nit was way outside the values of our country and constituted torture by \nany definition.\n  No. 2, it was terribly managed. That is not a very exciting point \nabout management, but nobody was in charge. Contractors were actually \ndesigning the program and assessing whether it was successful--the \npeople who had designed it and were implementing it. There was no \ncentral place at the CIA that managed it, so that was a problem.\n  No. 3--and this we are going to talk about for a few minutes--it was \nnot effective. The guts of this report are an analysis of the 20 \nprincipal cases the CIA presented as justification for the torture to \nsay that it worked, that it led to intelligence that was reliable and \ncurrent, and the report goes through in excruciating detail looking at \neach one of those allegations.\n  It basically finds that the information was either already available, \nit was available in our hands, it was available in other ways, and the \nwitnesses had given up the data prior to their being subjected to these \nextraordinary measures. I am going to talk, as I mentioned, in a couple \nof minutes about this issue of effectiveness.\n  I should have said this at the beginning. My poor words can't \ncontribute a great deal to this debate, but the speech Senator John \nMcCain made on this floor this morning should be required viewing for \nevery schoolchild in America, every Member of this body, every Member \nof this Congress, and every American. He spoke eloquently about the \nviolation of our ideals of this program and the fact that it cannot, \nwill not, and could not work.\n  The final point we take from the report is this program was \ncontinually misrepresented. It was misrepresented to the President, it \nwas misrepresented to the Justice Department, it was misrepresented to \nthe Congress, and it was misrepresented to the Intelligence Committee.\n\n  The problem is that continues today. In the past few days we have \nseen an outburst of statements, speeches, and interviews on television \nsaying it was effective. It wasn't effective, and the report makes that \nclear.\n  There is a semantic sleight of hand going on, and I have already seen \nit in two or three interviews on television where people slide from the \nreport and they say: The program of detention of people whom we \ncaptured after September 11 was effective in generating intelligence.\n  Absolutely true. There is no doubt of that. People were detained, \nthey were interrogated, they gave good intelligence, it taught us what \nwe know about Al Qaeda, and it was very helpful to the country in \npreventing future plots.\n  The question for the House, though, is was the torture effective? If \nyou have somebody in custody, they give up good information, and then \nlater you torture them and they don't give you anymore information, the \ntorture didn't create that information or that intelligence. The \nquestion is did the extraordinary methods create additional evidence.\n  People should cock their ears when they hear people say the program \ncreated this good intelligence. It did. But the program is not what we \nare talking about today. We are talking about so-called enhanced \ninterrogation techniques.\n  I would suggest when people come up with a euphemism such as enhanced \ninterrogation techniques, that should tip us off that something is \ngoing on that we should be concerned about.\n  I wrestled with this decision. It was not easy. There is risk \ninvolved. There has been a lot of commentary today. Our people are on \nalert. Will someone attack us because of this report?\n  I can't deny that risk. I think it is impossible to say. But we have \nalready learned that these people will attack us for any or no reason. \nThey have been trying to attack us for 10 years. That is their reason \nfor existing.\n  ISIL has beheaded Americans, not because of this report, but because \nthat is their agenda. Now they may issue a press release or a YouTube \nvideo and say we are doing this because of the report, but I would \nsubmit they are going to do it anyway.\n  What they are going to cite--it is not the report, it is what we did \nthat has inflamed opposition around the world, and it has done so for \nmany years already.\n  Finally, on the question of the risk, when the terrible activities at \nAbu Ghraib came to the attention of the Congress, we did a report. The \nArmed Services Committee did a study and issued a report in grisly \ndetail of what was done, and at that point we had 100,000 troops in \nIraq. If ever there was a report that would have inflamed public \nopinion in a foreign country and generated retribution against us, it \nwas that. We cannot be intimidated by people who tell us that we cannot \nexercise and be true to our own ideals.\n  But if there is any risk, why should we do it? Because these actions \nare so alien to our values, they are so alien to our principles that we \nsimply can't countenance them.\n  By the way, if this wasn't torture, if this wasn't a problem, why did \nthe CIA destroy the tapes of one of these interrogations? That is what \nstarted all of this, when the Senate learned they had destroyed tapes. \nIf they thought this was not torture--which is what they were telling \nus--then why are they destroying the tapes? That is what began this \nprocess.\n  To me, one of the most telling quotes in the whole report was a back-\nand-forth between the CIA and I think the White House--but I think it \nwas within the CIA where the statement was made: ``Whatever you do, \ndon't let Colin Powell find out about this, he'll blow his stack.'' Now \nthat tells me they knew they were doing something that wasn't \nacceptable to our country and to the American people. But the second \nreason to release this report is the key: so it will never happen \nagain. That is the whole deal here.\n\n  The campaign of the last few days of people saying it worked and it \nwasn't torture and you shouldn't do it because\n\n[[Page S6430]]\n\nof the risk--that, to me, validates my concern because these people are \nessentially saying: We would do it again if we had the chance. And the \nonly thing standing between them and doing it again is an Executive \norder signed by this President in January of 2009, which could be wiped \nout in the first week of a new Presidency or in the first month of a \nnew Presidency. We cannot have this happen again.\n  The oratory is that it works. I have a letter, which I will submit \nfor the Record, from 20 former terrorist interrogators--Army, Air \nForce, CIA, FBI--saying these kinds of tactics don't work and, in fact, \nthey produce bad intelligence. There is an article in Politico today by \nMark Fallen, who is a 30-year interrogator, saying it doesn't work.\n  We have to have this discussion and lay that to rest because the \npeople who are saying it works are really saying: And we will do it \nagain if we have to. And that is not who we are as people.\n  Interestingly, in the CIA's response to the report--all during the \nearly part of this past decade the argument was--and we are hearing it \ntoday--it works. We are certain it works. We got valuable intelligence. \nWe got Osama bin Laden.\n  The CIA is not saying that today. When they submitted their response \nto the committee's report, what they said about effectiveness was that \nit is unknowable whether it was effective. I believe the migration from \nthe certainty they gave to Members of Congress and the President and \nthe Department of Justice--the migration from ``certainty'' to \n``unknowable'' speaks volumes because they couldn't refute the facts \nthat are in this report.\n  If this idea that this kind of interrogation works becomes \nconventional wisdom, it will definitely happen again.\n  I go back in conclusion to John McCain's statement this morning. I \ncan't match his eloquence. It was one of the most powerful messages I \nhave ever heard in this body or anywhere else. He talked about who we \nare as Americans, and he also talked from personal experience about \nwhat torture will do and whether it will produce good information, and \nI would submit that John McCain knows more about that particular \nsubject than all the rest of us in this body put together.\n  I got a critical note from a friend in Maine this morning that said \n``You know, you are naive'' and all those kinds of things. I just wrote \nhim back and said, ``Don't take it from me; watch what John McCain had \nto say.''\n  We are exceptional, but we are not exceptional because of natural \nresources or because we are smarter and better looking than anybody \nelse; we are exceptional because of our values. We are one of the few \ncountries in the world that was founded on explicit values and ideals \nand principles. And principles aren't something you discard when times \nget tough. That is when they are important. That is like saying: I am \nin favor of free press unless somebody says something offensive. These \nare principles that make us distinct and different.\n  I believe this debate is about the soul of America. It is about who \nwe want to be as a people. It is a hard debate. It is difficult. It is \nhard to talk about these things. This was a dark period. But I believe \nthat having this discussion, having this debate, getting this \ninformation out--and by the way, all the information is going to be \nout: the report; the CIA's response was made public today; the minority \nhad their own statement that is quite substantial. So the public is \ngoing to be able to look at all this information and make their own \ndecisions. I looked at the information, and the decision I made was \nthat this is important information the people of America are entitled \nto, they should understand, and we should move forward consistent with \nour ideals and our principles as a nation and see that something like \nthis never happens again.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter I referred to earlier.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 February 4, 2014.\n     Hon. Angus King,\n     U.S. Senate, 359 Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator King: We write to you as current and former \n     professional interrogators, interviewers, and intelligence \n     officials regarding the Senate Select Committee on \n     Intelligence's (SSCI) 6000-plus page study of the CIA's post-\n     9/11 rendition, detention, and interrogation program. We \n     understand that the SSCI may soon take up the issue of \n     whether to pursue declassification and public release of the \n     study. In the interest of transparency and furthering an \n     understanding of effective interrogation policy, we urge you \n     to support declassification and release of as much of the \n     study as possible, with only such redactions as are necessary \n     to protect national security.\n       Since the CIA program was established over a decade ago, \n     there has been substantial public interest in, and discussion \n     of, the fundamental efficacy of the so-called ``enhanced \n     interrogation techniques'' (EITs). Despite the employment of \n     these methods, critical questions remain unanswered as to \n     whether EITs are an appropriate, lawful, or effective means \n     of consistently eliciting accurate, timely, and comprehensive \n     intelligence from individuals held in custody. Based on our \n     experience, torture and other forms of abusive or coercive \n     techniques are more likely to generate unreliable information \n     and have repeatedly proven to be counterproductive as a means \n     of securing the enduring cooperation of a detained \n     individual. They increase the likelihood of receiving false \n     or misleading information, undermine this nation's ability to \n     work with key international partners, and bolster the \n     recruiting narratives of terrorist groups.\n       We would like to emphasize that this view is further \n     supported by relevant studies in the behavioral sciences and \n     publicly available evidence, which show that coercive \n     interrogation methods can substantially disrupt a subject's \n     ability to accurately recall and convey information, cause a \n     subject to emotionally and psychologically ``shut down,'' \n     produce the circumstances where resistance is increased, or \n     create incentives for a subject to provide false information \n     to lessen the experience of pain, suffering, or anxiety.\n       Despite this body of evidence, some former government \n     officials who authorized the CIA's so-called ``enhanced \n     interrogation'' program after 9/11 claim that it produced a \n     significant and sustained stream of accurate and reliable \n     intelligence that helped disrupt terrorist plots, save \n     American lives, and even locate Osama Bin Laden. While some \n     of the particular claimed successes of the program have been \n     disproven based on publicly available information, the \n     broader claim that the EIT program was necessary to disrupt \n     terrorist plots and save American lives is based on \n     classified information unavailable to the public.\n       The SSCI study--based on a review of more than 6 million \n     pages of official records--provides an important opportunity \n     to shed light on these important questions. We understand \n     that the SSCI minority and CIA have separate views regarding \n     the meaning and significance of the official documentary \n     record. Those views are important and should also be made \n     public so that the American people have an opportunity to \n     decide for themselves whether the CIA program was ultimately \n     worth it.\n       It is beyond time for this critical issue of national \n     importance to be driven by facts--not rhetoric or partisan \n     interest. We therefore urge you to vote in favor of \n     declassifying and releasing the SSCI study on the CIA's post-\n     9/11 interrogation program.\n           Sincerely,\n         Tony Camerino, Glenn Carle, James T. Clemente, Jack \n           Cloonan, Gerry Downes, Mark Fallon, Brigadier General \n           David R. Irvine, USA (Ret.), Steven Kleinman, Marcus \n           Lewis, Mike Marks, Robert McFadden, Charles Mink, Joe \n           Navarro, Torin Nelson, Erik Phillips, William Quinn, \n           Buck Revell, Mark Safarik, Haviland Smith, Lieutenant \n           General Harry E. Soyster (Ret.).\n\n  Mr. KING. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nLevin be permitted to follow my remarks and speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, torture is wrong, it is un-American, and \nit doesn't work. Recognizing these important realities, the President \nsigned an Executive order in January of 2009 that limited \ninterrogations by any American personnel to the guidelines that are in \nthe Army Field Manual, and he reinforced U.S. commitment to the Geneva \nConventions. This closed the book on the Bush administration's \ninterrogation program. But make no mistake--these weren't enhanced \ninterrogations. This was torture. I would challenge anyone to read this \nreport and not be truly disturbed by some of these techniques.\n  Releasing the Intelligence Committee's study of the CIA's detention \nand interrogation program to the American people today will finally \nprovide a thorough accounting of what happened and how it happened. In \naddition, like my colleague and friend from Maine\n\n[[Page S6431]]\n\nwho spoke before me, I hope this process helps to ensure that it never \never happens again.\n  This was a grave chapter in our history, and the actions taken under \nthis program cost our Nation global credibility, and--let's be blunt--\nthey put American lives at risk. Some have suggested that releasing \nthis report could put American lives at risk. But let's be clear. It \nhas been the use of torture that has unnecessarily put Americans in \nharm's way.\n  There is no question that there will never be a good time to release \nthis study. We all know that for months, terrorists in the extremist \ngroup ISIS have been kidnapping and barbarically killing innocent \nAmericans because of what we as a nation stand for. The response to \ntheir threats and terrorism should not be for us to change our American \nvalues; it should be to stand firm in our values and work with our \nallies to root out extremism and terrorism in all its forms.\n  The release of this study will finally let us face what was done in \nthe name of the American people and allow for future generations to use \nthese findings to learn from the mistakes made by the architects of \nthis program. This is an objective, fact-based study. It is a fair \nstudy. And it is the only comprehensive study conducted of this program \nand the CIA's treatment of its detainees in the aftermath of the \nSeptember 11 attacks. Today marks an enormous, albeit painful, step \ninto our future.\n  It is important to know that these torture methods were the \nbrainchild of a few CIA officials and their contractors. When I joined \nthe Intelligence Committee two years ago, I began to read \nthe classified report and was surprised to learn this. Frankly, it was \nnot consistent with all of my assumptions. It wasn't what my prejudices \ntold me to expect. But that is exactly why a fact-based study is so \nimportant.\n\n  Furthermore, it is important to know that at every turn, CIA \nleadership avoided congressional oversight of these activities and, \neven worse, misled Congress. That leadership deliberately kept the vast \nmajority of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees in the dark on \nthe interrogation techniques until the day the President revealed the \ndetention and interrogation program to the rest of the world in 2006--4 \nyears after it began.\n  Even then, misrepresentations to the committee about the \neffectiveness of this program continued, in large part because the CIA \nhad never performed any comprehensive review of the effectiveness of \nthe interrogation techniques or the actions of its officers. Myths of \nthe effectiveness of torture have been repeated, perpetuating the fable \nthat this was a necessary program that somehow saved lives.\n  The committee examined the CIA's claims of plots thwarted and \ndetainees captured as a result of intelligence gained through torture. \nIn each and every case, the committee found that the intelligence was \nalready available from other sources or provided by the detainees \nthemselves before they were tortured.\n  However, we need to stop treating the issue of torture as one worthy \nof debate over its practical merits. This is about torture being \nimmoral, being un-American. Reducing a human being to a state of \ndespair through systematic subjugation, pain, and humiliation is \nunquestionably immoral. It should never happen again with the blessing \nof the Government of the United States of America.\n  As my colleague who spoke before me--Senator King of Maine--said so \nwell in an interview this morning, ``This is not America. This is not \nwho we are.'' I think that sums up how I view the revelations in that \nreport.\n  The information in the study released today to the public will \nfinally pull back the curtain on the terrible judgment that went into \ncreating and implementing this interrogation program.\n  The decision to use these techniques and the defense of the program \nwere the work of a relatively small number of people at the CIA. This \nstudy is in no way a condemnation of the thousands of patriotic men and \nwomen at this great Agency who work tirelessly every day to protect and \ndefend our Nation from very real and imminent threats using lawful \nmeasures; using effective measures. In fact, the insistence that so \nmany intelligence successes were the result of enhanced interrogations \nnegates and marginalizes the effective work done by thousands of other \nCIA officers not involved in these activities.\n  What this study does is show that multiple levels of government were \nmisled about the effectiveness of these techniques. If secretive \ngovernment agencies want to operate in a democracy, there must be trust \nand transparency with those who are tasked with the oversight of those \nagencies.\n  As the committee carries out future oversight, we will benefit from \nthe lessons in this study. I hope we never again let the challenges of \ndifficult times be used as an excuse to frustrate and defer oversight \nthe way it was in the early years described in this report.\n  Although President Obama ended the program by signing that Executive \norder in 2009, any future President could reverse it. It is worth \nremembering that years before this detention and interrogation program \neven began, the CIA had sworn off the harsh interrogations of its past. \nBut in the wake of the terrorist attacks against the United States, it \nrepeated those mistakes by once again engaging in brutal interrogations \nthat undermined our Nation's credibility on the issue of human rights, \nproduced information of dubious value, and wasted millions and millions \nof taxpayer dollars.\n  The public interest in this issue too often has centered on the \npersonalities involved and the political battle waged in the release of \nthis study, but those stories are reductive, and I hope they will soon \nbe forgotten. Because the story of what happened in this detention and \ninterrogation program--and how it happened--is too important, and it \nneeds to be fully understood so that future generations will not make \nthe same mistakes that our country made out of fear.\n\n  When America engages in these acts, with authorization from the \nhighest levels of government, we invite others to treat our citizens \nand our soldiers the same way. This study should serve as a warning to \nthose who would make similar choices in the future or argue about the \nefficacy of these techniques. Let us learn from the mistakes of the \npast, and let us never repeat these mistakes again.\n  Before I close, I wish to say how important it is to acknowledge that \nthe Intelligence Committee's study of the CIA's detention and \ninterrogation program represents many, many years of hard work by \nMembers and staff who faced incredible obstacles in completing their \nwork. The fact that this study is finished is a testament to their \ndedication, and it is a testament to the dedication and focus of \nChairman Rockefeller and Chairman Feinstein in deciding that oversight \nis our job, regardless of how long it takes.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the report released today by the \nIntelligence Committee is an important addition to the public's \nknowledge about the CIA's use of torture, euphemistically described by \nsome as ``enhanced interrogation techniques'' in the period following \nthe September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n  The use of these techniques was a failure, both moral and practical. \nThese tactics violated the values this Nation has long stood for, while \nadding little benefit to our security. As GEN David Petraeus and others \nhave pointed out, their use has placed U.S. personnel at greater risk \nof being tortured. They have tarnished America's standing in the world \nand undermined our moral authority to confront tyrants and torturers. I \nam glad this report will fully inform a public debate with facts that \nhave remained classified for too long, and I hope it ensures that our \nNation never again resorts to such brutal and misguided methods.\n  The report lays out clearly that, contrary to claims by former CIA \nand Bush administration officials, these techniques did not produce \nuniquely valuable intelligence that saved lives. The report examines 20 \nsuch specific representations that were used frequently by the CIA to \nmake the case to policymakers for continued use of abusive techniques. \nIn all 20 cases, the CIA's claims about the value of intelligence \ngathered through torture were inaccurate. At the same time the CIA\n\n[[Page S6432]]\n\nwas making false claims about the effectiveness of these techniques, it \nwas failing to mention that some detainees subjected to these \ntechniques provided false, fabricated information--information that led \nto time-consuming wild-goose chases.\n  This is not at all surprising when we consider the origin of these \nabusive interrogation techniques. In 2008 the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee produced a detailed investigative report into the treatment \nof detainees in military custody. That report traced the path of \ntechniques such as waterboarding, sleep deprivation, and forced nudity \nfrom the military's survival, evasion, resistance, and escape training, \nor SERE training, the path to interrogations of U.S. detainees. SERE \ntraining was not designed to train U.S. personnel to torture detainees. \nRather, it was designed to prepare U.S. personnel to survive torture at \nthe hands of our enemies. SERE training simulated techniques that were \nused by the Chinese interrogators during the Korean War--techniques \ndesigned to elicit a confession--any confession--whether true or false. \nThose who tortured U.S. troops were not after valuable actionable \nintelligence. They were after confessions they could use for propaganda \npurposes.\n  Defenders of the CIA's actions have claimed that abusive techniques \nproduced key intelligence on locating bin Laden that couldn't have been \nacquired through other means. This is false, as the Intelligence \nCommittee's report demonstrates in detail. Not only was the key \ninformation leading to bin Laden obtained through other means not \ninvolving abusive interrogation techniques by the CIA, but, in fact, \nthe CIA detainee who provided the most significant information about \nthe courier provided the information prior to being subjected to \nabusive interrogation.\n\n  There has been a great deal of conversation, and rightly so, about \nthe need for effective congressional oversight of our intelligence \ncommunity and the obstacles that exist to that oversight. This report \nhighlights many such obstacles. In one case, this report makes public \nthe likely connection between the Senate's efforts to oversee \nintelligence and the destruction of CIA tapes documenting abusive \ninterrogation of detainees. In 2005 I sponsored a resolution, with the \nsupport of ten colleagues, to establish an independent national \ncommission to examine treatment of detainees since 9/11. According to \nemails quoted in the report released today, Acting CIA General Counsel \nJohn Rizzo wrote on October 31, 2005, that the commission proposal \n``seems to be gaining some traction,'' and argued for renewed efforts \n``to get the right people downtown''--that is, at the White House--``on \nboard with the notion of our destroying the tapes.'' Does it sound a \nlittle bit like Watergate? The videos were destroyed at the direction \nof Jose Rodriguez, then the head of the CIA's National Clandestine \nService, just 1 day after the November 8, 2005, vote on our commission \nproposal in the Senate. It is just one striking example of the CIA's \nefforts to evade oversight.\n  Some have argued against releasing this report, suggesting that it \ncould spark violence against American interests. Fundamentally, the \nidea that release of this report undermines our security is a massive \nexercise in blame shifting. Telling the truth about how we engaged in \ntorture doesn't risk our security. It is the use of torture that \nundermines our security. Release of this report is hopefully an \ninsurance policy against the danger that a future President, a future \nintelligence community, and a future Congress might believe that we \nshould compromise our values in pursuit of unreliable information \nthrough torture. If a future America believes that what America's CIA \ndid in 2001, 2002, and 2003 was acceptable and useful, we are at risk \nof repeating the same horrific mistakes. That is a threat to our \nsecurity.\n  Torture is never the American way. Concealing the truth is never the \nAmerican way. Our Nation stands for something better. Our people \ndeserve something better--they deserve an intelligence community that \nconducts itself according to the law, according to basic human values, \nand with the safety of our troops always in mind. They deserve better \nthan intelligence tactics that are likely to produce useless lies from \npeople trying to end their torture being used against them, instead of \nproducing valuable intelligence.\n  I thank Chairman Feinstein for her leadership in completing and \nreleasing this report. I thank Senator Rockefeller for his longstanding \neffort in this regard. I thank Senator McCain and others for speaking \nout on the need to ensure that the United States never again repeats \nthese mistakes.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am on the floor this afternoon to speak \nbriefly about the American Savings Promotion Act, H.R. 3374.\n  My understanding is that this bill may soon pass the Senate--it was \npassed by the House of Representatives in September--and I wish to \nspeak briefly about its value to our country, to its citizens, and to \nour country's future.\n  I believe this is a fairly narrow circumstance with broad \nconsequences. I believe if there is a primary responsibility we have in \nbeing a citizen of this country, it is to make sure, among other \nthings, that we pass on to future generations of Americans the \nopportunity to pursue the American dream--to be able to have an idea to \npursue a business plan, to save for your family's and children's \neducation, to save for your own retirement, to prepare yourself for a \nbright financial future. Unfortunately, many Americans struggle to do \nthat.\n  Certainly, one of the aspects of that circumstance is there is very \nlittle savings that goes on in our country today. People are unable or \nunwilling, or perhaps undisciplined, in a way that allows them to \nprepare for their financial security and their financial future. The \nproblem is--and statistics bear this out--people aren't saving. The \nreality is, according to a recent survey, 44 percent of American \nhouseholds lack the savings to cover basic expenses for 3 months if \nunemployment or medical emergency or another crisis leads to a loss of \nstable income. Many Americans have the inability--almost the majority \nof Americans have the inability to care for themselves and their \nfamilies if there is an emergency or a problem for more than 3 months. \nThat is something we ought to try to resolve.\n\n  I also think there has been over a period of time a disparity of \nincomes. We want to make certain those at the lowest income levels have \nan opportunity to increase their income and to increase their financial \nstability. In fact, the Senator from Oregon, Senator Wyden, and I \ncreated sometime ago the Senate Economic Mobility Caucus, trying to \nmake certain that people have a chance to move up the ladder of \neconomic success and security in our economy and in our country. \nSenator Wyden and I came together to bring some of the best minds from \nconservative to more liberal thought-provoking organizations and policy \norganizations to visit with Republican and Democratic Senators and \ntheir staffs about what ideas are out there that might increase the \nchances that a person or a family has the chance to improve their \nfinancial circumstances.\n  One of the ideas that arose from that caucus's discussions was this \nlegislation called the American Savings Promotion Act, again, with the \nrealization that people are not saving for their own financial \nsecurity, that they lack stability in times of emergency and difficult \neconomic challenges to care for themselves, how can we encourage \nAmericans to save more?\n  One of the ideas that came forth in this regard is the opportunity to \nlink savings to prizes. When I first heard this, I thought it sounded a \nlittle bit odd, a little bit like a gimmick. But the reality is with \nlittle savings, people still believe--in fact, 20 percent of Americans \nbelieve that winning the lottery is a meaningful strategy to build \nwealth. Americans spend more than $60 billion every year on lottery\n\n[[Page S6433]]\n\ntickets and families earning the least spend the highest percentage of \ntheir earnings on lottery tickets despite the long odds of winning.\n  This legislation is not about a lottery, but about allowing financial \ninstitutions the opportunity to provide prizes for those who save, who \nopen a savings account and deposit money into that account. In our \ncountry, because of the way financial institutions are regulated, that \nhas been an opportunity in a number of States in credit union financial \ninstitutions for a period of time. In fact, the statistics and the \nfacts that arise from that experiment or that experience indicate that \nsavings increases when there is a prize associated with the savings \nbehavior. So it is one of the reasons this makes sense. Prize-linked \nsavings is an innovation, a tool to encourage savings while offering \nthe chance to win a larger prize.\n  We know these programs work because of the evidence in the States \nthat I mentioned in which credit unions have been offering these prizes \nassociated with savings, and that has occurred in Nebraska and North \nCarolina and Washington. Since 2009, over 50,000 accountholders have \ncollectively saved more than $94 million, and it only is available in \nthe credit union setting and not available in a bank setting because of \nFederal barriers that prevent banks and thrifts from offering these \nprize-linked savings products.\n  With the passage of this legislation--again, which is a pretty \nstraightforward, commonsense kind of opportunity--this legislation will \nupdate Federal laws to allow States to expand prize-linked savings to \nother financial institutions beyond credit unions.\n  Increasing savings is a win-win for individuals. It is certainly \nvaluable to boost the financial institutions' accounts and an \nimprovement to the American economy.\n  This legislation was introduced by me, with the cosponsorship efforts \nof Senator Sherrod Brown, the Senator from Ohio, in an effort to create \none more opportunity, one more piece of encouragement for people to \nsave for their own financial well-being, to care for themselves and \ntheir families, and to increase the savings rate in this country for \nthe benefit of the entire economy, but most importantly for the benefit \nof low-income individuals who need a boost of encouragement to save.\n  I wish to thank my colleagues in the House. As I say, this \nlegislation passed in the House where Congressman Kilmer and \nCongressman Cotton led the effort in the House, and my colleague, the \nSenator from Ohio, Senator Brown, for his efforts in supporting this \nlegislation here in the Senate. It is an opportunity for us to do \nsomething modest but useful, something based upon common sense, and \nsomething that accomplishes a goal we all should have of making certain \nthe American dream is alive and well, that individuals and families \ntake personal responsibility for themselves and their family members. \nWe all know that increased savings, preparing for any kind of \ncircumstance or emergency that comes our way, is something that ought \nto be encouraged.\n  I appreciate that it is likely that later today or tomorrow H.R. 3374 \nwill pass, again, an example of where we have been able to work \ntogether and bring new ideas to the cause of making certain that \neverybody has the opportunity to increase their economic value, to \nincrease the economic worth for their family available for the future, \nto pay their bills, and to make certain their future is bright, again, \nin my mind making sure the American dream is more alive and all \nAmerican families are better off.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity to address the Senate, \nand I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I had a chance briefly earlier, when \nChairman Dianne Feinstein of the Senate Intelligence Committee and her \npredecessor as Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Commerce \nChairman Jay Rockefeller, were on the floor, to express my appreciation \nto them for the leadership they showed in bringing the Senate \nIntelligence Committee report through a very long ordeal and finally \nbefore the American public today.\n  I am not going to revisit what the report says. I was on the \nIntelligence Committee as it was prepared. I was closely involved in \nits preparation. The points I would like to make here today are, first, \nto once again thank Chairman Rockefeller and Chairman Feinstein for \npersisting through this process, particularly Chairman Feinstein, who I \nthink saw very intense resistance both within the Senate and within the \nCIA to this effort. They, I think, have done something that is in the \nvery best traditions of the Senate.\n  The second thing I will say is that in my opinion, in America, an \nopen democracy like ours lives and dies by the truth. If we have done \nsomething wrong, if we have done something we should not have done, \nthen we should come clean about it. That is what this report does, in \nexcruciating, painstaking detail.\n  Let me credential the report for a minute. When the CIA was offered a \nchance to challenge the facts of the report, they had it for 6 months. \nMy understanding is they came up with one factual correction which was \naccepted. You hear a lot of blather in the talk show circuit now about \nhow the report is inaccurate. Well, the agency that least wanted to see \nthis report come out and most wanted to hammer at it had 6 months with \nfull access to all of the files and the underlying knowledge of what \nwas done. The best they could come up with was a single correction. So \nI hope we can get past whether it was correct.\n  The other thing we should get past is this was a bunch of second-\narmchair thinking by people who approved the program originally and \nnow, on reflection, want to look good. The Senate was not briefed on \nthis program until the public found out about it. The Senate \nIntelligence Committee was not briefed on this program until the public \nfound out about it. The only people who were briefed on it were the \nChairs, the Chair and the Vice Chair on the House and the Senate side. \nThey were told strictly not to talk to anybody, not to talk to staff, \nnot to consult with lawyers, in some cases not even to talk with each \nother. So the idea that the Senate is now having some kind of second \nthoughts about this, having once approved it--part of the findings of \nthe report are that the Senate was misled. Not only was the Senate \nmisled, but it appears the executive branch was misled as well.\n  The point that I would like to conclude with is that when you have a \nwrong, a considerable wrong that has taken place--and I think that for \nan American agency to torture a human being is a very considerable \nwrong--it tends to affect nearby areas. You cannot contain the wrong. \nSo congressional oversight was compromised in order to protect this \nprogram. People simply were not told. When they were told, they were \ngiven watered-down, misleading, or outright false versions.\n  The separation of powers has been compromised by this. A Federal \nexecutive agency has actually used its technological skills to hack \ninto the files of a congressional investigative committee. That has to \nbe a first in this country's history. A subject of a congressional \ninvestigation was allowed to file a criminal referral with the \nDepartment of Justice against members of the investigative committee's \nstaff. That, I believe, is a first in the history of separation-of-\npowers offenses in this country.\n  The integrity of reporting not only through congressional oversight, \nbut up into the executive branch, appears to have been compromised to \nprotect this program with information that the government already knew, \nfrom legitimate, proper, professional interrogation, being ascribed to \nthe torture program. You can line up the timeline. You can see that the \ninformation was disclosed first. You can see where higher-ups in the \nexecutive branch were told that that information was due to the torture \nwhich occurred after the\n\n[[Page S6434]]\n\ninformation was received. That simply does not meet the test of basic \nlogic.\n  The final thing is that it compromised the integrity of the way we \nlook at our law. The Department of Justice and the Office of Legal \nCounsel wrote opinions designed to allow and protect this program that \nwere so bad that they have since been withdrawn by the Department of \nJustice.\n  The Presiding Officer is a very able and experienced lawyer. Those of \nus who have been in the Department of Justice know well that the Office \nof Legal Counsel stands at the pinnacle of the Department of Justice in \nterms of legal talent, ability, and acumen. Many of us believe the \nDepartment of Justice stands at the pinnacle of the American legal \nprofession. So those are the people who ordinarily are the best of the \nbest. When they write legal opinions so shoddy that they have to be \nwithdrawn, when they overlook and fail to even address the U.S. Circuit \nCourt decisions that describe waterboarding as torture when they are \nanswering the question, is waterboarding torture, that is shoddy legal \nwork.\n  When I first got a look at this and came to the Senate floor to speak \nabout it, I described it as ``fire the associate'' quality legal work. \nThat is what we got from the very top of the Department of Justice. It \nis not because there was a lack of talent there. It is because things \nwere bent and twisted to support this program. So it is very important \nthat the truth just came out.\n\n  I am very glad this has happened. It is a sad day in many respects \nbecause these are hard truths. These are hard facts to have to face. \nBut we are better off as a country if we face hard truths and hard \nfacts.\n  I will close by saying this. I have traveled all over that theater \nlooking at the way our Central Intelligence Agency operates and the way \nour other covert operations operate. I am extremely proud of what our \nintelligence services do. I am incredibly impressed by the courage and \nthe talent of the young officers who go overseas into often very \ndifficult and dangerous situations and do a brilliant job. In many \nrespects, it is for them that I think this report needs to be out. It \nneeds to be known that this was not the whole department, that there \nare many officers who had nothing to do with it and would want nothing \nto do with it and knew better. There were many people who were \nprofessionals in interrogation who knew how amateurish this was. It was \ndone by a bunch of contractors, basically.\n  So I think we should be well aware, as we reflect on this, of their \ncourage and of the sacrifice and of the ability and of the discipline \nof the young men and women who put themselves in harm's way to make \nsure that this country has the information and the intelligence it \nneeds to succeed in the world. I am proud of them.\n  I am also proud of the Intelligence Committee and our staffs who \nworked so hard to perform this extraordinary service.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, a Bloomberg headline Monday noted: ``Half \nof the Senators Who Voted for ObamaCare Will be Gone in 2015.'' \nObamaCare, it seems, has not been kind to the party that jammed it \nthrough Congress.\n  In fact, the third ranking Democrat in the Senate admitted as much 2 \nweeks ago when he told an audience that Democrats made a mistake after \nthe 2008 election by putting all their focus on passing a health care \nlaw. He further said:\n\n       Unfortunately, Democrats blew the opportunity the American \n     people gave them. We took their mandate and put all of our \n     focus on the wrong problem--health care reform.\n\n  Now, as a result, my colleague from New York said: ``The average \nmiddle-class person thought, `the Democrats aren't paying enough \nattention to me.' ''\n  Well, Democrats weren't paying enough attention to middle-class \nfamilies. The American people didn't support the health care law, and \nthey made that clear. But Democrats just ignored their objections and \nforced it through anyway.\n  They were far from frank about what was in the bill. In fact, \nObamaCare architect Jonathan Gruber essentially admitted that Democrats \nwere deliberatively deceptive when passing their health reform law. \nGruber said:\n\n       This bill was written in a tortured way to make sure CBO \n     did not score the mandate as taxes. . . . Lack of \n     transparency is a huge political advantage. And basically, \n     call it the `stupidity of the American voter' or whatever, \n     but basically that was really, really critical to getting the \n     thing to pass.\n\n  That is from Jonathan Gruber, as I said, an architect of ObamaCare.\n  Well, 4\\1/2\\ years after the law has passed, it is clear Americans \nwere right to be concerned. The law that was supposed to reduce the \ncost of health care for American families is actually driving up \nprices.\n  Each Friday my office puts out a document featuring the ObamaCare \nheadlines of the week. I would like to read a few headlines from the \npast week that I think give a picture of where we are with this law.\n  This is from the Associated Press: ``Healthcare.gov average premiums \ngoing up in 2015.'' From the Wall Street Journal: ``More Cost of Health \nCare Shifts to Consumers.'' From Businessweek: ``Obamacare's Future: \nCancer Patients Paying More for Medication.'' From Gallup: ``Cost Still \na Barrier Between Americans and Medical Care.'' From the Fiscal Times: \n``High Deductible Plans Have More People Delaying Treatment.'' From \nU.S. News & World Report: ``Americans Unhappy With Obamacare Shopping \nExperience.'' And from The Hill: ``Security Flaws Found in Obamacare \nFee Calculator.''\n  And I could go on. Those are just headlines from last week. I could \nread similar headlines from the week before and from the week before \nthat.\n  Any way you look at it, ObamaCare is a mess. The President promised \nthe law would lower premiums by $2,500. In fact, the average family \nhealth care premium has increased by $3,064 since the law was passed, \nand family premiums are still going up.\n  The President promised Americans could keep the health care plans \nthey had and liked. In reality, ObamaCare has forced millions of \nAmericans off their plans.\n\n[[Page S6435]]\n\n  The President promised that Americans would be able to keep the \ndoctors they liked. In fact, Americans have lost the doctors they liked \nand trusted, not to mention access to convenient hospitals and needed \nmedications.\n  The President promised that shopping for ObamaCare would be like \nshopping on Amazon or Kayak. The reality is the President's own former \nHealth and Human Services Secretary recently admitted it was more like \nbuying an airline ticket using your fax machine.\n  We are still just talking about the ways ObamaCare has harmed \nAmericans' health care. But the damage hasn't been confined to health \ncare. ObamaCare is also hurting our already sluggish economy.\n  Take the ObamaCare tax on lifesaving medical devices, such as \npacemakers and insulin pumps. This tax has already eliminated thousands \nof jobs in the medical device industry, and it is on track to eliminate \nthousands more if it isn't repealed. In fact, this tax is so bad that \neven Democrats who voted for ObamaCare support repealing the tax.\n  Then there is the ObamaCare 30-hour workweek rule, which has forced \nemployers to cut workers' hours and wages, and there are the numerous--\nnumerous--ObamaCare rules and regulations that are making it difficult \nfor small businesses to hire and create jobs. It is no wonder that \nDemocrats are rethinking their decisions to support this law.\n  Americans have made it clear they do not like ObamaCare, and \nRepublicans are listening. One of our top priorities when we take the \nmajority in the Senate in the new Congress will be working to repeal \nthis law and replacing it with real reforms--reforms that will actually \ncut costs and improve Americans' access to health care.\n  In the meantime, we will focus on chiseling away at the law's most \nharmful provisions. We want to repeal the job-killing medical device \ntax and restore the 40-hour workweek so that employers will no longer \nbe forced to cut workers' hours in order to afford health care costs. \nMany Democrats as well as Republicans opposed these ObamaCare \nprovisions, so I look forward to bipartisan repeals.\n  The senior Senator from New York was right when he said Democrats \nmade a mistake when they decided to focus on the President's health \ncare law instead of on jobs and the economy. In poll after poll, \nAmericans have made it clear they want their representatives in \nWashington focused on creating jobs and on growing the economy, and \nthat is what the new Republican majority in the Senate intends to do.\n\n  We will take up legislation to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline and \nthe 42,000-plus jobs it would support. We will take up House-passed \nbills that have been gathering dust on the Democratic leader's desk.\n  We will work with the President to expand trade promotion authority \nto open new markets for American agricultural products and manufactured \ngoods, and we will take up legislation to repeal the President's \nnational energy tax, which could eliminate tens of thousands--hundreds \nof thousands--of jobs and devastate entire communities.\n  We also intend to take up big projects that would help put our \neconomy on a path to long-term health, such as legislation to simplify \nand streamline our costly and inefficient Tax Code.\n  The election results were pretty decisive. Americans made it very \nclear they were tired of the Democrats' policies and they wanted a \nchange in Washington, and Republicans are listening. Our priorities in \nthe next Congress will be the American people's priorities. We will \nfocus on creating jobs and growing our economy, and we hope the \nDemocrats will join us. The American people have been waiting long \nenough.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. CARPER. I object, just for a moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The assistant bill clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN.

Madam President, I first wish to spend a few minutes \ntalking about my colleague and chairman of the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee.\n  The last 2 years have been a real pleasure on my part, and I have \ngrown to have a great friendship with the chairman of the committee. I \ncan truly say in our committee we have done a lot of great work. We \nhave both compromised on a lot of issues to try to move the country \nforward, and to him I am thankful for that. I don't think either of us \nhave had to break on any principles we have had to be able to do that. \nI think our committee has been a model in terms of doing bipartisan \nbills and on bipartisan approval of nominees. For him, I would say I \nappreciate his leadership this past year. He has the unfortunate \nattribute of having the same initials I do, so it is somewhat confusing \non our committee. But maybe that is why we have been as successful as \nwe have.\n  I also wish to recognize the hard work of so many of the staff \nmembers on both sides, the work they put in, and the cooperative nature \nunder which they have worked.\n  We have before us a bill we are trying to clear called the Taxpayers \nRight-to-Know Act, and it is actually a continuation of a bill that \nSenator Carper, myself, and several others--including the President--\nstarted when we started the transparency act back in 2009. This follows \nalong with the DATA Act which was passed this year.\n  What this bill does is says the American people ought to know where \nthe money is being spent, and so it says the agencies are going to list \nthe programs they have. It is done in a stepwise fashion so it doesn't \nput too much pressure on OMB as they try to implement it. I believe at \nthis time we are waiting to make sure we have clearance for this before \nwe ask for a unanimous consent.\n  I yield my remaining time to the chairman of the committee, Senator \nCarper.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I would like to say to my colleague, Ted \nKennedy said to me when I first got here a number of years ago, talking \nabout compromise and that sort of thing--he always said: I am willing \nto compromise on policy, not on principle.\n  I think if we look at what we have accomplished in the last 2 years, \nthat is exactly what we have done. I thank my colleague for being a \ngreat leader--not just of his caucus but of our body and for being my \nfriend.\n  With that, I would say on the legislation that is before us, as he \nsuggested, the Taxpayers Right-to-Know Act does build on previous \nlegislation reported out of our committee. Some of those bills, the \nDATA Act, the Government Performance and Results Modernization Act, and \nsome others have been signed into law with bipartisan support, \nincluding by the current President.\n  The Taxpayers Right-to-Know Act is a good government bill that will \nprovide better and more detailed information to Congress and the \nAmerican people about Federal spending. Congress has passed several \nbills in the last few years to improve transparency on government \nspending and to get this information online. Unfortunately, the \ninformation has not always been provided at the level of detail \ntaxpayers and a number of my colleagues and I would prefer.\n  This bill builds on the Government Performance and Results \nModernization Act passed in 2010 and that I coauthored with Senators \nWarner and Akaka. That bill required OMB to work with agencies to \ncreate a list of all Federal programs that can be accessed on a single \nWeb site.\n\n[[Page S6436]]\n\n  Unfortunately, there has been no consistency whatsoever across the \ngovernment in how agencies define the term ``program.'' GAO has agreed \nthat the current program list isn't giving us the kind of transparency \nwe want because agencies took different approaches in defining their \nprograms. The Taxpayers Right-to-Know Act addresses this problem by \ndefining the term ``program.''\n  GAO has also noted that the current program inventory does not allow \nCongress and the GAO to compare similar programs, which is an obstacle \nto measuring government performance. Additionally, budget and cost \ninformation is not available for all programs.\n  This bill will ensure that agencies provide a full list of their \nprograms along with important information about each program. For \ngrants and other types of direct assistance, it will provide \ninformation on how many people a program serves and how many people it \ntakes to run it.\n  A complete inventory of Federal programs, along with budget and \nfinancial information at the program level, will allow Congress to \ncompare similar programs and identify overlap and duplication.\n  The bill has strong bipartisan support in our committee and was \nreported out without dissent. Seeing it to final passage would be a \ngood win for this Congress.\n  I am pleased to yield back to our colleague from Oklahoma for a \nunanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/09/senate-section/article/S6436-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 2113\n\n  Mr. COBURN.

Mr. President, I voted to confirm Virginia Lodge and \nRon Walter to be members of the Board of the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority. I believe that these nominees are qualified and have \ndemonstrated the characteristics that will enable them to fulfill their \nduties in supporting the mission of the TVA.\n  According to the TVA Act, the Board sets the broad strategies and \ngoals of the Tennessee Valley Authority. Given the many changes facing \nour electricity system, those strategies for TVA--one of the Nation's \nbiggest utilities--are critical. As technology changes the future of \nenergy production and energy use, the administration is busy unleashing \ncostly regulations that risk damaging our economy for little \nenvironmental gain.\n  Navigating these crosscurrents, TVA's Board must strive to keep \nelectricity costs low through prudential and nonideological \ndecisionmaking. They must continue the work of TVA's current management \nto cut costs without impacting service. Only through demanding \ndecisions based on data and through questioning assumptions will they \nsuccessfully lead TVA through today's challenges.\n  Also of importance is TVA's continued maintenance and eventual \ncompletion of the Bellefonte nuclear power plant. In the 1970s, TVA \nmade plans to build a large number of nuclear reactors, but it \nabandoned those plans after completing several plants while others--\nincluding two units at Bellefonte--were only partially completed.

The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                     Tributes to Departing Senators\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to salute \nmy colleagues who are departing the Senate at the end of this year with \nthe conclusion of the 113th Congress: Mark Begich of Alaska, Saxby \nChambliss of Georgia, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, Kay Hagan of North \nCarolina, Tom Harkin of Iowa, Mike Johanns of Nebraska, Tim Johnson of \nSouth Dakota, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Carl Levin of Michigan, Mark \nPryor of Arkansas, Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, Mark Udall of \nColorado, and John Walsh of Montana.\n  They have all worked hard, ceaselessly giving their energy and \nconsiderable time and service to their constituents, to their home \nStates and to our country. I want to thank them for their service and \nfor their kindness to me over many, many years in so many cases. In \nparticular, I want to say a few words about these colleagues.\n\n\n                              Mark Begich\n\n  Mark Begich and I worked together to address the challenges facing \nthe fishing industry, which is vital to both of our States. He has \ncontinually fought to address the unique challenges facing Alaskans, \nparticularly with respect to access to VA health care. I salute him and \nwish him the best.\n\n\n                            Saxby Chambliss\n\n  I have served with Saxby Chambliss on the Armed Services Committee \nand joined him in his efforts to support the National Infantry Museum \nand Soldier Center. Saxby has been a strong supporter of our men and \nwomen in uniform. He has also been a leader on homeland security and \nintelligence matters. I wish him well.\n\n\n                               Tom Coburn\n\n  Tom Coburn has always been passionate on the issues he cares about. \nWe have engaged in vigorous debate, demonstrating, I hope, that \nprincipled disagreement can lead ultimately to principled progress. My \nthoughts are with him, particularly as he battles health issues, his \ncancer. I hope and wish him success and much happiness as he moves \nforward.\n\n\n                               Kay Hagan\n\n  I have served with Kay Hagan on the Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs Committee and on the Armed Services Committee. We have worked \ntogether on a number of initiatives, including efforts to keep student \nloan interest rates low. We traveled together to Iraq, Afghanistan, and \nPakistan in 2010. She has been a tremendous advocate, especially for \nour military families and for small businesses.\n\n\n                               Tom Harkin\n\n  Tom Harkin has been a great friend, a longtime advocate for students, \nfor workers, for individuals with disabilities. As Chairman of the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, he has worked to end \nthe logjam and pass reauthorizations of our childcare programs and the \nworkforce investment system, and he recently worked with me to pass a \nbipartisan bill I helped author to ensure consumers have access to the \nsafest, most effective sunscreens available.\n  He has been a steadfast advocate for increasing our investment in \nmedical research at the NIH. An extraordinary Senator, we have so much \nto thank him for on behalf of every American. His legacy is going to be \nso profound. It is hard to pick one. But his efforts, along with Arlen \nSpecter's, to double NIH funding was a landmark in terms of not only \nsuccessful investment in programs that matter to Americans and the \nworld but bipartisan efforts to lead the country forward.\n\n\n                              Mike Johanns\n\n  I have been proud to work with Mike Johanns, an extraordinary Senator \nand an extraordinary gentleman, on a number of issues. We were \nparticularly happy--both of us--when the HAVEN Act was incorporated \ninto the pending version of the National Defense Authorization Act. \nThis legislation will allow disabled and low-income veterans the \nability to finance improvements to their homes so they are safer and \nmore accessible. We also worked together on healthy housing efforts and \nto reduce lead hazards. This is consistent with so many things he has \ndone, particularly with respect to veterans. Again, I wish him the best \nas he goes forward.\n\n\n                              Tim Johnson\n\n  Tim Johnson and I served in the House of Representatives together. We \ncame to the Senate together in 1997. As chairman of the banking \ncommittee, he has been an extraordinary leader. He has dedicated \nhimself particularly to community banks and to rural housing, which is \nconsistent with the interests of his constituents in South Dakota.\n  He has worked to build bipartisan compromise on issues like TRIA and \nFHA reform, among so many other matters. As the chairman of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, \nand Related Agencies he has been a tireless\n\n[[Page S6439]]\n\nadvocate for our military personnel. I thank him.\n\n\n                             Mary Landrieu\n\n  Mary Landrieu and I also came to the Senate together in 1997. We \nserved together on the Appropriations Committee, where she has been an \nextraordinary advocate for Louisiana, particularly after Hurricane \nKatrina. In fact, her efforts have been so profoundly influential in \nher home State, she is one that we all look to as a model for what it \nis to be an advocate for your constituents. She has done it so well.\n\n\n                               Mark Pryor\n\n  Mark Pryor and I have worked together on the Appropriations \nCommittee. We have worked together on a number of initiatives. I want \nto thank him particularly for his role in trying to help states like \nRhode Island be included in the Commodity Supplemental Food Program. I \nthank Mark for that. I offer him my fondest wishes.\n\n\n                            Jay Rockefeller\n\n  Today, we are recognizing the work of Jay Rockefeller as chairman of \nthe Intelligence Committee, along with Senator Feinstein. But he has \nbeen such a stalwart in so many different areas: as chairman of the \ncommerce committee, someone who has championed the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, someone who has been in the lead with respect to \nadvocacy for the E-Rate, which helps bring broadband connectivity to \nall of our libraries and schools, to EPSCoR. I can go on and on for a \nremarkable career by a remarkable individual, a real gentleman, someone \nwhom I am proud to call a friend and am deeply indebted to his \nfriendship.\n\n\n                               Mark Udall\n\n  Mark Udall and I served together on the Armed Services Committee. I \nam grateful to have traveled with him also to Afghanistan and Pakistan \nin 2011. Again, he is committed to our troops, committed to our \nnational security, committed to his home State. He has been an advocate \nfor clean energy, for natural resources, for things that will be a \nlegacy for generations to come in Colorado and throughout the United \nStates.\n\n\n                               John Walsh\n\n  John Walsh is a friend that I met and served with over the last \nseveral years. I want to salute him, not only as a Senator but as a \ncombat veteran. He has had the greatest privilege that I believe any \nAmerican has--the privilege to lead American soldiers. He did it well. \nI thank him for that.\n\n\n                               Carl Levin\n\n  But let me say, especially, a few words about my dear, dear friend \nCarl Levin. For 18 years, Carl Levin has either been chairman or \nranking member of the Armed Services Committee. The U.S. military, the \nmost powerful and professional force in the world, has in countless \nways been shaped because Carl Levin repeatedly helped form a new common \nground to move us forward as a Nation for the benefit of our men and \nwomen in uniform and for the benefit of us all.\n  Carl and I have traveled many times together--Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq, \nAfghanistan, Pakistan, Israel, Syria, Colombia. We were there to visit \nwith commanders and local leaders, but especially to see our troops and \nto thank them. In the faces of those troops I saw the trust and respect \nthey felt--some to their own surprise--when they met the chairman--the \npowerful chairman of the Armed Services Committee. He was there. He had \ntraveled across the globe to listen to them, to work for them, and to \nthank them.\n  It was profoundly moving to me to see this--inspiring indeed. As the \nchairman of one of the other major committees, the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, he has pursued the powerful on behalf \nof the powerless, on behalf of the people. He has not only uncovered \nabuse, but he has sent a powerful message to an increasingly \ndiscouraged America that there is someone who will fight for them, who \nunderstands that everyone deserves a fair chance at a better future.\n  Carl Levin has been a friend, a role model. I will miss working with \nhim.\n  Along with all of my other colleagues who are leaving us at the \nconclusion of the 113th Congress, let me thank them for their service, \ntheir dedication to improving the lives of Americans, and on a very \npersonal level for their friendship. I wish them all well.\n\n\n      SSCI Study of the CIA'S Detention and Interrogation Program\n\n  Let me conclude on a slightly different topic; that is, to commend \nSenator Rockefeller again and Senator Feinstein for their extraordinary \nleadership today in bringing forward to the American public the \nIntelligence Committee report on the CIA's interrogation program.\n  But I particularly want to commend and thank Senator McCain. For many \nyears, Senator McCain has spoken out, and many times alone, against the \ndespicable and heinous actions that have been illustrated today. He has \nled our efforts. No one has led them more vigorously and more intensely \nand more successfully than John McCain--to prohibit the use of torture \nand abusive methods by the United States of America, to remind us that \nour highest ideals require us to do something else--something better--\nand also to remind us that what is at stake--very much at stake--are \nthe lives and the health of our soldiers.\n  We cannot expect others to follow the law if we do not. We cannot \nexpect our forces to be treated according to the conventions and laws \nthat govern civilized society if we depart from them. That is a \npowerful message. It is no surprise coming from someone whose personal \nexperience, whose personal courage lends incredible credibility, \nincredible support to these efforts.\n  To these three colleagues, I extend my thanks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                             Tax Extenders\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this week it seems that the Senate is \nfinally ready to take up and pass a tax extenders bill. Congress' \nprocrastination on tax extenders has been causing a lot of headaches \nand indigestion to many of my constituents back home in Iowa.\n  Small business owners and farmers want to know whether the enhanced \nexpensing rules under section 179 will be extended so that they can \ninvest in new machinery. Retirees want to know whether they can make a \ncharitable donation from their IRA to meet their required minimum \ndistribution. The renewable energy sector wants to know what \ninvestments they should make to increase production.\n  The Senate could have made strides towards answering these questions \njust this past spring. The Finance Committee acted in a bipartisan \nfashion to report an extenders package to the floor that would have \nextended all expiring provisions for 2 years. By all accounts, this \npackage could have been passed by the Senate with broad support on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  Unfortunately, movement of this package in the Senate stalled in May \ndue to procedural maneuvering on the Senate floor. That maneuvering was \nmeant to prevent votes on all amendments--even those with broad, \nbipartisan support. With the Senate failing to take action, the hopes \nof getting the extenders done in a timely fashion faded last spring.\n  However, there were high hopes that a bipartisan deal could be worked \nout with the House that could provide individuals and businesses much-\nneeded tax certainty. Before Thanksgiving, House and Senate negotiators \nwere making real headway towards a bipartisan agreement that would have \nextended most provisions for 2 years and made several provisions \npermanent. The President then thwarted negotiations by threatening to \nveto that package before it was even finalized.\n  Why the President would threaten to veto a package that, by all \naccounts, recognized bipartisan priorities as well as priorities of the \nadministration is beyond me. The President's stated complaint is that \nthe deal was geared too heavily toward business. From an administration \nthat has regularly been advocating business-only tax reform, this \ncomplaint rings hollow.\n  However, all of the business provisions that would have been made \npermanent under the proposed deal have had strong support from both \nsides of the aisle here in the Senate as well as from the White House. \nFor instance, the President's fiscal package that was in the 2015 \nbudget calls for both the research and development tax credit and the \nenhanced expensing rules under Section 179 to be made permanent.\n  The bipartisan deal would have accomplished this. The proposed deal \nalso\n\n[[Page S6440]]\n\nincluded priorities specific to President Obama and many of my \nDemocratic colleagues. For instance, the American opportunity tax \ncredit enacted as part of the President's 2009 stimulus bill would have \nbeen made permanent. The President's other named priorities were the \nenhanced refundable child tax credit and the earned-income tax credit. \nBut it was the President's own actions on immigration--using \npresidential edict--that made their inclusion a very tough sell. Many \non my side of the aisle have long had concerns about fraud and abuse in \nboth of these credits. The President's Executive action only served to \nenhance these concerns and added fuel to the fire by eroding \nestablished policy that prohibits undocumented immigrants from \nreceiving their earned-income credit.\n  The President may have a phone and a pen. He says he has it, and it \nseems as if he is always using it. But the last time I checked, \nCongress is still a coequal branch of government under the \nConstitution. When the President acts unilaterally, it should not \nsurprise him when Congress responds.\n  So it is true that the deal did not include everything the President \nwanted, but it didn't include everything Republicans wanted either. \nNobody ever gets everything they want in bipartisan negotiations. The \npoint of negotiating is to get something the majority of us can \nsupport.\n  By cutting off negotiations, the White House has left us with voting \non something that is barely better than nothing for individuals and \nindustries. This includes industries the President claims to be a \npriority of his, such as the renewable energy sector, which is very \nmuch a high priority for me.\n  Forward policy guidance is critically important to the renewable \nenergy sector. The proposed deal would have provided certainty to wind \nenergy through a multiyear phaseout that would have provided a \nglidepath to self-sustainability. Other renewable provisions would have \nbeen extended for 2 years. Instead, Congress is now faced with settling \nfor a 1-year retroactive extension that fails to provide any meaningful \nincentive for the further development of renewable energy.\n  It also fails to provide certainty to other businesses and to \nindividuals as well. These are provisions that will once again expire \nalmost as soon as they go into law. I think we all agree that making \ntax law 1 year at a time in retroactive fashion is not the way to do \nbusiness. Yet that is the reality we currently face because of this \nadministration's refusal to compromise.\n  While I would prefer longer extensions of these provisions, that is \nno longer a viable option as we close down this Congress. As a result, \nI intend to support the House package. My only hope is that in the new \nCongress we can make strides toward putting some certainty back into \nthe Tax Code.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                 Women Owned Small Business Contracting\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I rise today to speak about an important piece of \nlegislation that will be before the Senate shortly that will help women \nentrepreneurs across the country break through the glass ceiling.\n  Earlier this year, as chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship, I released a report entitled ``21st \nCentury Barriers to Women's Entrepreneurship.'' These barriers, \naccording to our report, show that women entrepreneurs were not getting \na fair shot at access to capital, not getting a fair shot at competing \nfor Federal contracts, and needed more programs tailored specifically \nto their needs and certainly needed more access to capital and at \nsmaller amounts of money.\n  This chart shows the various things that were relevant from that \nreport: equal access to Federal contracts, access to capital, and \nrelevant business training.\n  We heard an earful from women entrepreneurs all across America, and \nit spurred us to take action and make major changes.\n  That is why we introduced legislation called the Women's Small \nBusiness Ownership Act of 2014, and this legislation did three things: \nIt said, let's focus on sole-source contracting authority for women-\nowned businesses when they are working with the Federal Government, \nlet's improve the counseling to women, and let's make sure women get \nthe access to capital that they deserve.\n  Additionally, the issue of sole-source contracting was taken up by \ntwo of my colleagues, Senator Shaheen and Senator Gillibrand. I should \nsay that my predecessor on the committee, Senator Landrieu, had worked \non this issue of access to capital for women for a long time, and we \ncertainly applaud all she did as chairwoman of the Small Business \nCommittee.\n  The sole-source contracting provision is in the Defense bill we are \ngoing to be taking up shortly.\n  I thank all of my colleagues--as I said, Senator Shaheen, Senator \nGillibrand, Senator Landrieu--and also the SBA Administrator, Maria \nContreras-Sweet, for their support in getting more federal contracts to \nwomen-owned businesses.\n  There are more than 8 million women-owned businesses in the United \nStates, but they only get a tiny percent--about 4 percent--of Federal \ncontracts. We want to make sure this is changed. I think we have a \nsecond chart that describes this problem.\n  We have a Federal goal of making sure that small businesses get \naccess to contracts at each Federal agency so that we are doing all we \ncan to grow small businesses in America. If you think about it, many \nsmall businesses have the technological expertise to do the work. What \nthey often don't have is the manpower to wade through the lengthy and \ncomplicated federal contracting process. So sole-source contracting \nallows the Federal Government to streamline the procurement process \nwhen selecting a company. So we want to make sure this is changed, and \nthe FY 15 NDAA legislation will do just that.\n  Twenty years ago, Congress established the goal of awarding 5 percent \nof all Federal contracts to women-owned small businesses, but we did \nnot make sure there was fair representation in the marketplace to \nachieve this goal. Last year, the Department of Defense accounted for \n68 percent of Federal procurement opportunities; yet the Department of \nDefense only issued 3.6 percent of those contracts to women-owned small \nbusinesses. In my State, the State of Washington, women received only \n1.67 percent of Federal contracts. We heard from women across America, \nwhen they came to testify before the Small Business Committee this \nsummer, exactly how challenging this process is.\n  I want to point out a last chart, which shows that 28 percent of \nbusinesses in the United States are women-owned, and we certainly want \nto increase that. Part of our challenge economically is to make sure \nvarious groups are getting access to adequate capital, getting \nopportunities to compete for federal contracts, and getting the \ncounseling and training they need, so they can participate in the \neconomy as small business owners. But we can see on this chart that the \npercentage of federal contracts to women-owned businesses is minuscule. \nWe want to make sure we are doing everything we can to help these \nwomen.\n  Trena Payton, a business owner and veteran from my home state of \nWashington, is one of these voices fighting for this provision to be \nmade into law. Trena testified at a Small Business Committee hearing on \nVeterans' Entrepreneurship. In 2003, Trena decided to open her own \nbusiness. It took her more than a year to land her first contract. She \nsaid at the hearing:\n\n       As the head of a women-owned small business, I can tell you \n     that access to the federal marketplace is a huge issue.\n\n  Today, Trena's company, ABN Technologies, has grown to employ twelve \npeople and last year generated revenues of 8.1 million dollars.

The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Tribute to Carl Levin\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to offer a few words of tribute to \nmy departing colleague, Senator Carl Levin--a model of serious purpose, \nfirm principle, and personal decency, and whose example ought to \ninspire the service of new and returning Senators. We could not aspire \nto better service than what he has given our country.\n  Carl and I have served together on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee for the better part of three decades. He is my senior in this \nbody by 8 years and has been my chairman for more than 10 years in \ntotal. It has been a privilege to serve under his very able, honorable, \nand fair leadership.\n  Carl and I sit on opposite sides of the aisle. The difference is \nquite obvious on any number of issues, but I hope it is also obvious \nhow much I admire and respect my friend from Michigan.\n  We have had our moments on the committee. Debate there can get a \nlittle passionate from time to time, perhaps a little more passionate \non my part than Carl's, but that, as all my colleagues would surely \nattest, is my problem, not Carl's. We are, however, both proud of the \ncommittee's tradition of bipartisan cooperation which Carl has worked \ndiligently to preserve and strengthen. We both know how important that \ntradition is to faithfully discharging our responsibilities to help \nmaintain the defense of this country and do right by the men and women \nof the U.S. Armed Forces. We both feel their example of selfless \nsacrifice would shame us if we let the committee descend into the \npartisan posturing that often makes it hard to get important work done \nin Congress.\n  When Members disagree in committee--often heatedly--it is because we \nfeel passionately about whatever issue is in dispute. Even then we try \nto behave civilly and respectfully to each other, and we do not let our \ndisagreements prevent us from completing the committee's business. Carl \nwon't let us. That we have managed to keep that reputation in these \ncontentious times is a tribute to Carl Levin. He has kept the committee \nfocused on its duties and not on the next election or the latest rush-\nto-the-barricades partisan quarrel. He does so in a calm, measured, \npatient, and thoughtful manner. He seems, in fact, to be calmer and \nmore patient the more heated our disagreements are. As members' \nemotions and temperatures rise, Carl's unperturbed composure and focus \nbring our attention back to the business at hand. You could safely say \nhe and I have slightly different leadership styles. I am gentler and \nless confrontational. But Carl's style seems to work for him. It works \nwell for the committee too, for the armed services, and for the \ncountry.\n  The committee has a heavy workload every year, and Carl manages to \nkeep us all in harness and working together at a good pace and with a \nconstructive, results-oriented approach that is the envy of the dozen \nor so lesser committees of the Senate. Our principal responsibility is \nto produce the Defense authorization bill--one of the most important \nand comprehensive pieces of legislation the Senate considers on an \nannual bases. The committee has never failed to report the bill, and \nthe Senate has never failed to pass it. That is not an accomplishment \nthat some of the lesser committees I just referred to can claim every \nyear, and no one deserves more of the credit than Carl Levin.\n  When Carl Levin first joined the committee, he explained his reason \nfor seeking the assignment this way:\n\n       I had never served, and I thought there was a big gap in \n     terms of my background and, frankly, felt it was a way of \n     providing service.\n\n  He might never have served in the military, but he has surely served \nthe military well, and he has served the national interests our Armed \nForces protect in an exemplary manner that the rest of us would be wise \nto emulate.\n  More recently, I have had the honor and privilege of serving \nalongside Carl on the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. His \ntireless efforts and steadfast dedication to exposing misconduct and \nabuse by financial institutions and government regulators have set a \nnew standard for thoughtful and thorough congressional investigations.\n  Whether the topic was the 2008 financial crisis, Swiss banking \nsecrecy, or JPMorgan's ``London Whale'' debacle, professionals in the \nindustry and the public at large knew they could count on Carl Levin to \nget to the bottom of it with authoritative reports and hearings. Carl's \ntenacity in uncovering wrongdoing sparked significant changes in the \nfinancial sector.\n  I also commend Carl Levin on zealously and effectively pursuing his \ninvestigations in a way that has furthered the subcommittee's \nlongstanding tradition of bipartisanship. While Carl Levin and I may \nhave had our disagreements, we never let them get in the way of finding \ncommon ground where we could.\n  While Carl's retirement may come as a relief to some of those on Wall \nStreet, his patience, thoughtfulness, and commitment to bipartisanship \nwill be deeply missed on the subcommittee and in the Senate.\n  Indeed, from Carl Levin's long and distinguished service in the \nSenate, Carl has obtained the respect of his colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle. We all listen to him, and we listen closest to him on the \noccasions when we disagree with him. That, in my view, is a great \ncompliment from one Senator to another. It is a tribute paid to only \nthe most respected Members.\n  Of course, the greatest compliment one Senator can pay another is to \ncredit him or her as a person who keeps his or her word. That has \nbecome too rare in Washington but not so in my experiences with Carl \nLevin. He has never broken his word to me. He has never backed out of a \ndeal, even when doing so would have been personally and politically \nadvantageous. When we are in agreement on an issue, Carl usually argues \nmore effectively than I can, and when we disagree, we usually find a \nway to settle our dispute without abandoning our responsibilities. Carl \nLevin deserves most of the credit for that too.\n  One of the great satisfactions in life is to fight for a common cause \nwith someone you haven't always agreed with, someone whose background, \nviews, and personality are different from yours. Yet you discover that \ndespite your differences, you have always been on the same side on the \nbig things.\n  Thank you, Carl, for the privilege and for your friendship and \nexample. The committee is going to miss you, the Senate is going to \nmiss you, the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces are going to miss \nyou, and I will miss you a lot.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S6442]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/09/senate-section/article/S6442-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SCHATZ.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in \na colloquy with Senator Leahy of Vermont, chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, regarding S. 2520, the FOIA Improvement Act of \n2014.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank Senator Leahy for attempting to address my \nconcerns about this bill. I thank his committee staff for working with \nmy committee staff to insert clarifying report language.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would like to acknowledge the chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation for highlighting \nimportant concerns of the agencies his committee works with closely. \nThis legislation seeks to further the goal of government transparency; \nbut we also understand the need for government agencies to dutifully \nand carefully fulfill their responsibilities.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. From the beginning, I have recognized that this bill \nwould make important changes to the Freedom of Information Act. My \nconcerns have been rooted in the possible unintended consequences this \nbill would have on consumer protection. I was concerned this bill would \nmake it harder for our consumer protection agencies to bring \nenforcement actions against corporate wrongdoers.\n  Specifically, I am concerned that requiring government law \nenforcement agencies to show foreseeable harm that is not ``speculative \nor abstract'' when invoking FOIA exemptions for attorney-client, work-\nproduct, and deliberative process privileges will undermine law \nenforcement efforts.\n  Hundreds of years of American legal tradition has generally protected \nwork-product documents and attorney-client communications from the \ndiscovery process in civil litigation. Further, the deliberative \nprocess privilege has allowed government agencies' law enforcers to \nfreely exchange ideas and legal strategies as part of their internal \ndecision making process.\n  I am concerned that the bill could have a ``chilling effect'' on \ninternal communications and deliberations of agencies' law enforcement \npersonnel who are preparing law enforcement actions against alleged \nwrongdoers, in order to avoid the prospect of increased litigation.\n  We do not want to hinder the robust, internal exchange of rigorous \nideas and legal strategies within government agencies when they are \nbringing enforcement actions.\n  Given this, courts should review agency law enforcement decisions on \nthe new foreseeable harm standard under an ``abuse of discretion'' \nstandard.\n  Mr. LEAHY. At Senator Rockefeller's request we have included language \nin the committee report on the abuse of discretion standard and its \napplication to make clear that it is the intent of Congress that \njudicial review of agency decisions to withhold information relating to \ncurrent law enforcement actions under the foreseeable harm standard be \nsubject to an abuse of discretion standard.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Furthermore, if we are going to potentially burden \nour government agencies with increased costs that will be associated \nwith complying with the bill, then I think Congress should also provide \nthese agencies with sufficient funding to deal with what is sure to be \nan increased workload.\n  While I still have concerns about this bill's effect on consumer \nprotection, I think the accommodation made by Senator Leahy will help. \nI thank him for inserting clarifying language in the report with regard \nto this congressional intent on review of information withheld under \nthe foreseeable harm standard.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I ask consent to engage \nin a colloquy with Senator Leahy, chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, regarding important aspects of S. 2520, the FOIA Improvement \nAct of 2014.\n  While I support the ultimate goal of this legislation, which seeks to \nincrease government transparency, as the chairman of the Senate Banking \nCommittee, I am also mindful of the need for government agencies to \ndutifully and carefully fulfill their oversight responsibilities of our \nNation's financial institutions and the health and welfare of our \nfinancial systems at-large. Financial regulatory agencies are tasked \nwith ensuring the safety and soundness of the financial system, \ncompliance with Federal consumer financial law, and promoting fair, \norderly, and efficient financial markets. A critical component of \neffective oversight is the ability of a financial regulator to have \nunfettered access to information from a regulated institution. A \nfinancial institution should not have to fear that its regulator will \nbe unable to protect the institution's confidential information from \ndisclosure. Since the passage of the Freedom of Information Act, \nCongress has recognized the importance of protecting this type of \nsupervisory information as evidenced specifically in 5 U.S.C. Sec.  \n552(b)(8), commonly referred to as Exemption 8, and more generally in \nother exemptions. It is my understanding that nothing in S. 2520 is \nintended to limit the scope of the protections under Exemption 8, or \nother exemptions relevant to financial regulators; nor is the bill \nintended to require release of confidential information about \nindividuals or information that a financial institution may have, the \nrelease of which could compromise the stability of the financial \ninstitution or the financial system, or undermine the consumer \nprotection work by the regulators. Given that the release of \nconfidential or sensitive information relating to oversight of \nregulated entities could cause harm to such entities, individuals, or \nthe financial system, a financial regulatory agency could reasonably \nforesee that disclosure of such information requested under FOIA may \nharm an interest protected by Exemption 8. This is precisely why \nCongress continues to provide these statutory exemptions.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank Senator Johnson for his remarks and for his \ninterest and support for this legislation. I agree that it is important \nto ensure that our financial regulators are able to do the work \nrequired to maintain the safety and soundness of our financial \ninstitutions. I also agree that the free flow of information between \nregulators and financial institution is important to this process. \nExemption 8 was intended by Congress, and has been interpreted by the \ncourts, to be very broadly construed to ensure the security of \nfinancial institutions and to safeguard the relationship between \nfinancial institutions and their supervising agencies. The proposed \namendments to the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, are not intended to \nundermine the broad protection in Exemption 8 or to undermine the \nintegrity of the supervisory examination process. Moreover, much of the \ninformation that the government is permitted to withhold under \nExemption 8, is also protected under Exemption 4, which exempts from \ndisclosure commercial and financial information that is privileged or \nconfidential. Exemption 4 covers information prohibited from disclosure \nunder the Trade Secrets Act and similar laws, and as such does not \nprovide for discretionary disclosure under FOIA. As with other \nexemptions that are based on separate legal restrictions, it is \nunderstood that the foreseeable harm standard will not apply to most of \nthe information falling under Exemption 4. I will address these \nconcerns, and I appreciate all the time and attention the Senator from \nSouth Dakota has given to this important legislation.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. I thank the Senator from Vermont for his \nwork on this important matter and for working with me to clarify the \nscope of this bill. I hope the Senator from Vermont continues to work \non these issues with the agencies to ensure that this new standard will \nnot serve to undermine the broad protections currently afforded to \nconfidential supervisory information and in turn undermine the \ncooperative relationship between regulators and their supervised \ninstitutions.\n\n[[Page S6443]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/09/senate-section/article/S6443-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MARK PRYOR\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, today we honor the dedicated public \nservice of my dear friend and colleague, Senator Mark Pryor from \nArkansas.\n  For Mark Pryor, public service is a calling--one that goes to the \nroots of who he is. Mark Pryor is the fifth generation in his family to \nserve in public office.\n  Beholden to no party, no special interests, Senator Pryor's singular \nobjective in Washington has been to make lives better for the people of \nthe State his family calls home. The sign on his desk says ``Arkansas \ncomes first.'' It was his father's campaign slogan a generation ago, \nand that's the priority that guided Mark Pryor from the day he arrived \nin the Senate.\n  When Senator Pryor learned that a widow in Greenwood, AR, was being \ndeprived death benefits because her husband died at home, instead of in \ncombat, Senator Pryor crafted an amendment to change that Pentagon \nrule, restoring the full death benefit for the widow--and fixing it \npermanently so it would be available to other surviving spouses.\n  A deeply patriotic man, with a profound respect for those who serve, \nSenator Pryor is the author of the HIRE At Home Act, which encourages \ncompanies to consider military experience for servicemembers reentering \nthe workforce.\n  But he has also fought to bring down the costs of Arkansans' \nprescriptions and to protect the social safety net. When FEMA demanded \nback pay for Federal disaster aid it provided to Arkansas, Senator \nPryor made sure the rule got changed.\n  And I was honored this past year to partner with Senator Pryor on the \nBring Jobs Home Act, to prevent companies from being rewarded for \nshipping jobs overseas and giving them an incentive to bring those jobs \nthat have left our borders back home again.\n  Of course, Senator Pryor served as chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and \nDrug Administration and Related Agencies. So as author of the 2014 Farm \nBill, I relied on Senator Pryor as a partner. He introduced the Forest \nProducts Fairness Act, which helps timber farmers in Arkansas and \nacross the Nation qualify for USDA's BioPreferred Program.\n  During an age of partisan strife, Senator Pryor has provided \nsanctuary for those who seek compromise. I share the sentiment he \nexpressed in his farewell address--it is imperative that we come to \nwork not wearing jerseys of red or blue but ones that have red, white \nand blue.\n  It saddens me that my dear friend, Senator Pryor, cannot join us in \nthis enterprise, because he has truly been a voice of civility and \nreason. But I have no doubt he will find new ways to serve the country \nand the State that he loves.\n  I wish him Godspeed in his future efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/09/senate-section/article/S6443-2", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6443-S6444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SSCI STUDY OF THE CIA'S DETENTION AND INTERROGATION PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to personally commend Senator \nFeinstein for releasing this report today. We have all heard the \nJustice Louis Brandeis quote that ``sunlight is the best disinfectant'' \nbut occasionally we need a real world reminder. Today, Senator \nFeinstein and the members and staff of the Intelligence Committee have \nprovided that. The findings of this report are truly remarkable, laying \nbare that the CIA interrogation program was simultaneously far more \nbrutal and far less effective than previously claimed.\n  This 600-page report is long overdue and makes clear that the CIA's \nso-called ``enhanced interrogation techniques'' failed to produce any \notherwise unavailable intelligence that saved lives. At no time were \nthese coercive interrogation techniques effective.\n  But more critically, this report makes clear to all Americans that \nwhat took place was not in keeping with our ideals as a nation. We have \nno greater duty than to protect the American people and our national \nsecurity. But the single best way to do that is--and always has been--\nto do that in a manner consistent with our laws and our traditions. \nHorrific and torturous practices are explicitly prohibited and are \nnever necessary. I thank Senator Feinstein, Senator Udall and other \nmembers of the committee for the months and years they have committed \nto making this release a reality.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the release of \nthe declassified Senate Select Intelligence Committee report on the \nCIA's past rendition, detention and interrogation practices.\n  As a longtime member of the committee, I strongly support today's \nrelease of the declassified Executive Summary, Findings, Conclusions \nand Additional and Minority Views of the committee's report. With the \nrelease of this report, the American people finally have the \ninformation they need to understand the CIA's interrogation practices \nthat spanned 2001 through 2009, when President Obama put an end to the \nBush-era program.\n  The CIA's practices went against our values as Americans and damaged \nAmerica's global reputation. The committee's report shows not only that \ntorture did not extract the ``otherwise unavailable'' intelligence that \nsome CIA officials claimed, it did not work as a policy or in practice.\n  I have consistently opposed the repugnance, legality and efficacy of \ntorture. I supported FBI Director Robert Mueller's directive saying FBI \nagents may not participate in torture. I have repeatedly and publicly \nexpressed my frustration about being lied to and manipulated by some \nCIA officials over many years. As I said during the Intelligence \nCommittee's hearing confirming John Brennan as CIA Director, ``I'm \ngoing to be blunt and this will be no surprise to you, sir--but I've \nbeen on this Committee for more than 10 years, and with the exception \nof Mr. Panetta, I feel I've been jerked around by every CIA Director.''\n  My views against torture have been consistent with those of Senator \nJohn McCain, whose stance against torture is particularly compelling \ngiven his own experiences as a prisoner of war. I have also supported \nthe use of interrogation techniques as laid out in the Army Field \nManual and have decried the use of contractors by the CIA in the \ntorture of detainees.\n  Some people have raised concerns about the timing of the release of \nthis report and that our enemies could use it as a pretext for \nviolence. Long before the release of this report, however, terrorist \ngroups made their violent intentions towards America clear. They hate \nAmerica and our freedoms. They use violence for the sake of violence. \nNo public action is without risks, whether by President or Congress, \nbut we also risk who we are as Americans by suppressing the facts in \nthis report.\n  I would like to reiterate that this report was reviewed and redacted \nin conjunction with the CIA and White House, and the Director of \nNational Intelligence approved its declassification. It was a difficult \nprocess that took over a year, but we finally got to a place where the \nnarrative of the report was adequately preserved while ensuring that \nCIA personnel and operations were not compromised. The DNI weighed the \nrisks and ultimately certified the declassification of the report.\n  To be clear, my support for this report in no way diminishes my \nrespect for the men and women of the CIA, who are faithfully and \nlegally doing their duties. The CIA's intelligence professionals put \ntheir lives at risk for our country. They deserve our support and \nrespect.\n  I would like to thank Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman \nDianne Feinstein for her leadership, as well as my committee colleagues \nfrom both sides of the aisle who supported this investigation. \nThroughout the frustrating and sometimes contentious process of \nproducing this report, we never gave up on pursuing the truth. Thanks \nalso to the committee staff who worked tirelessly on this report at \ngreat sacrifice to themselves and their families.\n  This report sheds light on a complicated episode in America's \nhistory, but it is also a testament to the value of never giving up on \nthe search for truth and accountability. I hope that future generations \nwill read it, study it, learn from it and make sure that torture is \nnever again used by the U.S. government.\n\n[[Page S6444]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/09/senate-section/article/S6444-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO CLEMENCIA SPIZZIRRI\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to take this time to honor \nan extraordinary Iowa teacher who has had a positive impact on a great \nmany students. Ms. Clemencia Spizzirri was recently announced as the \n2015 Iowa Teacher of the Year. This award honors the great work she has \ndone as a foreign language teacher at Merrill Middle School in Des \nMoines, IA.\n  Ms. Spizzirri has been teaching Spanish to eager young minds at \nMerrill Middle School for 5 years. Despite her relatively short time \nthere, her profound impact is evident. The high praise she receives \nfrom her students, colleagues, and community members are a testament to \nthe work ethic and passion she displays in her classroom every \nschoolday.\n  As an immigrant herself, Ms. Spizzirri embodies the importance of a \nbroad-based education that helps students understand the world beyond \ntheir own country. Born in Quito, Ecuador's capital city, Ms. Clemencia \nwas the youngest of seven children. She learned quickly that success \nwas nearly impossible without a quality education. This drove her to \nbecome a teacher. She witnessed firsthand the struggles that accompany \npoverty and knew she could make a difference through teaching. She \nstarted her career teaching English in Quito. When the conditions in \nher country began to worsen, she obtained a visa and moved to the \nUnited States. After immigrating to this country, Ms. Spizzirri \nreceived a bachelor's degree in New York. She then moved to Des Moines, \nIA, where she received her master's degree from Drake University.\n  Ms. Spizzirri attributes her passion for educating young minds to \nunfortunate circumstances she has witnessed in her own life. This \npassion ensures a quality education for all her students and \ncontributes well-rounded citizens to the community. Great teachers are \nan invaluable resource to all of our communities and Ms. Spizzirri \ndeserves nothing but praise for her tremendous work. I thank Ms. \nSpizzirri for her service to the people of her community and wish her \nnothing but the best in her future school years and beyond.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/09/senate-section/article/S6444-2", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING MARK HESSE\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I wish to remember an \nupstanding Coloradan and accomplished mountaineer who passed away \nunexpectedly this year while doing what he was so passionate about: \nclimbing. Mark Hesse was a man of exceptional character, exhibited a \nstrong sense of adventure, and was a devoted admirer of nature; all of \nwhich are qualities of a true conservationist. He was an inspiration to \nmany of us in the great State of Colorado.\n  Mark grew up in Colorado Springs, CO, where he became an Eagle Scout. \nUpon graduating from the University of Colorado at Boulder with a \nmaster's degree in special education and teaching, Mark took to \ntraveling abroad in pursuit of climbing peaks around the world. In \n1976, he became the first person to climb the completely vertical \nsoutheast face of Mount Asgard on Baffin Island. In 1986, he made the \nfirst ascent up the northeast buttress of Kangtega in Nepal, a \nprominent Himalayan peak with a summit of over 20,000 feet. These \nascents, among countless others, inspired him to advocate for \nconservation and accomplish so much for Colorado's environment.\n  He is survived by Julie Asmuth, his wife of 30 years, his two \ndaughters Hartley and Laurel, his mother Florence, brothers Jon, Paul, \nPhil, and sisters Anne Ness and Maria Hesse Vasey.\n  Mark was a loyal and devoted husband and father. He had a warm \npersonality and a great sense of humor. He also had an amazing knack \nfor turning ordinary outings into epic adventures, and thus was well \nknown for adventure stories that seemed almost too absurd to be true. \nThese qualities enabled him to inspire and educate his children and \ntheir peers, as well as the friends and colleagues he had through \nclimbing and service projects he was part of. Mark was devoted to \ntaking his family on trips to some of the most remote places possible, \nincluding the rainforests in South America and the ocean reefs of South \nEast Asia. He believed in supporting ecotourism and educating himself \nand his family about different cultures and natural wonders of the \nworld before they disappeared.\n  Mark loved the environment, believed in a higher standard for \nmanaging public spaces, and was committed to preserving the natural \nbeauty of our great Nation. He received several distinguished awards \nfor his work, such as the American Alpine Club's David Brower Award for \nMountain Conservation in 1995, the Bob Marshall Champion of Wilderness \nAward presented by the U.S. Forest Service in 2005 and 2007, and the \nU.S. Bureau of Land Management's Making a Difference National Volunteer \nAward for outstanding service on public lands in 2014. He was the co-\nfounder and executive director of the Santa Fe Mountain Center from \n1977 to 1980, the program director of the Southwest Outward Bound \nSchool, and co-founder of the Colorado Fourteeners Initiative Program. \nHe worked with the Bureau of Land Management to preserve two popular \nclimbing destinations: Shelf Road and Penitente Canyon. Perhaps most \nnotably, Mark founded the Rocky Mountain Field Institute in 1982, which \nhas engaged more than 16,000 volunteers to contribute 200,000 hours to \npublic land stewardship projects. These efforts amounted to more than \n$4 million in on-the-ground restoration efforts.\n  One of Mark's final projects, and a dream he had been nurturing for \nmany years, was to create a hot-shot trail crew with high-end rock \nworking skills that could build climbing access trails in the steep, \nrocky, and unstable terrain where climbers travel. At the time of his \npassing, Mark was collaborating with the Boulder Climbing Community and \nthe Access Fund, two non-profits based in Boulder, to develop the Front \nRange Climbing Stewards trail crew. The project moved forward, inspired \nby Mark's lifetime of work, and in 2014 the trail crew performed more \nthan $120,000 worth of work, in both Eldorado Canyon and the Flatirons, \nincluding the spectacular rebuild of the iconic Royal Arch Trail that \nwas destroyed in the flood of 2013.\n  Colorado lost an irreplaceable individual with the passing of Mark \nHesse. I, along with many others, have lost a respected leader, \nvisionary, and friend. Let his life be a reminder of what every \nAmerican is capable of accomplishing.\n  I ask that my colleagues join me in remembering Mark Hesse for his \npassion for the outdoors, his vast wealth of experiences, and his \nleadership in showing us how to be good stewards of our public lands.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/09/senate-section/article/S6444-3", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO CHARLES NIX\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN.

PATRICK SCHOOL\n\n Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, I wish to applaud St. Patrick \nSchool of Chesterton, IN for being recognized as a 2014 National Blue \nRibbon School by the U.S. Department of Education.\n  Established in 1982, the National Blue Ribbon Schools program has \nrecognized over 7,000 public and nonpublic schools that demonstrate a \nvision of educational excellence for all students, regardless of their \nsocial or economic\n\n[[Page S6445]]\n\nbackground. Since its inception, this program has offered the \nopportunity for schools in every State to gain recognition for \neducational accomplishments in closing the achievement gaps among \nstudent groups.\n  Recognition as a National Blue Ribbon School by the U.S. Department \nof Education is based on a school being measured as either an \n``Exemplary High Performing School''--where schools are among the \nState's highest scorers in English and mathematics--or as an \n``Exemplary Achievement Gap Closing School''--where schools with at \nleast 40 percent of their student body coming from disadvantaged \nbackgrounds have reduced the achievement gap in English and mathematics \nwithin the last 5 years. St. Patrick School has made great strides in \nthe area of improved proficiency in both English and mathematics.\n  As a Four Star School, St. Patrick's takes great care to integrate \nelements of Catholic faith into its curriculum. Consisting of strong \nmorals, a deeply rooted faith in community, and a strong sense of \nrespectful conduct, the staff at St. Patrick challenges its students to \nput their faith into action through community service and social \nengagement on global issues.\n  I wish to acknowledge Principal Richard John Rupcich of St. Patrick \nSchool, the entire staff, and the student body. It undoubtedly took \nhard work and dedication to achieve this prestigious award.\n  On behalf of the citizens of Indiana, I congratulate St. Patrick \nSchool, and I wish them continued success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/09/senate-section/article/S6445-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DONALD LINDBERG\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as a member of the Senate who has \nspent many years leading efforts to build support for biomedical \nresearch and improved public health, I would like to pay tribute to a \ngreat public servant and trailblazer in medical informatics, Donald \nA.B. Lindberg, Director of the National Library of Medicine, NLM, the \nworld's largest biomedical library, and a part of the National \nInstitutes of Health. Dr. Lindberg recently announced that he will \nretire next year after over 30 years of distinguished public service.\n  Trained as a pathologist, Dr. Lindberg is recognized worldwide as a \npioneer in medical information technology, artificial intelligence, \ncomputer-aided medical diagnosis and electronic health records. When \nDr. Lindberg joined NLM in 1984, the library had no electronic \njournals, personal computers were few and far between, and only a \nrelatively small number of research institutions had access to the \nInternet. Today millions of scientists, health professionals, and \nmembers of the public use NLM's high-quality electronic information \nresources billions of times a year.\n  Dr. Lindberg arrived at NLM with a belief in the potential of \nadvanced computing and telecommunications. He immediately launched the \ngroundbreaking Unified Medical Language System, now broadly used to \nhelp computer systems behave as if they understand biomedical meaning. \nHe also greatly expanded NLM's informatics research training programs, \nincreasing the Nation's supply of informatics researchers and health \ninformation technology leaders. The library, its grantees, and its \nformer trainees continue to play essential roles in the development of \nelectronic health records, health data standards, and the exchange of \nhealth information.\n  One of the proudest achievements of Dr. Lindberg's tenure was the \nestablishment of the National Center for Biotechnology Information, \nNCBI, in 1988. It expanded the scope of the NLM and provided a national \nresource for molecular biology information and essential support for \nmapping the human genome. Today, NCBI is home to GenBank, dbGaP, \nPubChem, and PubMed Central and is an indispensable international \nrepository and software tool developer for genetic sequences and other \ngenomic data, and a pioneer and leader in linking data and published \nresearch results to promote new scientific discoveries.\n  In another unprecedented move, Dr. Lindberg asked NLM to create the \nVisible Humans, a library of digital images representing the complete \nanatomy of a man and a woman--giving a unique and detailed look inside \nthe body. People around the world can and do use the images in a \nvariety of ways. They have been used to help students learn anatomy; to \ndevelop products like artificial limbs; and to create tools to help \nsurgeons rehearse operations.\n  As access to the World Wide Web and the Internet spread throughout \nthe country, Dr. Lindberg seized the opportunity to make high quality \nmedical information freely available to the public. In a 1997 press \nbriefing that I sponsored with the late Senator Arlen Specter, R-PA, \nand then Vice President Al Gore, we announced free Internet access to \nMEDLINE via PubMed. In 1998, Dr. Lindberg went on to create the \nconsumer-friendly MedlinePlus.gov and a new era of timely and trusted \nonline health information for the general public began. \nClinicalTrials.gov, now the world's largest trial registry and a unique \nsource of summary results data for many trials, followed soon after in \n2000, providing patients, families and members of the public easy \naccess to information about the location of clinical trials, their \ndesign and purpose, and criteria for participation.\n  In 2003, I again joined the NLM and the National Institute on Aging \nin launching NIHSeniorHealth.gov, a website that features \nauthoritative, up-to-date information from the NIH, in a format that \naddresses the cognitive changes that come with aging and allows easy \nuse. In that same year, I partnered with Dr. Lindberg and respected \nnational physician groups to launch the Information Rx project, which \nsupplies prescription pads to health providers to point their patients \nto trusted health care information from the NIH. At the urging of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee, Dr. Lindberg has also made high-\nquality health information available to physicians and their patients \nvia NIH's first consumer magazine, NIH MedlinePlus. This free magazine \nis now available in Spanish and online around the Nation and worldwide.\n  Over the past three decades, Dr. Lindberg greatly expanded the scope \nof the National Network of Libraries of Medicine. Now, NLM and this \nnetwork of more than 6,000 academic, hospital, and public libraries \npartner with community-based organizations to bring high-quality \ninformation to health professionals and the public-regardless of \nlocation, socioeconomic status or access to computers and \ntelecommunications. NLM has entered into longstanding and successful \npartnerships with minority-serving institutions, tribal and community-\nbased organizations, and the public health community. NLM's marvelous \nexhibitions which Dr. Lindberg championed, such as Native Voices: \nNative Peoples' Concepts of Health and Illness, expand NLM's reach with \nelectronic and traveling versions, bringing important issues and \nscholarship to persons unable to make it through NLM's Bethesda doors. \nMoreover, Dr. Lindberg helped set the U.S. standards for the public's \nuse of the Internet. He was the founding Director of the National \nCoordination Office for High Performance Computing and Communications \nin the President's Office of Science and Technology Policy and was \nnamed by the HHS Secretary to be the U.S. National Coordinator for the \nG-7 Global healthcare Applications Project.\n  It gives me great pleasure pay tribute to Dr. Donald A.B. Lindberg, \none of this country's visionaries, for his many contributions in \nscience and technology that have transformed access to biomedical \ninformation and clearly had a lasting positive impact on the \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/09/senate-section/article/S6445-2", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6445-S6446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO COLONEL ROBERT J. McALEER\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to my \nconstituent COL Robert J. McAleer for his exemplary dedication to duty \nand his service to the U.S. Army and to the United States of America. \nHe has served his last 2 years in the Army as Chief of the Army's \nSenate Liaison Division, representing the Army on Capitol Hill.\n  A native of Washington State, Colonel McAleer earned a commission as \na distinguished graduate from the U.S. Military Academy in 1988. \nColonel McAleer has served in a broad range of challenging operational \nassignments and an unusually diverse set of Army units: cannon \nartillery, rocket and missile, air defense, light infantry, cavalry, \nRanger, Special Forces, and Stryker.\n\n[[Page S6446]]\n\n  Colonel McAleer spent more than a decade overseas, including two \ntours each in Germany and Korea, and two 15-month tours in Iraq. As a \nlieutenant, he completed critical assignments in austere locations on \nthe Demilitarized Zone in Korea. As a captain and major with the Army \nSpecial Operations Command, he participated in the detention of Bosnian \nwar criminals, served as a fire support officer for twenty AC-130 \ngunship and similar missions in Kosovo, an operation to rescue American \nhostages in South America, and numerous exercises that served as \nblueprints for post-9/11 operations. In Iraq, as battalion operations \nofficer and, later, Squadron Commander, he worked to secure dangerous \nareas in southwest Baghdad, Abu Ghraib, and then Diyala Province. His \nunits were marked by their discipline, determination, purposeful \noperations, and focus on the needs of the civilian population. He led \nefforts in intelligence, governance, essential services, and \nreconciliation. As a colonel, serving as Chief of Future Operations for \nCombined Forces Command in Korea, he synchronized the U.S. and South \nKorean response to North Korea's artillery shelling of Yong Pyong \nIsland, the death of Kim Jong Il, and a North Korean ballistic missile \nlaunch. He led major joint and international planning efforts on the \nKorean Peninsula to prepare military forces and governments for \ncontingencies, especially in the areas of rear area logistics, \nnoncombatant evacuation, and countering and preventing the use of \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  With the exception of his current assignment as an Army legislative \nliaison, Colonel McAleer spent his entire career in combat units, \neither in command or operations positions. He spent 6 years in command \nof four units: Bravo Battery 1-39 Field Artillery, Airborne; Bravo \nBattery 1-321 Field Artillery, Airborne; 2nd Battalion, 8th Field \nArtillery; and Fires Squadron, 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment. A \nsoldier's soldier, focused on his assigned mission and the wellbeing of \nthose under his command, he touched thousands of lives, developing \ncountless leaders and young soldiers in his units.\n  On behalf of a grateful nation, I join my colleagues today in \nrecognizing and commending Colonel McAleer for over 26 years of service \nto his country. He played a key role in defending our national \ninterests while positively impacting the soldiers and families under \nhis command. He has been an excellent Army liaison to the Senate. We \nwish Bob, his wife Kate, daughter Catherine, and son Colin all the best \nas they continue their journey of service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/09/senate-section/article/S6446-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6446-S6447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:02 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 229.

Personnel ceiling adjustments\n       Section 103 is intended to provide additional flexibility \n     to the DNI in managing the civilian personnel of the \n     Intelligence Community (IC). Section 103 provides that the \n     DNI may authorize employment of civilian personnel in Fiscal \n     Year 2015 in excess of the number of authorized positions by \n     an amount not exceeding three percent of the total limit \n     applicable to each IC element under Section 102. The DNI may \n     do so only if necessary to the performance of important \n     intelligence functions.\n     Section 104. Intelligence Community Management Account\n       Section 104 authorizes appropriations for the Intelligence \n     Community Management Account (ICMA) of the DNI and sets the \n     authorized personnel levels for the elements within the ICMA \n     for Fiscal Year 2015.\n\n Title II--Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System\n\n     Section 201. Authorization of appropriations\n       Section 201 authorizes appropriations in the amount of \n     $514,000,000 for Fiscal Year 2015 for the Central \n     Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability Fund.\n\n                     Title III--General Provisions\n\n\n                      subtitle a--general matters\n\n     Section 301. Increase in employee compensation and benefits \n         authorized by law\n       Section 301 provides that funds authorized to be \n     appropriated by the Act for salary, pay, retirement, and \n     other benefits for federal employees may be increased by such \n     additional or supplemental amounts as may be necessary for \n     increases in compensation or benefits authorized by law.\n     Section 302. Restriction on conduct of intelligence \n         activities\n       Section 302 provides that the authorization of \n     appropriations by the Act shall not be deemed to constitute \n     authority for the conduct of any intelligence activity that \n     is not otherwise authorized by the Constitution or laws of \n     the United States.\n     Section 303. National intelligence strategy\n       Section 303 amends the National Security Act of 1947 to \n     require the DNI to develop a comprehensive national \n     intelligence strategy every four years beginning in 2017.\n     Section 304. Software licensing\n       Section 304 amends Section 109 of the National Security Act \n     of 1947, which requires chief information officers within the \n     IC to prepare biennial inventories and assessments concerning \n     the use and procurement of software licenses, to make certain \n     enhancements to the biennial assessments required under \n     Section 109.\n     Section 305. Reporting of certain employment activities by \n         former intelligence officers and employees\n       Section 305 requires the head of each element of the IC to \n     issue regulations that require an employee occupying \n     positions with access to particularly sensitive information \n     within such element to sign a written agreement that requires \n     the regular reporting of any employment by, representation \n     of, or the provision of advice relating to national security \n     to the government of a foreign country, or any person whose \n     activities are supervised, directed, controlled, financed, or \n     subsidized by any government of a foreign country, for a two-\n     year period after the employee ceases employment with the IC \n     element.\n     Section 306. Inclusion of Predominantly Black Institutions in \n         intelligence officer training program\n       Section 306 amends the National Security Act of 1947 to \n     include predominantly black institutions in the intelligence \n     officer training programs established under Section 1024 of \n     the Act.\n     Section 307. Management and oversight of financial \n         intelligence\n       Section 307 requires the DNI to prepare a plan for \n     management of the elements of the IC that carry out financial \n     intelligence activities.\n     Section 308. Analysis of private sector policies and \n         procedures for countering insider threats\n       Section 308 directs the DNI to submit to the congressional \n     intelligence committees an analysis of private sector \n     policies and procedures for countering insider threats.\n     Section 309. Procedures for the retention of incidentally \n         acquired communications\n       Section 309 requires the head of each element of the IC to \n     adopt Attorney General-approved procedures that govern the \n     retention of nonpublic telephone or electronic communications \n     acquired without consent of a person who is a party to the \n     communications, including communications in electronic \n     storage.\n       The procedures required under this section shall apply to \n     any intelligence activity that is reasonably anticipated to \n     result in the acquisition of such telephone or electronic \n     communications to or from a United States person not \n     otherwise authorized by court order, subpoena, or similar \n     legal process, regardless of the location where the \n     collection occurs. The procedures shall prohibit the \n     retention of such telephone or electronic communications for \n     a period in excess of five years, unless the communications \n     are determined to fall within one of several categories, \n     enumerated in subsection (b)(3)(B), for which retention in \n     excess of five years is authorized, to include communications \n     that have been affirmatively determined to constitute foreign \n     intelligence or counterintelligence, communications that are \n     reasonably believed to constitute evidence of a crime and are \n     retained by a law enforcement agency, and communications that \n     are enciphered or reasonably believed to have a secret \n     meaning.\n       Because it may be necessary in certain instances for IC \n     elements to retain communications covered by this section for \n     a period in excess of five years that do not fall into the \n     categories specifically enumerated in subsection (b)(3)(B), \n     subsection (b)(3)(B)(vii) provides flexibility for the head \n     of each element of the intelligence community to authorize \n     such extended retention where the head of the element \n     determines that it is necessary to protect the national \n     security of the United States. In the absence of such a \n     determination, Section 309 is intended to establish a default \n     rule for intelligence collection activities, not otherwise \n     authorized by legal process, that requires agencies to delete \n     communications covered by this section after five years, \n     unless a determination is made that the communications \n     constitute foreign intelligence or counterintelligence or \n     otherwise meet the retention requirements set forth in this \n     section.\n     Section 310. Clarification of limitation of review to \n         retaliatory security clearance or access determinations\n       Section 310 makes a technical amendment to Section \n     3001(b)(7) of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \n     Prevention Act of 2004 to clarify that the policies and \n     procedures prescribed by that section (to permit individuals \n     to appeal adverse security clearance or access \n     determinations) are only required to apply to adverse \n     security clearance or access determinations alleged to be in \n     reprisal for having made a protected whistleblower \n     disclosure.\n     Section 311. Feasibility study on consolidating classified \n         databases of cyber threat indicators and malware samples\n       Section 307 requires the DNI to conduct a feasibility study \n     on consolidating classified databases of cyber threat \n     indicators and malware samples in the IC and to provide a \n     report to the congressional intelligence committees \n     summarizing the feasibility study.\n     Section 312. Sense of Congress on cybersecurity threat and \n         cybercrime cooperation with Ukraine\n       Section 312 expresses the sense of Congress concerning \n     cybersecurity threat and\n\n[[Page S6465]]\n\n     cybercrime cooperation between the United States and Ukraine.\n     Section 313. Replacement of locally employed staff serving at \n         United States diplomatic faculties in the Russian \n         Federation\n       Section 313 requires the Secretary of State to ensure that \n     every supervisory position at a U.S. diplomatic facility in \n     the Russian Federation is occupied by a citizen of the United \n     States who has passed a background check and to provide \n     Congress with a plan to further reduce reliance on locally \n     employed staff.\n     Section 314. Inclusion of Sensitive Compartmented Information \n         Facilities in United States diplomatic facilities in the \n         Russian Federation and adjacent countries\n       Section 314 requires that each U.S. diplomatic facility \n     that is constructed in, or undergoes a construction upgrade \n     in, the Russian Federation, any country that shares a land \n     border with the Russian Federation, or any country that is a \n     former member of the Soviet Union, shall be constructed to \n     include a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility. The \n     Secretary of State may waive the requirements of this section \n     upon a determination that it is in the national security \n     interest of the United States.\n\n\n                         subtitle b--reporting\n\n     Section 321. Report on declassification process\n       Section 321 requires the DNI to submit a report to Congress \n     describing proposals to improve the declassification process \n     and steps the IC could take or legislation that may be \n     necessary, to enable the National Declassification Center to \n     better accomplish the missions assigned to the Center by \n     Executive Order 13526.\n     Section 322. Report on intelligence community efficient \n         spending targets\n       Section 322 requires the DNI to submit a report to the \n     congressional intelligence committees on the status and \n     effectiveness of efforts to reduce administrative costs for \n     the IC during the preceding year.\n     Section 323. Annual report on violations of law or executive \n         order\n       Section 323 requires the DNI to report annually to the \n     congressional intelligence committees on violations of law or \n     executive order by personnel of an element of the IC that \n     were identified during the previous calendar year. Under the \n     National Security Act, the President is required to keep the \n     congressional intelligence committees fully and currently \n     informed of the intelligence activities of the United States \n     government. Nonetheless, this annual reporting requirement is \n     necessary to ensure that the intelligence oversight \n     committees of the House and Senate are made fully aware of \n     violations of law or executive order, including, in \n     particular, violations of Executive order 12333 for \n     activities not otherwise subject to the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act.\n     Section 324. Annual report on intelligence activities of the \n         Department of Homeland Security\n       Section 324 requires the Under Secretary for Intelligence \n     and Analysis of the DHS to provide the congressional \n     intelligence committees with a report on each intelligence \n     activity of each intelligence component of the Department \n     that includes, among other things, the amount of funding \n     requested, the number of full-time employees, and the number \n     of full-time contractor employees. In addition, Section 324 \n     requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit to the \n     congressional intelligence committees a report that examines \n     the feasibility and advisability of consolidating the \n     planning, programming, and resourcing of such activities \n     within the Homeland Security Intelligence Program (HSIP).\n       The HSIP budget was established to fund those intelligence \n     activities that principally support missions of the DHS \n     separately from those of the NIP. To date, however, this \n     mechanism has only been used to supplement the budget for the \n     office of Intelligence and Analysis. It has not been used to \n     fund the activities of the non-IC components in the DHS that \n     conduct intelligence-related activities. As a result, there \n     is no comprehensive reporting to Congress regarding the \n     overall resources and personnel required in support of the \n     Department's intelligence activities.\n     Section 325. Report on political prison camps in North Korea\n       Section 325 requires the DNI to submit a report on \n     political prison camps in North Korea to the congressional \n     intelligence committees.\n     Section 326. Assessment of security of domestic oil \n         refineries and related rail transportation infrastructure\n       Section 326 requires the Under Secretary of Homeland \n     Security for Intelligence and Analysis to conduct an \n     intelligence assessment of the security of domestic oil \n     refineries and related rail transportation infrastructure.\n     Section 327. Enhanced contractor level assessments for the \n         intelligence community\n       Section 327 amends the National Security Act of 1947 to \n     require that the annual personnel level assessments for the \n     IC, required under Section 506B of the Act, include a \n     separate estimate of the number of intelligence collectors \n     and analysts contracted by each element of the IC and a \n     description of the functions performed by such contractors.\n     Section 328. Assessment of the efficacy of memoranda of \n         understanding to facilitate intelligence-sharing\n       Section 328 requires the Under Secretary of Homeland \n     Security for Intelligence and Analysis to provide appropriate \n     congressional committees with an assessment of the efficacy \n     of the memoranda of understanding signed between Federal, \n     State, local, tribal, and territorial agencies to facilitate \n     intelligence-sharing within and separate from the Joint \n     Terrorism Task Force. This study should help identify any \n     obstacles to intelligence sharing between agencies, \n     particularly any obstacles that might have impeded \n     intelligence sharing in the wake of the April 2013 bombing of \n     the Boston Marathon, and find improvements to existing \n     intelligence sharing relationships.\n     Section 329. Report on foreign man-made electromagnetic pulse \n         weapons\n       Section 329 requires the DNI to provide appropriate \n     congressional committees with a report on the threat posed by \n     manmade electromagnetic pulse weapons to United States \n     interests through 2025.\n     Section 330. Report on United States counterterrorism \n         strategy to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al-Qaeda and \n         its affiliated or associated groups\n       Section 330 requires the DNI to provide appropriate \n     congressional committees with a report on the United States \n     counterterrorism strategy to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat \n     al Qaeda and its affiliated or associated groups.\n     Section 331. Feasibility study on retraining veterans in \n         cybersecurity\n       Section 331 requires the DNI to submit to Congress a \n     feasibility study on retraining veterans and retired members \n     of elements of the IC in cybersecurity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/09/senate-section/article/S6465-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6465-S6466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DENOUNCING THE USE OF CIVILIANS AS HUMAN SHIELDS BY HAMAS AND OTHER \n TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS IN VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW\n\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 616, H. Con. \nRes. 107.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the concurrent \nresolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 107) denouncing the \n     use of civilians as human shields by Hamas and other \n     terrorist organizations in violation of international \n     humanitarian law.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution, which had been reported from the Committee on \nForeign Relations, with an amendment and an amendment to the preamble \nand an amendment to the title.\n  (Strike out all after the resolving clause and insert the part \nprinted in italic.)\n  (Strike the preamble and insert the part printed in italic.)\n\n                            H. Con. Res. 107\n\n       Whereas the use of human shields is unconscionable and \n     morally unacceptable;\n       Whereas since June 15, 2014, there have been over 2,000 \n     rockets fired by Hamas and other terrorist organizations from \n     Gaza into Israel;\n       Whereas Hamas uses civilian populations as human shields by \n     placing their missile batteries in densely populated areas \n     and near schools, hospitals, and mosques;\n       Whereas Israel dropped leaflets, made announcements, placed \n     phone calls, and sent text messages to the Palestinian people \n     in Gaza warning them in advance that an attack was imminent, \n     and went to extraordinary lengths to target only terrorist \n     actors and to minimize collateral damage;\n       Whereas Hamas urged the residents of Gaza to ignore the \n     Israeli warnings and to remain in their houses and encouraged \n     Palestinians to gather on the roofs of their homes to act as \n     human shields;\n       Whereas on July 23, 2014, the 46-Member UN Human Rights \n     Council passed a resolution to form a commission of inquiry \n     over Israel's operations in Gaza that completely fails to \n     condemn Hamas for its indiscriminate rocket attacks and its \n     unconscionable use of human shields, with the United States \n     being the lone dissenting vote;\n       Whereas public reports have cited the role of Iran and \n     Syria in providing material support and training to Hamas and \n     other terrorist groups carrying out rocket and mortar attacks \n     from Gaza;\n       Whereas throughout the summer of 2006 conflict between the \n     State of Israel and the terrorist organization Hezbollah, \n     Hezbollah forces utilized innocent civilians as human \n     shields;\n       Whereas al Qaeda, Al-Shabaab, Islamic State of Iraq and the \n     Levant (ISIL), and other foreign terrorist organizations \n     typically use innocent civilians as human shields;\n       Whereas the United States and Israel have cooperated on \n     missile defense projects, including Iron Dome, David's Sling, \n     and the Arrow Anti-Missile System, projects designed to \n     thwart a diverse range of threats, including short-range \n     missiles and rockets fired by non-state actors, such as \n     Hamas;\n       Whereas the United States provided $460,000,000 in fiscal \n     year 2014 for Iron Dome research, development, and \n     production;\n\n[[Page S6466]]\n\n       Whereas, during the most recent rocket attacks from Gaza, \n     Iron Dome successfully intercepted dozens of rockets that \n     were launched against Israeli population centers; and\n       Whereas 5,000,000 Israelis are currently living under the \n     threat of rocket attacks from Gaza: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate \n     concurring),\n       That Congress--\n       (1) strongly condemns the use of innocent civilians as \n     human shields;\n       (2) calls on the international community to recognize and \n     condemn Hamas' use of human shields;\n       (3) places responsibility for the rocket attacks against \n     Israel on Hamas and other terrorist organizations, such as \n     Palestine Islamic Jihad;\n       (4) supports the sovereign right of the Government of \n     Israel to defend its territory and its citizens from Hamas' \n     rocket attacks, kidnapping attempts, and the use of tunnels \n     and other means to carry out attacks against Israel;\n       (5) expresses condolences to the families of the innocent \n     victims on both sides of the conflict;\n       (6) supports Palestinian civilians who reject Hamas and all \n     forms of terrorism and violence, desiring to live in peace \n     with their Israeli neighbors;\n       (7) supports efforts to demilitarize the Gaza Strip, \n     removing Hamas's means to target Israel, including its use of \n     tunnels, rockets, and other means; and\n       (8) condemns the United Nations Human Rights Council's \n     biased resolution establishing a commission of inquiry into \n     Israel's Gaza operations.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. I ask unanimous consent that the committee-reported \namendment to the resolution be agreed to, the resolution, as amended, \nbe agreed to, and that the committee-reported amendment to the preamble \nbe agreed to, the preamble, as amended, be agreed to, and that the \ncommittee-reported amendment to the title be agreed to, and that the \nmotions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
