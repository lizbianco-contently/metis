Mr. President, I want to start today by reading a few \nquotes on the issue of campaign finance reform. Here is the first one \nfrom 1987:\n\n       What we ought to do is eliminate the political action \n     committee contributions because those are the ones that raise \n     the specter of undue influence. And those can be gone \n     tomorrow. We can pass a bill tomorrow to take care of that \n     problem.\n\n  Another quote from the next year:\n\n       We Republicans have put together a responsible and \n     constitutional campaign reform agenda. It would restrict the \n     power of special interest PACs, stop the flow of all soft \n     money, keep wealthy individuals from buying public office.\n\n  Two years later, 1990:\n\n       We would eliminate PACs altogether. It would be interesting \n     to see whether our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \n     will be willing to eliminate PACs altogether. And we would \n     have the money come from individuals in small and fully \n     disclosed amounts.\n\n  A few years later, 1997:\n\n       Public disclosure of campaign contributions and spending \n     should be expedited so voters can judge for themselves what \n     is appropriate. These are reforms which respect the \n     Constitution and would enhance our democracy.\n\n  Three years later, in 2000, another quote:\n\n       We need to have real disclosure. And so what we ought to do \n     is broaden the disclosure to include at least labor unions \n     and tax-exempt business associations and trial lawyers so \n     that you include the major political players in America. Why \n     would a little disclosure be better than a lot of disclosure?\n\n  A quote from 2003:\n\n       Money is essential in politics and not something we should \n     feel squeamish about, provided the donations are limited and \n     disclosed, everyone knows who is supporting everyone else.\n\n  So, Mr. President, who did these statements come from? Tom Udall, the \nsponsor of the vote that we had last night? Michael Bennet from \nColorado? He and Tom Udall sponsored the constitutional amendment. Did \nit come from them or some other Democrat?\n  No, that is not the case.\n  Let me quote a few more things:\n\n       Keep wealthy individuals from buying public office and stop \n     the flow of soft money and public campaign contributions and \n     spending should be expedited so voters can judge for \n     themselves what's appropriate.\n\n  Those are quotes. Did these quotes come from Bernie Sanders, who is \nknown as being a liberal? He has been an outspoken advocate for \ncampaign finance reform.\n  The author of these quotes is none other than my friend the \ndistinguished Republican leader, the senior Senator from Kentucky. \nThese are all his quotes word for word. The senior Senator from \nKentucky has a track record of campaign finance reform spanning two \ndecades or more. I was with him\n\n[[Page S5384]]\n\nthere 25 years ago, fighting the undue influence of unlimited campaign \ndonations. I cosponsored his 1989 constitutional amendment that \nwould have given Congress power to enact laws regulating the amount of \nindependent expenditures. I was there with him. But I guess times have \nchanged. I am aware that the Republican leader has stated that his \nviews on the matter of campaign finance have changed over the years. \nWhat a gross understatement. But as Victor Hugo wrote:\n\n       Change your opinions, but keep your principles. Change your \n     leaves, but keep your roots.\n\n  At one time the Republican leader was rooted in the principle that \nthe wealthy shouldn't be able to buy public office whether for \nthemselves or for others. Even as recently as late in 2007 he was \npreaching donor disclosure. What has changed in the last few years?\n  Over the last several years we have witnessed the Koch brothers \ntrying to buy America, to pump untold millions into our democracy, \nhoping to get a government that would serve their bottom line and make \nthem more money. The news today says they are out promoting themselves, \nand that is easy to do because they are worth $150 billion.\n  So we are watching the corrupting influence that the Republican \nleader foretold 27 years ago and many years thereafter before our very \neyes. He switched teams. What could have possibly convinced the senior \nSenator from Kentucky that limitless, untraceable campaign donations \naren't really that bad after all?\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/09/senate-section/article/S5384-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, now that the President has conducted \ninitial consultations with our allies and stated his objective to \ndegrade and destroy ISIL, it is time to present a strategy to Congress. \nI hope he will begin to do that today.\n  He needs to identify military objectives and explain how those ends \nwill be accomplished. He needs to present this plan to Congress and the \nAmerican people, and where the President believes he lacks authority to \nexecute such a strategy, he needs to explain to Congress how additional \nauthority for the use of force will protect America. The threat from \nISIL is real and is growing. It is time for President Obama to exercise \nsome leadership in launching a response.\n  We know the administration has authorized military actions to protect \nAmerican lives. Now we need to hear what additional measures will be \ntaken to defeat ISIL.\n\n\n                           Speech Suppression\n\n  Earlier today one Democratic Senator urged his colleagues to get \nserious about the real challenges facing our country--challenges such \nas dealing with the threat of ISIL. He implored fellow Democrats not to \nfocus all their time instead ``doing things that are of lesser \nimportance.''\n  Yet his voice seems to have been ignored by the Democrats who run the \nSenate, because here we stand debating their proposal on whether to \ntake an eraser--an eraser--to the First Amendment. Here we are debating \nwhether to grant politicians the extraordinary authority to ban speech \nthey don't like. That is what Democratic leaders have brought to the \nfloor this week as their top priority. It is a measure so extreme it \ncould even open the door to government officials banning books and \npamphlets that threaten or annoy them. That is not my argument. That is \nessentially the Obama administration's own position, one that his own \nlawyers advocated in the Supreme Court in the Citizens United case. As \none USA Today columnist put it at the time: ``It isn't often that a \ngovernment lawyer stands before the Supreme Court and acknowledges \nthat, yes, it would be constitutional to ban a book. But that is what \nhappened.''\n  Truly shocking.\n  These are the depths to which the Obama administration and its \nDemocratic majority appear willing to drag our country in order to \nretain their hold on power. They are tired of listening to criticism of \ntheir failed policies. They are sick of having to sell the middle class \non ideas that actually hurt the middle class. And with the Democrats' \nfragile Senate majority hanging by a thread, it seems they are done \nplaying with the normal rules of democracy. It seems they would rather \njust rewrite the rules altogether to shut up their critics and shut \ndown their opponents, even as they continue to give a path to leftwing \ntycoons they like--folks who preach higher taxes and more regulations \nfor everybody else--while jealously guarding pet projects and \nsweetheart deals for themselves.\n\n  The aim here, just as with the IRS scandal, is to use the levers of \npower to shut down the voice of we the people when we the people don't \nsee things their way. The First Amendment is the only thing standing in \nthe way.\n  We all know the real reason Senate Democrats are so determined to \npush this measure now. They are not actually all that serious about \npassing it this week. In fact, they designed it to fail because they \nthink its failure would help turn more leftwingers out to the polls. \nThe entire spectacle is mostly about saving the jobs of Democratic \nSenators come November. Yet it must be admitted that it is getting \nharder to tell which of our Democratic friends are cynical in their \nsupport of this and which are sincere, because the number of true \nbelievers in speech suppression appears to be growing on the other \nside, and that is really worrying for the future of our democracy.\n  So look, if the Democrats who run Washington are so determined to \nforce the Senate into debate over repealing the free speech protections \nof the First Amendment, then fine, let's have a full and proper debate. \nLet's make the country see what this is really all about. Let's expose \nthis extremist effort to the light of public scrutiny.\n  I suspect our Democratic friends don't really want that, though. I \nsuspect they hope to just drop a few talking points, have their \nproposal fail, shoot some indignant e-mails to their supporters and \nmove on. I don't think they counted on Senators standing up for the \nAmerican people. I don't think they counted on Senators exposing their \nplans to entrench the tools of government speech suppression. So they \nwould rather not have a debate they can't win.\n  Then here is a better idea. We all just spent the past several weeks \nback in our home States talking to our constituents. They have a lot on \ntheir minds these days--important issues they expect the Democrat-run \nSenate to address--things such as high unemployment, rising health care \ncosts, and an ongoing crisis at the border. I, for one, will be \ninterested to hear how repealing part of the First Amendment creates \njobs for Americans or reduces health care costs. The answer of course \nis it doesn't, and the Republican-controlled House has already sent \nover countless bills that continue to collect dust on the majority \nleader's desk. There are many bills on job creation alone, including \nlegislation that passed the House, with significant bipartisan support.\n\n  So if Senate Democrats want to take up some of that serious House-\npassed legislation instead of endless designed-to-fail political votes, \nwe will be happy to do it. Just say the word.\n  Let's end the Democrats' endless gridlock and get some bills to the \nPresident's desk for once because Americans are not demanding that \nCongress repeal the free speech protections of the First Amendment. \nThat is certainly not on their minds. They are looking to us to work \ntogether to get some things done for them for a change, and we can as \nsoon as our Democratic friends want to get serious.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I agree with the Republican leader's defense \nof the First Amendment, but the constitutional amendment before us is \nnot about limiting free speech. My Democratic colleagues and I are \ntrying to address the special interest money that threatens to create a \ngovernment of elected officials who are beholden to a few wealthy \nindividuals.\n  As the respected Justice John Paul Stevens recently told us, money is \nnot speech. Of course it isn't, and we know that.\n\n[[Page S5385]]\n\n  Last week there was a recorded speech given at the Koch brothers' \nsecret meeting place in San Diego or thereabouts. It was a secret \nmeeting on their political strategy. They called it a summit. They had \nsecurity guards. They cleared everybody who could come. It was very \ndelicate. You had to be the right person or they would not let you into \nthe meeting. However, there was one person who was able to record what \nwent on at that meeting.\n  One of the speakers who was recorded--no others--was a man by the \nname of Richard Fink, who is vice president of Koch Industries. He is a \nbig shot with the Koch brothers. Of course the Koch brothers were there \nlistening to his speech. He said some pretty terrible and vicious \nthings about unemployed Americans. He basically called them lazy. He \nwent on to say that the minimum wage leads to fascism. I am not making \nthis up. That is what he said--fascism. He even compared minimum wage \nwith tactics utilized by Nazi Germany and modern-day suicide bombers. \nThat is what the Koch brothers' representative said in their presence \nand in the presence of a number of higher ranking Republican officials.\n  He has a right to say whatever he wants; that is the country we live \nin. But as Senators we have a responsibility to stand for constituents \nwho are unemployed or on minimum wage, and on this side of the aisle we \nhave done that. The American people agree with us--not just Democrats \nand Independents. Republicans believe there should be an increase in \nthe minimum wage.\n  The Republican leader was at the summit the very day Mr. Fink made \nhis offensive remarks. He was there. Why has he not gone on Record \nrepudiating these vicious and unfair comments about the poor? In fact, \nit has been reported the Republican leader referred to the speeches \ngiven at the Koch brothers' conference that day as inspiring--\ninspiring.\n  There are 150,000 unemployed Kentuckians. Are they leaning toward \nfascism? There are families in Kentucky who live on minimum wage--or \ntry to. I don't think my friend the Republican leader views them as \nfascist stooges or lazy, but he should stand and repudiate what the \nKoch brothers, through their representatives, said at the conference he \nattended. If any Member of this body said as much, I have no doubt my \nfriend would come to his constituents' immediate defense. But be \ncareful what you say about the Koch brothers. They are very sensitive. \nThey want that to protect their $75 billion. There are two of them, and \ntogether they are worth $150 billion. Nobody messes with them because \nthey have money to try to buy America, and that is what they are trying \nto do.\n  Do we need campaign finance reform? Of course we do. I gave some \nquotes earlier, and my friend the Presiding Officer is a very smart \nman. As well as being a Rhodes Scholar, he graduated from one of the \nmost famous educational institutions in the world, Stanford University. \nHe is a pretty bright guy as a Presiding Officer. But you don't have to \nbe a bright guy to understand the flip-flop. I don't know how else to \ndescribe it. He gave his little speech a minute ago about the First \nAmendment. I am not making this up. This is what the man said. The same \nman complaining about how the First Amendment has been violated is the \nsame man who has sponsored basically the same legislation we are now \ntrying to pass.\n  I will give some of his quotes again. Let's make sure they are spread \nacross the Record.\n\n       What we ought to do is eliminate the political action \n     committee contributions, because those are the ones that \n     raise the specter of undue influence. And those can be gone \n     tomorrow. We can pass a bill tomorrow to take care of that \n     problem.\n\n  Here is another quote:\n\n       We Republicans have put together a responsible and \n     Constitutional campaign reform agenda. It would restrict the \n     power of special interest PACS, stop the flow of all soft \n     money, keep wealthy individuals from buying public office.\n\n  Hallelujah. I am glad he said that.\n  He also said:\n\n       We would eliminate PACs altogether. It will be interesting \n     to see whether our colleagues--\n\n  Talking about Democrats--\n\n     on the other side of the aisle will be willing to eliminate \n     PACs altogether. And we would have the money come from \n     individuals in small and fully undisclosed amounts.\n\n  Next quote:\n\n       Public disclosure of campaign contributions and spending \n     should be expedited so voters can judge for themselves what \n     is appropriate. These are the reforms which respect the \n     Constitution and would enhance our democracy.\n\n  I didn't rewrite this. This is a direct, word-for-word quote. Next:\n\n       We need to have real disclosure. And so what we ought to do \n     is broaden the disclosure to include at least labor unions \n     and tax-exempt business associations and trial lawyers so \n     that you include the major political players in America. Why \n     would a little disclosure be better than a lot of disclosure?\n\n  He also went on to say:\n\n       Money is essential in politics, and not something that we \n     should feel squeamish about, provided the donations are \n     limited and disclosed, everyone knows who's supporting \n     everyone else.\n\n  I repeat. The Presiding Officer is one of the smartest people we have \nin the entire Senate. With all due respect to the Presiding Officer, \nyou don't have to be a Rhodes Scholar or a graduate from Stanford \nUniversity to understand how absolutely irrational my friend is with \nwhat he just came and said. He said this constitutional amendment is \nviolating the First Amendment of our Constitution. I am using his \nremarks to state and show the importance of our amendment.\n  Congress and the States have the authority--or they should have the \nauthority--to set reasonable limits on campaign spending. It is just \ncommon sense. Americans clearly believe in this amendment. The \namendment would restore the authority back to Congress and the States, \nnot to two wealthy brothers who are trying to buy America--two wealthy \nbrothers who control most of the tar sands in the world. They have a \nhuge oil, gas, and chemical interest. They control lots of stuff.\n  Today the paper said they are going to spend their millions to tell \neverybody what great people they are. That is all over the news today. \nBe aware of the Koch brothers because they have unlimited sums of \nmoney. They are going to tell you how they are all about apple pie and \nmotherhood and great for America. They are not great for America. They \nare trying to buy America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/09/senate-section/article/S5385-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, political speech is not on the fringes of the \nFirst Amendment, it is the core freedom of democracy. The entire point \nof the First Amendment is to say the government has no business telling \nthe citizens what constitutes reasonable political speech.\n  Congress is not allowed to ban books. Congress is not allowed to ban \nmagazines or pamphlets. Congress is not allowed to silence dissent. The \nidea behind this amendment is that government should have the power to \nsilence criticism of the government. This amendment, referring to \nSenate Joint Resolution 19, is an attempt to control the words \nAmericans speak and the ideas Americans hear. Every great movement in \nour democracy has been based on ideas that were at one time or another \nat the outset deemed unreasonable by the government. It is dangerous \nand it is un-American in the extreme. Under this proposed amendment, \nthe Federal Government would have the power to decide which groups, \nwhich causes, which arguments, and ultimately which citizens would be \nallowed to enter the public square.\n  The amendment would even empower Congress to distinguish between \nnatural individuals and artificial entities; that is, rich and powerful \npeople will still be free to influence our government but everyone else \ncan be barred\n\n[[Page S5386]]\n\nfrom coming together and pooling their resources for that very purpose.\n  What is an artificial entity with restricted speech rights? Churches, \nneighborhood associations, civic groups, single-issue organizations \nsuch as the national right to life, or NARAL, trade associations, \nbusinesses or labor unions, schools. The target of this amendment is \nAmerica. Civil society. When politicians talk about outside groups, \nthey mean outside Washington. They mean ordinary citizens coming \ntogether, rallying behind a common cause. They mean the abolition \nmovement, the women's suffrage movement, and the labor movement, as \nwell as the civil rights movement, antiwar movements, the pro-life \nmovement, and the consumer rights movement. They mean citizens. That is \nwho the authors of this amendment believe are outside intruders whose \nspeech somehow needs to be regulated, needs to be restricted by \nCongress--people with ideas that are ``unreasonable,'' people such as \nThomas Paine or Thomas Jefferson and Frederick Douglass and Susan B. \nAnthony and Martin Luther King, Jr.\n  The true danger of the idea is even put into the text in the section \n3 carveout for the press. So wealthy individuals, those who happen to \nown newspapers or happen to own a television station or a radio \nnetwork, do, under this proposed amendment, continue to have free \nspeech. But the people who read and watch the media do not. Or the \npeople who do not own those companies, do they not have the same \nrights? Under this proposed amendment, they would not. This is \nOrwellian. Under this amendment, Congress could establish a Federal \nministry of truth of sorts to monitor the political speech of citizens \nand make sure they are reasonable, to make sure the activities in which \nthey engage, those that are attempted to influence elections, are, in \nfact, reasonable.\n  Congress would, of course, be empowered to define what constitutes \njournalism, what falls within the parameters of this freedom of the \npress carveout so that irritating bloggers and reporters and producers \ncould perhaps be silenced, assuming they were carved out of that \ndefinition. This provision will not guarantee equality. It will rather \nguarantee inequality.\n  It is right there in the text of the amendment. Some citizens' rights \nto free speech would be more equal than others under this proposed \namendment. It is sometimes appealing at a surface level to start from \nthe proposition that something such as this might be desirable to some \nfor the simple reason that we do not want any one person or any one \ngroup of persons having a disproportionate impact on the electoral \nprocess. We do not want anyone or anything to be able to buy an \nelection. But that misses the point. This would not solve that problem. \nIn fact, this would make that problem worse.\n  Consider, for example, the fact that under this proposed amendment, \nas I read it, and as I think most would read it, an individual would be \nfree to spend unlimited amounts of money, thousands, tens of thousands, \nhundreds of thousands, maybe even millions or tens of millions of \ndollars supporting the candidate of her choice if that individual \nhappens to own a newspaper or if that individual perhaps happened to \nown a television company or a radio broadcast network. That would be no \nproblem. That would be beyond the scope of this proposed amendment, \nbecause under section 3 of Senate Joint Resolution 19, it makes clear \nthat: ``Nothing in this article shall be construed to grant Congress or \nthe States the power to abridge the freedom of the press.''\n  So in light of section 3, everything else in Senate Joint Resolution \n19 might either do a lot or it might do a little. It might do \npractically nothing or it might do practically everything.\n  Let me explain what I mean. Let's examine the text of the first two \nsections of this provision.\n  Section 1 says: ``To advance democratic self-government and political \nequality, and to protect the integrity of the government and the \nelectoral process, Congress and the States may regulate and set \nreasonable limits on the raising and spending of money by candidates \nand others to influence elections.''\n  If your intent is deemed to involve influencing the outcome of an \nelection, then you are subject to these reasonable limits. Well, what \npeople in Congress think is reasonable might be different than what the \nAmerican people think is reasonable.\n\n  Then in section 2 it says that: ``Congress and the States shall have \npower to implement and enforce this article by appropriate legislation, \nand may distinguish between natural persons and corporations or other \nartificial entities created by law, including by prohibiting such \nentities from spending money to influence elections.''\n  Herein lies the problem: Getting back to our hypothetical a few \nminutes ago, if the idea behind this is to prevent any person or any \ngroup of persons from having too much influence over elections taking \nplace in the United States of America, this does not do that. Depending \non how broadly or how narrowly Congress chooses to define this contest \nof freedom of the press, which it carves out and holds harmless, this \nlegislation might do everything or it might do nothing. Let me explain \nwhat I mean.\n  Most of the money that is spent by political campaigns, whether by \nindividual candidates or by organizations attempting to influence the \noutcome of elections, comes in the form of disseminating a message, \ncomes in the form of either printed material, in the form of pamphlets \nor the electronic equivalent of pamphlets, or it comes in the form of \nsome type of advertising. Maybe it is an advertisement in a newspaper, \nmaybe it is an advertisement on television. But that is where most \npolitical money ends up getting spent.\n  As understood by the founding generation and as understood and \ninterpreted by the Supreme Court to this day, most of that material is \nprotected in the sense that most of that material constitutes something \nthat falls under the category of freedom of the press. Freedom of the \npress, of course, does not belong solely, does not belong exclusively, \nto those who have a press badge or those who are part of what has \nhistorically been considered our news media.\n  If, on the other hand, those who have drafted this amendment--if, on \nthe other hand, those who would decide what laws to pass under this \namendment to give it force, if they were to conclude that they wanted \nto more narrowly define ``press'' to include only credentialed media, \nperhaps newspaper reporters, perhaps newspaper reporters and radio and \ntelevision reporters, then they would be significantly changing the \nFirst Amendment as interpreted by the Supreme Court. They would be \nsignificantly changing the nature of freedom of the press as recognized \nby the Supreme Court over the last two centuries.\n  If, in fact, they choose to do it that way, then we would find \nourselves in an awful situation in which the owner of a newspaper would \nbe able to spend potentially millions of dollars, perhaps tens of \nmillions, promoting the candidate of her choice simply because she owns \na newspaper. But what about someone who does not own a newspaper but \nnonetheless wants her views to be expressed, wants to have some way of \ncontributing to the national debate? What if there is someone out there \nwho is really concerned, concerned about a particular issue?\n  Let's say there is a voter who is concerned about the PATRIOT Act and \nshe wants to contribute to an organization, let's say the ACLU, which \nwould, in turn, perhaps make statements to try to influence the public \ndebate about the PATRIOT Act. This could run afoul of all of that. In \nfact, under the plain language of it, it likely would. In fact, the \nACLU itself has expressed this concern in a letter dated June 3, 2014, \nto Chairman Pat Leahy of the Senate Judiciary Committee on which I sit.\n  On page 4 of that letter, the ACLU presents the following \nhypothetical:\n\n       For instance, would an ACLU ad urging Members of Congress \n     to support Patriot Act reform, which runs shortly before the \n     November 2004 election, when that issue is at play in the \n     election, be construed as an issue ad exhorting voters to \n     support reform, or a covert attempt to influence voters who \n     oppose Members who do not support reform?\n       Similarly, would an ad by a group urging repeal of the \n     Affordable Care Act, which runs before the 2012 presidential \n     election, be issue advocacy or covert express advocacy?\n\n  These are questions raised by the ACLU itself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n[[Page S5387]]\n\n  Mr. LEE. I ask unanimous consent that I be given 2 additional minutes \nto wrap up my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEE. What all of this boils down to is that the core values, the \ncore protections underlying the First Amendment are not just important, \nthey are not just nice to talk about, they are at the very foundation \nof our representative democracy. They are at the very foundation of our \nRepublic and how it operates. If this amendment were to pass, if this \nwere to become part of the Constitution of the United States, Congress \nwould become more powerful at the expense of the American people.\n  Ultimately this will inure to the benefit of the political \nestablishment in Washington. It would inure to the benefit, perhaps, of \ntwo political parties but everybody else would suffer. It would be more \ndifficult for more Americans to speak on issues that concerned them. \nCongress would have more power and the States would have more power to \nrestrict the speech of the American people.\n  It has been said in the past that this is about restricting money, \nnot speech. It is a little bit like saying a city ordinance prohibiting \npeople from using either an automobile or a subway car to get to a \nprotest rally isn't restricting their access to a protest rally or the \nright to participate in that protest rally.\n\n  When money is the means by which the American people can have the \nability to express their concern on an issue voters are facing in an \nupcoming election, that should concern us all. This is an attempt to \nweaken the most fundamental components of our rights as U.S. citizens. \nI must, therefore, oppose Senate Joint Resolution 19 and urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/09/senate-section/article/S5387-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5387-S5388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I know many Senators were back home over \nthe last number of weeks talking to and listening to their constituents \nabout issues on their minds. I was also at home. As a doctor and as a \nSenator, I heard from many people in my home State of Wyoming who have \na lot of concerns about the health care law and the devastating side \neffects the law has on them.\n  Over the past few weeks there have been headlines just about every \nday all across the country with bad news about the health care law and \nits impact on the American people. Just this morning the local \nnewspaper, The Hill, has a headline: ``Support for ObamaCare continues \nto fall.''\n\n       Public approval of ObamaCare continued to sink this summer, \n     issuing the latest warning for vulnerable Democrats who will \n     face voters this fall after backing the law.\n\n  It says that just 35 percent of voters now support the health care \nlaw. This is a monthly poll done by the Kaiser Health Foundation which \nwas released yesterday.\n  It says:\n\n       Healthcare remains one of the most important issues in \n     midterm elections, ranking only behind the economy and jobs \n     as voters' top issue.\n\n  I talk about health care repeatedly because I am a physician. I have \ntaken care of patients for 25 years in my home State of Wyoming, and I \nhave taken care of families from all around the State. They come to me \nwith their concerns about the health care law.\n  President Obama says the Democrats who voted for the law should, as \nhe said, ``forcefully defend and be proud of the law.'' Is the \nPresident proud of the ways families across America are suffering \nbecause of his health care law and the dangerous side effects people \ncontinue to face?\n  Here is a headline from last Friday, September 5, front page of the \nWall Street Journal. It says: ``Hacker Breaches Part Of Federal Health \nSite.'' A computer hacker breached the Federal health site. The article \nsays the hacker broke into part of the healthcare.gov Web site in \nJuly--in July--and uploaded malicious software, according to Federal \nofficials.\n  The administration now admits it. It goes on to say that ``the break-\nin raised concerns among Federal officials because of how easily the \nintruder gained access and how much damage could have occurred.'' This \nis a concern Republicans have warned about for a long time.\n  The Obama administration didn't do the basic things any business in \nAmerica would have done to protect people and their personal \ninformation. According to this report, part of the problem in this case \nwas that the Web site's developers never--and taxpayers have paid \nplenty to these developers--bothered to change a default password for \nthe system. No one can believe it. Hackers didn't have to go around \nsome complicated security system or break in through a back door. Oh, \nno. The Obama administration official admitted to the Wall Street \nJournal there was a door left open--a door left open.\n  The Obama administration said that so far the hackers haven't stolen \nanybody's personal information that they know of. Apparently, they \ndidn't know about this breach for weeks. The hacker walked in through \nan open door in July, and the Obama administration didn't know anything \nabout it until August 25. Healthcare.gov stores huge amounts of \npersonal and private information about people, including their access \ninformation and their health care information, and people have a right \nto know the information is secure.\n  Where are the Democrats on the floor of the Senate today ready to \nforcefully defend leaving the door open for these hackers?\n  Here is another headline from the September 2 New York Times: \n``Bracing for New Challenges in Year Two of Health Care Law.''\n\n  We all remember how terrible the launch of the health care program \nwas last fall. We remember right after the President sat down with Bill \nClinton and he said: Oh, easier to use than Amazon, cheaper than your \ncell phone bill, and you can keep your doctor.\n  America knows those things weren't true.\n  We all remember the terrible launch last October. The new head of the \nexchange talked about what he expects it to be like this year, year \ntwo. They have had a full year now to get ready and fix the problems. \nYet this Obama administration official just recently told the New York \nTimes: ``In some respects, it's going to be more complicated. Part of \nme thinks that this year is going to make last year look like the good \nold days.''\n  America is not ready to go back to the Obama Web site good old days. \nThat is what the Obama administration's person in charge of the health \ncare exchange told the New York Times. Are the Democrats going to come \nto the floor and forcefully defend this kind of chaos and confusion \nwith the health care enrollment for a second year in a row? It is \nanother disgraceful side effect of the President's unworkable, \nunmanageable health care law.\n  I will give one more example of what the American people are learning \nabout how the health care law is harming them individually. Insurance \ncompanies have been releasing their preliminary rates for 2015, and in \nmany places for many people, premiums are going up. According to the \nconsulting group PricewaterhouseCoopers, premiums are going up about 8 \npercent on average across the country. That is not what Democrats \npromised when they wrote the health care law. Democrats in Washington, \nhere in the Senate, promised the rates would go down. President Obama \nwent around the country and said people would see their health care \ncosts go down by an average of $2,500 per family per year. Nancy Pelosi \nwent on ``Meet the Press'' and said rates will go down for everyone. \nThat hasn't happened. Premiums have gone up. Copays are up. Deductibles \nhave gone up. Out-of-pocket costs have gone up for millions of \nAmericans.\n  As chairman of the Republican policy committee, one of the things I \ndo is look around the country and try to find out how the policies that \ncome out of Washington affect people all across the country. I have \ntraveled over the past month and heard from many people that the \nPresident's health care law is hurting them individually and costing \nthem more.\n  One place people are really being hurt by the health care law is \nAlaska. Here is a headline from The Hill newspaper on Monday: ``Alaska \ninsurance rates set to spike.'' According to the article, Alaskans \nbuying health insurance through the State's exchange can expect a \nsurprise spike of more than 30 percent on average.\n\n[[Page S5388]]\n\n  Another place being hit is Iowa. PricewaterhouseCoopers says the \naverage person in Iowa who buys health insurance through the exchange \nis going to pay 11.5 percent more next year in premiums. For others, \npremiums will be as high as 14 percent higher. Those Iowa families \naren't getting a cut of $2,500 as promised by the Democrats who voted \nfor this health care law and as the President said. What they are \ngetting instead is an increase of 14 percent--more money out of their \npockets.\n  We can go round and round with individual stories. They are paying \nmore. So it is no surprise then that today the headline in The Hill \nnewspaper is that it is more unpopular now and continues to lose \npopularity.\n  Then the impact. It is astonishing. I picked up today's Investor's \nBusiness Daily. The headline is ``ObamaCare Spurs College Blues For \nWorking Students.'' A lot of students have to work their way through \ncollege. Page 1, above the fold, ``ObamaCare Goes To College.''\n\n       More than 200 colleges and universities--\n\n  This is because of the law, the way they define part-time work and \nfull-time work, and full-time is defined as 30 hours.\n  ``ObamaCare Goes To College.''\n\n       More than 200 colleges and universities have restricted \n     work hours for students, for part-time faculty, or both, \n     citing the costs of complying with the employer mandate \n     related to the President's health care law.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, what I do is come to the floor to talk \nabout the concerns I have for Americans who are concerned about their \njobs, concerned about the economy, concerned about their opportunity to \nget the care they need from a doctor they choose at a lower cost. They \nsee all of these issues as troublesome under the President's health \ncare law. So I am going to continue to talk about this and the impact \nthis has on the American family. I am going to talk about restoring \npeople's freedom to buy insurance that works for them and their \nfamilies because they know what is best for them, not the Obama \nadministration. I am going to talk about reforms that get people the \ncare they need from a doctor they choose at lower costs. I am going to \ntalk about giving people choices, not Washington mandates.\n  Republicans are going to keep offering real solutions for better \nhealth care without all of these tragic side effects.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/09/senate-section/article/S5388-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5388-S5389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      AFFORDABLE HIGHER EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time to talk about a fair shot \nfor American families on quality, affordable higher education. It is \nvery appropriate that the Senator from New Jersey is presiding because \nhe has been one of the great leaders in the Senate on the affordability \nof higher education, and it has been a pleasure to work with him.\n  Let me go through some of the numbers because they are somewhat \nshocking. We have 20 million students who enter college every year, and \n60 percent will exit with student debt. The majority of students who \nnow attend college will have to borrow money in order to be able to get \na college education. Thirty-seven million Americans today have college \nloans that are outstanding. Yes, we know some are young professionals \nand some are older people. I was surprised to learn that almost 8 \nmillion Americans over the age of 50 have college loans that are still \noutstanding. So this is a burden many American families will have for \nthe rest of their lives.\n  The average debt today is $29,000, and that number is rising \ndramatically every year. So when a student graduates, the average debt \nthey carry is $29,000. There is $1.2 trillion in outstanding college \nloans--more than credit card debt.\n  As the Senator from New Jersey pointed out earlier today, the \npercentage of a family's disposable income they need in order to pay \nfor a college education--which we need for global competition and for \ncompetition in this country--is far higher than any other \nindustrialized country in the world by far, equaling almost 50 percent \nof disposable income. That is a shocking number. Education is the great \nequalizer, and for many American families it is out of reach because of \nthe cost and the necessity to borrow money.\n  Let me get beyond the numbers for a moment and talk a little bit \nabout the people. Last Thursday Senator Mikulski and I were on the \ncampus of Bowie State University and UMBC. Bowie State is one of our \nhistorically Black colleges and universities in Maryland, located in \nPrince George's County. We had a chance to not only meet with Dr. \nMickey Burnim, the president of Bowie State University, but with \nstudents as well around a table to talk about how they go about trying \nto arrange for scholarships and loans in order to be able to afford a \ncollege education.\n  Bowie State University is a good buy compared to other colleges; \ntuition is only around $5,000. One would think those students are in \ngood shape, but let me tell my colleagues about the realities.\n  Dr. Burnim was explaining to us that on the first day of school, many \nstudents who they thought would be enrolled were not enrolled. Why? \nBecause they couldn't put together the total financial package in order \nto satisfy the tuition costs, so they were not formally enrolled.\n  I was talking to some students at that roundtable discussion who \nexplained to me that there were students who showed up for the first \nday of class without the textbook because they couldn't afford the \ntextbook. Now they are going to be behind before they even start \nbecause of the high cost of a college education.\n  Here we are at a State college, and the average debt held by a \nstudent graduating from Bowie is $27,800--at a State college. That is a \nshocking number.\n  The same number, if we go through the same thing at UMBC--where the \npresident is Dr. Freeman Hrabowski--one of the great universities of \nour country--they find so many tools to help their students with loans, \nscholarships, work-study programs, and the debt there is also over \n$20,000 a year for their graduating seniors. It is affecting their \nability to perform in college.\n  What do I mean by that? There are large amounts of debt they have to \ntake care of. The students do everything they can to reduce their debt, \nso they work. In some cases they work more than one job and attend \ncollege. It affects their ability to perform and successfully complete \ncollege.\n  At Bowie State it takes about 6 years to do a 4-year program because \nthe students are working and are having a hard time meeting the credit \nrequirements.\n  In some cases I was told there are students who want to take a summer \nclass because it was offered, it was needed for their major, and it \nwould allow them to graduate in a more timely way, but they couldn't \nafford to take the summer class because the Pell grants aren't \navailable in the summertime.\n  I thank Senator Harkin, the chairman of the committee of \njurisdiction, for offering legislation that would correct that, that \nwould allow for Pell grants to be available on a 12-month basis. That \nwould help.\n  Yes, the effect of the high cost of education is first and foremost \non the individual. Too many children are not going to college, too many \nchildren are not going to the college of their choice, and too many \nstudents are taking too many years to graduate because of the high cost \nof college. Too many students aren't going on to those advanced degrees \nbecause they have too much debt, they have to work, and they have to \npay off their student loans.\n  Too many students don't have all the training they need in order to \ndo the best for themselves, and it is affecting their ability to \nsucceed economically. They are delayed in their career choices because \nof extra years of college, and it is affecting their ability to buy \nhomes because they have student debt.\n  It is affecting our communities. There are less retail consumers than \nthere would otherwise be. Yes, it is affecting our global competition; \nyes, we have to increase Pell grants; yes, we have to increase public \nsupport; and,\n\n[[Page S5389]]\n\nyes, we have to increase transparency, but we can, this week and next, \ndo something about it by passing the Bank on Students Emergency Loan \nRefinancing Act.\n  I thank Senator Warren and Senator Franken for leading our effort. \nThis will allow us to refinance loans. People can't today, they can't \nrefinance student loans. They can't take advantage of the lower \ninterest rates. People who have student loans are paying thousands of \ndollars of extra interest costs.\n  Let's refinance it. The government shouldn't be making money off the \nbacks of student loan holders because the interest rates are lower than \nwhat they are charging. Let's refinance. That will save thousands of \ndollars for families and would help us have more affordable \nopportunities for education in our community.\n  Let's give a fair shot to American families. Let's take up and pass \nthe Bank on Student Emergency Loan Refinancing Act to allow those \nmillions of Americans who are currently holding student debt to \nrefinance at lower rates, saving thousands of dollars and helping \nAmericans afford a college education.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz).

Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of \nreauthorizing the Export-Import Bank. I am on the floor with the \nSenator from Washington, Senator Cantwell, who has been such a leader \nas head of the small business committee on this issue.\n  As I heard the Senator from Maryland talk about the importance of \nstudent loans to our economy and the importance to our economy for \nhaving people being able to go out there and get the education and fill \nthe jobs today, another piece of this is to make sure those markets are \navailable, to make sure our businesses are able to compete \ninternationally, both small and big, with companies from across the \nworld. This means jobs in America. Exports are critical to the U.S. \neconomy, and we need to help our businesses, small and large, boost \ntheir exports.\n  When 95 percent of the world's customers live outside of our borders, \nthere is literally a world of opportunity out there for U.S. business. \nIt used to be we were just focused on Canada, especially in Minnesota, \nand Mexico, but we know there is a world of opportunity in emerging \nmarkets in places such as Asia and Africa, for us to finally be making \nthings in America and having people buy them in other countries.\n  As a Senator, I have been working to boost America's ability to \ncompete in the global economy and to open up these markets. That is why \nI strongly support reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank.\n  I thank Senator Cantwell for her efforts in leading this fight, and I \nthank leadership on both sides of the banking committee.\n  As Senate chair of the Joint Economic Committee, today I am releasing \na report on ``The Contribution of Exports to Economic Growth and the \nImportant Role of the Export-Import Bank.''\n  According to one analysis, exports are projected to account for \nalmost 40 percent of real U.S. GDP growth over this decade.\n  We know we have stabilized the economy in America, but the only way \nwe are going to be able to expand it, to add more jobs, to make sure \npeople are working at their fullest potential, is to be able to export \nthings to other countries with these emerging middle classes in places \nsuch as India and other countries where we can actually sell our goods.\n  This report highlights that the Export-Import Bank plays a crucial \nrole in supporting businesses, particularly small businesses, to find \nmarkets for their products. What does the report show? Well, first it \nshows the economy has expanded for the past 4 years and U.S. exports \nhave been the ticket to that growth.\n  Last year U.S. exports of goods reached an all-time high, $2.3 \ntrillion or 13.5 percent of U.S. GDP, an increase of 35 percent since \n2009. Think of the jobs that means in America.\n  In 2013, U.S. exports of goods and services were responsible for 11.3 \nmillion jobs, an increase of 1.6 million jobs since 2009.\n  Manufacturing and agricultural producers have also been able to \nincrease their exports, supporting economic recovery and job growth. In \nthe manufacturing sector, nearly 25 percent of production is exported \nand these exports are responsible for about 3 million jobs.\n  I see this in Minnesota. In 2013, our goods and services exports rose \nto $20.7 billion, and Minnesota was ranked the fourth largest \nagriculture exporting State in 2012, up from sixth in 2011.\n  Do you know what that means in real terms? Our unemployment rate is \ndown to 4.5 percent. Our Twin Cities area has the lowest unemployment \nrate of any metropolitan area in the country, and it is very much about \nexports. Companies--not just the big ones, but the small ones--that \nhave learned to export and are willing to use the tools to export, \nmeans using the Export-Import Bank.\n  Yet U.S. exporters, as we all know, are competing with foreign \nproducers in places such as Germany, France, and China, which are \nbacked by their own countries' credit export programs and often receive \nother government subsidies.\n  I ask my friends who are slowing down this reauthorization, how can \nwe say to our U.S. companies, big and small, that we are going to allow \n60 other countries, including the top 10 exporting countries globally--\nthat they can have credit export programs but our companies can't have \nthem in the United States?\n  I will show you what I mean by this report.\n  I commend to colleagues the September 2014 Joint Economic Committee \nreport, ``The Contribution of Exports to Economic Growth and the \nImportant Role of the Export-Import Bank,'' that I referred to earlier.\n  On the graph and report in figure 2 we show ``Comparison between U.S. \nand Other Countries' Export Credit Subsidies.''\n  What do these numbers show? This number is about ``New medium- and \nlong-term official export credit volumes, 2013, billions of U.S. \ndollars.'' It shows that China's medium- and long-term credit export \nvolumes are at $45.5 billion.\n  That is what we are doing and that is why we see them--as Senator \nCantwell will discuss--going into markets such as Africa and opening \nthose markets up for their companies, because they are willing to help \nthem out of their own version of the Export-Import Bank--$45.5 billion \nin China.\n  Germany, a very successful economy, is at $22.6 billion in credit \nvolume. Where is the United States? We are at $14.5 billion. We are \nabove countries such as France, Italy, and Brazil, but we are below \ncountries such as China, Germany, and South Korea.\n  You can imagine the impact if we got rid of the Export-Import Bank. \nYou can imagine--which we cannot allow to happen.\n  The Export-Import Bank was first authorized in 1934. It supports U.S. \nbusinesses by providing financing that the private sector that may be \nunable or unwilling to do at competitive rates. The Export-Import Bank \ndoes this by providing loans, loan guarantees, and insurance policies \nto increase export opportunities.\n  In 2013, as our study shows, the Export-Import Bank supported \napproximately 205,000 U.S. jobs and $37.4 billion in U.S. exports. It \nmade 745 new loans and loan guarantees worth $21.8 billion.\n  By issuing these loans, loan guarantees, and insurance policies, the \nExport-Import Bank helped provide funding for projects ranging from \nshort-term investments to more complex and long-term transactions such \nas transportation and other infrastructure projects.\n  The Export-Import Bank also steps in to provide credit to open up \nthese new markets such as Africa, as I have focused on. For example, in \nthe past 4 years the Export-Import Bank has provided authorization for \nmore than $4 billion in support for U.S. export to sub-Saharan Africa, \nyet China is still ahead of us.\n  The Export-Import Bank provides support to many industries, \neverything from gas and oil, to space and telecommunications, to \nagribusiness.\n  The Export-Import Bank supports U.S. exports to more than 150 \ncountries, small business. This is what I\n\n[[Page S5390]]\n\nhear all across our State since 114 small Minnesota businesses have \nreceived financing over the past few years.\n  The big businesses tend to have trade exports, right? They have \nexports they want to go to Uruguay or Kazakhstan or somewhere in the \nworld. They can have some special person who knows the language and who \ncan help them and hire a consultant in the country. How can a small \nbusiness do that? Yet they know their product is going to sell in these \nother countries.\n  That is where the Export-Import Bank comes in, because working with \nour foreign commercial service, they are able to get the tools they \nneed, small businesses, to compete at the same level as big businesses.\n  In August I visited Balzer, an agricultural equipment manufacturer \nbased in Mountain Lake, MN, a town of about 2,000 people. Balzer \ncurrently employs 74 people in Mountain Lake, 74 people out of 2,000. \nIt has made a real difference, the Export-Import Bank, for their \ncompany. Exports are approximately 15 percent of their sales.\n  Or how about Superior Industries in Morris. There are 5,000 people in \nthat town and 500 people employed at the company. They are now \nexporting, thanks to the Ex-Im Bank, to Canada, Australia, Russia, \nArgentina, Chile, Uruguay, and Brazil.\n  How would they would get into Uruguay? Do we think their small \ncommunity bank--which we love--is going to be able to help them figure \nout Uruguay financing? No.\n  That is why we have the Ex-Im Bank. It helps these small businesses \nto make major decisions, to finance major products and major deals, so \nthey can actually have jobs in the United States that are providing \nexports to these other countries.\n  That is what this is all about. It is critical. We have to \nreauthorize this proven Ex-Im Bank and make sure our exporters are \ncompeting on a level playing field in a global market.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate my colleague, \ncochair of the Joint Economic Committee, for her report on the \nimportance of the contribution of exports to our economy and for the \nExport-Import Bank.\n  The report she is issuing today has a picture of cargo container \nships leaving the Port of Miami. I could say that this picture could be \nany number of ports around the United States of America, certainly in \nmy State, where one in three jobs is related to trade.\n  I very much appreciate the Joint Economic Committee highlighting at \nthis point in time how important the export economy is to the U.S. \neconomy. My colleague comes from a similar State where we like to say \nwe make a lot of great manufactured products--and we are very proud \nthey are sold in the international marketplace--but now is no time to \nbasically curtail credit agencies' ability to help make those sales a \nreality when we have had fabulous U.S.-made products.\n  So I very much appreciate the Joint Economic Committee's release of \nthis report. It is showing that our economy--even though we faced this \nvery disastrous financial collapse 6 years ago--that report basically \nshows that last week the trade deficit continued to decline. A headline \njust recently said: ``Trade deficit at 6-month low as exports climb.''\n  So it does not take a rocket scientist to figure out that a growing \nmiddle class around the globe is an excellent opportunity for us to \nsell U.S. manufactured products. In fact, the middle class is going to \ndouble over the next 15 years. So that is a great opportunity for us to \ntake American-made products and get them into this marketplace.\n  In fact, last year American companies exported more goods and \nservices--totaling $2.3 trillion in value, 13.5 percent of our gross \ndomestic product. So that is a step in the right direction. But that is \nbeing threatened if Congress does not reauthorize this important credit \nagency to make sure these deals get closed. That is why today we are \nhere to make sure that a long-term reauthorization of the Export-Import \nBank is implemented.\n  Now, I know we already have about 240 Members of the House of \nRepresentatives who are on record saying they support a long-term \nextension of the Export-Import Bank. I know there are many Senators \nhere in the Senate who support that. So why is this taking so long? \nSome people are even suggesting that we can do just a 2-month extension \nor a 3-month extension. Well, I can tell you how ridiculous that idea \nis because it does not give any certainty and predictability to \nbusinesses that are trying to close deals.\n  In fact, one business exporter from Texas said:\n\n       The Export-Import Bank is absolutely essential to maintain \n     and grow our businesses. . . . Recent reports on the \n     uncertainty of the Bank's future may have already impacted \n     our bottom line. Our customers need the certainty of export \n     credit to continue many of their sales abroad.\n\n  So this individual Texas company is such a reflection of the fact \nthat exports are U.S. jobs. In fact, it is $2.3 trillion in goods and \nservices, and 11.3 million jobs in the United States are related to \nexports, many of those in manufactured products.\n  So why would we take and risk these kinds of numbers with the \nuncertainty of a credit agency that helps close these deals? With that \nmany jobs and that much economic impact at stake, why would we suggest \nthat we only want to reauthorize it for a couple of months? I think \nthat is a very wrongheaded approach.\n  We have heard from many other companies. One from Georgia was able to \nincrease its annual sales from roughly $500,000 to over $20 million in \njust a few years and was able to do so with the Export-Import Bank.\n  We have 21 days left to get this right and to help our economy \ncontinue to grow, but we have to do something here in the Senate; and \nthat is, pass the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank.\n  While we were home in August, we heard many people talk about this \nissue. In fact, I would like to put up a few newspaper headlines that \nwe saw around the country. One is from the Roanoke Times, which was an \neditorial that said: ``In our view, small businesses need this.'' They \ncalled for the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank. Another \nnewspaper, the Wichita Eagle, editorialized in support: ``Reauthorize \nthe Ex-Im Bank.'' And the Columbus Dispatch editorialized: ``Ohioans \nbenefit from Export-Import bank.''\n  So these are just three of the editorials heard all around the \ncountry that are asking us to reauthorize this important credit agency \nand make sure we are giving small businesses and manufacturers the \ntools it takes to export.\n  But my colleague, who is the Joint Economic Committee chair, brought \nup an even more specific point; that is, where are we going to be in \ncompetition as it relates to China when they are chasing economic \nopportunity all around the globe? In fact, an editorial that was in the \nChicago Tribune on August 15 said: ``Sub-Saharan Africa's economy is \ngrowing about 5.4 percent a year--outpacing the global rate of 3.6 \npercent . . .'' So here is Africa with lots of economic opportunity. It \nis home to many very fast-growing economies in Angola, Nigeria, and \nEthiopia. They go on to say: ``The Ex-Im Bank plays a vital niche role \nin the U.S. economy as backstop because commercial banks and other \nfinancial firms often find ways to say `no' to deals involving selling \ngoods in developing countries.'' That is from the Chicago Tribune.\n  So newspapers around America get it. This is a key tool for us to \naccess new opportunities that are emerging in developing countries. The \nfact is, China is already there, they are selling products, they are \nusing their credit agency to help close deals. Why? Because a lot of \nbanks are uncomfortable, either with the size of the deal, the lack of \nfinancial players in those emerging markets, and the inability to get \nthese deals closed without the export bank and its assistants.\n  Another editorial that was in the Boston Globe actually talked about \na U.S. company that lost a deal because of our inability to make a \ndecision here. A California company ``lost a $57 million contract this \nyear because of ideological posturing in Washington.'' It is ``a self-\ninflicted economic wound.'' They are talking about a firm that ``lost \nits bid to sell technology'' that was going to be used in the \nPhilippines only because the Korean competitor\n\n[[Page S5391]]\n\ncould guarantee that their export-import bank would be there.\n  That is another example that we are not even waiting right now to \nhave the negative impact; we are already having the negative impact \nbecause we are not getting this done.\n  So it is very important we make sure we reauthorize the Export-Import \nBank. As one company in my State said, the Norwest Ingredients company: \n``Loss of the export insurance provided by EX-IM Bank would be \ndevastating to my business . . .,'' that a short-term extension of the \nExport-Import Bank does not provide the certainty that we need to \nfinance these deals.\n  I think this is so much what we need to be focusing on. I appreciate \nmy colleague's contribution from the Joint Economic Committee to this \nreport. She talked again about the specifics of what other countries \nare doing.\n\n  This chart shows you the percentage of credit agency resources \nagainst a country's GDP--how much they are investing in selling their \nproducts around the globe. So we can see what India, China, France, and \nGermany are doing to basically dwarf what we are doing as far as making \nsure our products are sold around the globe.\n  I wish the financial market was there to help close these \ntransactions. But just as we have a small business administration that \nhelps get financial backers to back small businesses, the Export-Import \nBank helps U.S. manufacturers sell their products overseas.\n  We have too much of a supply chain in the United States of America, \nwith manufacturing in aerospace, in agriculture, and in automobiles, to \ngive it all away by simply not reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank in \na timely fashion.\n  So I again appreciate the cochair of the Joint Economic Committee in \nthe release of a report focusing on why exports are so important to our \neconomy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republicans have no time remaining. There \nare 3 minutes on the Democratic side.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I just want to be recognized for the 3 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, one, I want to thank my colleague, Senator \nKlobuchar from Minnesota, of the Joint Economic Committee, for making \nthe case on why the Ex-Im Bank is a good government program essential \nto creating jobs in America from export sales.\n  Boeing is in South Carolina; they are in Washington. Senator Cantwell \nhas been a champion of this issue as long as I have been around. Now \nthat Boeing is making 787s in South Carolina, I will just put this on \nthe table: 8 out of 10 787s made in South Carolina are Ex-Im financed. \nWe are competing in the wide-body market with countries such as France; \nChina will be getting in this market. Every competitor of Boeing--GE \nmakes gas turbines in Greenville. Most of those are sold in the Mideast \nthrough Ex-Im financing. Every competitor of these two large companies \nin South Carolina has an Ex-Im Bank.\n  So to my colleagues in the House, I think I am a pretty conservative \nguy, but I am also practical. Why in the world would we shut our bank \ndown when China is growing their bank? The Chinese would support \nclosing the Ex-Im Bank in America; so would the French; so would the \nCanadians; so would the British. If you really want to give the \nAmerican economy a kick in the wrong place, shut our bank down and \nallow the other countries that compete with us to keep theirs open.\n  There is plenty of waste in the government. So we pick one program \nthat is small in number, in terms of actual volume that makes money for \nthe Treasury and creates hundreds of thousands of job opportunities. \nThis is smart conservatism? This is what conservatism has come to be, \nthat you take a program--that allows American companies to compete in \nthe international market, that makes money for the American taxpayer--\nand you shut it down just to prove to people you are ideologically \npure? That is not conservatism. That is crazy, and we are not going to \nlet it happen.\n  To my Democratic friends, we should have reauthorized this a long \ntime ago in a process befitting the Senate. There is well over half of \nmy conference ready to vote for reforms on the Ex-Im Bank, but we are \nnot doing anything in this body, and you are not going to pick our \namendments. So there is plenty of blame to go around.\n  I hope we are smart enough as a House and a Senate to get this right, \nnot to shut down the Ex-Im Bank that makes money for the taxpayer, \ncreates thousands of American jobs, for some ideological reason \ndisconnected with reality.\n  China would love this. France would love this. When it comes to my \nState, it would be devastating to the small businesses that benefit \nfrom Ex-Im financing. If you can close their banks down, count me in, \nwe will close ours. But I will be damned if we are going to close ours \nwhen they have theirs up and running to put people out of work in my \nState and all over this country when you are talking about the best-\npaying jobs in America.\n  I look forward to a further discussion on this topic.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about the situation that \nthe United States is facing regarding the new terrorist threat from the \nnew caliphate--so-called caliphate state of ISIS.\n  The President has announced that tomorrow he will address the \nAmerican people and explain what he proposes to do about this new \nsituation that faces us, this Islamic state of Iraq and Syria, \notherwise called ISIS or IS.\n  We are at a critical moment facing a serious danger, and now is the \ntime to act together. For action to be effective, it needs our united \nsupport. That is why the President's address tomorrow is so important.\n  I was alarmed by his admission in a press conference 10 days ago that \nhe had no strategic policy in mind. So I welcome this opportunity now \nto learn what this strategy is, and I truly hope that it will be \narticulated fully and completely with clarity so that not only the \nAmerican people but their representatives here in the House and the \nSenate know exactly what the President intends on doing and proposing.\n  The unspeakable depravities committed by ISIS seem to have no limits. \nThe alarm bells have become louder as ISIS henchmen continue their \nbeheadings and their brutality and their barbarism. One of the most \nacute dangers ISIS poses is the wide scope of their ambitions.\n  First Syria, then Iraq, now Lebanon, later possibly Jordan, Saudi \nArabia, and others are in their target sites.\n  ISIS is now widely and correctly judged to be the largest, best \norganized, best financed, most capable, and most ambitious terrorist \norganization in history.\n  So when the President explains his plan to degrade and defeat ISIS, I \nplan to carefully examine it and look through what I believe are the \nessential elements and hallmarks necessary for us to succeed: its \ndetermination, its courage, its resources to enact the plan, its vision \nfor where we want to\n\n[[Page S5392]]\n\ngo, a clearly outlined goal that we want to achieve, and a realism that \nwe can be successful.\n  President Obama must outline the task of defending our Nation and \ndegrading and defeating ISIS and clearly lay out before us how we will \naccomplish this.\n  When I first addressed this subject last month, I outlined five areas \nin which I believed urgent action was required, and I hope the \nPresident's plan will include these five areas.\n  First, as I have just said, I called for the Obama administration to \narticulate their own plan to confront ISIS and protect America. I trust \nthis will happen tomorrow.\n  Second, I called for a vigorous, concerted push with Islamic states \nand communities to stand up to the outrageous ISIS perversion of their \nreligion and their culture. We haven't seen outrage in the region from \nthose moderates, the leadership, the political as well as the people \nwho simply see this action of ISIS as a perversion of their religion. \nAs destructive and brutal as it is, where have they been? It is time \nfor them to step up. I believe we must make a concerted push with \nIslamic states and communities to stand up to this outrage that is \ntaking place.\n  We should work with all political and religious authorities to speak \nout about how their faith and their culture is being co-opted and \nperverted by these ISIS criminals. We then must press them to take \neffective action to undercut the popular, political, and economic \nsupport ISIS extremists are getting. Genuine Muslim leaders--imams and \nothers--need to take center stage to discredit the violent radicals and \nweaken their outreach and recruitment among Muslim youth.\n  Third, last month I called for much greater security assistance for \nour potential partners in this fight against ISIS. The United States \nshould move quickly to provide arms, training, and other requested \nassistance to Iraqi Kurdistan's Peshmerga forces and to other states \nthat need and request support and will work with us to address this \nchallenge. We need to find effective ways to support and directly arm \nthe reliable, vetted Sunni tribes and Sunni leaders in Iraq who are \nessential partners in combating this ISIS extremism that ultimately are \nSunni Islam's greatest interest and threat.\n  Fourth, it is clear ISIS cannot be defeated without our \nparticipation. Therefore, I believe our current bombing campaign \nagainst ISIS targets should be continued and expanded to include ISIS \nbases in Syria.\n  If we have learned anything from the wars in Vietnam, Korea and \nSerbia and our experience along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, we \nhave learned the futility of attacking military forces that have safe \nhaven bases just across the border or nearby leads to less than success \nand leads to potential defeat.\n  Fifth, and lastly, I believe we need to address new dangers to our \nhomeland by reassessing border security and determining whether it can \nbe improved to address the threat of foreign fighters returning to the \nUnited States.\n  The threat of Western, homegrown, radical, and violent jihadist \nterrorists is real and it is growing. We know that. ISIS boasts that \nthey have trained and motivated fighters who are already embedded in \nmany countries throughout the world and that they have their sights \ntrained on the United States and Europe. There is no reason to \ndisbelieve them. So we must respond to this threat to our country in \nevery possible way.\n  One effective step is to reevaluate our entry procedures, including \nthe Visa Waiver Program. I know this is controversial. I know countries \nthat have been loyal allies will raise alarms. But we have to \nunderstand that we need to conduct a thorough, candid assessment of how \nthis Visa Waiver Program affects our national security interests and \nwhether there are changes to the program that would enhance our \nsecurity.\n\n  Similar reviews of our refugee and asylum policies are also \nnecessary. As the ranking member of the Appropriations Homeland \nSecurity Subcommittee and a member of the Select Committee on \nIntelligence, I will seek such an assessment and pursue legislation \nthat is responsive to the new danger we face.\n  In conclusion, when President Obama unveils his strategy to defeat \nISIS--not manage ISIS, not contain ISIS, but to defeat ISIS--I am \nhopeful his presentation will include at least the essential elements I \ntalked about: clarity and coherence, sound diplomacy to bring Muslim \nnations and communities into firm opposition to ISIS extremism, \nappropriate expanded security assistance to partners in the struggle, \nenhanced military action to include Syria, and greater attention to \nborder security.\n  If what the President says tomorrow includes these elements, and \nhopefully more, then I will look very carefully as to how I can support \nthe President and the strategy and encourage my colleagues to do the \nsame, because I believe it is essential that to succeed against this \nthreat, we need to speak with one voice.\n  We need to be united as Americans--as a Congress and Americans \nthroughout the country in terms of the nature of the threat, what we \nneed to do to address it, and the plan and strategy to successfully \nachieve that goal.\n  If it falls short, then I hope the Congress can work with the \nPresident to bring about the necessary steps to give us every \nopportunity to succeed in this challenging task. I hope we don't come \nto that point. I hope we can unite. I look forward to carefully \nexamining the proposal. I trust we will be receiving at last leadership \nfrom the President of the United States and his team in terms of \naddressing what I think is a major crisis that cannot wait, cannot be \nmanaged. It cannot be classified as hoping something will work out.\n  The world is yearning for leadership. On matters of foreign policy, \nit looks to the United States and it looks to the leader of the United \nStates. We need to restore their confidence that we are taking this \nthreat seriously and that we are engaging in an effort to address this \nsuccessfully.\n  So we wait with great anticipation for the remarks of the President \nthat will occur tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, during the past month, two American \njournalists were murdered by a fanatical Islamic terrorist group, the \nIslamic State, known as ISIL. The murder of these two journalists is \npart of a campaign of horrific brutality that has included \ncrucifixions, rape, the slaughter of civilians, and prosecution of \nreligious minorities, including Christians and Yazidis.\n  Currently ISIL holds large sections of land in both Iraq and Syria, \nand the group has made clear that its ambitions extend even further. \nMeanwhile, Iran continues its efforts to enrich uranium, Ukraine is \nstruggling to prevent further Russian incursions, and the Islamic \nmilitants in Libya recently seized the U.S. Embassy compound after \nAmericans were forced to evacuate the war-torn country.\n  Here at home we are facing a crisis on our southern border thanks to \nthe President's policies which have encouraged thousands of \nunaccompanied children to undertake the dangerous journey to the United \nStates.\n  On the economic front, millions of middle-class families are being \nsqueezed by the Obama economy and Obamacare. Job growth last month was \na disappointing 142,000 jobs, the worst report this year, and far from \nthe numbers we need to get the economy going again. Unemployment \nremains high, and the unemployment rate would be even higher if \nmillions of Americans hadn't gotten so discouraged by the lack of job \nprospects that they gave up looking for work altogether.\n  Meanwhile, ObamaCare has not only failed to fix the problems in our \nhealth care system, it has made them worse. American families are \nfacing higher health care premiums and fewer health care choices. In \nshort, our country is facing serious challenges both at home and \nabroad.\n  What are Democrats doing about all these challenges? Well, this week \nthey are taking up legislation that limits\n\n[[Page S5393]]\n\nAmericans' First Amendment rights. That is right; instead of taking up \nany of the 40 House-passed jobs bills, addressing our border crisis, or \nfocusing on the international challenges we are facing, Democrats have \ndecided to spend the first part of a brief 2-week session rewriting the \nFirst Amendment. It is no wonder a George Washington University \nBattleground poll found that 70 percent of Americans think the country \nis on the wrong track.\n  Our First Amendment right to freedom of speech is one of our most \nfundamental rights. It is the right that helps protect all of our other \nrights by keeping government accountable and ensuring that all \nAmericans, not just those whose party is in power, get to make their \nvoices heard.\n  The Democrats' proposed constitutional amendment would severely \ncurtail this freedom by giving Congress and State governments the \nauthority to regulate political speech. That means Congress will get to \ndecide how much of a voice Americans are allowed in the political \nprocess. And that is bad news for Americans of every political \naffiliation. Under the Democrats' legislation, the party in power could \neffectively silence the voices of those who disagree with them.\n  Democrats are unhappy about recent decisions by the Supreme Court \nthat rolled back some of the restrictions on free speech and increased \nindividuals' voices in the political process. So their solution is a \nconstitutional amendment to shut down the voices of those who disagree \nwith them. Apparently they don't realize that is not the way the \nAmerican system works.\n  In America, if you don't like what your opponents are saying, you \nhave the freedom to persuade your opponents to adopt your position or \nyou persuade the American people to vote against them. You don't try to \nrevoke their right to speak. That is what they do in totalitarian \nsocieties. It is not what we do here in America.\n  In the United States your political power is supposed to exist in \nproportion to the strength of your ideas, not in proportion to your \nability to silence your critics. Fortunately for Americans of every \npolitical persuasion, the Democrats' amendment is unlikely to go \nanywhere in Congress--as Democrats well know.\n  So why are they taking up this legislation this week when there are \nso many problems, foreign and domestic, that need to be addressed? The \nanswer is simple. Democrats are worried about reelection, and they \nthink this legislation somehow will help them get reelected. They have \npassed this amendment to appeal to members in the far-left base who \nwant restrictions on political speech or at least on political speech \nwith which they disagree. Democrats are betting that seeing this \namendment defeated in Congress will encourage members of their \npolitical base to come to the polls in November. That, of course, has \nbeen Democrats' legislative strategy all year.\n  The New York Times reported back in March that Democrats plan to \nspend the spring and summer on messaging votes, ``timed''--and I quote, \n``to coincide with campaign-style trips by President Obama.''\n\n  ``Democrats concede,'' the Times reported, ``that making new laws is \nnot really the point. Rather, they are trying to force Republicans to \nvote against them.''\n  Let me repeat that. Despite the economic challenges facing American \nfamilies and steadily growing international unrest, the Democrats have \nspent the past several months pursuing a legislative strategy in which \n``making new laws is really not the point.''\n  We have seen that time and time again here over the past several \nmonths on the floor of the Senate where we come here on a daily basis \ncasting political show votes, knowing they are not going anywhere, \ndesigned to appeal to a political constituency that they hope will come \nout and support them during the November elections. Instead of pursuing \npolitical consensus--the only way to actually accomplish anything in a \ndivided Congress--Senate Democrats have brought up bill after bill to \npander to their political base. It is disappointing that the Democrats \nhave put their electoral prospects over Americans' freedom of speech \nthis week. And it is disappointing that Democrats have spent this \nentire year on political show votes instead of substantial legislation \nto address the many challenges that are facing American families. The \nPresident has been no help. Instead of urging Democrats in Congress to \nwork with Republicans on Senate legislation to deal with our country's \nmost serious problems, he has been focused on campaigning. It wouldn't \nbe a stretch to say that campaigning has been the President's main \nconcern for the majority of his Presidency, whether it is involved in \ndelaying Obama regulations to protect Democrats in the 2012 elections \nor his decision last week to defer his executive action on immigration \nuntil after the election in what White House officials essentially \nadmitted was an attempt to protect Democrats in November.\n  There is a place for campaigning--we all know that. We all do it--but \nit is not in the halls of Congress or in the Oval Office. We were \nelected to govern, and that means we should be spending our time on \nlegislation to meet our Nation's challenges. We should be taking up \nlegislation to support job creation. We should be fighting to give \nmiddle-class families a break from ObamaCare's high premiums and \nreduced choices. We should be taking up measures to advance energy \nindependence in this country and make energy more affordable for \nworking families. We should be focused on what we need to do to address \nthe crises abroad and America's security here at home.\n  Republicans are working to create jobs; Democrats are trying to save \ntheir own. It is not too late for Democrats to join Republicans to come \nup with bipartisan solutions to the challenges facing our country. The \nHouse of Representatives passed somewhere on the order of 350 bills, \nall of which are collecting dust here in the Senate, 40 of which \nspecifically deal with the issues of the economy and job creation which \nevery poll says is the American people's No. 1 priority. Yet here we \nare again in a shortened work period where we have a couple of weeks to \nactually do some things that would bend the curve in the direction of \nlowering the unemployment rate, growing the economy, creating more \njobs. We have a whole series of bills that have been passed by the \nother Chamber, the House of Representatives, that have been sent here \nwhich specifically deal with the issue of jobs and the economy that are \nsitting at the desk collecting dust because the majority leader has \nchosen instead to try to bring to the floor a whole bunch of things he \nthinks are additive in terms of getting the vote out for Democrats in \nNovember elections but frankly do absolutely nothing to address the \nserious concerns and challenges that are facing middle-class families \nall across this country. The people's representatives can do better. \nThe people's representatives should do better. Whenever Democrats here \ndecide they are ready to stop campaigning and start governing, \nRepublicans are ready to go to work.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I will just come out and say it. \nCitizens United was one of the worst decisions in the history of the \nSupreme Court. It was a disaster, a radical exercise of pro-corporate \njudicial activism. It was seriously flawed both legally and factually.\n  Legally, the Court trampled its own precedence--cases such as Austin \nv. Michigan Chamber of Commerce and McConnell v. Federal Elections \nCommission, which had been on the books for years and stood for the \nobvious proposition that the people can enact reasonable limits on \nmoney and politics.\n  Factually, the Court rested its conclusions on the faultiest of \npremises--that unlimited campaign expenditures by outside groups, \nincluding corporations, do not give rise to corruption or even the \nappearance of corruption. That assessment is disconnected from reality \nand is horribly out of touch with the sentiments of most Americans. For \nexample, the Minnesota\n\n[[Page S5394]]\n\nLeague of Women Voters issued a report in which it concluded that ``the \ninfluence of money in politics represents a dangerous threat to the \nhealth of our democracy in Minnesota and nationally.'' I think if you \nasked most people whether unlimited spending on campaigns has a \ncorrupting effect, they would agree and say, yes, of course it does, \nand I think they would be right. But the decision in Citizens United \nwas based on this unfounded and unbelievable idea that we have no \nreason to be concerned about the effects of unlimited campaign \nspending.\n  So we have this 5-to-4 Supreme Court decision that ignores the law, \nignores precedent, invents facts, and as a result we ended up with a \ncampaign finance system in tatters--one in which deep-pocketed \ncorporations, superwealthy individuals, and well-funded special \ninterests can flood our elections with money, thereby drowning out the \nvoices of middle-class Americans who don't have the luxury of spending \nhundreds of thousands of dollars or millions of dollars or hundreds of \nmillions of dollars to influence the political process.\n  This is real. Spending by outside groups more than tripled from the \n2008 Presidential campaign to the 2012 Presidential campaign when it \ntopped $1 billion. Outside spending went from $330 million in 2008 to \nover $1 billion in 2012. What happened in the interim? Well, it was \nCitizens United in 2010 and the floodgates were opened.\n  The middle class is not just being flooded, it is being blindfolded \ntoo, because these wealthy special interest groups can often spend the \nmoney anonymously, so voters have no idea who is behind the endless \nattack ads that fill the airwaves.\n  Here is how it works: If you have millions of dollars you want to \nspend, you can funnel it through back channels so that it ends up in \nthe hands of a group--typically one with a generic and benign-sounding \nname.\n  I was trying to invent a name, such as ``Americans for More America'' \nand ``American America.'' I was kind of joking around, and it turns out \nthere is group that has that name. They use this money to buy ads and \nvery often without disclosing the source of their funds. To me, this \nwhole thing looks a lot like money laundering, except now it is \nperfectly legal.\n  Again, this is real. A study just came out which showed that in the \ncurrent election cycle alone there have already been over 150,000 ads \nrun by groups that don't have to disclose the source of their funding, \nand things are just getting worse. Earlier this year, in a case called \nMcCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission, the Supreme Court was at it \nagain, recklessly doing away with a law that prohibited people from \ngiving more than $123,000 in the aggregate directly to candidates in an \nelection cycle. The limit had been $123,000. Who has that kind of \nmoney? Who has that kind of money lying around to spend on elections? \nWell, I guess the super-rich have that kind of money, but the middle \nclass certainly doesn't. The folks I meet with in Minnesota are trying \nto make ends meet, pay off their student loans, train for a new job, or \nsave some money to start a family. They sure don't have that kind of \nmoney just lying around, and they are the folks who need a voice here \nin Washington.\n  In June the Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the subject, and we \nheard from a witness whose presentation I found particularly persuasive \nand compelling. I suggest that my colleagues read his testimony. He was \na State senator from North Carolina. He said:\n\n       Suddenly, no matter what the race was, money came flooding \n     in. Even elected officials who had been in office for decades \n     told me they'd never seen anything like it. We were barraged \n     by television ads that were uglier and less honest than I \n     would have thought possible. And they all seemed to be coming \n     from groups with names we had never heard of. But it was \n     clear that corporations and individuals who could write giant \n     checks had a new level of power in the state.\n\n  He went on to explain that the vast majority of outside money that \nwas spent on State races, including the Governor's race, came from one \nman--just one man--who reportedly poured hundreds of thousands of \ndollars into State politics. Before the Governor was even sworn into \noffice, he announced who would write the State's budget. Yes, it was \nthat same donor. Apparently, the donor got his money's worth. The \nbudget he drafted was loaded with goodies for corporate interests and \nthe super-rich, provided at the expense of middle-class and working \nfolks.\n  I find this whole thing incredibly disturbing, this idea that a \nhandful of superwealthy corporate interests in effect can buy our \ndemocracy--or in this case one guy. That is not how it is supposed to \nwork. Everyone is supposed to have an equal say in our democracy \nregardless of his or her wealth. The guy in the assembly line gets as \nmany votes as the CEO--one. You don't get extra influence just because \nyou have extra money--or you shouldn't. The government should be \nresponsive to everyone and not just the wealthiest among us.\n  The way I see it is we can go two ways from here. On the one hand, we \ncan continue to let Citizens United be the law of the land. We can \nperpetuate the fallacy that corporations have the constitutional right \nto flood our elections with undisclosed money. We can let deep-pocketed \nspecial interests buy influence and access and then set the agenda for \nthe rest of the country or we can say enough is enough. We can restore \nthe law to what it was before Citizens United was decided. More to the \npoint, we can restore the voice to millions upon millions of everyday \nAmericans who want nothing more than to see their government represent \nthem. That is the choice we have before us this week. For those of us \nwho believe the measure of democracy's strength is in votes cast, not \ndollars spent--for us, I think it is an easy choice.\n\n  I am going to vote to reverse Citizens United, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \n25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, the proceedings on the amendment \nbefore us show just how broken the Senate is under the current \nleadership.\n  Yesterday the majority leader stated:\n\n       We're going to have a cloture vote to stop debate on this. \n     [Republicans] say, well, great, we'll go ahead and support \n     that because we can stall.\n\n  He also said:\n\n       There will be no amendments. Either you're for campaign \n     spending reform or not. So my Republican colleagues, they can \n     stall for time here.\n\n  This is an ``Alice in Wonderland,'' upside-down world the majority \nleader is describing. You can bet that if Republicans were blocking \nDemocrats from describing this amendment, we would be accused of \nobstruction. But when we vote to proceed to this amendment, as we did \nyesterday, we are also accused of obstruction. It goes to show that \nwhatever Republicans do, we will be accused of obstruction. That is a \ncatch-22. That is the majority's game plan--bring up partisan measures \nfor political posturing, avoid working together to solve problems, and \nblame the other side no matter what the other side does. That is why \nthe Senate is broken.\n  The amendment before us would amend the Bill of Rights and do it for \nthe first time. It would amend one of the most important of those \nrights--the right of free speech. The First Amendment provides that \nCongress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech. The proposed \namendment would give Congress and States the power to abridge that \nfreedom of free speech. According to the amendment, it would allow them \nto impose reasonable limits, whatever those reasonable limits might be, \non contributions and expenditures--in other words, limiting speech that \ninfluences elections. It would allow speech by corporations that would \ninfluence elections to be banned altogether.\n  This amendment is as dangerous as anything Congress could pass. \nPassing for the first time an amendment to the Constitution amending \nthe Bill of Rights is a slippery slope. Were it to be adopted--and I \nbelieve it will not be--the damage done could be reversed only if two-\nthirds of both Houses of Congress voted to repeal it through a new \nconstitutional amendment, with three-fourths of the States ratifying \nthat new amendment.\n  So let's start with first principles. The Declaration of Independence \nstates\n\n[[Page S5395]]\n\nthat everyone is endowed by their Creator with unalienable rights that \ngovernments are created to protect. Those preexisting rights include \nthe right to liberty.\n  The Constitution was adopted to secure the blessings of liberty to \nAmericans. Americans rejected the view that the structural limits on \ngovernmental power contained in the original Constitution would \nadequately protect the liberties they had fought in that revolution to \npreserve. So before the Colonies would approve the Constitution, the \nColonies--or then the States under the Articles of Confederation--\ninsisted on the adoption--or the addition to the original \nConstitution--of the Bill of Rights.\n  The Bill of Rights protects individual rights regardless of whether \nthe government or a majority approves of their use. The First Amendment \nin the Bill of Rights protects the freedom of speech. That freedom is \nbasic to self-government. Other parts of the Constitution foster \nequality or justice or representative government, but the Bill of \nRights is only about individual freedom.\n  Free speech creates a marketplace of ideas in which citizens can \nlearn, debate, and persuade fellow citizens on the issues of the day. \nAt its core, it enables our citizenry to be educated, to cast votes, to \nelect their leaders.\n  Today freedom of speech is threatened as it has not been in many \ndecades. Too many people do not seem to want to listen and debate and \npersuade. Instead, they want to punish, intimidate, and silence those \nwith whom they disagree. For instance, a corporate executive who \nopposed same-sex marriage--the same position President Obama held at \nthat very time--is to be fired. Universities that are supposed to be \nfostering academic freedom cancel graduation speeches by speakers some \nstudents find offensive. Government officials order other government \nofficials not to deviate from the party line concerning proposed \nlegislation.\n  The resolution before us--the proposed constitutional amendment cut \nfrom the same cloth--would amend the Constitution for the first time to \ndiminish an important right of Americans that is contained in the Bill \nof Rights. In fact, it will cut back on one of the most important of \nthose rights--core free speech about who should be elected to govern.\n\n  The proposed constitutional amendment would enable governments to \nlimit funds contributed to candidates and funds spent to influence \nelections. That would give the government the ability to limit speech. \nThe amendment would allow the government to set the limit at low \nlevels. There could be little in the way of contributions or election \nspending. There would be restrictions on public debate on who should be \nelected. For sure, incumbents--those of us who sit in this body--would \nfind that outcome to be acceptable because it would weaken possible \nopposition. They would know no challenger could run an effective \ncampaign against them.\n  What precedent would this amendment create? Suppose Congress passed \nlimits on what people could spend on abortion or what doctors or \nhospitals could spend to perform them. What if Congress limited the \namount of money people can spend on guns or limited how much people \ncould spend of their own money on health care? Under this amendment \nCongress could do what the Citizens United decision rightfully said it \ncould not; example: Make it a criminal offense for the Sierra Club to \nrun an ad urging the public to defeat a Congressman who favors logging \nin the national forests; another example: Prohibiting the National \nRifle Association from publishing a book seeking public support for a \nchallenger to a Senator who favors a handgun ban or for the ACLU to \npost on its Web site a plea for voters to support a Presidential \ncandidate because of his stance on free speech. Nobody wants a \ngovernment that powerful which could enforce those examples I just gave \nas well as other examples.\n  Don't take my word for it. In fact, at oral argument in Citizens \nUnited, the Obama administration told the Court it would be legal for a \ncorporation to be prosecuted for publishing a book that expressly \nadvocated for or against the election of a candidate. Sounds \nimpossible, but that is what was said. Consequently, the Obama \nadministration and the Democratic leadership support banning books they \ndon't agree with. Consequently, that should be a frightening prospect \nfor all of us.\n  Under this amendment, Congress and the States could limit campaign \ncontributions and expenditures without complying with existing \nconstitutional provisions. Congress could pass a law limiting \nexpenditures by Democrats but not by Republicans, by opponents of \nObamaCare but not by its supporters.\n  What does the amendment mean when it says Congress can limit funds \nspent to influence elections? If an elected official says he or she \nplans to run again, long before any election, Congress under this \namendment could criminalize criticism of that official as spending to \ninfluence elections. A Senator on the Senate floor, as I am right now, \nappearing on C-SPAN free of charge, could, with constitutional \nimmunity, defame a private citizen. The Member could say the citizen \nwas buying elections. If the citizen spent what Congress said was too \nmuch money to rebut that charge, he could possibly go to jail. We would \nbe back to the days when criticism of elected officials was a criminal \noffense. If people think that cannot happen, it did happen in 1798 when \nthe Alien and Sedition Acts were passed--and that is since our country \nwas formed and since our Constitution has been governing our \nrelationships.\n  Yet the supporters of this constitutional amendment say this \namendment is necessary for democracy. That is outrageous. The only \nexisting right the amendment says it will not harm is freedom of the \npress. So Congress and the States could limit the speech of anyone \nexcept the corporations that control the media. In other words, under \nthis amendment, some corporations are OK and other corporations are not \nOK. That would produce an Orwellian world in which every speaker is \nequal, but some speakers are more equal than others. Freedom of the \npress has never been understood to give the media special \nconstitutional rights denied to others.\n  Even though the amendment by its terms would not affect freedom of \nthe press, I was heartened to read that the largest newspaper in my \nState, the Des Moines Register, editorialized against this proposed \nconstitutional amendment. They cited testimony from the Judiciary \nCommittee hearing, and they recognized the threat the proposed \namendment poses to freedom.\n  But in light of recent Supreme Court decisions, an amendment soon may \nnot be needed at all. Four Justices right now would allow core \npolitical speech to be restricted. Were a fifth Justice with this same \nview to be appointed, there would be no need to amend the Constitution \nto cut back on this political freedom.\n  Justice Breyer's dissent for these four Justices in the McCutcheon \ndecision does not view freedom of speech as an end in itself, as was so \nimportant to our Founding Fathers. He thinks free political speech is \nabout advancing, in his words, ``the public's interest in preserving a \ndemocratic order in which collective speech matters.''\n  To be sure, individual rights often do advance socially desirable \ngoals, but our constitutional rights do not depend on whether unelected \njudges believe they advance democracy as they conceive it. Our \nconstitutional rights are individual. They are not ``collective''--the \nword the Justice used. Never in 225 years has any Supreme Court opinion \ndescribed our rights as collective. Our rights come from God and not \nfrom the government or from the public, and if they did, they could be \ntaken away from us at any time. So I don't put much stock in the \ncomment from one Justice quoted on the floor today that the Court's \ncampaign finance decisions are wrong.\n\n  Consider the history of the last 100 years. Freedom has flourished \nwhere rights belonged to individuals that governments were bound to \nrespect. Where rights were collective and existed only at the whim of a \ngovernment that determines when they serve socially desirable purposes, \nthe results in those countries have been literally horrific.\n  We should not move even 1 inch in the direction the liberal Justices \nand this amendment would take us. The stakes could not be higher for \nall Americans who value their rights and their freedoms.\n  Speech concerning who the people's elected representatives should be,\n\n[[Page S5396]]\n\nspeech setting the agenda for public discourse, speech designed to open \nand change the minds of our fellow citizens, speech criticizing \npoliticians, speech challenging government policies--all of these forms \nof speech are vital rights. This amendment puts all of those examples \nin jeopardy upon penalty of imprisonment.\n  It would make America no longer America.\n  Contrary to the arguments of its supporters, the amendment would not \nadvance self-government against corruption and the drowning out of \nvoices of ordinary citizens. Quite the opposite. It would harm the \nrights of ordinary citizens, individually and in free association, to \nadvance their political views and to elect candidates who support their \nviews. By limiting campaign speech, it would limit the information \nvoters receive in deciding how to vote, and it would limit the amount \npeople can spend on advancing what they consider to be the best \npolitical ideas.\n  Its restrictions on speech apply to individuals. Politicians could \napply the same rules to individuals who govern corporations. Perhaps \nindividuals cannot be totally prohibited from speaking, but the word \n``reasonable'' is in this amendment. Reasonable limits can mean almost \nanything. Incumbents likely would set a low limit on how much an \nindividual can spend to criticize him. Then the individual will have to \nrisk criminal prosecution in deciding whether to speak, hoping a court \nwould later find the limit he or she exceeded was unreasonable. That \nwould create not a chilling effect on speech but a freezing effect.\n  This does not further democratic self-government like we are used to \nin this country.\n  When supporters such as the Senator from Illinois say that those who \nspend money in campaigns silence their critics, they have it exactly \nbackwards. One person speaking does not silence anyone, but the \ngovernment prosecuting people for speaking does.\n  My friend says that candidates, unlike individual groups, ``abide by \nstrict rules on . . . how much is being spent.'' This is simply not so. \nThat Senator is factually wrong. The rules are the same. The First \nAmendment requires that candidates be able to spend as much as they \nwant. That is true for individuals, corporations, and unions as well. \nIndividuals are limited in current law on how much they can contribute \nto candidates. Corporations cannot contribute to candidates at all.\n  The rules for expenditures are different. Candidate expenditures are \nexpenditures by others independent of the candidate and are unlimited \nbecause they are simply free expression. Individuals and corporations \ncannot and, in fact, do not make unlimited campaign contributions under \ncurrent law.\n  My friend also discussed fraud in voting, which he says does not \nexist, and opposed voter ID laws. The amendment before us has nothing \nto do with voting. Even if it did, polls consistently show that about \n75 percent of Americans support a requirement that voters produce photo \nID.\n  Prevention of fraud is common sense. Voter fraud exists, despite the \ntactic of voter ID opponents repeating over and over that it does not. \nIn my State of Iowa, there have been successful prosecutions for in-\nperson voter fraud.\n  In North Carolina recently, 765 registered voters appeared, based on \ntheir names, birth dates, and last four digits of their Social Security \nnumbers, to have voted in another State. That certainly warrants \ninvestigation. We would have more evidence of voter fraud if this \nadministration did not block efforts to prosecute its existence.\n  When Florida sought from the Department of Homeland Security a list \nof noncitizens it could compare against its voter rolls, the Department \nrefused to supply it.\n  Let's turn back to the amendment before us, which affects only free \nspeech rights, not voting rights. Keep our eye on the ball. The \namendment would apply to some campaign speech that could not give rise \nto corruption.\n  As my friend from Illinois stated, under current law an individual \ncould spend any amount of his or her own money to run for office, but \nan individual could not corrupt himself by his own money and could not \nbe bought by others if he or she did not rely on outside money.\n  Yet the amendment would allow Congress and the States to strictly \nlimit what an individual could contribute to or spend on his or her own \ncampaign. That would make beating the incumbents who would benefit from \nthe new powers to restrict speech much more difficult.\n  In practice, individuals seeking to elect candidates in the \ndemocratic process must exercise their First Amendment freedom of \nassociation in order to work together with others for a common \npolitical purpose. This amendment could prohibit that altogether. It \nwould permit Congress and the States to prohibit ``corporations or \nartificial entities . . . from spending money to influence elections.''\n  That means labor unions. That means nonprofit corporations such as \nthe NAACP Legal and Educational Defense Fund, Inc. That means political \nparties.\n  The amendment would allow Congress to prohibit political parties from \nspending money to influence the elections. If they can't spend money on \nelections, then these political parties would be rendered as mere \nsocial clubs.\n  The prohibition on political spending by for-profit corporations also \ndoes not advance democracy. Were this amendment to take effect, a \ncompany that wanted to advertise beer or deodorant would be given more \nconstitutional protection than a corporation of any kind that wanted to \ninfluence an election.\n  The philosophy of the amendment, as you can see, is very elitist. It \nsays the ordinary citizen cannot be trusted to listen, to understand \npolitical arguments, and evaluate which ones are persuasive. Instead, \nincumbent politicians interested in securing their own reelection are \ntrusted to be high-minded. Surely they would not use this new power to \ndevelop rules that could silence not only their actual opposing \ncandidate but associations of ordinary citizens who have the nerve to \nwant to vote them out of office.\n  As First Amendment luminary Floyd Abrams told the Judiciary \nCommittee:\n\n       [P]ermitting unlimited expenditures from virtually all \n     parties leads to more speech from more candidates for longer \n     time periods, and ultimately to more competitive elections.\n\n  Why would anybody want to destroy that political environment--more \nspeech, more candidates, longer time periods, and ultimately \ncompetitive elections? Incumbents are unlikely to use this new power to \nwelcome competition.\n  In fact, the committee report indicates that State and Federal \nlegislators are not the only people who would have the ability to \nlimit campaign speech under the amendment. It says States and the \nFederal Government can promulgate regulations to enforce the amendment. \nSo unelected State and Federal bureaucrats who do not answer to anyone \nwould be empowered to regulate what is now the freedom of speech for \nindividuals and entities that has been protected for 227 years by our \nBill of Rights. That would make a mockery of the idea that this \nproposed amendment advances democracy.\n\n  Another argument for the amendment--some voices should not drown out \nothers--also runs counter to free speech, and it is also very elitist. \nIt assumes voters will be manipulated into voting against their \ninterests because large sums will produce so much speech as to drown \nout others and blind them to the voters' true interests.\n  We had a perfect example very recently in Virginia's Seventh \nCongressional District. The incumbent Congressman outspent his opponent \n26 to 1. Newspaper reports state that large sums were spent on \nindependent expenditures on the incumbent's behalf, many by \ncorporations. No independent expenditures were made for his opponent. \nHis opponent won. That sounds like really drowning out a political \npoint of view.\n  That appears to be undue influence? No. The winner of that primary \nspent just over $200,000 to win 55 percent of the vote.\n  Since a limit that allowed a challenger to win would presumably be \n``reasonable'' under the amendment, Congress or the States could limit \nspending on House primaries to as little as $200,000, all by the \ncandidate, with no obviously unnecessary outside spending allowed.\n  The second set of unpersuasive arguments used by the proponents \nconcerns\n\n[[Page S5397]]\n\nCitizens United. That case has been mischaracterized as activist. As \nMr. Abrams stated, that case continues a view of free speech rights by \nunions and corporations that was expressed by President Truman and by \nliberal Justices in the 1950s. What Citizens United overruled was the \ndeparture from precedent, and Citizens United did not give rise to \nunfettered campaign spending.\n  The Supreme Court in 1976, in Buckley v. Valeo, ruled that \nindependent expenditures could not be limited. That decision was not \nthe work of supposed conservative judicial activists.\n  Wealthy individuals have been able to spend unlimited amounts since \nthen. And corporations and others have been able to make unlimited \ndonations to 501(c)(4) corporations since then as well.\n  As Mr. Abrams wrote to the Judiciary Committee in questions for the \nrecord, ``What Citizens United did do, however, is permit corporations \nto contribute to PACs that are required to disclose all donors and \nengage only in independent expenditures. If anything, Citizens United \nis a pro-disclosure ruling which brought corporate money further into \nthe light.'' So I do not think my colleagues are correct in saying that \nthis amendment is about so-called ``dark money.'' And limiting speech \nis totally separate from disclosure of speech. This amendment says \nnothing about disclosure.\n  And it is the amendment, not Citizens United, that fails to respect \nprecedent. It does not simply overturn one case.\n  As Mr. Abrams responded, it overturns 12 cases, some of which date \nback almost 40 years. As the amendment has been redrafted, it may be \n11\\1/2\\ now, depending on what ``reasonable'' means.\n  Justice Stevens, whom the Committee Democrats relied on at length in \nsupport of the amendment, voted with the majority in three of the cases \nthe amendment would overturn.\n  Some members of the Committee may not like the long established broad \nprotections for free speech that the Supreme Court has reaffirmed. But \nthat does not mean there are 5 activists on the Supreme Court. The \nCourt ruled unanimously in more cases this year than it has in 60 or 75 \nyears, depending on whose figures you use. Its unanimity was frequently \ndemonstrated in rejecting arguments of the Obama administration.\n  I have made clear that this amendment abridges fundamental freedoms \nthat are the birthright of Americans. The arguments made to support it \nare unconvincing. The amendment will weaken, not strengthen, democracy. \nIt will not reduce corruption, but will open the door for elected \nofficials to bend democracy's rules to benefit themselves.\n  The fact that the Senate is considering such a dreadful amendment is \na great testament to the wisdom of our Founding Fathers in insisting on \nand adopting a Bill of Rights in the first place.\n  As Justice Jackson famously wrote, ``The very purpose of a Bill of \nRights was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of \npolitical controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and \nofficials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by \nthe courts.\n  ``One's right to life, liberty, and property, to free speech, a free \npress, freedom of worship and assembly, and other fundamental rights \nmay not be submitted to vote; they depend on the outcome of no \nelections.''\n  We must preserve our Bill of Rights including our rights to free \nspeech. We must not allow officials to diminish and ration that right. \nWe must not let this proposal become the supreme law of the land.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. We have heard on this floor some lengthy speeches that \nbrought a number of arguments to bear in an effort to appear learned, \ninsightful, founded in law and founded in history, all to obscure the \nfundamental fact before this body, which is some on this floor today \nwant to see a government owned and operated by the powerful, not the \npeople. But that is exactly the opposite of what our Constitution was \nset up to do. The Founders of our Nation proceeded to lay out in very \nclear terms that the entire premise of our government would not be \nruled by the few over the many. It would not be a system of government \nset up of, by, and for the powerful. They laid that vision out in the \nvery first words of our Constitution.\n  This premise is so well-known to citizens that when you say: What are \nthe first three words of our Constitution, they will say, together: \n``We the People,'' because that is what animates our system of \ngovernment--``We the People.'' Those who came to argue for the \ngovernment by and for the powerful are simply trying to destroy our \nConstitution and our vision of government.\n  Citizens United, a court case that absolutely ignores the fundamental \npremises on which our Nation is founded, is a dagger poised at the \nheart of our democracy. It is a decision by five Justices that this \nframework doesn't matter.\n  The writers of the Constitution felt this was so important to convey \nto every citizen that this is the meaning, the core meaning of what our \ngovernment is about, that they proceeded to write those words in a font \nthat is approximately 10 times the size of everything that comes after \n``We the People of the United States. . . .'' And all that follows is \nto illuminate, expand on that vision.\n  It was President Lincoln who summarized the genius of our democracy \nin his speech at Gettysburg: `` . . . of the people, by the people, and \nfor the people.'' He proceeded to say that we must not let this vision \nperish from this Earth.\n  Yet Citizens United, day by day, election by election, is diminishing \nand destroying the very vision that President Lincoln summarized in \nthat speech on the battlefield at Gettysburg.\n  What does Citizens United say? It says that entities that are not \nindividuals, that have no claim to the Bill of Rights, can spend \nunlimited sums to inundate the airwaves and drown out the voice of the \npeople.\n  Imagine, if you will, the town square. Let's turn the clock back to \nthe early phase of our democracy.\n  There we are at the town square and everyone is supposed to have \ntheir chance to have their say in influencing the decisions that are to \ncome. The town council says: Do you know what, Mr. Jones or Mrs. \nAnderson, you get 30 seconds, but now over here we are going to give 4 \nhours to your opponent. Would anyone consider that an exercise in \ndemocracy? Oh, yes, the individuals get 30 seconds, but the powerful \nentity--maybe the big landholder--gets 4 hours to make his or her case. \nThat is not democracy. That is not ``We the People.'' That is rules \nthat are twisted to fix the game on behalf of the powerful against the \npeople, and that is what Citizens United represents.\n  Our system of government is such that it is essential that citizens \nbelieve that every citizen has a fair shot to participate because if \nthey do not believe there is a fair shot, then, in fact, the premise of \ndemocracy--``We the People''--is destroyed because why participate if \nthe system is rigged? That is what we are talking about--the rigging of \nthe system. I think those five Justices simply have not read the \nConstitution, have not read the first three words, do not understand \nthe premise, the foundation, the heart of our system of government and \nwhat it is intended to accomplish. It is as if they scratched out the \nfirst three words of the Constitution and said: We are rewriting it. We \nare going to rig the system for ``We the Powerful'' over the people. \nThat is what this debate is about.\n  In Citizens United, these five Justices--a one-vote majority over the \nfour who protested against this bizarre effort to destroy the premises \nof our democracy--said: Unlimited sums, dark money--such sums ``do not \ngive rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.'' They could \nnot be more wrong. Corruption in this sense is the rigging of the game \nsuch that citizens do not have a fair voice, and rigging the game is \nexactly what Citizens United does. It is so obvious that, of course, it \ngives rise to the appearance that the game is rigged because it is.\n  Think about the situation I described where the town council says to \nMr. Anderson or Mrs. Jones: You get 30 seconds; the opponent on the \nother side\n\n[[Page S5398]]\n\ngets 4 hours. That is exactly what we are seeing in elections across \nthe country. You may see in some elections that the average donation \nmay be $50. Along come the Koch brothers, who in most States would be \nout-of-State, out-of-State oil and coal billionaires, coming in and \nmaybe spending $3 million or $5 million or more through a variety of \nfront groups they have set up.\n  How many individual donations does it take to get the same time to \npresent your case as the Koch brothers spending, say, $3 million? Well, \nit would take about 60,000 $50 donations to buy the same opportunity to \nspeak. So Citizens United is very much like that town council saying: \nYou, madam citizen, get 30 seconds, but you, mister rich, powerful \nindividual, get 4 hours. So, of course, it is corrosive and corrupting. \nIt erodes fair opportunity for all citizens to have their voice heard. \nAnd because it does erode the ability of all citizens to have their \nvoice heard, of course, it enhances the belief, that is, the appearance \nthat the system is rigged, the appearance of corruption.\n  It changes the debate in this Chamber because colleagues look at \nthese millions of dollars brought to bear by just a couple individuals \nand they say to themselves in the back of their head: I better not step \non the toes of that group that can now spend millions of dollars in my \nelection way down in a southern State or way out in a western State or \nway up in the northeast. I better not step on their toes. If that is \nnot corrosive and corrupting to a ``We the People'' debate and \ndecisionmaking, I do not know what is.\n  Let's take an example. Not so long ago the party across the aisle was \nsaying: We think we have a good idea on how to use a market-based \nsystem to control sulfur dioxide. Rather than putting a limit on each \nsmokestack, we will create an overall limit and allow the market to \nallocate the most cost-effective way to reduce that sulfur dioxide \npollution. That cap-and-trade system invented across the aisle, \nproposed across the aisle, passed across the aisle, actually worked \npretty well. In fact, it worked spectacularly. Sulfur dioxide and acid \nrain were decreased faster, more cheaply than anyone envisioned. If the \nrange of possible outcomes was considered to be 1 through 10, this was \na 25. It was a resounding success.\n  But along come two individuals who have these billions of dollars who \nare getting into elections all over the country, who are threatening to \nput millions in to those who disagree, and they say: No, no, no. Sulfur \ndioxide, hmm, do not apply this idea that worked so well for the carbon \ndioxide pollution; do not do that; no matter how well this idea worked, \ndo not do that because we won't fund your election. If you are with us, \nwe will fund massive amounts of campaign ads to attack your opponents. \nThat is exactly what the Koch brothers have done, and they reversed the \nentire position of my colleagues across the aisle in a couple years--in \nabout a 2-year period--from a market-based control of a major \npollutant, carbon dioxide, to arguing that no, no, no, it cannot be \ncontrolled. That would be an energy tax.\n\n  Well, this happens time and time again, and the people across this \nNation do, in fact, pay attention. They are seeing the system is \nrigged. That is why in one poll 92 percent of Americans said this \nprogram is broken. I thought to myself: What is wrong with the other 8 \npercent? Haven't they paid attention? Don't they know how much this \nsystem is being corrupted by Citizens United, by the decision of those \nfive Justices?\n  Well, in addition, there is another form of corruption that comes \nfrom Citizens United; and that is those individuals who have been \nelected by these vast sums are beholden to those who elected them and \nthey will choose no policy that goes against those who have pulled \ntheir strings and gotten them elected. That is definitely a form of \nserious corruption in a democracy, where ideas are supposed to be \ndebated and decided, analyzed, not where vast corporate or individual \nwealthy billionaires pull the strings. So it is destroying the \ncompetition between ideas on how to take a path that works for ``We the \nPeople'' instead of ``We the Powerful.''\n  When people back home see those in this Chamber arguing to cut food \nstamps while not cutting a single egregious tax giveaway to powerful \noil companies, they see the corrosive influence of Citizens United. \nWhen they see folks across the aisle arguing that you should not \neliminate these subsidies that go to companies that ship our jobs \noverseas, and that you should oppose subsidies to bring those jobs \nhome, they see the powerful influence of Citizens United. The list \ncould go on and on.\n  We have a particular challenge because the concentration of wealth in \nAmerica is greater than it has been since 1920, greater than it has \nbeen for virtually a century. And now we have a system, thanks to our \nSupreme Court majority of five, that says wealth can be brought to bear \nto buy elections across this Nation. This is not the system that \ncolonists thought about when they were trying to set up a government \nthat would serve every American--not the few--that would serve humble, \nordinary working Americans--not the most powerful--that would serve \nthose in every economic level for a better vision, a better opportunity \nfor employment, a better opportunity for health, a better opportunity \nto live a quality life, instead of just those who have the biggest bank \ncheckbooks.\n  I urge my colleagues, let's take up this issue. How could any issue \nbe more important than this issue that goes to the very core of our \ndemocracy? Let's not try to run these lengthy, lengthy speeches with \nlearned, learned quotes, to try to disguise what this is about: the \nwealthiest, the most powerful oppressing the fundamental nature of our \ndemocracy.\n  Together we can stay the hand that holds the dagger aimed at the \nheart of democracy, and it is our responsibility to do so for this \ngeneration and for the generations to come.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/09/senate-section/article/S5398-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, more than 40 years ago, in New York Times \nv. Sullivan, Justice William Brennan described ``a profound national \ncommitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be \nuninhibited, robust, and wide-open.'' The measure now before the Senate \nshows that this commitment is in serious jeopardy.\n  Next week marks the 227th anniversary of the drafting of the U.S. \nConstitution. Those who participated in that process agreed that \nindividual liberty requires limits on government power, but they \ndiffered on how explicit and extensive those limits should be. Many \nthought the simple act of delegating enumerated powers to the Federal \nGovernment and reserving the rest to the States would be enough. Others \nwere more skeptical of government power and insisted that the \nConstitution needed a bill of rights. Those skeptics, however, were not \nskeptical enough. The measure before us today, S.J. Res. 19, would \nallow the government to control and even prohibit what Americans say \nand do in the political process.\n  Yesterday a member of the majority leadership said this measure is \n``narrowly tailored.'' It is possible to believe that only if you have \nnever read S.J. Res. 19 and know nothing about either the Supreme \nCourt's precedents or past proposals of this kind. This is not the \nfirst attempt at empowering the government to suppress political \nspeech, but it is the most extreme.\n  Four elements of this proposal are particularly troubling.\n  First, its purpose is to advance what it calls ``political \nequality.'' None of the constitutional amendments previously proposed \nto control political speech has made such a claim. The irony is \nastounding. At the very time in our history when technology is \nnaturally leveling the political playing\n\n[[Page S5399]]\n\nfield, this proposal would give the power to define political equality \nto government. If simply suggesting that the government should have the \npower to enforce its own version of political equality is not enough to \noppose this proposal, then our liberties are in even greater danger \nthan I thought.\n  In addition to its stated purpose, this proposal is also troubling \nbecause of the power it would give to government. Past proposals of \nthis kind were very specific about what government could or should \nregulate. One measure, for example, covered expenditures made ``to \nexpressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified \ncandidate for Federal office.'' More recently, proposed amendments \ncovered expenditures made ``in support of, or opposition to, a \ncandidate.'' The proposal before us today, however, says that \ngovernment may regulate ``the raising and spending of money by \ncandidates and others to influence elections.'' That is all it says. It \nwould allow government to control the raising and spending of money by \nanyone doing anything at any time to influence elections. No proposal \nof this kind has ever been drafted more broadly.\n  The same Democratic Senator who yesterday claimed this proposal is \nnarrowly tailored referred to big-money campaign donors, high rollers, \nand for-profit corporations with unlimited budgets. I urge not only my \ncolleagues but everyone listening to this debate to read S.J. Res. 19. \nJust read it. My liberal friends may want to paint certain billionaires \nor for-profit corporations as the big bad wolf, but this proposal goes \nfar beyond that. It would allow government to regulate the raising and \nspending of money not only by billionaires or corporations but by what \nit simply labels ``others.'' That means everyone everywhere. It means \nindividuals as well as groups, rich as well as poor, for-profits, \nnonprofits. Under this proposal, government could control them all.\n  It takes no imagination whatsoever to realize that virtually \neverything can influence elections. Voter registration drives, get-out-\nthe-vote efforts, nonpartisan voter information, discussion about \nissues, town meetings--all of these activities and many more influence \nelections.\n  Once again, I urge everyone to read the proposal before us. It would \ngive government the power to regulate anything done by anyone at any \ntime to influence elections.\n  The third troubling element of this proposal is that it would \nsuppress the First Amendment freedom of speech for individual citizens \nbut protect the First Amendment freedom of the press for Big Media. \nSupporters of this amendment want to manipulate and control how \nindividual citizens influence elections but are perfectly happy with \nhow Big Media influences elections. This proposal would allow \ngovernment to prohibit nonprofit organizations from raising or spending \na single dollar to influence elections but leaves multibillion-dollar \nmedia corporations free to influence elections as much as they choose. \nThat set of priorities represents a twisted sense of political equality \nthat I cannot believe most Americans share.\n  Finally, this proposal would allow government to distinguish between \nwhat it calls natural persons and ``corporations or other artificial \nentities created by law.'' Unlike other provisions of the Bill of \nRights, such as the Fourth or Fifth Amendment, the First Amendment does \nnot use the word ``person;'' it simply protects the freedom of speech--\na freedom that obviously can be exercised not only individually but \nalso collectively.\n  Yesterday a Democratic Senator dismissed the notion that corporations \ncan be treated as persons under the law because corporations never get \nmarried, raise kids, or care for sick relatives.\n  Is he kidding? A corporation cannot care for sick relatives, but it \ncertainly can speak, and that is what this debate is all about. As the \nSupreme Court observed more than a century ago, corporations are \n``merely associations of individuals.''\n  Perhaps I need to remind my colleagues that the first section of the \nfirst title of the United States Code is the Dictionary Act. It defines \nthe word ``person'' to include ``corporations, companies, associations, \nfirms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies, as well as \nindividuals.''\n  Many of what this proposal labels ``artificial entities''--such as \nnonprofit organizations, associations, or societies--exist to magnify \nthe voices of individuals. The Supreme Court case that sparked this \ndebate, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, was brought not \nby a for-profit corporation but by a nonprofit organization. S.J. Res. \n19 would allow government not only to regulate but to prohibit the \nraising or spending of money by these nonprofits, associations, and \nsocieties to influence elections. They could be banned from speaking on \nbehalf of what my Democratic colleagues like to refer to as ordinary, \naverage Americans. Suppressing the speech of organizations that speak \nfor individuals would leave millions of those Americans with no voice \nat all.\n\n  We should eliminate rather than create barriers to participation in \nthe political process. We should encourage rather than discourage \nactivities by our fellow citizens to influence the election of their \nleaders. We should prohibit rather than empower government to control \nhow Americans participate in the political process. We should, to \nreturn to Justice Brennan's words, strengthen rather than dismantle our \nnational commitment to uninhibited, robust, and wide-open debate on \npublic issues. Making S.J. Res. 19 part of the Constitution would \ninstead make that debate inhibited, weak, and closed.\n  As the Supreme Court has recognized, the First Amendment is premised \non a mistrust of government power. Neither the nature of government \npower nor its impact on individual liberty has changed. S.J. Res. 19, \ntherefore, proves three things. It proves that the government's \ntemptation to control what Americans say and do in the political \nprocess is as strong as ever. It proves that the majority believes it \ncan retain power only by suppressing the liberties of our fellow \nAmericans. It proves that the profound national consensus Justice \nBrennan described may no longer exist.\n  Another irony is that the majority in what we often call the world's \ngreatest deliberative body is trying to stifle the free speech of \ncitizens with whom they disagree. This is nothing more than election-\nyear misdirection, an attempt to distract attention from the majority's \ncomplete failure to address the real problems facing our Nation.\n  We should heed the advice of our late colleague from Massachusetts, \nmy friend Senator Ted Kennedy. We were often called ``the odd couple'' \nbecause we worked so well together but came from disparate or different \npolitical areas. In March 1997 this body was debating another proposed \nconstitutional amendment to control political speech. That measure, I \nwant my colleagues to know, was more narrowly drawn than the one before \nus today. It was limited to expenditures supporting or opposing \ncandidates and did not exempt Big Media. Yet Senator Kennedy rose to \noppose it and said:\n\n       In the entire history of the Constitution, we have never \n     amended the Bill of Rights, and now is no time to start. It \n     would be wrong to carve an exception in the First Amendment. \n     Campaign finance reform is a serious problem, but it does not \n     require that we twist the meaning of the Constitution.\n\n  That was said by Senator Kennedy, and he was right. The Senate voted \n38 to 61 against that proposal. And Senator Kennedy's words apply with \neven more force today, there is no question about it.\n  The real purpose of S.J. Res. 19 is exactly what America's Founders \nratified the First Amendment to prevent. Supporters of this radical \nproposal apparently believe that freedom itself is the problem. That \nview is contrary to the most fundamental principles of this Republic \nand incompatible with a free society. Freedom is not the problem; it is \nthe solution.\n  I am really amazed that my colleagues on the other side would attempt \nto pull this stunt at this time in our country's history, when almost \nanybody who looks at it knows it is done just for publicity and \npolitical reasons. At the same time, what an awful amendment it is. It \nmakes one wonder if people in the Congress today are really as serious \nabout our country as they were back at the beginning of this country. \nThose people didn't have nearly the knowledge from books of learning \nand capacities we have today,\n\n[[Page S5400]]\n\nbut for some reason they were inspired. They were well educated. They \nwere strong people. They knew what was right, they stood up for what \nwas right, and they did it in very carefully selected words, which \nwould be surely diminished by what the Democrats are trying to do here \ntoday.\n  I sometimes wonder, is politics more important than the Constitution? \nThey know they are not going to pass this resolution. We are not going \nto let them pass it. It is crazy. It is wrong. It is out of whack. It \nis against almost everything the Founding Fathers stood for. It is \nagainst Supreme Court precedent. It basically would limit the rights of \nfar too many people.\n  I know my colleagues are going to ultimately vote this down. This \nwill never get 67 votes and never should. It never should have seen the \nlight of day and never should have seen a minute on the floor of this \naugust body. It diminishes this body, that this type of amendment is \nbeing brought to the floor of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning \nbusiness for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n\n\n                            Fair Shot Agenda\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, over the last several weeks I spent a \nlot of time traveling across my home State of Washington hearing from \nworkers and families about the challenges they face in today's economy. \nWhile there is no question the economy has made a lot of progress, I \nspoke with far too many people who are working as hard as they can and \nstill feel as though they are running in place. Despite their best \nefforts, they have not achieved the kind of economic security that \nallows them to buy a home or save for retirement or start the new \nbusiness they have been thinking about. I think we can all agree more \nAmericans should have those kinds of opportunities.\n  So I am proud that this year Senate Democrats have focused on \nlegislation that would go a long way toward giving our families and \nAmericans a fair shot. We have made the case for giving millions of \nAmericans across this country a raise, helping students get out from \nthe crushing burden of student loan debt, ensuring that in the 21st \ncentury working women get equal pay, and so much more.\n  In the coming days we are going to bring these issues to the \nforefront once again and make another push for our Republican \ncolleagues to join us. Each one of these policies would do so much for \nour families and for economic growth, and that is especially true \nbecause each would help women in today's workforce. I have come to the \nfloor to focus on that last point in particular and talk about why each \nof these bills would make a real difference for women across the \ncountry.\n  You may remember that my Republican colleagues blocked these bills \nthe last time the Democrats brought them to the floor. So I am going to \nencourage my Republican colleagues to say something besides no when it \ncomes to higher wages for workers or college affordability or pay \nequity, because if they have a reason for opposing legislation that \nwould help women and families get ahead, I think the American people \ndeserve to hear it.\n  The role of women and families in our economy has shifted \ndramatically in the last several decades. Today 60 percent of families \nrely on earnings from both parents--up from 37 percent in 1975. Women \ntoday make up nearly half of the workforce, and more than ever women \nare likely to be the primary breadwinner in their families. Women are \nmaking a difference across the economy in boardrooms and lecture halls \nand small businesses, but our Nation's policies have not caught up with \nthe times. In fact, today they are holding women back.\n  Across the country women still earn 77 cents on the dollar on average \ncompared to men. That difference adds up. In Seattle last year women \nearned 73 cents on the dollar compared to their male counterparts, and \nthat translated to a yearly gap for women of $16,346. Nationwide, over \na typical woman's lifetime, pay discrimination amounts to $464,320 in \nlost wages. The gender wage gap makes dealing with other financial \nburdens such as student loans even more challenging.\n  This past spring I invited a woman from Massachusetts named AnnMarie \nDuchon to our Budget Committee hearing to testify about her own \npersonal experience with pay inequity. AnnMarie told us that over the \nyears she missed out on more than $12,000 in wages compared to a male \ncoworker who was doing the same job. She told us she and her husband \nboth have student loan debt and those lost wages--$12,000--would have \ncovered 10 months of payments. AnnMarie said thinking about that \nsetback was ``heartbreaking.''\n  AnnMarie said she was ultimately able to go back and convince her \nemployers to give her equal pay, but unfortunately most women are not \nable to do that. Many don't even know they are earning unequal wages. \nThat is a real loss, both for our families and for our economy as a \nwhole. That is why we need the Paycheck Fairness Act to tackle pay \ndiscrimination head-on and help ensure that in this 21st century \nworkers are compensated based on how they do their job, not on their \ngender.\n  Another policy that needs an update is our Federal minimum wage. Two-\nthirds of minimum wage workers are women. Many of them are the sole \nbreadwinners and sole caregivers for their family, and I know if you \nask them how $7.25 an hour translates to a grocery trip for a family of \nfour or shopping for school supplies or just paying transportation to \nand from work, they will give you a straight answer: It doesn't. \nDemocrats know it is time they got a raise. Republicans disagree. They \nsaid no earlier this year to a raise for 15 million women, and I think \nthe American people deserve to hear why.\n  Women aren't the only ones affected by these challenges, because when \nworking women aren't getting equal pay, when they haven't gotten a \nraise in years, when they are struggling to make ends meet, that means \ntheir families are too--and our economy as a whole is weaker for it.\n  Democrats have put forward ideas throughout this year that would help \nlevel the playing field. It has been, I must say, deeply disappointing \nthat time after time our Republican colleagues have simply said no--no \nto tax and pay discrimination through the Paycheck Fairness Act, no to \ngiving millions of workers across the country--including 15 million \nwomen--a raise, no to legislation that would relieve some of the \ncrushing burden of student loan debt, and the list goes on.\n\n  Republicans rejected so much as a debate on each of those bills just \na few months ago, and that is a shame because we know these are issues \nwomen and families truly care about. They rightly expect us to be \nworking together to come up with solutions. If Republicans are just \ngoing to reject our ideas, I think their constituents deserve to hear \nwhat else they have to offer.\n  When I was in my home State of Washington last month I spoke with an \nentrepreneur named Leilani Finau. Leilani has worked very hard to get \nher own business off the ground. She told me for the last 12 years she \nhas only been able to pay the interest on her student loans. So more \nthan a decade later she still owes the same amount of principal.\n  I also talked to a woman named Veronica Donoso. She is an \nadministrative specialist and a single mom from my home State. Veronica \ntold me about the financial burdens she is dealing with--not only \nstudent loans but childcare for her daughter. She said, ``I try not to \nlet my daughter see my struggles, but I feel terrible knowing that she \nis suffering too.''\n  I think women such as AnnMarie, Leilani, Veronica, and a lot of other \nwomen across the country deserve to hear more than just no from \nRepublicans when it comes to legislation that could make a difference \nfor them and their families.\n  In the next few days Republicans will have an opportunity to take a \ndifferent approach than they have so far this year. I am calling on the \nSenate Republican leader to take advantage of it. We should be able to \ndebate these important issues. Democrats have put solutions on the \ntable, a higher minimum wage, student debt relief, giving women more \ntools to fight pay discrimination, and more. If Republicans have more \nto say than no, it is time for them to do it.\n\n[[Page S5401]]\n\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW.

First, I thank the distinguished chair of \nthe Budget Committee for her words and her work on focusing on middle-\nclass families and making sure the economy grows for everyone. I wish \nto echo and expand upon the very same topics our distinguished \nchairwoman has been talking about.\n  First, I think it is important to note that we have seen an \nimprovement in the economy. We are seeing a stock market that has \ndoubled since President Obama took office. We have seen deficits going \ndown. We are seeing projections of slowing increases as they relate to \nhealth care and Medicare costs. We are seeing more jobs being created.\n  The challenge for us is making sure everyone has an opportunity in \nthat economy. We see an economy that has turned, but yet we see way too \nmany people who are not able to benefit from that economy and who don't \nhave a fair shot to create the opportunities for themselves and their \nfamilies.\n\n  So there is more work to be done and that is what the ``fair shot'' \nagenda is all about. I thank the Presiding Officer for her leadership \naround this whole question of how to make sure the economy works for \neveryone, how to make sure we have a middle class in this country--and \nwe will not have a middle class unless everybody has a fair shot to \nmake it.\n  We have put together five issues we have voted on that we will \ncontinue to bring up over and over again until they get passed--and \ncertainly there are other issues as well but five that would make a \ntremendous difference to Americans in terms of creating opportunity.\n  The first one is the minimum wage. If you work, you ought to be \nreceiving more wages than if you were in poverty. Why not be over the \npoverty line if you are working 40 hours a week. We ought to value work \nin our economy. Raising the minimum wage is an important piece of that. \nIt is the floor, the foundation that is high enough that your family is \nnot in poverty if you are working 40 hours a week. We raised this issue \nand we voted on this issue of raising the minimum wage above the \npoverty line and it was blocked by our Republican colleagues in April.\n  We then came back and looked at the fact that another part of the \nburden on middle-class families and those aspiring to get into the \nmiddle class is the cost of student loans. In fact, it is shocking to \nknow we have more student loan debt than credit card debt in this \ncountry. We are seeing that people are able to refinance their homes to \nlower interest rates and benefit from lower interest rates for a \nvariety of things, but they cannot refinance their student loans. \nPeople are locked in, whether it is current students, people recently \nout of college--we know there is a certain percentage of the trillion \ndollars in student loans that are paid by people who are retired, \nactually on Medicare and still paying off student loans. The law \ncurrently does not allow them to even just refinance to the low rates \nthat one can get in other parts of the economy. Back in June we put \nforward a refinancing bill that would help 25 million Americans--\nincluding 1 million in Michigan alone--reduce their student loan debt, \nput more money in their pocket so they can buy a house, they can raise \na family. I know realtors in my State of Michigan and those who are \ninvolved in mortgage banking are now deeply concerned about this issue \nbecause the debt they have is disqualifying people from buying a home \nor being able to make other investments, starting a small business or \nother opportunities for refinancing.\n  So this is a critically important issue. If someone is following the \nrules of working hard and doing what we all say to do, getting skills \nso they can compete and be part of the new economy and get a job, but \nfolks find themselves in a situation where all they can do is create \ncrushing debt in all of this and spend years and years and years, \noftentimes hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loan debt, this \nis a concern. This is getting in the way of allowing people to be \nsuccessful and have a middle class in this country. We have our student \nloan bill based on students, and it was unfortunately voted down by \nRepublicans in June.\n  Then we go on to an issue we didn't originally have on our agenda \nuntil the Supreme Court made what I believe was an outrageous decision \nthat affects women in their personal health care decisions, basically \nsaying that for a woman to get a certain kind of coverage for birth \ncontrol or contraception, she would have to walk into her boss's office \nand sit down and explain her personal health care issues and get \napproval for birth control. I don't know any other part of the health \ncare system that requires a boss to oversee a decision made by an \nemployee. But this was something that was decided as being a legitimate \noption under a Supreme Court decision called the Hobby Lobby decision.\n  So we put forth legislation to make it clear it is not your boss's \nbusiness, that women ought to be able to receive coverage for \npreventive care for women just as men do for their health care \ndecisions. We voted on a bill that would make sure women could make \ntheir own basic health decisions in privacy, and that was blocked in \nJuly by Republicans, indicating they did not believe women should have \nthe opportunity to make their own health care decisions.\n  Then a bill of mine with Senator Walsh called the Bring Jobs Home Act \ncame before us. It is a very simple premise again. We are a global \neconomy. We want to export our products but not our jobs, and we have \ntax policy right now that incentivizes those who want to take the jobs \noverseas. Some of this is craziness in the Tax Code, I believe.\n  One of those very simple policies that has sent a message that it is \nOK to ship jobs overseas is the fact that if a company closes shop in \nplaces such as Michigan or Wisconsin or Ohio or anywhere in the \ncountry--we have seen too much of this in Michigan over the last \ndecade--they can actually write off the cost of the move. The employer \ncan say to the employees, you pack up the boxes, and by the way--\nthrough the Tax Code--you will end up paying for the move. The Bring \nJobs Home Act says, no, we are not paying, as American taxpayers, for \nyour move if you are moving outside the country with those jobs. If you \nwant to come back, great, you can not only write off those costs, we \nwill give you an extra 20-percent tax credit for the cost on top of it.\n\n  Very simply put, the Bring Jobs Home Act is for those who want to \ncome home to America. We are all for it. We will support you and help \nyou do that. If you want to leave America, you are on your own. That \nwas blocked by the Republicans in July.\n  As if blocking those four very important, commonsense bills was not \noutrageous enough, Republicans once again blocked a bill to guarantee \nwomen equal pay for equal work. I can't believe we are talking about \nthis in 2014. Everybody says, wait a minute, we have equal pay for \nequal work. We have a law on the books that is not enforced at this \npoint in time. We have court decisions that do not allow the actual \nequal pay for equal work statute to truly be enforced in this country, \nwhich is why we find ourselves in a situation where nationally women \nstill only receive 77 cents on a dollar. In Michigan, it is 74 cents on \na dollar.\n  It is hard to believe that in this day and age--in 2014--42 of our \nRepublican colleagues voted against the Paycheck Fairness Act. I hope \nwe are going to have another chance in the near future to vote on that \nand again give them an opportunity to support equal pay for equal work.\n  When we look at Michigan, where women are working very hard every \nday, I find it stunning that they are making only 74 cents on every \ndollar. They are getting 26 cents less for every dollar that they work. \nWhen you go to the grocery store, you don't get a 26-percent reduction. \nThey can't say: Hey, I am paid less. Here is my 26-percent discount. \nWhen they go to the gas station, they don't get a 26-percent discount. \nWhen they pay their mortgage, they don't get a 26-percent discount. \nObviously it doesn't make sense and the numbers don't add up, but it is \nmuch more than just about numbers.\n  I remember when Kerri Sleeman from Houghton, MI--up in the Upper\n\n[[Page S5402]]\n\nPeninsula--came here to testify in the Senate. She was a senior \nengineer supervising a group of engineers at the company. After the \ncompany closed and went bankrupt, she was reviewing the legal documents \nand found that she, as the engineering supervisor, had, in fact, been \npaid less than those whom she supervised.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for another minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Kerri Sleeman, as a supervisor, deserved to receive the \nkind of pay she should receive as a supervisor.\n  One of the things I find outrageous is when we hear folks on the \nother side of the aisle say equal pay for equal work is nonsense; the \nbill is nonsense. It is a distraction. In Michigan we have heard people \nsay: Women don't care about equal pay, they want flexibility. Well, \nflexibility doesn't pay for my groceries. The truth of the matter is \nwomen want to have the opportunity to receive equal pay.\n  We are at a point in time where we ought to move forward quickly in \npassing each one of these issues. As we know, this is about the economy \nand growing the middle class in this country. We are not going to have \na middle class unless everybody has a fair shot to participate and work \nhard and be successful, and we need to get about the business of making \nsure that happens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I can't tell you how disappointed I am \nthat the majority leader has continued to persist in blocking votes on \nmore than 300 different pieces of bipartisan legislation that have \npassed the House of Representatives and that he refuses to bring up in \nthe Senate. Rather than work together on a bipartisan basis to try to \nget the economy moving and get Americans back to work, we have these \nfocus group, poll-tested show votes. The distinguished Senator from \nMichigan just admitted that equal pay for equal work is already the law \nof the land and then said we need to vote on it again. Well, it should \nbe renamed ``The Trial Lawyer Relief Act'' because that is what it is. \nIt is going to benefit the trial lawyers by encouraging litigation and \nwill do nothing to make sure there is equal pay for equal work. We all \nagree that is and should be the law of the land, but encouraging \nlegislation such as lawsuits against small businesses would do nothing \nto create jobs and grow the economy.\n  There is a reason why the congressional approval rating is at 14 \npercent. The distinguished senior Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain--in \na display of what I guess could be called gallows humor--said we are \ndown to paid staff and blood relatives. Those are the only ones who \nstill approve of what Congress is doing, and it is easy to understand \nwhy.\n  We just came back off of a recess where we had a chance to go back \nhome and talk to our constituents. More importantly than talk to them, \nwe had a chance to listen to them and hear what is on their minds. What \nare their concerns? What are their hopes? What are their dreams? What \nare they worried about? I guarantee that none of my constituents \nsuggested we need to repeal the First Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution. That is the particular legislation that is on the floor \ntoday. That is the priority of the Democratic majority leader. It is a \nshow vote to try to deny people an equal opportunity to participate in \nthe political process--to shut them out if you disagree with them and \nsilence them. Tell them to sit down, be quiet, we are in charge and in \ncontrol.\n  I cannot tell you how disappointed I am that it seems as though it is \nall politics all the time. Every perceived or real problem that our \nDemocratic friends seem to identify--what is their solution? It is more \ngovernment. The most feared words in the English language where I come \nfrom are ``I'm from the Federal Government and I'm here to help.''\n  We had an experiment over the last 5\\1/2\\ years since President Obama \nwas elected and the electorate gave the Democratic Party control of \nboth the House and Senate. We have had a scientific experiment in the \nsize and role of government and the results are in, and they are pretty \npathetic. Unemployment is still unacceptably high. The labor \nparticipation rate, which is the percentage of people actually \nparticipating in the workforce, is at a 30-year low. People have given \nup looking for work, which is a great human tragedy.\n  Then there is the President's approval rating. He is doing better \nthan Congress, I will give him that, but it is down around 40 percent. \nHere is the troubling thing--and this is not a partisan comment. As an \nAmerican, I worry when the Commander in Chief has the sort of poll \nnumbers we are talking about. There was a poll reported by the \nWashington Post and ABC News on September 9. The poll showed that \nAmericans say, by 52 percent to 42 percent, that President Obama has \nbeen more of a failure than a success as President of the United \nStates. That is terrible. But it demonstrates his refusal to engage \nwith Congress on a bipartisan basis to do the country's work. It also \nreflects the mistakes he has made when it comes to leadership around \nthe world.\n  President Obama wanted his second term to be about nation building \nhere at home rather than conflicts and crises abroad. But, as we all \nknow by now, the world is not cooperating. Even worse, the President is \nnot leading. Instead, he has embraced a dangerously reactive foreign \npolicy marked by empty rhetoric and wishful thinking, and the results \nare now plain to see.\n  When we look at the Middle East, we see a massive terrorist enclave \nspanning western Iraq and eastern Syria. The border between Syria and \nIraq is gone. It is the site of a new caliphate. They are the Islamic \nradicals who were deemed so bad that Al Qaeda didn't want to have \nanything to do with them--ISIS. They have created what they believe is \nan Islamic state or caliphate, where Shari'a law will rule and women \nwill have virtually no rights and people will have no liberty or \nfreedom. We have seen American journalists being decapitated on video. \nWe see a brutal Syrian civil war in which about 200,000 civilians have \nbeen killed--200,000 human beings are dead as a result of a Syrian \ncivil war--and millions more Syrians have been displaced internally \nwithin this country or else living in refugee camps in Turkey, Lebanon, \nand Jordan.\n\n  We see a failed state in Libya. We see a terrorist-sponsoring Iranian \ntheocracy that continues to pursue a nuclear weapon, and we see a \nviolent Iranian axis stretching from Tehran to Damascus to Beirut and \nGaza.\n  Meanwhile, let's not forget about Eastern Europe. We see an \naggressive, autocratic gangster state conducting a cross-border \ninvasion of democratic neighbors and taking sovereign territory by \nforce in a manner not seen on the European continent since World War \nII.\n  A few weeks ago the President announced that Western sanctions \nagainst Russia were working as intended. Yet, in late August a large \nnumber of Russian troops began launching major incursions into Eastern \nand Southern Ukraine in the hopes of seizing even more territory. They \nalready have Crimea; that is yesterday's news. Now they are making \nfurther gains in Eastern and Southern Ukraine. One Ukrainian official \ncalled it a full-scale invasion. It doesn't sound to me as though the \nsanctions that were issued by the United States are working as intended \nas the President has said.\n  Our existing sanctions are inadequate. They are not working as \nintended. Vladimir Putin is not deterred by economic sanctions. In \nfact, according to one Italian newspaper, Putin recently told the \nPresident of the European Commission that if Russia wanted to, it could \ntake Kiev in 2 weeks. I am sure Mr. Putin is OK if it takes a little \nbit longer, just as long as he gets the territory he needs to try to \nrestore the Russian empire to his former visions of glory.\n  White House officials famously describe the President's foreign \npolicy as ``don't do stupid stuff.'' That is one for the history \ntextbooks. That is the sort of policy our students need to study in \nhigh school: Don't do stupid stuff. Come on.\n  Time and time again in country after country on issue after issue, \nthis administration has, by its inaction and its ambivalence, \nundermined America's partners, adversaries are emboldened, and it has \nweakened American credibility.\n\n[[Page S5403]]\n\n  Let's start with the Middle East. In Libya, President Obama launched \na war against Moammar Qadhafi in Libya and then he did virtually \nnothing to help stabilize the country after Qadhafi's fall. That \nneglect ultimately led to the tragic death of four Americans in \nBenghazi in September 2012. It also led to the emergence of terrorist \nhavens. What do they look for other than a power vacuum that they can \nfill where they can seek sanctuary and launch attacks in the region or \nagainst other adversaries? This has led to Libya's collapse as a \nfunctioning state. It is a failed state.\n  It has also enabled jihadist groups in Mali and Africa until they \nwere driven out by the French.\n  Then there is Syria. Remember when the President said Bashir Assad \nneeds to step down? He then did virtually nothing to help see that \nhappen. He did nothing to arm the moderate rebel forces opposing Assad \nin the Syrian civil war. The irony is that U.S. officials had a plan to \nsupport those rebels, and they recommended it to the President in the \nsummer of 2012 a plan proposed by then-Secretary of Defense Leon \nPanetta, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, then-CIA Director \nDavid Petraeus, and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Dempsey. They \nrecommended a plan to deal with Assad and to facilitate the regime \nchange President Obama called for. What did the President do? He \nrejected it, even though his stated policy in Syria since August 2011 \nhas been regime change.\n\n  It has become commonplace to say that the United States has no good \noptions in Syria. But President Obama's chronic passivity has helped \nthe jihadists. I know that is not his intention, but it has helped the \nresult. It has helped embolden the Iranians, and it has made the Syrian \nwar even more dangerous for the United States and the United States' \ninterests.\n  Then there is Iraq. President Obama failed to secure a new status of \nforces or bilateral security agreement that would have protected \nAmerican forces that served on a transitional basis in Iraq after the \nconclusion of the Iraq war. We kept troops in Japan and Germany after \nWorld War II, and indeed the Americans were the only glue capable of \nholding the country of Iraq together and avoiding the sort of sectarian \ncivil war we have seen ensue. But his complete withdrawal of U.S. \nforces in 2011 was a huge gift to Iraq's Shiite militias, their Iranian \npatrons, and the Sunni terrorists of Al Qaeda who would later form the \nso-called Islamic State or ISIS or ISIL, as they are now called. I have \nto tell my colleagues, as I reflect on the American casualties in \nRamadi, in Fallujah--our marines, our brave American soldiers, men and \nwomen, their loss of life or injuries incurred in liberating Iraq from \nSaddam Hussein and to see all of that forfeited by the President's \nunwillingness to secure a bilateral security agreement and leave a \ntransitional, small footprint force there to help the Iraqis transition \nto self government and democracy--it breaks my heart. I don't know how \nwe explain that to someone who lost a loved one in Ramadi or Fallujah \nor anywhere else in the Iraq war.\n  According to the Wall Street Journal, at least 8 million Syrians and \nIraqis live under full or partial Islamic State control. Eight million \nSyrians and Iraqis are living under the rule of medieval barbarians who \nnot only decapitated two American captives but have accumulated a \nfrightening amount of territory and wealth. They control a lot of the \nnatural resources, the oil wells, in Iraq now because we have allowed \nthem to capture it, and now that is the source of revenue for them to \ncontinue their terror. They have accumulated a frightening amount of \nterritory and wealth by robbing, raping, extorting, and murdering \ninnocent civilians.\n  By allowing the Islamic State to take over such a large part of Iraq \nand Syrian territory, President Obama has neglected one of the key \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission. We remember the 9/11 \nCommission. It was a bipartisan commission set up after the tragedy of \n9/11 to ask: How do we keep this from ever happening again?\n  One of the key recommendations of the 9/11 Commission is that the \nU.S. Government identify and prioritize actual or potential terrorist \nsanctuaries; in other words, safe havens. Instead, the President has \nstood by and watched like a spectator while the Islamic State, over the \ncourse of many months, carved out its own safe haven, right in the \nheart of the Middle East.\n  I am grateful to the President that he now has made a pledge to \ndestroy ISIS. I believe this is not a threat that can be managed; I \nthink it needs to be eliminated. So I congratulate the President for \nhaving evolved to this point where he understands the nature of the \nthreat to American interests and to the American people, and I hope he \nis serious about doing that. But as one person recently noted, the \nObama administration has persuaded just about every leadership cadre in \nthe Middle East that the United States can be safely ignored when its \nprincipals make threats or promises. Remember the red line in Syria \nwith chemical weapons. Well, the red line was crossed, and there were \nvirtually no consequences associated with it. What is the lesson we \nlearn? I guess I can get away with it and I am going to keep on \ncoming--such as Vladimir Putin in Crimea and Ukraine.\n  Speaking of threats and promises, President Obama has repeatedly \nthreatened Russia with serious consequences over its invasion of \nUkraine, and he has repeatedly promised to help the Ukrainian people \nuphold their sovereignty. Yet he continues to stubbornly refuse to \nprovide the very arms to the Ukrainian patriots needed in order to \ndeter and deflect and defeat Russian aggression. What are we giving \nthem? Our good wishes? Sending them some food and medical supplies? \nThat is fine as far as it goes. But without the actual weapons and the \ntraining they need in order to defeat Russian aggression and to raise \nthe cost for Vladimir Putin, he is not going to stop. Yet the \nPresident's threats haven't been reinforced with the kind of action \nnecessary to change Moscow's calculations, and his promises to the \ngovernment of Kiev now look rather empty.\n  The tragedy is it seems as though there is one world crisis after \nanother, and we have long since forgotten about Libya, Syria, and the \nred lines and the chemical weapons there. They seem like a vague and \ndistant memory because now we are focused on ISIS. But they are all \npart of the same problem.\n  There is a very real danger in Ukraine that last week's cease-fire \nwill only solidify Russia's recent territorial gains and legitimize its \nongoing invasion and further embolden Vladimir Putin to seize even more \nUkrainian territory or the territory of another Eastern European \ncountry when the time seems right. Amidst all of this upheaval, all of \nthis violence, all of these challenges, all of these threats to U.S. \ninterests and allies, the President seems disturbingly aloof. Here is \nwhat he said about the ongoing global turmoil at a recent fundraising \nevent on August 29. This was reported in the press. He said:\n\n       The world has always been messy. In part, we are just \n     noticing it now because of social media and our capacity to \n     see in intimate detail the hardships that people are going \n     through.\n\n  But make no mistake about it. The Middle East has not always been \nconsumed by the type of violence and chaos we are seeing today, and \nEuropean countries have not always been facing cross-border invasions \nsuch as that posed by Russia today.\n  The world needs strong American leadership. Ronald Reagan was right. \nWe have a safer, more peaceful world when America is strong and does \nnot create the safe havens for terrorists or by our timidity or our \nrhetoric that is not followed up on by actions that create the \nimpression that people can get away with it. It just encourages the \nthugs, the dictators, and the terrorists.\n  The President's refusal to accept any real responsibility for the \nconsequences of his foreign policy is troubling enough, but what is \neven more troubling is he doesn't seem to fully grasp the magnitude of \nthe threats and challenges that America is now dealing with. If he \nthinks this is all about social media and people being aware of things \nthat were happening before but they weren't aware of before, I hope he \nwill think again. Indeed, his overall record is looking more and more \nlike a case study in the perils of weaknesses, naivete, and indecision. \nI can only hope that recent events will force him to change course.\n  That could start by his coming to Congress with a strategy to \neliminate\n\n[[Page S5404]]\n\nISIS, to eliminate this threat. I believe there would be bipartisan \nsupport for a strategy the President would present that has a \nreasonable chance of success. But just to have open-ended air strikes \nand maybe just a strategy comprising hopes and dreams but not one with \nthe likelihood of working is not good enough. But if he came to us and \nworked with Congress, I think it would serve multiple purposes.\n  First, it would comply with the Constitution and the laws of the \nUnited States. That is important.\n  Second, by engaging in bipartisan support in Congress, he would build \nsupport necessarily for this policy among the American people. I don't \nbelieve Americans should ever go to war without the support of the \nAmerican people. We see what happens when that support fades and \ncrumbles, and it is not good.\n  The third reason he ought to come to Congress is I read in some of \nthe news clips today he is going to come and ask us for $5 billion to \nfight ISIS. Well, the President--who is famous for saying, I am going \nto go it alone; I have a pen and a phone--can't go it alone when it \ncomes to appropriating money. He needs Congress to appropriate that \nmoney. And Congress should not appropriate money without a strategy \nthat has a reasonable likelihood of working or without an explanation \nof how this strategy is going to protect America and Americans' \ninterests.\n  So in his remarks on U.S. policy toward the Islamic State in Iraq and \nSyria tomorrow night when he makes this nationwide address, I urge the \nPresident to go beyond the rhetoric and offer a clear explanation of \nour military objectives and our strategic objectives. I urge him to \nexplain how and why the Islamic State poses a dangerous threat to U.S. \nnational security interests, which I believe it does and I believe he \nthinks it does. So I hope he will explain it to the American people so \nthey can understand it. I urge him to explain how U.S. allies and \npartners can help support America's mission, because we can't and \nshould not do it alone. Indeed, we do need that coalition, particularly \nof people in the region who have the most direct interest and stake in \nthe outcome. We need them to come to the table and help too.\n  Finally, I urge him to explain what his strategy is and how U.S. \noperations in Iraq and Syria fit within the broader role on radical \nIslamic terrorism. If the President gave such a speech--and I hope he \ndoes--I hope it is followed with true negotiations and deliberations \nand consultation with Congress. I know Minority Leader Pelosi and \nMajority Leader Reid and the Republican leader of the Senate, Senator \nMcConnell, and Speaker Boehner and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy are \nvisiting with the President perhaps as I speak. Maybe that is just the \nbeginning of the kind of consultation that should take place. But I \nhope it is followed on by true collaboration and consultation with all \nMembers of Congress so that we as Americans can come together and do \nwhat is in our national interests. But we can't do it without \nleadership, and we don't do it without a strategy to accomplish that \ngoal.\n  I think in the process the President could inject some much needed \nclarity and direction into a foreign policy that has become hopelessly \nmuddled and aimless.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                             Foreign Policy\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am going to give a brief statement about corporate \ninversion, but before I do I wish to respond to the Senator from Texas, \nwho is my friend, and we have served together for many years. He has \ntaken the floor for a period of time and spoken about some of the \nproblems facing this Nation at home and abroad and has been largely \nbeen critical of the President in both categories. I didn't arrive \nearly enough to hear his parade of horribles when it came to domestic \npolicy; I just caught the end of it when he suggested there was \nsomething wrong with this President because America's labor force, its \nworkforce, is shrinking. People are giving up looking for work. Well, \nthat is a serious concern, and we ought to ask a question: Why are they \ngiving up looking for work? It turns out it has, perhaps, something to \ndo with the policy of our government, but it also has something to do \nwith the life expectancy of Americans.\n  I am a little older than the Presiding Officer, and I just barely \nmissed what we call baby boomers. Baby boomers are those born after \nWorld War II when the returning soldiers and their wives and spouses \nsat down and said: We are going to build a family. And they did. A lot \nof kids were born in America. It was called a baby boom.\n  Guess what. Baby boomers are facing retirement age. The workforce is \nshrinking because they are retiring. I would like to blame Barack Obama \nfor that, but I think maybe that is a stretch. I don't think you can \nblame him for the baby boom. He wasn't even around after World War II, \nand he certainly can't be blamed because people decide to retire. \nLongevity kind of suggests when that might happen.\n  But still in all, it is another one of the things that is ticked off: \nThe shrinking labor pool is an indication of the failure of the Obama \nlabor policy. No. It is an indication of the shrinking baby boomers, \nwho are aging out and retiring--and God bless them; they are entitled \nto it. Folks ought to think twice about that particular criticism.\n  I would like to address the foreign policy side, and I do wish to put \nin perspective what the Senator from Texas had to say, which was a long \nlist--going all across the world--of problems this President has either \nfailed to fix or has created.\n  I listened carefully, and I always do, because critics of the \nPresident have every right to do that. That is part of democracy. But \nthey also bear some responsibility to suggest what we should do as an \nalternative. Many of them said we have to be more manly, we have to \nstand up, and we have to show the world we are assertive. What does \nthat mean? What are they saying?\n  What the President is saying is that we have to be careful that we \ninvest American lives, American treasure, and the American military in \nthis world in places where we can make a difference and take care not \nto do, as they said inartfully, stupid stuff by sending our military \ninto places where they cannot achieve their goal and reasonably come \nhome in a short period of time. That is the President's position.\n  I have not heard those on the other side be more specific when they \nsay we have to be more assertive in America.\n  The date was October 11, 2002, on the floor of the Senate--and I was \nhere. It was 12 years ago, and it was the night we voted on giving \nPresident George W. Bush the authority to invade Iraq. The rollcall \ntook place late at night, and I stuck around afterward. There were \nabout three or four of us left on the floor. In the final rollcall \nthere were 23 Senators who voted no on the invasion of Iraq. I was one \nof them. There was 1 Republican, and the rest were Democrats--1 \nIndependent and 21 Democrats, I should say. Twenty-three of us voted no \non invading Iraq. Twenty-three of us questioned whether being assertive \nat that moment in history was the right thing to do. Remember, we were \ntold about weapons of mass destruction and threats to the United \nStates. Some of us were skeptical. The case had not been made. But we \nwent forward.\n  I would like to make a note as well that even though there was a \ndifference of opinion about the policy of Iraq under President George \nW. Bush after the decision was made to go forward, many of us who voted \nno joined in with those who voted yes to say: Now that we have made the \ndecision, we stand together as a nation. We are going to provide for \nPresident George W. Bush the resources for these men and women in \nuniform so they can accomplish their mission and come home safely.\n  In other words, partisanship ended at the water's edge after we had \nmade our decision. I still think that is the right course in foreign \npolicy. Even though I voted against that war, I voted for the resources \nfor the troop to execute it.\n  I thought: What if it were your son, Senator? What if it were someone \nyou loved? Do you want them to have everything they need to get them \nhome safely?\n  Of course.\n  I wish that longstanding tradition in Congress would return. Wouldn't \nit be healthy and inspiring if after a heated debate over a foreign \npolicy issue we said: Now we stand together. The decision has been \nmade. We are going to stand as a nation.\n  But instead what I hear from the other side when it comes to foreign \npolicy issues: We are going to be critical\n\n[[Page S5405]]\n\nof whatever he does, whenever he does it, wherever he does it.\n  I don't think that is constructive. I don't think it speaks well of \nthe United States. The debate is important. The debate is part of us, \npart of who we are as a democracy. But after the debate, let's get on \nwith working together.\n  Do you remember that it wasn't that long ago when they discovered \nchemical weapons in Syria? The President said: This isn't just a threat \nto Syria; this is a threat to the Middle East and beyond. I am going to \nmake a stand to dismantle those chemical weapons in Syria, and I ask \nCongress for the authority not to send in troops but, if necessary, a \nmissile, a bomber, a fighter plane to support our efforts to eradicate \nthis chemical weapons stockpile.\n  Do you remember what happened? I do. What happened was we had a \ndebate in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a vote--a \nbipartisan vote--which supported the President. Then we couldn't bring \nit to the floor because there was not adequate support from the other \nside of the aisle to stand by the President when it came to dismantling \nchemical weapons in Syria. He went forward, working then with Russian \nleader Vladimir Putin, and basically all of those weapons have been \ndismantled. When the President asked for the authority to dismantle \nthose weapons, he couldn't get the support of the other party. That was \nthe reality.\n  Now we face a new challenge, and there are those who say that if we \nhad just been bold and assertive--and I wonder if what they are saying \nis if we had just shown the strength we showed with the invasion of \nIraq, this might not have occurred.\n  Make no mistake. I am honored to chair the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee. It is the biggest. Our budget is just under $600 billion \na year. It is almost half of domestic discretionary spending. I have \ncome to learn that our military is really the best in the world, \nstarting with the men and women who serve but way beyond that--our \ntechnology, our intelligence. We have the very best, but we have \nlearned the hard way that even the best military in the world can run \ninto obstacles they did not anticipate.\n  The first time I went to Walter Reed, I visited with a disabled Iraqi \nveteran. He was a sergeant from Ohio who had his right leg blown off \nbelow the knee.\n  I said: What happened?\n  He said: It was an IED.\n  I said: What is that?\n  He said: Well, it is an explosive device, roadside bomb. And we were \nin the best military equipment in the world, and this crude roadside \nbomb went off and blew off my leg.\n  I thought to myself: I wonder, if the greatest military in the world \nwith the greatest technology in the world can be brought to a stop by a \ncrude roadside bomb, if we are properly evaluating war today, fighting \nterrorism today.\n  What the President is trying to do is to find effective ways to stop \nthis onset of terrorism in the Middle East, this new round of terrorism \nin the Middle East, this group called Islamic State.\n  Why are we picking this group out of all the other terrorist groups--\nand there are many of them. They are quantitatively, qualitatively \ndifferent. They are the first terrorist group we know that has taken \nand held territory. Usually terrorist groups set off a bomb in the \nmarketplace and they are gone. No, they take and hold territory. They \ncapture banks--go inside and take all the resources out--so they have a \ntreasury. Some people think they earn as much as $1 million a week off \nthe oil wells they are controlling in Iraq. They use American equipment \nthat has been left behind or stolen, and they engage in the worst level \nof savagery we have seen in modern times. The beheading of those two \ninnocent Americans was heartbreaking--heartbreaking in one respect as I \nthought about their poor families and what they face, but it also \nenraged me to think that this group, the Islamic State, would do that \nto two innocent Americans, defying us and saying to us: This is just \nthe beginning. It is a serious threat, and it is a threat to the \nstability in Iraq.\n  Here we are 12 years after we invaded Iraq, after we have lost 4,476 \nAmerican lives in Iraq, after 30,000 of our troops have come home \nseriously injured, after we put $1 trillion more on our national debt \nto pay for the Iraqi struggle, and the country is virtually in chaos.\n  The President is saying to the American people: I want to fight \nterrorism, I want to do it effectively, and I want to do it smartly. I \nwant to do it in a way where we are not sending in troops who are there \nfor long periods of time to just be targets for terrorists. Let's use \nour resources and our forces in a thoughtful way.\n  I am awaiting a speech tomorrow night because I want to hear, as he \nlays this out, what he hopes to accomplish, how long we are going to be \nthere, where we are going to be, and by what authority he is moving \nforward and using these military resources. Those are all legitimate \nquestions, and it is right for the loyal opposition to raise questions \nabout where he is going, why he is going, and what he wants to do. But \nfor the time being, I think the American people want the President to \npresent his case and then make their judgment as to what is fair to \nbring stability to this critical part of the world.\n\n\n                          Corporate Inversion\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, when a company moves its corporate \nheadquarters overseas, but only on paper so it can avoid paying its \nfair share of U.S. taxes, these companies , are called corporate \ninverters. But let's call them what they really are: corporate \ndeserters.\n  These companies profit using roads and bridges built with American \ntax dollars to deliver goods to U.S. customers. They benefit from \naccess to America's educated workforce . . . American investments in \nbasic research . . . and American patent protections. And some have \neven made millions, if not billions, of dollars from taxpayer-funded \ngovernment contracts and programs like Medicare.\n  But when it comes time to pay their fair share of U.S. taxes--the \nvery taxes that pay America's roads and bridges . . . our colleges and \nuniversities . . . basic research . . . patent protections . . . \nMedicare . . . and other competitive advantages--these companies do \neverything they can to dodge U.S. taxes. And they have gotten very good \nat shirking their fair share.\n  Let me tell you how this corporate ``Three Card Monte'' works. First, \na company in the U.S. purchases a company in Switzerland, Ireland or \nanother country with a lower corporate tax rate. The U.S. company then \nfiles papers saying it is relocating overseas.\n  In many cases, almost nothing changes. The CEO and other senior \nexecutives stay in the U.S., no new headquarters are opened overseas, \nand up to 80 percent of the shareholders are the same, but suddenly the \ncompany gets a huge tax break.\n  But this is only the beginning of the story. Next, the new parent \ncompany--headquartered overseas--shifts the debts off its own books and \nonto the books of its U.S. subsidiary. Abracadabra: Another huge tax \nbreak, because the company can write off its debt and interests on that \ndebt. This is called ``earnings stripping.''\n  Now, here is the third card in the Three Card Monte: the hopscotch \nloophole. U.S. corporations currently have nearly $2 trillion in \nforeign earnings stashed overseas. As long as they keep that money \nparked overseas, they can defer paying taxes on it.\n  But when a company ``inverts,'' the inverted company--the corporate \ndeserter--can access the millions--sometimes billions--of dollars they \nI have parked overseas without paying US taxes on the money. So the \n``hopscotch loophole'' gives these corporations another massive tax \nbreak. The inverted company can use the money it had parked overseas to \npay back the loans it used to finance the inversion . . . or to pay \ndividends to U.S. investors--and pay little to no taxes.\n  Let me give you an example. Let's say a U.S. company wants a big tax \nbreak by inverting and purchasing an overseas company.\n  It doesn't have enough cash in the U.S. to buy the overseas company \nand it doesn't want to use the money it has stashed overseas--because \nonce the money comes home, it is subject to U.S. taxes. So what does \nthe corporation do?\n  First, it gets a short-term loan from a bank to fund the inversion. \nOnce that transaction is complete, the company can use the money it has \nstashed overseas to pay off the short-term loan while dodging U.S. \ntaxes on those overseas profits.\n\n[[Page S5406]]\n\n  The result of this corporate Three Card Monte? Corporate deserters \nare able to avoid billions in U.S. taxes--and other folks--families and \ncompanies that are working hard to make it in America--have to pay more \ntaxes. To add insult to injury, some of these corporate deserters have \nmade their millions and billions off of federal contracts paid for by \nU.S. taxpayers--the very taxpayers who will have to pay for their tax \ndodging.\n  I'm not the only person who thinks this is wrong. Mark Cuban is a \nbillionaire investor. Listen to this warning he tweeted to corporate \ndeserters--quote: ``If I own stock in your company and you move \noffshore for tax reasons I'm selling your stock.''\n  Why did he say that? Because when companies move off shore to save on \ntaxes, American workers and companies that stay in America, that \nbelieve in America, have to make up the shortfall.\n  That's not right, it's not fair, and we should take action to stop \nthese corporations from dodging taxes and taking advantage of earning \nstripping and hopscotch loopholes.\n\n\n              Reducing Corporate Tax Rates Not A Solution\n\n  Many of our Republicans colleagues point to our broken tax code and \nsay if we just reduce the corporate tax rate, it will stop companies \nfrom inverting.\n  They are wrong, plain and simple. Absolutely, our tax code is broken \nand Congress should reform it. We should close loopholes that allow \nsome to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. We should fix the tax \nsystem so it works for hard-working Americans and for companies that \nwant to help America succeed.\n  But let's not try to fool people into thinking that if we just lower \nour corporate tax rate the deficit will disappear and all of our \neconomic challenges will be solved. There is no realistic tax reform \nproposal that would reduce U.S. tax rates to compete with Ireland, \nwhich has a tax rate of 12.5 percent, or Switzerland, with its 17 \npercent corporate tax rate.\n  This is a race to the bottom the United States can't win and should \nnot be lured into entering.\n  Instead, we should immediately act to stop companies from inverting \nand then we should get to work on reforming our tax code. Before a \ndoctor can perform heart surgery, she or he first has to stop the \nbleeding and that is what we need to do.\n  There are at least a dozen companies that have announced they are \ninverting or are considering inversion. We should act now--either \nthrough Congressional or executive action--to close the tax loopholes \nthat allow inverters--these corporate deserters--to avoid their fair \nshare of taxes and push their tax obligations off onto the rest of us. \nOnce we stop the bleeding, we can turn our attention to real tax reform \nwhere and a long-term, comprehensive solution.\n  Senator Levin's bill would stop the bleeding by placing a 2-year \nmoratorium on many inversions. Only inversions where no more than 50 \npercent of the shareholders remain the same after the inversion would \nbe allowed to go forward.\n  We should also limit the damage caused by inversions by limiting the \npractice of ``earnings stripping''--that's the tax-lawyer's trick where \nyou load all the debt onto the U.S. subsidiary and then write off the \ndebt and the interest payments as a tax deduction.\n  That is the purpose of a bill I am introducing tomorrow (Wednesday) \nwith Senator Schumer. Our proposal would prevent certain corporations \nfrom taking excessive interest deductions and sticking U.S. taxpayers \nwith the tab.\n  Our bill would reduce the cap on interest deductions from 50 percent \nof adjusted taxable income to 25 percent. It would eliminate the \nability of a company to carry forward any excluded interest.\n  It would also require the IRS to pre-approve related-party \ntransactions for up to 10 years after these companies move their \nheadquarters overseas to ensure greater transparency.\n  This bill is a targeted approach to a serious problem.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  There's more we need to do. I plan to work with my colleagues to \ndevelop a more comprehensive proposal to address both earnings \nstripping by foreign corporations and the hopscotch rule.\n  Foreign corporations should not be allowed to load up the U.S. \nsubsidiaries with debt and expect U.S. taxpayers to pay their debts. \nInverted corporations should not be rewarded with additional tax breaks \nby dodging taxes on their profits earned overseas.\n  These two proposals, along with Senator Levin's Stop Corporate \nInversion Act, must be part of any comprehensive tax reform proposal.\n  Before I close, let me mention one other issue.\n  Some of the very companies that move their headquarters overseas in \norder to avoid paying their fair share of U.S. taxes then have the \nnerve to come back to the U.S. with their hand out asking to profit \nfrom U.S. government contracts.\n  Yes, that is right. Over the past 5 years, these corporate deserters \nhave received $1 billion in federal contracts paid for by U.S. \ntaxpayers, while avoiding U.S. taxes. This has to stop.\n  That is why I introduced a bill with Senators Levin and Jack Reed to \nban federal contracts for these corporate deserters. There is a \ncompanion bill in the House that is sponsored by Representatives \nDeLauro, Doggett and Sander Levin.\n  This isn't a new idea. In 2008, Congress prohibited inverted \ncorporations from obtaining any Federal contract under the annual \nappropriations bills, and for the most part this ban has worked.\n  But these companies found a loophole. That is why they pay their tax \nattorneys and advisors the big bucks--to find the little loopholes \nworth billions of dollars. We need to close this loophole so that \ncorporate deserters aren't able to profit from taxpayer-funded \ngovernment contracts.\n  About 50 companies have inverted in the last decade. Another dozen \ncompanies--including three headquartered in my State of Illinois--have \nannounced that they are planning or considering inversion. If these \ncompanies want to renounce their corporate citizenship, that is their \nchoice. I think It is a bad choice, but it is their choice.\n  But they should not expect American workers and other American \ncompanies to pick up the tab for them while they take advantage of all \nthat America offers. That is not a free market. That is freeloading.\n  This isn't a partisan issue. Every inversion increases the burden on \nyou and me to make up for the lost tax revenue.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle and the President to address this important issue.\n  It was about 2 weeks ago that I was in central Illinois and I was \nheading to a forum for Senate candidates. It was put on by the farmers \nin downstate Illinois. I have a lot of friends there. We went off to a \nfarm, and before we arrived I had an extra 45 minutes. I hadn't had \nlunch. So we were driving around Bloomington-Normal, IL, in McLean \nCounty.\n  I said: Let's stop and get a sandwich somewhere.\n  My driver said: Well, there is a Burger King.\n  I said: No, thanks. There is a Steak 'n Shake--which happens to be a \nfranchise we are very proud of in the Midwest and in Illinois.\n  I consciously decided not to stop at Burger King. Why? Because in the \npast several weeks Burger King has consciously decided they are leaving \nthe United States. This iconic hamburger chain--second largest in the \nworld--has bought a doughnut chain in Canada, and now they want to move \ntheir headquarters to Canada from Miami, FL. Why would they move their \ncorporate headquarters out of the United States of America, where they \nhave most of their restaurants? To cut their taxes. It is called \ninversion.\n  If you can pick up and on paper move your corporation to Switzerland, \nIreland, the island of Jersey, Canada--you name it--there are ways that \naccountants and lawyers have figured out how to reduce your tax burden. \nBut, of course, as companies decide to do that, they are also making \nconscious decisions to stop paying U.S. taxes or avoid paying U.S. \ntaxes--at least some part of them.\n  We have seen a lot of companies announce this. AbbVie, which is a \npharmaceutical company in the northern\n\n[[Page S5407]]\n\nsuburbs of Chicago, used to be Abbott Laboratories. AbbVie has decided \nthey want to move overseas.\n  I took a look at it and thought for a moment: Interesting. A \npharmaceutical company wants to move overseas.\n  How important was the United States to the success of a \npharmaceutical company such as AbbVie, to the fact they developed drugs \nand products that were profitable? How important was this country to \nthat company? I would say critically important. Companies don't usually \ncome up with all the ideas for new drugs. They rely on the National \nInstitutes of Health, the premier biomedical research agency in the \nworld. The annual budget is in the range of $31 billion, and they do \nresearch which they then turn over free of charge to pharmaceutical \ncompanies to develop drugs to make money. The National Institutes of \nHealth is supported by American taxpayers.\n  If a pharmaceutical company develops a new drug they think has the \npotential to be a blockbuster and sell a lot, there is another step. \nThey have to go to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and the FDA \ntests it.\n  If at the end of testing they come up with the conclusion that it is \nnot only safe but effective for what it is being used for, they give it \na seal of approval. It is the gold standard of safety of \npharmaceuticals. The Food and Drug Administration is supported by the \nU.S. Government and American taxpayers. Then it is not over. There is \nat least one last stop. You go to the patent office to make sure you \nprotect your intellectual property, this pharmaceutical formula. The \nU.S. patent office is supported by the government and U.S. taxpayers.\n\n  So here is a pharmaceutical company using research, using testing, \nand using protections of patents from our government that says: \nIncidentally, we are leaving. We don't want to pay taxes to this \ngovernment. We want to reduce our tax burden to this government.\n  There is something wrong with this picture. Mr. President, 49 or 50 \ncorporations have done it, and more are threatening. Take Burger King. \nThe sale of hamburgers does not involve a great deal of research, but \nthe product that you are cooking at your store has been inspected for \nsafety by the U.S. Federal Government. And the place where your store \nis located probably is on a highway or street supported by our \ngovernment.\n  But then there is one other element. The people who work in fast food \nin America are not usually paid a lot of money. Their income is \nsupplemented by government programs such as food stamps. It turns out \nto the tune of about $7 billion a year. That is what taxpayers in \nAmerica pay to subsidize the income of workers in fast food \nrestaurants. So here is Burger King that is using the largess, \nprotection, rule of law in the United States to do their business, \ncounting on our government to step in and supplement the income of the \nperson frying the hamburgers and serving it, and saying: Incidentally, \nwe are leaving; we don't have any obligation to this country to pay \ntaxes; we are going to Canada--on paper.\n  There is something wrong with this picture. To me, if you are going \nto desert this country as a corporation, consumers first ought to be \naware of it. That is why I drove past Burger King. I do not care to do \nbusiness with a company that does not think it owes its fair share of \ntaxes. Because if they do not pay their fair share of taxes, other good \nAmerican companies will be forced to pay more and other individuals \nwill too.\n  So it is right for us to speak up now about this process of inversion \nand bringing it to an end. It is not just a matter of escaping taxes. \nThere are accounting techniques. There are countless techniques which \nthese inverted corporations can use to even reduce their corporate \ntaxation more.\n  Some people say the U.S. corporate income tax is too high. The \nnominal rate is 35 percent. The effective rate is closer to 25 percent, \nand the major corporations pay in the range of 10 to 15 percent. When \nyou look at the countries they are going to--Ireland, I believe their \ncorporate income tax rate is 12.5 percent; the Cayman Islands, zero. So \nwe cannot play it to the lowest denominator, play to the bottom line, \nthe bottom corporate income tax. It is a lose-lose situation.\n  What we have to do is to make sure that the inversion comes with a \nprice. I am joined with Senator Schumer. We will put in a bill later \nthis week to talk about this whole question of inversion as it relates \nto the Tax Code. It is a technical bill Senator Schumer has largely \nwritten as a member of the Senate Finance Committee and asked me to \njoin him on because of my interest on the subject. It limits the \npractice of ``earnings stripping''--a tax lawyer's trick where you load \nall the debt on to the U.S. subsidiary and then write off the debt and \nthe interest payments as a tax deduction. The bill which I will \nintroduce with Senator Schumer is designed to prevent corporations from \ntaking excessive interest deductions and sticking U.S. taxpayers with \nthe tab. There are other parts of that bill.\n  I believe the Tax Code should be written in a positive fashion. It is \nnot positive in our Tax Code to set the stage for corporations to move \ntheir jobs and headquarters overseas. In fact, we allow under our Tax \nCode for these corporations to deduct their moving expenses if they are \ngoing overseas. What are we thinking? Why would we create an incentive, \na deduction, for taking jobs out of America? I think there is a better \napproach. When the time comes for tax reform--and I hope it is soon--I \nam going to propose that we have something called the patriot employer \ntax credit. Here is what it says. It is pretty simple. If your \nheadquarters for your corporation are in the United States; if you have \nkept your jobs here in the United States; if at least 90 percent of \nyour employees are paid at least $15 an hour; if you have good health \ninsurance, according to the standards of the Affordable Care Act; if \nyou will contribute at least 5 percent of your employees' earnings \ntoward their retirement; and if you will give a veterans preference, we \nwill give you a tax credit.\n  We want to reward--we should reward--and incentivize companies that \nbuild their future in America, companies that believe in America, \ncompanies that pay a decent wage in benefits to the people who work for \nthem.\n  That is what should be in the Tax Code. Let's start incentivizing job \nbuilding and job expansion here in the United States. Let's stop these \ndeductions for moving jobs overseas. And let's put an end to this \ncorporate inversion.\n  These folks have to realize we are not going to stand still for them \ngaming the Tax Code to avoid their responsibility to the country which, \nby and large, created the success of most of their corporations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President:\n\n       Attention all citizens. To assure the fairness of elections \n     by preventing disproportionate expression of the views of any \n     single powerful group, your Government has decided that the \n     following associations of persons shall be prohibited from \n     speaking or writing in support of any candidate. . . .\n\n  This is a statement that I have taken directly from a dissenting \nopinion issued by Associate Justice Antonin Scalia in a case called \nAustin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce--a 1989 ruling of the Supreme \nCourt of the United States.\n  The concern expressed in that dissenting opinion, the opening line of \nwhich I have just read, comes to mind when we review the legislation in \nfront of this body right now, S.J. Res. 19--an attempt, a wholesale \neffort to repeal the First Amendment of the United States, to undo its \nmost fundamental protections, protections that protect the right of \nevery American to speak out on issues of public concern, to try to \ninfluence the outcome of elections, to try to dictate the course of our \nentire country.\n  Now, fortunately, this precedent that Justice Scalia was expressing \nconcerns with was overruled. It was overruled in a case called Citizens \nUnited, which has itself become the target of S.J. Res. 19. In other \nwords, because the Constitution has now been properly interpreted to \nprotect the right of the American people to join together and form \nvoluntarily associations and to use those associations to try to \ninfluence the outcome of elections, my colleagues across the aisle have \ndecided--rather than to follow the Constitution\n\n[[Page S5408]]\n\nto change it, rather than to follow its dictates to get rid of those \nportions that would interfere with the power of government--this is \nsomething we cannot tolerate, this is something we cannot ignore, this \nis something that we must do something about, and we have to do it \ntoday.\n  As Justice Scalia explained in his dissent in the Austin case, this \nprinciple, this type of approach whereby we allow the government to \nlimit the expressive capabilities of the American people, to limit the \nability of the American people to form voluntarily associations and \nspeak out on matters of public concern, is utterly contrary not only to \nour case law but to the text of the First Amendment, and it is \ninconsistent with the absolutely central proof underlying the First \nAmendment. The idea here is that government cannot be trusted to assure \nthrough censorship--and make no mistake, that is what this is about, \ncensorship--the ``fairness of political debate.''\n  So we are here ostensibly to debate the relative merits of S.J. Res. \n19, which would up end well over two centuries of understanding that \nthere are certain things the government cannot do, that there are \ncertain things that the government can never be trusted to, that the \ngovernment cannot censor our speech, particularly our political speech. \nWe are here to debate that, and yet among those who have introduced \nthis legislation, among those who have sponsored this legislation, we \nhave heard, if I am not mistaken, from only three today. We have heard \nonly three speeches today.\n  This is a profound and disturbing message to the American people. We \nare trying to upend the cornerstone of American republican democracy, \nand yet we have had two speeches in support of it. This is something \nthat ought to alarm us terribly.\n  I was pleased to hear moments ago from my distinguished colleague, \nthe senior Senator from Illinois. I respect the senior Senator from \nIllinois. He and I have worked together on a lot of pieces of \nlegislation. We have worked together most recently on the Smarter \nSentencing Act, which I think is an important bipartisan attempt to \nreform our Federal criminal sentencing code, which is in serious need \nof being reformed.\n  I also respect the senior Senator from Illinois for some statements \nhe made a few years ago when another amendment had been proposed. I at \nleast respect the approach that he took in urging caution before \nundertaking any effort to undo, to weaken, to undermine the Bill of \nRights. Here is a statement that he made on June 26, 2006: ``The Bill \nof Rights has served this Nation since 1791, and with one swift blow of \nthis ax, we are going to chop into the first amendment.'' He was \nconcerned about that.\n\n  He was concerned also when on the same day he made a similar comment, \ninstructive here, I think, when he noted: ``It is a matter which we \nwill likely debate the rest of this week''--the week in which he was \nspeaking in 2006--meaning this is an urgent matter, it is a matter of \ngreat concern to the American people when we are talking about changing \nthe First Amendment or any component of the Bill of Rights. He \ncontinued:\n\n       The reason we are going to spend this much time on it is \n     because this one-page document represents a historic change \n     in America. If this amendment were to be ratified, it would \n     mark the first time in our nation's history that we would \n     amend the Bill of Rights [to the United States Constitution].\n\n  On the same day he also said:\n\n       It takes a great deal of audacity for anyone to step up and \n     suggest to change the Constitution. . . . I think we should \n     show a little humility around here when it comes to changing \n     the Constitution. So many of my colleagues are anxious to \n     take a roller to a Rembrandt.\n\n  I could not agree more, especially when we are talking about not just \nfreedom of speech but core political speech, which is the subject of \nS.J. Res. 19. Make no mistake, the fundamental purpose, the most \nimportant objective underlying the free speech clause and the free \npress clause was to protect the right of the people to engage in \npolitical speech. And make no mistake, the purpose of this is to \nenhance Congress's power to restrict political speech. In fact, its \nentire purpose focuses on efforts to spend money to influence \nelections--the core of political speech.\n  Let's go back for a minute to the dissenting opinion issued by \nJustice Scalia in the Austin case I referenced a few minutes ago. He \nexplained in that dissenting opinion that there are some things that we \nunderstandably do not want government to do. There are a lot of things \nwe do in the Constitution that are all about outlining what the powers \nof government are. We explain what power Congress has, what power the \nPresident has. We explain further that powers not delegated to Congress \nare reserved to the States or the people.\n  Then we also identify in the Bill of Rights that there are certain \nareas that are just out of bounds for government, areas where we do not \nwant government to tread. This is one of those areas. As Justice Scalia \nexplained:\n\n       The premise of our Bill of Rights . . . is that there are \n     some things--even some seemingly desirable things--that \n     government cannot be trusted to do. The very first of these \n     is establishing the restrictions upon speech that will assure \n     ``fair'' political debate. The incumbent politician who says \n     he welcomes full and fair debate is no more to be believed \n     than the entrenched monopolist who says he welcomes full and \n     fair competition.\n\n  This is what we face here. This is the risk we face here. We are \nassured by the proponents of this legislation--that is, both of them, \nboth of those who have shown up so far to speak in support of this--\nthat this will still allow debate to occur. Yet how are we to believe \nthis when what they are proposing is to expand Congress's power to \nlimit that right to participate in an open, public debate, to undertake \nefforts to influence the outcome of elections and thus dictate the \ncourse of an entire Nation.\n  Justice Scalia concluded with the thought that, as he put it:\n\n       The premise of our system is that there is no such thing as \n     too much speech--that the people are not foolish, but \n     intelligent, and will separate the wheat from the chaff.\n\n  He refutes the notion:\n\n       . . . that a healthy democratic system can survive the \n     legislative power to prescribe how much political speech is \n     too much, who may speak, and who may not.\n\n  When we try to weaken this understanding, we are playing with fire. \nWhenever Congress attempts to expand its power--for that matter, \nwhenever any government attempts to expand its power--it does so \ninevitably at the expense of individual liberty.\n  Here, where it tries to expand its influence over political debate, \nwhere it purports to have the ability to expand its power over core \npolitical speech, it does so--inevitably, inescapably, unavoidably--at \nthe expense of the free expressive rights of a free people.\n  This is one of the main core principles upon which our country was \nfounded. We became a nation against a backdrop in which we found \nourselves subject to a large, distant, powerful national government, \none headed by a king and a parliament. Our former London-based national \ngovernment recognized no boundaries around its authority. It had for \ncenturies interfered with the right of the people to express their \ngrievances. It had for centuries supported criminal actions against \npersons who engaged in what they described under their laws as \nseditious libel. In other words, if you criticized the government--if \nyou criticized a government official--you could be, and presumably \nwould be, criminally prosecuted for doing so. The truth was not a \ndefense. In fact, truth made it even worse from the viewpoint of the \ngovernment, because it was more difficult to refute. So people were \nroutinely prosecuted for criticizing the government.\n  We cannot--we must not--take even one step in the direction of \nexpanding government's authority when it comes to speech that is at the \ncore of our political system.\n  Look, our political system isn't perfect. Our political system isn't \nsomething that everybody necessarily is inclined to enjoy. But our \npolitical system does keep us free, and it keeps us free only to the \nextent that individuals are allowed to speak their mind without fear of \nretribution from the government, only to the extent that individuals, \nrich and poor alike, are able to say what they want and join together \nand form voluntary associations for the purpose of influencing the \noutcome of elections so they can have some chance at standing up to a \nbig government that affects so many of their\n\n[[Page S5409]]\n\nrights, that affects so much of how they are going to provide for the \nneeds of their families and their communities.\n  When the people are intimidated by a government that recognizes no \nboundaries around its authority, everyone suffers. This is an issue \nthat is neither Republican nor Democratic, it is neither liberal nor \nconservative. It is simply American.\n  It is time for the American people to stop simply expecting Congress \nto continue to expand its power at the expense of their individual \nliberty. It is time for the American people to stop simply expecting \ntheir rights have to bow to the interests of an all-powerful incumbency \nin Washington, DC. It is time for the American people to expect more. \nIt is time for the American people to expect freedom.\n  We expect freedom, and we will defend freedom when we defeat Senate \nJoint Resolution 19.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/09/senate-section/article/S5409-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5409-S5426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  ISIL\n\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, 1 month ago the President initiated an air \ncampaign against ISIL in Iraq. ISIL is a dangerous terrorist \norganization committing atrocities against thousands of people, \nincluding American hostages, and a strong American response, to include \nmilitary action, is certainly warranted.\n  In the first month of this air campaign, two explanations for the \nmission were given by the President. We began with a mission for \nhumanitarian purpose and also the need to protect American embassy \npersonnel. Since that time, the White House has stated that the air \nstrikes may go on for some open-ended period of time. Despite a pledge \nnot to place American boots on the ground, more American military \npersonnel have been deployed to Iraq as advisers and are on the ground \nthere now.\n  In order to clarify what is at stake and set out a path forward, many \nof my colleagues and I have called for the President to bring before \nCongress and the Nation a clear plan for defeating ISIL. I am gratified \nthat the President will address the Nation on this topic tomorrow \nnight.\n  I am supportive generally of the limited and prudent steps taken thus \nfar, while Congress was in recess, to slow ISIL's momentum. I expect to \nhear a comprehensive strategy tomorrow.\n  I support the strong U.S. diplomatic push that has forced Iraqi \ngovernment formation, and I am pleased with Iraqi political \ndevelopments to form a unity government. Now Iraqi leaders must govern \ninclusively.\n  I am especially heartened by reports that the administration has \nworked to find a number of nations willing to partner with America to \ndeal with the ISIL threat, including nations in the region. The United \nStates cannot be a police force for a region unwilling to police \nitself. The United States should not bear the sole burden of defeating \na terrorist organization that poses a more imminent threat to many \nother nations than the threat it does to America.\n  I look forward to the President's address, and I am confident that a \nwell-thought-out plan against ISIL will compel the support of the \nNation and of Congress.\n  We are a nation of laws but also of values. I rise today particularly \nto urge the President to not just inform us of what he plans to do but \nto follow the Constitution and to seek congressional approval to defeat \nISIL. I do so for two reasons.\n  First, I don't believe the President has the authority to go on the \noffense and wage an open-ended war on ISIL without congressional \napproval; and, second, in making the momentous decision to authorize \nmilitary action, we owe it to our troops who risk their lives to do our \ncollective jobs and reach a consensus supporting the military mission \nthey are ordered to complete.\n  Let me first deal with the legal issue. The Constitution is clear. It \nis the job of Congress, not the President, to declare war. Some parts \nof the Constitution frankly are vague and open to interpretation: What \nis due process? What is cruel and unusual punishment? Some parts of the \nConstitution are clear and specific: You have to be 35 years old to be \nPresident of the United States. The power to declare war is a clear and \nspecific power. It is an enumerated power of Congress in article I.\n  The clear wording of the Constitution is additionally illuminated by \nwritings of the principal drafter, the Virginian James Madison. In a \nletter to Thomas Jefferson after the Constitution was ratified, Madison \nexplained the war powers clause in article I:\n\n       Our Constitution supposes what the history of all \n     governments demonstrates--that the Executive is the branch of \n     power most interested in war and most prone to it. It has \n     accordingly with studied care vested the question of war in \n     the Legislature.\n\n  So a President must seek congressional approval for significant \nmilitary action. As Commander in Chief, a President can always take \nsteps to defend America from imminent threats. The Framers understood \nthis. But even in those instances, they intended that the President \nreturn to Congress to seek ratification of such actions.\n  If we take the Constitution seriously, as we pledge to do when we \ntake our oaths of office, we must follow the command that the President \nmust come to Congress to initiate major military action.\n\n  During a congressional recess, President Obama began a new military \naction against ISIL. He has indicated that the military action may \ncontinue for an extended period of time. He has stated that the action \nis evolving from a narrow effort to protect Americans from imminent \nthreat to a campaign to go on offense in order to degrade the ability \nof ISIL to cause harm. This is precisely the kind of situation that \ncalls for congressional action and approval.\n  Some have asserted that the administration need not seek \ncongressional approval for an extended campaign of air strikes. Humbly \nand respectfully, I deeply disagree with that assertion. The \nPresident's article II power allows him to defend America from imminent \nthreat, but it does not allow him the ability to wage an offensive war \nwithout Congress. The 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force, \ncrafted by President Bush and Congress in the days after the 9/11 \nattacks, limits the President's power to actions against the \nperpetrators of those attacks. ISIL was not a 9/11 perpetrator. It \ndidn't form until 2003.\n  President Bush sought a broader AUMF at that time to allow action \nagainst terrorist groups posing a threat to the United States. Had \nCongress granted such a power, the war against ISIL would have been \ncovered by that AUMF. But Congress explicitly rejected giving the \nPresident power to wage preemptive war against unnamed terrorist \norganizations without additional congressional approval. Any attempt to \njustify action against ISIL by reference to the 2001 AUMF would fly \ndirectly in the face of the clear congressional action rejecting the \npreemptive war doctrine.\n  Congress passed a second AUMF in 2002 to allow military action to \ntopple the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein. That task was completed long \nago. American troops left Iraq in 2011, and the administration has \ntestified recently before the Senate that the Iraq AUMF is now obsolete \nand should be repealed. It provides no support for military action \nagainst ISIL. There is no treaty of collective defense ratified by \nCongress that would justify the President commencing military action \nagainst ISIL. The Iraqi Government has asked for our help, which solves \ninternational law sovereignty questions, but that request does not \ncreate its own domestic legal justification.\n  Finally, the 1973 War Powers Resolution creates a set of timing rules \nfor Presidential action and congressional response in matters of war. \nThe resolution has been widely viewed as unconstitutional for a variety \nof reasons. But even accepting its validity--and the President, like \nmost, almost certainly does not accept its 60-day limitation on his \narticle II powers--it does not change the basic constitutional \nframework vesting the declaration of war in the legislative branch.\n  I believe a reluctance to engage Congress on this mission against \nISIL is less due to any legal analysis supporting broad executive power \nthan to a general attitude, held by all Presidents, that coming to \nCongress on a\n\n[[Page S5410]]\n\nquestion such as this is too cumbersome and unpredictable. That \nattitude is shared on the Hill by some who view questions of military \naction, especially in a difficult circumstance such as this, as \npolitically explosive and best avoided, if at all possible\n  I urge the President and my colleagues to resist the understandable \ntemptation to cut corners on this process. There is no more important \nbusiness done in the Halls of Congress than weighing whether to take \nmilitary action and send servicemembers into harm's way. If we have \nlearned nothing else in the last 13 years, we should have certainly \nlearned that. Coming to Congress is challenging, but the Framers \ndesigned it to be so, and we all pledged to serve in a government known \nfor particular checks and balances between the branches of government.\n\n  Remember in the days after 9/11, whose anniversary we commemorate \nthis week, the President brought to Congress a request for military \naction. The ruins of the Pentagon and the World Trade Center were still \nsmoking and the search for the lost was still ongoing. Certainly the \nAmerican public would have supported the President's strong and \nimmediate Executive action in that circumstance, but President Bush \nknew that the Nation would be stronger if he came to Congress to seek \nauthority. Similarly President Bush came to Congress prior to \ninitiating military action in Iraq. So many painful lessons were \nlearned in the aftermath of that authorization, but it is important to \nremember that it was not a unilateral Executive decision but Congress \nwas included and voted to support the mission.\n  I believe it would be a grievous mistake after 13 years of war to \nevolve toward a new strategy of taking prolonged military action \nwithout bothering to seek congressional approval, and I particularly \nworry about the precedent it would create for future Presidents to \nassert that they have the unilateral right to engage in long-term \nmilitary action without the full participation of the people's \nlegislative branch. As President Obama said last year when announcing \nthat he would come to Congress to seek military authorization to combat \nthe use of chemical weapons in Syria:\n\n       This is not about who occupies the office at any given \n     time, it is about who we are as a country. I believe the \n     people's representatives must be invested in what America \n     does abroad . . .\n\n  Mr. President, I focus my remarks on the legal reasons for the \nPresident to engage Congress on any plan to defeat ISIL.\n  Let me conclude by offering an additional reason--even a more \nimportant reason--about why the President and Congress should work \ntogether to craft a suitable mission for this important effort. When we \nengage in military action, even only an air campaign, we ask our troops \nto risk their lives and their health--physical and mental. Of course we \npray for their complete safety and success, but let's be realistic \nenough to acknowledge that some may die or be injured or be captured or \nsee these things happen to their comrades in arms. Even those who come \nhome physically safe may see or do things in war that will affect them \nfor the rest of their lives. The long lines of people waiting for VA \nappointments today or hoping to have their VA disability benefit claims \nadjudicated are proof of this.\n  In short, during a time of war we ask our troops to give their best, \neven to the point of sacrificing their own lives. When compared against \nthat, how much of a sacrifice is it for a President to engage in a \npossibly contentious debate with Congress about whether military action \nis a good idea? How much of a sacrifice is it for a Member of Congress \nto debate and vote about whether military action is a good idea? While \nCongressional Members face the political costs of debate on military \naction, our servicemembers bear the human cost of those decisions. If \nwe choose to avoid debate, avoid accountability, avoid a hard decision, \nhow can we demand that our military willingly sacrifice their very \nlives?\n  So I await the President's address on the real and significant threat \nposed by ISIL with a firm willingness to offer support to a well-\ncrafted military mission. I believe the American public and this \nCongress will support such a mission. It is my deepest hope that we \nhave the opportunity to debate and vote on the mission in the halls of \nCongress as our Framers intended and as our troops deserve.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am glad I had the opportunity to be \non the floor today to hear the remarks of the Senator from Virginia. \nAll of us look forward to the President's remarks tomorrow night. I am \ngoing to reserve my comments because of the seriousness of the subject \nand out of respect for the Office of the President until after the \nPresident addresses the Nation. But I would say this. Having heard the \nSenator from Virginia, I hope the President and his advisers listened \ncarefully to what the Senator from Virginia said. None of us want to \nsee another military adventure in the Middle East. As in Virginia and \nWest Virginia and Tennessee, we have had thousands--tens of thousands \nof Tennesseans who have been in Iraq and Afghanistan three, four, five, \nor six times on tours of duty. But this ISIS threat is a different kind \nof threat to civilization, and very well could be a threat to the \nUnited States. It requires a response. It requires the President's \nleadership. He is the Commander in Chief, and it is his job to lay out \nfor us a firm and clear strategy for, in the words of his \nadministration, how we will defeat and destroy this new movement.\n  In thinking about whether to come to the Congress, I think it is \nuseful for the President to think back to the first President Bush and \nthe decision he had to make. I was in his cabinet. I came just about \nthat time and the idea of a ground war in the Middle East was a \nshocking thought. We had not had something like that in this country \nfor a while, and the President was reluctant at first to come to the \nCongress to seek approval for that, but he did it. And he said after he \nhad done it that in retrospect he was glad he did. What did he gain?\n  Even though it was a contentious debate and the margin of the vote \nwasn't large, it gave a clear signal to the world that we were united \nas a country against the threat at that time. It gave a clear signal to \nthe country that regardless of party we were united with the President \nof the United States on what he saw as an urgent mission for our \ncountry. As a result of that, he had an enormously successful \noperation. It was well planned, funded by other countries, primarily, \nand had a limited objective. They got to the gates of Baghdad, the \nobjective was realized, and we came home. I think the fact that the \nPresident sought the advice of Congress was a part of that.\n  In this case I think this President would find in this body careful \nlisteners to what he has to say, a willingness on both sides of the \naisle to consider his strategy, and a willingness to support a \ncarefully crafted plan to meet his objectives. This is not Libya, this \nis not Grenada, and this is not Panama. This is at least 2 or 3 years. \nAny time our country is expected to have a military action especially \nin the Middle East again, it needs to have the full support of the \nAmerican people, and that starts here.\n  So I will wait until Wednesday night to hear what the President has \nto say, but the Senator from Virginia has given some very careful and \nreasonable advice, and I hope the President and his advisers will \nconsider that very carefully.\n  I am here today to speak on another subject. I am here today because \nSenate Democrats want to amend the Bill of Rights--at least 48 of them \ndo. Forty-eight of them want to say: Let's amend the United States \nConstitution and the free exercise clause of the First Amendment. Let's \namend the guarantee of free speech. That is an extraordinary \ndevelopment.\n  If passed, Senate Joint Resolution 19, which is the subject on the \nfloor today, would give Congress and State governments the power to \ndecide which Americans can speak in elections, what they can say, when \nthey can say it, and how they say it. This measure would gut the free \nspeech provisions of the First Amendment. It is a shocking proposal--a \nshocking proposal made even more so by the fact that it is supported by \n48 Democratic Senators and President Obama. I wonder if any of them \nhave taken the time to see the writing\n\n[[Page S5411]]\n\non the wall of the Newseum down the street. In big bold letters carved \ninto the concrete it says: ``Congress shall make no law . . . abridging \nthe freedom of speech . . . '' That is in the First Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution.\n  Our Founders passed the Constitution, and they said, well, we forgot \nto do the Bill of Rights. So they came back with the Bill of Rights, \nand this is in the First Amendment. Free speech is one of the defining \ncharacteristics of liberal democracies worldwide. No country has \nembraced free speech and protected it as much as has the United States \nof America. Other countries look to us as a model for this remarkable \nfreedom. So why would anyone attempt to amend the Constitution, amend \nthe Bill of Rights, and change the free speech clause in the First \nAmendment?\n  When we look at the Democratic leadership in the Senate we see a \npattern of using a gag rule to silence Senators who were sent here on \nbehalf of the people who elected them to represent their views. The \nmajority leader has prevented Tennesseans, for example, from having \ntheir say through their Senators, their elected officials, for years \nnow, by using the gag rule in this body to keep amendments from being \nconsidered and voted on. Senators have listened to their constituents \nand proposed amendments on ObamaCare, taxes, the National Labor \nRelations Board, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, etc., and they are told by the \nDemocratic leadership that they won't get votes. I have said on this \nfloor many times, it is like being invited to join the Grand Ole Opry \nand not being allowed to sing.\n  But the consequences are much more serious than that. It is not just \nmy amendment or my colleague Senator Corker's amendment, and it is not \njust Tennesseans' amendments. It is the voters of every State who sent \nus here to have a say on their behalf. Senator Barrasso from Wyoming \nhas counted that since July of 2013, last year, only 14 Republican \namendments and 9 Democratic amendments have received votes. That is an \nastounding number. There are 100 Senators here representing more than \n300 million Americans. This is said to be the world's greatest \ndeliberative body. The new book ``The American Senate'' describes this \nbody, saying: ``This is the one authentic touch of genius in the \nAmerican political system.'' What makes it ``the one authentic touch of \ngenius in the American political system'' then? It is that you take a \ndifficult message or a difficult bill, you put it on the floor, and you \ntalk about it and you talk about it, and you debate it, and you amend \nit, until finally you say that is enough and 60 of us say it is time to \ncut off debate. Let's vote and have a result.\n\n  Yet in a year's time there have only been 23 amendments to \nlegislation that have received votes. Some Members of this body who are \nrunning for re-election and have never had a vote on any amendment they \noffered on the Senate floor. Someone might well ask, well, what have \nyou been doing?\n  Then this summer the Democrats extended the gag rule from the Senate \nfloor to the Senate committee rooms. The bills of some members of the \nAppropriations Committee, on which I serve, were indefinitely postponed \nbecause the Senate leadership wanted to avoid difficult votes on those \namendments--no vote on clean water, no vote on energy, no vote because \nit was a difficult vote.\n  Now in this provision Democrats and the President are trying to \nextend the gag rule to the free speech clause of the First Amendment. \nWhat this proposal would do is give Congress the power to silence the \ngroups or organizations that threaten their reelection. For example, \nthe government could tell a gun owner in Johnson City, TN, that he or \nshe cannot spend money to advocate in defense of Second Amendment \nrights if that speech falls too close to an election and threatens to \ninfluence the campaign of incumbents. Or similarly, Congress might tell \nTennessee Right to Life: You cannot advertise to protect the rights of \nthe unborn. Congress could decide that such speech should be restricted \nor prohibited because incumbents fear it is really an endorsement of a \ncandidate for political office.\n  Also incumbents could seek to stop new political movements like the \ntea party by placing unachievable conditions on their ability to raise \nand spend funds on behalf of candidates they support. They can do this \nunder the guise of protecting donors by saying you can't receive \ndonations unless you've been successful in a previous election or you \nhave a real chance of being successful in the future. The decision of \nwhether a new political movement is politically viable would of course \nbe made by their political competitors. Or Congress might criminalize \nexpenditures by organizations like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who \nmight oppose a plan by Senate Democrats to increase the minimum wage on \nthe grounds that the funds spent by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are \nthe equivalent of attack ads against Democratic candidates in tight \nreelection races.\n  Who might be exempt from this gag rule on free speech? Well, freedom \nof the press--that is mentioned in the amendment. And who would freedom \nof the press be? Who might this be? Well, it would be billionaires who \ncould buy television stations, billionaires who could buy a newspaper \nand buy any form of this new media that we see around us. So ordinary \nAmericans could have their ability to advocate their views restricted, \nbut billionaires could buy TV stations or buy a newspaper or buy any \nform of media and say whatever they think. Those are the people exempt \nfrom the gag rule proposed by the Democrats.\n  What about millionaire candidates? It has been considered by the \nSupreme Court and by all who looked at it that while Congress might put \nrules on raising from others that it could never place on spending your \nown money. So we have candidates running for President, running for the \nSenate, who spend their own money. So we might not be limiting the \nmillionaire candidates to the Senate and their right to free speech. We \nmight not be limiting the billionaire owners of television stations and \nnewspapers and their right to free speech, but ordinary Americans would \nhave a gag rule. So the gag rule that began on the Senate floor and \nwent to the Senate hearing rooms would now be applied by Congress to \nthe ordinary Americans across this country. The Founders would never \nhave imagined that. They passed the First Amendment to protect against \nthis very concern--that government censors would tell ordinary \nAmericans what they can and cannot say.\n  President Harry Truman, who liked to exercise a lot of free speech \nhimself, warned about this in a message to Congress on August 8, 1950. \nHe said:\n\n       Once a government is committed to the principle of \n     silencing the voice of opposition, it has only one way to go, \n     and that is down the path of increasingly repressive measures \n     until it becomes a source of terror to all of its citizens \n     and creates a country where everyone lives in fear.\n\n  That is President Harry Truman.\n  That is not a description of this country. That is not a description \nof America. That is a description of our enemies.\n  Look through our history. How would this law apply in our history? \nWhat about Harriet Beecher Stowe before the Civil War, writing ``Uncle \nTom's Cabin?'' Maybe she would want to buy an ad in the local newspaper \nsaying: Mr. Lincoln is a nice man. Read my book. The State might not \nlike that. They might like holding slaves. They might not like what she \nsays and what she wants to advertise.\n\n  What about Thomas Payne at the beginning of our country's history \nwriting ``Common Sense''? Would a law such as this apply to his tract--\nthe 1 he published or if he published 10 or if he published 20?\n  Taken to its logical conclusion, this proposal could be used by a \nCongress or a State to ban books, to ban writings. It is shocking that \nwe are standing here today and debating such a proposal. It is not \nsurprising that so few from the other side of the aisle are streaming \nthrough the door and standing on the floor--as the Senator from Utah \nmentioned--to defend this proposal.\n  Every American ought to be concerned about this proposal to amend the \nBill of Rights and the free speech clause in the First Amendment. They \nshould be deeply concerned that the Senate majority leader and his gag \nrule have effectively silenced their elected representatives here in \nthe Senate, and now he wants to silence them.\n\n[[Page S5412]]\n\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today, as I have for many years, to \nurge my colleagues to fix our Nation's broken campaign finance system. \nI do so after much deliberation and consideration of a series of \nSupreme Court decisions and the explosion of undisclosed and \npotentially unlimited campaign spending that has Americans of all \npolitical backgrounds concerned. Indeed, I remember when this was an \nissue that brought Republicans and Democrats together, and I was proud \nto support Senator McCain's efforts at campaign finance reform.\n  Unfortunately, the recent Supreme Court decisions, such as Citizens \nUnited and McCutcheon, have given more than the mere appearance that \nmoney--and corporate money at that--has a louder voice than everyday \nAmericans. Indeed, Justice Breyer wrote in his McCutcheon dissent that \n``taken together with Citizens United . . . [McCutcheon] eviscerates \nour Nation's campaign finance laws, leaving a remnant incapable of \ndealing with the grave problems of democratic legitimacy that those \nlaws were intended to resolve.'' In my view, these misguided decisions \nby a slim majority of the Court have allowed spending on political \ncampaigns to get out of control.\n  There is a pervasive and corrosive view of politics felt by too many \nin this country that their ability to express their concerns and wishes \nto their elected officials is being crowded out by narrow interests and \ncampaign funds. Rhode Islanders don't want their voices drowned out by \nunlimited money with little or no transparency or no disclosure on \nwhere that money comes from.\n  In order to have a broad-based democratic system, we need reasonable \ncampaign finance laws which ensure that those with large financial \nresources cannot drown out the voice of everyday Americans. That is \nwhat this constitutional amendment we are seeking to debate is all \nabout.\n  The system is broken, and as much as individual candidates can pledge \nto provide more disclosure or take other steps to increase \ntransparency, that is not the solution to fixing the problem. We need \nto give Congress and the States the ability to set reasonable rules for \nall candidates.\n  The constitutional amendment we are considering today does three \nstraightforward things:\n  First, in order to advance democratic self-governance and political \nequality, it gives Congress and the States the power to regulate and \nset reasonable limits on the raising and spending of money by \ncandidates and others to influence elections.\n  Second, it grants Congress and States the power to enforce the \namendment and to distinguish between people and corporations or other \nartificial entities.\n  Third, it ensures that nothing in the amendment could be used to \nabridge the freedom of the press.\n  This amendment doesn't create any new and specific campaign finance \nrules; rather, it gives Congress and the States the power to pass \nlegislation and to distinguish between real people and legally created \nartificial entities, such as corporations. Whatever legislation that \nwould be enacted pursuant to this constitutional amendment would be the \nresult of a serious and lengthy debate in Congress and in the States. I \nwelcome that debate, and I believe most Americans want that debate as \nwell. It would begin a process that is so necessary to rebuild a sense \nof trust in our government and our electoral system.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this constitutional amendment to fix \nour broken campaign finance system by giving Congress and the States \nthe power to reasonably regulate political spending, thereby reducing \nthe influence of wealthy special interests. It is these same wealthy \nspecial interests that obfuscate the facts of a debate and block \nefforts that could give our country and our economy a shot in the arm.\n  Indeed, I hope we can also find bipartisan support to give more \nAmericans the ability to have a fair shot at success. For example, we \nneed to make college more affordable and ease the burden of student \ndebt on millions of Americans, invest in our infrastructure, raise the \nminimum wage, expand job training, close the pay gap for women, boost \njobs through manufacturing--and that is just for starters.\n  We need to pass these kinds of bills and send them to the House and \nurge them to act. The Senate was able to come together and pass a bill \nto provide relief to the long-term unemployed earlier this year, but \nwith 9.6 million Americans still out of a job and looking for work--3 \nmillion of whom have been doing so for more than 6 months--House \nRepublicans have refused to follow suit. It is imperative that we keep \nworking to strengthen our economy, create jobs, and provide a fair shot \nfor everyone.\n  I believe fixing the campaign finance system through this \nconstitutional amendment will provide a foundation so we can have \nreasonable debate that is responsive to the interests of the American \npeople and not responsive to the interests of a narrow class of \nAmericans.\n  I urge my colleagues to take up this bill, pass it, and get on with \nthe business of giving everyone a fair chance at success.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, at a time of extraordinary challenges across \nthe globe and here at home, we are not gathered in the Senate to \ndiscuss how to confront the threat of ISIS. We are not gathered in the \nSenate to discuss how to prevent Putin's Russia from invading its \nneighbors. We are not gathered in the Senate today to discuss how to \nsolve the humanitarian crisis at the border with some 90,000 \nunaccompanied children coming into the country this year. We are not \ngathered in the Senate today to discuss how to bring back jobs and \neconomic growth, or how to correct the fact that the Obama economy has \nproduced the lowest labor force participation since 1978--92 million \nAmericans not working today. And we are not gathered in the Senate to \ndiscuss how to stop the disaster that has been ObamaCare, which has \ncaused millions of Americans to lose their jobs, to be forced into \npart-time work, to lose their health insurance, to lose their doctors, \nand to see their premiums skyrocket. No.\n  Instead, we are gathered today in the Senate for a very different \ntopic. The majority leader and the Democratic majority in this Senate \nhave determined that the most important priority this Senate has, which \nwe are spending the entire week addressing, is the proposal of 49 \nDemocrats to repeal the free speech provisions of the First Amendment. \nThat is not hyperbole. Typically, when Americans hear that Members of \nthe Senate are proposing repealing the free speech protections of the \nFirst Amendment, the usual reaction is a gasp of disbelief. Could we \nreally have entered a world so extreme that our common ground no longer \neven includes the First Amendment of the Constitution?\n  The First Amendment protects our most foundational rights. Yet, under \nthe amendment we are debating today that 49 Democrats have signed their \nname to, the First Amendment would, in effect, have crossed out freedom \nof speech. Why? Because 49 Democrats have cosponsored a constitutional \namendment that is currently on the floor of the Senate, being voted on \nthis week, that would give Congress blanket authority to regulate \npolitical speech.\n  From the dawn of our Republic we have respected the rights of \ncitizens to express their views. It is the right upon which every other \ncivil liberty is predicated. But in the Democratic Senate of 2014, \ncitizens' free speech rights are tools for partisan warfare.\n  This proposal before the Senate is, bar none, the most radical \nproposal that has been considered by the Senate in the time I have \nserved. If this proposal were to pass, its effects would be \nbreathtaking. It would be the most massive intrusion on civil liberties \nand expansion of Federal Government power in modern times.\n  Let's talk about how and why that is the case. The text of the \namendment that is currently in the Bill of Rights\n\n[[Page S5413]]\n\nsays, Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of \nreligion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the \nfreedom of speech. So right now we operate under a First Amendment that \nsays Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech--not \nsome laws; not laws that some politicians think would help them \npolitically; but no law abridging the freedom of speech is what our \nFirst Amendment says.\n  What would the new First Amendment say? Well, according to our \nDemocratic friends, the new First Amendment would have two sections. \nThe first section says, Congress and States may regulate and set \nreasonable limits on the raising and spending of money by candidates \nand others to influence elections. Now, ``reasonable.'' Who could \noppose reasonable limits? Isn't that the essence of reasonableness? \nPerhaps I have forgotten my spectacles, but I don't see in the current \nFirst Amendment, Congress can make reasonable restrictions on the \nfreedom of speech. It doesn't say that. It says Congress shall make no \nlaw abridging the freedom of speech.\n\n  What is the difference? The First Amendment is not about reasonable \nspeech. The First Amendment was enacted to protect unreasonable speech. \nI, for one, certainly don't want our speech limited to speech that \nelected politicians in Washington think is reasonable.\n  There was a time this body thought the Alien and Sedition Acts \nprohibiting criticizing the government were reasonable. There is a \nreason the Constitution doesn't say let's trust politicians to \ndetermine what speech is reasonable and what isn't.\n  I would note the Supreme Court has long made clear the First \nAmendment is all about unreasonable speech. For example, when the Nazis \nwanted to march on Skokie, IL--Nazi speeches, the paradigm example of \nunreasonable speech; it is hateful, bigoted, ignorant speech--the \nSupreme Court said the Nazis have a constitutional right to march down \nthe street in Skokie, IL, with their hateful, bigoted, ignorant speech. \nNow every one of us then has a moral obligation to condemn it as \nhateful and bigoted and ignorant. But the First Amendment is all about \nsaying government doesn't get to decide what you say is reasonable and \nwhat you say is not.\n  The First Amendment is all about saying we will not censor American \ncitizens. What is this amendment about? Saying the Federal Government \nnow has the power to censor each and every American who dares speak \nabout politics. So if a person has a political view at home, they \nbetter hope politicians in Washington think that view is reasonable. I \nwill tell my colleagues that very little of what we do in this town is \nreasonable and the idea that elected politicians would seek to arrogate \npower to themselves to censor the citizens is anathema to who we are as \na country.\n  This bill, if adopted, raises three simple questions--questions I \nraised at three hearings in the Judiciary Committee and in the \nConstitution subcommittee, and I am the ranking member on the \nConstitution subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee. We have \nhad extensive debates on this amendment. I wish to pose three simple \nquestions that I would ask every Democrat who has put his name to \nthis--and I notice, sadly, my friend, the Presiding Officer, is one of \nthem, but he didn't serve on the committee. So I would ask him to \nconsider these questions, and I would hope every Democrat who has put \nhis name to this, upon thinking about it, will have second thoughts and \npull his name off.\n  So here are three questions every one of us should ask. No. 1, should \nCongress have the constitutional authority to ban movies?\n  No. 2, should Congress have the constitutional authority to ban \nbooks?\n  And No. 3, should Congress have the constitutional authority to ban \nthe NAACP from speaking about politics?\n  My answer to these three questions is unequivocally, unquestionably \nno. Yet every single Democrat who has put his name on this amendment \nhas no choice but to answer yes to all three of these questions.\n  I posed these questions in the Constitution subcommittee. When I \nposed them to the committee, the chairman of the committee, Senator \nDurbin, gaveled the hearing shut because he could not answer those \nquestions. But at the full Judiciary Committee hearing, I was told by \nmy Democratic friends: This is hyperbole. This is exaggeration. We \ndon't intend to ban movies or books or the NAACP. My response in those \nhearings was that this is the Senate. Forty-nine Senators are proposing \nan amendment to the Bill of Rights. The inchoate intentions that may be \nburied in the hearts of each and every Senator are utterly irrelevant \nto the question. The question is, What is the language that would be \ninserted into the Bill of Rights of our Constitution?\n\n  Let's look to the language. Section 2 of this amendment says Congress \nand the States shall have the power to implement and enforce this \narticle by appropriate legislation and may distinguish between natural \npersons and corporations or other artificial entities created by law, \nincluding by prohibiting such entities from spending money to influence \nelections.\n  That is very specific language that would now become part of our Bill \nof Rights. It is breathtaking. It is staggering in its scope.\n  I wish to take these one at a time because the Democrats, I am sure--\nall 49 Democrats--say, We don't intend to ban movies, books, or ban the \nNAACP. Well, let's look to the language they put their names to.\n  No. 1, let's start with movies. We have all heard a lot about the \nCitizens United case. In fact, we remember President Obama during the \nState of the Union hectoring the Supreme Court of the United States for \nthe Citizens United case.\n  Relatively few people know the facts that underlie the Citizens \nUnited case. The facts in those circumstances are that a nonprofit \ncorporation made a movie critical of Hillary Clinton, and for making a \nmovie critical of Hillary Clinton the Obama administration tried to \nimpose massive fines on them. Citizens United, which President Obama \nand the Senate Democrats decry as the most pernicious thing in modern \ntimes, it seems, was all about the government trying to fine a movie \nmaker for daring to make a movie about Hillary Clinton.\n  Listen, let me be very clear. There are movie makers--Michael Moore's \nmovies I think are complete nonsense. To quote the bard, they are full \nof sound and fury, signifying nothing. Michael Moore has a right to \nkeep making those movies over and over again and spewing his nonsense \nas long as he likes. The First Amendment protects his right to be \nwrong.\n  And as a simple legal matter, would this amendment give Congress the \nconstitutional authority to ban movies?\n  Paramount Pictures is a corporation. Under the text of the amendment, \nwhat could Congress do to a corporation? It can prohibit--and that is \nthe language in the amendment--it can prohibit the corporation from \nspending money to influence elections. So if a movie talks about \npolitics, Congress can make it a criminal offense. Go down to \nHollywood, take the producers, the directors, the actors and everyone \ninvolved in the movie and put them in handcuffs. That is breathtaking.\n  Now, again, the Democratic Senators say, We don't intend to do that. \nThen why did they submit a constitutional amendment to the Bill of \nRights that says Congress can prohibit Paramount Pictures from speaking \nabout politics? That means Congress can ban movies.\n  How about the second question: Should Congress be able to ban books? \nThat is an extreme question by anyone's measure. Surely, nobody in \nWashington is talking about banning books. Well, if we assumed that, \nour assumption would be wrong. Indeed, during the oral argument in \nCitizens United, the Supreme Court asked the Obama administration: Your \nposition is that under the Constitution, the sale for the book itself \ncould be prohibited. The answer from the Obama administration: Yes, if \nthe book contained the functional equivalent of express advocacy. The \nObama administration went in front of the Supreme Court and argued: We \nhave the power to ban books.\n  This is in the record. This is in the official transcript. People can \ngo and listen to this argument, listen to the Obama administration say \nthey believe the Federal Government has the ability to ban books from \nyour house. That is breathtaking.\n  I recognize in today's partisan society there are some people who may \nbe\n\n[[Page S5414]]\n\nwatching these remarks who aren't inclined to believe me. They might \nsay: Listen, you are a Republican. You are a conservative. And coming \nfrom the spot in the political aisle that I do, I don't tend to trust \nRepublicans or conservatives.\n  I understand that. I would tell you that if you don't believe me, \nperhaps you would believe that famed rightwing organization, the ACLU. \nThe ACLU said this amendment, to which 49 Democrats have signed their \nnames--what would it do? It would ``fundamentally `break' the \nConstitution and endanger civil rights and civil liberties for \ngenerations.'' I said a few minutes ago that this was the most radical \nlegislation that has been put before this body. Why is that? Because it \nis legislation the ACLU says would ``fundamentally `break' the \nConstitution.'' Breaking the Constitution is no minor matter, and \nendangering civil rights and civil liberties for generations ought to \nconcern every Member of this body.\n  One still might say: Surely banning books is hyperbole.\n  Well, if you don't believe me, the ACLU in writing told the Senate \nthis amendment--to which 49 Democrats have put their names--would give \nCongress the power to ban Hillary Clinton's new book, ``Hard Choices.'' \nI want that to sink in for a moment. Forty-nine Democrats have just put \ntheir names to a constitutional amendment, and the ACLU rightly tells \nus that the express language of the amendment gives the government the \npower to ban Hillary Clinton's new book, ``Hard Choices.''\n  I have that letter from the ACLU. I also have a subsequent letter \nfrom the ACLU doing something which they haven't done before and which \nI don't know they will do again--thanking me and thanking all of us who \nhave been fighting against this amendment for standing up for civil \nliberties. It is truly a shame the Democratic Party is not among them.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record both of the \nletters from the ACLU I referred to earlier.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Legislative Office,\n\n\n                               American Civil Liberties Union,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 3, 2014.\n     Re ACLU Opposes the Udall Amendment.\n\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: The \n     American Civil Liberties Union strongly opposes S.J. Res. 19, \n     a proposed constitutional amendment, sponsored by Sen. Tom \n     Udall (D-NM), that would severely limit the First Amendment, \n     lead directly to government censorship of political speech \n     and result in a host of unintended consequences that would \n     undermine the goals the amendment has been introduced to \n     advance--namely encouraging vigorous political dissent and \n     providing voice to the voiceless, which we, of course, \n     support.\n       As we have said in the past, this and similar \n     constitutional amendments would ``fundamentally break' the \n     Constitution and endanger civil rights and civil liberties \n     for generations.''\n       Were it to pass, the amendment would be the first time, \n     save for the failed policies of Prohibition, that the \n     Constitution has ever been amended to limit rights and \n     freedoms. Congress has had the wisdom to reject other rights-\n     limiting amendments in the past, including the Federal \n     Marriage Amendment, the School Prayer Amendment, the Victims' \n     Rights Amendment and, of course, the Flag Desecration \n     Amendment, which many of the sponsors of this resolution \n     opposed. It should likewise reject the Udall amendment.\n\n\n                    1. Description of the Amendment\n\n       While short, the Udall amendment is deceptively complex and \n     presents several concerns.\n       Section 1 provides that ``[t]o advance the fundamental \n     principle of political equality for all, and to protect the \n     integrity of the legislative and electoral processes, \n     Congress shall have power to regulate the raising and \n     spending of money and in-kind equivalents with respect to \n     Federal elections.''\n       Specifically, Subsection (1)(1) would allow limits on \n     ``contributions to candidates for nomination for election to, \n     or for election to, Federal office.'' Subsection (1)(2) would \n     allow limits on ``the amount of funds that may be spent by, \n     in support of, or in opposition to such candidates.'' Section \n     2 provides the same authorities to each state with respect to \n     state elections.\n       Section 3 says that ``[n]othing in this article shall be \n     construed to grant Congress the power to abridge the freedom \n     of the press.'' And, Section 4 grants express authority to \n     the states and Congress to implement these limits through \n     ``appropriate legislation.''\n\n\n  2. The Amendment is Unnecessary and Would be Corrosive to Vigorous \n              Political Debate About the Issues of the Day\n\n       Congress and the states already have the authority to limit \n     contributions to candidates, including limits on expenditures \n     like advertisements in support of a campaign or candidate \n     paid for by an outside group and coordinated with that \n     campaign or candidate. They have had this authority since the \n     landmark Buckley v. Valeo Supreme Court case in the 1970s, \n     which remains good law and only placed First Amendment limits \n     on the ability of the government to control independent \n     expenditures (that is, uncoordinated express advocacy for or \n     against a candidate).\n       Citizens United's holding, that corporations (including \n     non-profit advocacy groups like the ACLU and thousands of \n     others) and labor organizations may spend general treasury \n     funds on independent expenditures, is entirely consistent \n     with the reasoning of Buckley.\n       Subsections (1)(1) and (2)(1) are therefore both \n     unnecessary and redundant of existing law, which, notably, \n     already also places some limits on independent expenditures, \n     namely reporting requirements and less favorable tax \n     treatment. Such redundancy can be dangerous for civil \n     liberties, in that it invites courts to ask why lawmakers \n     said the same thing twice, and whether duplication means that \n     the second statement confers additional powers.\n       In other words, while the inclusion of contribution limits \n     in the Udall amendment is presumably an attempt to get at \n     McCutcheon's ban on aggregate limits, it could also permit \n     other laws limiting contributions that would severely harm \n     political debate, exacerbate the incumbency advantage, give \n     certain political parties an unfair leg up and \n     disproportionately impair third parties, many of whom cannot \n     afford the sophisticated legal counsel necessary to navigate \n     the complex new laws this amendment would allow. The \n     contribution section could, for instance, allow a federal law \n     limiting contributions to the point where challengers cannot \n     mount an effective campaign, and third parties simply can't \n     afford to stay in business.\n       More important, however, is the proposed change in \n     Subsections (1)(2) and (2)(2), which would permit the federal \n     and state governments to limit the amount of funds spent ``in \n     support of, or in opposition to'' candidates for office. \n     Right now, under existing law, there is a distinction between \n     express advocacy (``vote Romney/Ryan'' or ``support Obama/\n     Biden'') and ``issue advocacy'' (``call Speaker Boehner and \n     tell him to stop blocking NSA surveillance reform''). \n     Historically, campaign finance reform efforts, including \n     constitutional amendments such as this one, have sought to \n     restrict ``sham'' issue advocacy--that is, communications \n     that some claim are express advocacy disguised as issue \n     advocacy.\n       As a practical matter, however, the staff vested with the \n     responsibility of distinguishing between the two at the \n     Federal Election Commission (``FEC'') or the Exempt \n     Organizations Division of the Internal Revenue Service are \n     ill-equipped to draw these lines in a consistent and \n     principled manner.\n       For instance, would an ACLU ad urging members of Congress \n     to support Patriot Act reform, which runs shortly before the \n     November 2004 election (when that issue is at play in the \n     election), be construed as an issue ad exhorting voters to \n     support reform or a covert attempt to influence voters to \n     oppose members who do not support reform? Similarly, would an \n     ad by a group urging repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which \n     runs before the 2012 presidential election, be issue advocacy \n     or covert express advocacy?\n       Given the inability of the world's best election law \n     lawyers, let alone overworked line revenue agents and \n     attorney-advisors, to make a principled determination on any \n     such ads, lawmakers tend to overcorrect and restrict all \n     issue advocacy in order to suppress any covert express \n     advocacy. The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act attempted to do \n     exactly that by criminalizing any broadcast, cable or \n     satellite communication that simply mentioned a candidate in \n     the 30 days before a primary or 60 days before a general \n     election.\n       Recognizing both the severe harm to political debate \n     through overbroad laws that suppress all issue advocacy \n     mentioning a candidate for office, and the difficulty in \n     making principled distinctions between issue and express \n     advocacy under a totality of the circumstances approach, the \n     courts have rightly rejected measures that allow the \n     government to restrict issue advocacy at all.\n       Sections (1)(2) and (2)(2) are designed to, and would, \n     completely overturn that legal distinction between issue and \n     express advocacy and permit the government to criminalize and \n     censor all issue advocacy that mentions or refers to a \n     candidate under the argument that it supports or opposes that \n     candidate.\n       To give just a few hypotheticals of what would be possible \n     in a world where the Udall proposal is the 28th Amendment:\n       Congress would be allowed to restrict the publication of \n     Secretary Hillary Clinton's forthcoming memoir ``Hard \n     Choices'' were she to run for office;\n       Congress could criminalize a blog on the Huffington Post by \n     Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation \n     Voters,\n\n[[Page S5415]]\n\n     that accuses Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) of being a ``climate \n     change denier'';\n       Congress could regulate this website by reform group Public \n     Citizen, which urges voters to contact their members of \n     Congress in support of a constitutional amendment addressing \n     Citizens United and the recent McCutcheon case, under the \n     theory that it is, in effect, a sham issue communication in \n     favor of the Democratic Party;\n       A state election agency, run by a corrupt patronage \n     appointee, could use state law to limit speech by anti-\n     corruption groups supporting reform;\n       A local sheriff running for reelection and facing \n     vociferous public criticism for draconian immigration \n     policies and prisoner abuse could use state campaign finance \n     laws to harass and prosecute his own detractors;\n       A district attorney running for reelection could \n     selectively prosecute political opponents using state \n     campaign finance restrictions; and\n       Congress could pass a law regulating this letter for noting \n     that all 41 sponsors of this amendment, which the ACLU \n     opposes, are Democrats (or independents who caucus with \n     Democrats).\n       Such examples are not only plausible, they are endless. \n     Currently, we do not have to worry about viewpoint \n     discrimination, selective enforcement and unreasonable \n     regulations that unnecessarily stifle free speech without \n     advancing a legitimate state interest because of the First \n     Amendment, and these protections would not apply to speech \n     covered by this proposed amendment. Tinkering with the First \n     Amendment in this way opens the door to vague and overbroad \n     laws, which both fail to address the problem that Congress \n     wishes to solve and invariably pull in vast amounts of \n     protected speech.\n       Vague and overbroad laws regulating pure speech are also \n     exceedingly dangerous to democratic processes because they \n     can be misused by various parochial interests. During the \n     civil rights era, for instance, southern states often tried \n     to use laws forcing groups exercising their First Amendment \n     rights to disclose their membership, in a bid to run them out \n     of town.\n       Rather than ``equalizing'' the debate and giving voice to \n     the voiceless, laws that allow criminalization of issue \n     advocacy--which this, on its face, would permit--actually \n     give the advantage to special interests with significant \n     resources, because they can now call on the law to regulate \n     their policy opponents. By exempting this class of political \n     speech from the scope of the First Amendment (and potentially \n     other rights), it would provide no protection at all for \n     disfavored minority groups on both the left and right. \n     Congress would, for instance, be free to pass laws targeting \n     only ``political'' speech by groups like ACORN.\n\n\n 3. The Amendment Could Perversely Harm Freedom of the Press and Would \n   Directly Eviscerate the Freedoms of Speech, Assembly and Petition\n\n       In addition to allowing Congress and the states to \n     criminalize issue advocacy, the amendment's third section, \n     exempting ``freedom of the press'' from its reach, poses four \n     major problems.\n       First, it could actually make matters worse. Those with \n     enough money can afford to buy newspapers or journalistic \n     websites, which are indisputably press outlets, and would be \n     completely outside the scope of the laws permitted by this \n     amendment. William Randolph Hearst's newspaper empire, for \n     instance, was at first a vigorously partisan supporter of \n     Franklin Roosevelt (and then critic), and such partisan \n     electioneering by the mass media would unquestionably be \n     permitted under this amendment.\n       Second, it invites government inquiry into what constitutes \n     ``the press,'' which is increasingly problematic in the age \n     of citizen journalism and the internet. Here, the government \n     would have to determine if the Daily Kos or Red State qualify \n     as ``the press.'' If yes, they can blog freely. If no, they \n     could be censored or even go to jail. The potential for abuse \n     is obvious.\n       Accordingly, the reference to freedom of the press could \n     perversely limit that freedom. Legally, ``the press'' has \n     been defined broadly. It encompasses not only the ``large \n     metropolitan publisher'' but also the ``lonely pamphleteer.'' \n     ``Freedom of the press is a fundamental personal right,'' the \n     Supreme Court has written, ``which is not confined to \n     newspapers and periodicals. It necessarily embraces pamphlets \n     and leaflets. The press in its historic connotation \n     comprehends every sort of publication which affords a vehicle \n     of information and opinion.''\n       The reference to freedom of the press will force the \n     government and courts to draw difficult lines between non-\n     traditional media and the ``large metropolitan publisher.'' \n     More often than not, the latter, simply because of the \n     breadth of issues covered in their media, is going to appear \n     less ``political'' than the pamphleteer handing out circulars \n     urging greater gun control, reproductive freedom or a path to \n     citizenship for undocumented immigrants. The courts \n     interpreting the laws permitted by this amendment are \n     therefore more likely to move away from the notion of \n     ``lonely pamphleteer'' as press.\n       Finally, fourth, the reference to the press clause \n     expressly incorporates the speech, assembly and petition \n     clauses into the Udall amendment by omission. In other words, \n     the amendment makes clear--through lack of reference to the \n     speech clause--that this amendment is meant to directly \n     constrain the existing speech, assembly and petition rights, \n     and potentially all other constitutional rights that could \n     conceivably apply, with respect to both the state and federal \n     governments. That is both unprecedented and exceedingly \n     worrisome.\n       Additionally, we note that Section 3 appears to only apply \n     to Congress, suggesting that states may be free to \n     ``abridge'' the freedom of the press.\n\n\n    4. Amending the Constitution to Limit a Specifically Enumerated \n  Constitutional Right is Unprecedented in the History of the Republic\n\n       It bears emphasizing that this would be the first time the \n     amendatory process has been used to directly limit \n     specifically enumerated rights and freedoms. Many argue that \n     such an amendment is not unprecedented. What they mean, \n     however, is that amending the Constitution in response to an \n     unpopular court case is not unprecedented. In those cases, \n     however, the amendment either had little to do with \n     individual rights or it restored lost rights. In no case, did \n     it limit the right and freedom that vouchsafes our ability to \n     advocate for all of our other rights and freedoms.\n       Finally, while rights-limiting amendments are \n     unprecedented, proposals to do so are legion.\n       The ACLU has aggressively lobbied against, to name just a \n     few, the Flag Desecration Amendment, which would have \n     overturned the Supreme Court cases prohibiting the state and \n     federal governments from criminalizing defacement of the \n     American flag; the Victims' Rights Amendment, which would \n     have limited the rights of criminal defendants; an amendment \n     to deny automatic citizenship to all persons born in the \n     United States; the School Prayer Amendment, which would have \n     given school officials the power to dictate how, when and \n     where students pray; and the Federal Marriage Amendment, \n     which would have denied marriage rights to same-sex couples \n     in committed relationships.\n       Were this to pass, the Udall amendment would grease the \n     skids of these and other proposals to limit fundamental \n     constitutional rights.\n       For all of these reasons, we strongly urge you to oppose \n     the Udall amendment, and to focus Congress's attention on \n     enacting effective public financing laws, tightening up the \n     coordination rules, ensuring prosecutors have effective \n     resources to pursue straw donations and other common sense \n     measures for promoting the integrity of our political system.\n       What you must not do is ``break'' the Constitution by \n     amending the First Amendment.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact Legislative Counsel/\n     Policy Advisor Gabe Rottman at 202-675-2325 or \n     grottman@aclu.org if you have any questions or comments.\n           Sincerely,\n     Laura W. Murphy,\n       Director, Washington Legislative Office.\n     Gabriel Rottman,\n       Legislative Counsel/Policy Advisor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               American Civil Liberties Union,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 6, 2014.\n     Hon. Ted Cruz,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Bldg., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cruz: We write to offer our thanks for your \n     co-sponsorship of the USA Freedom Act and your ardent defense \n     of the First Amendment in two important areas. As you so \n     aptly said, ``Republicans and Democrats are showing America \n     that the government can respect the privacy rights of law-\n     abiding Americans, while at the same time, giving law \n     enforcement the tools needed to target terrorists.''\n       The American Civil Liberties Union has long sought to work \n     with members at all points on the political spectrum to \n     advance fundamental American principles of individual liberty \n     and personal privacy. We are heartened that you have been \n     willing to reach across the aisle to further those essential \n     values and implement needed reforms of our growing \n     surveillance state.\n       We would also note that, while many of the objections to \n     the bulk surveillance programs revealed in the past year have \n     focused on privacy, the ACLU has long been critical of mass \n     surveillance on First Amendment grounds as well. \n     Indiscriminate government spying abrogates our constitutional \n     right to anonymous speech and chills associational activity.\n       Indeed, it raises many of the same concerns that have led \n     the Supreme Court to prohibit the compelled disclosure of \n     political associations and beliefs in landmark cases like \n     National Association for the Advancement of Colored People v. \n     Alabama, 357 U.S. 449 (1958); Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479 \n     (1960); Gibson v. Florida Legislative Committee, 372 U.S. 539 \n     (1963); Brown v. Socialist Workers Party, 459 U.S. 87 (1982); \n     McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission, 514 U.S. 334 (1995); \n     and Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc. v. \n     Village of Stratton, 536 U.S. 150 (2002).\n       One of the key civil liberties concerns with indiscriminate \n     bulk surveillance, for either criminal investigative purposes \n     or national security, is that it gives the government a \n     detailed record of those dissenting from official policy--on \n     both the right and left. Surveillance chills such dissent, \n     which results in poor policy outcomes. Anonymity is essential \n     for the dissemination of unpopular ideas, which often enrich \n     the marketplace of ideas. Anonymous speech and association \n     have\n\n[[Page S5416]]\n\n     driven social progress on numerous fronts, from civil and \n     labor rights to, tellingly, our expansive modern view of free \n     speech.\n       For these and other reasons, the ACLU also opposes S.J. \n     Res. 19, a proposed constitutional amendment that would limit \n     the First Amendment to allow the government--federal and \n     state--to ``regulate and set reasonable limits on the raising \n     and spending of money by candidates and others to influence \n     elections.''\n       While we certainly appreciate the good intentions of the \n     measure's supporters, we fear--based on long historical \n     experience--that such an open ended remit would result in the \n     censorship of pure issue advocacy by non-partisan, non-profit \n     groups. Likewise, we anticipate the amendment would be used, \n     much like programmatic national security surveillance, to \n     compel disclosure of constitutionally protected anonymous \n     political activity and association by those espousing \n     controversial or minority views.\n       The fact this would be the first time any enumerated right \n     in the Constitution has been restricted through the \n     amendatory process underscores the gravity of the threat to \n     the First Amendment posed by S.J. Res 19. We thank you for \n     your support for the First Amendment in your staunch \n     opposition to the constitutional amendment and your original \n     co-sponsorship of the USA Freedom Act.\n       We look forward to working with you on other First \n     Amendment issues. Please contact Legislative Counsel/Policy \n     Advisor Gabe Rottman if you should have any questions at 202-\n     675-2325 or grottman@aclu.org.\n           Sincerely,\n     Laura W. Murphy,\n       Director, Washington Legislative Office.\n     Michael W. Macleod-Ball,\n       Chief of Staff/First Amendment Counsel.\n     Gabriel Rottman,\n       Legislative Counsel/Policy Advisor.\n\n  Mr. CRUZ. The third question every Senator who has put his name to \nthis amendment must answer is this: Should Congress have the \nconstitutional authority to ban the NAACP from speaking about politics? \nWell, why is that? Because the NAACP is a corporation. We hear the word \n``corporation,'' and we tend to think of ExxonMobil, Walmart, or what \nhave you, but the NAACP is a corporation. What could Congress do under \nthis amendment, under the explicit language of this amendment? Congress \ncould prohibit the NAACP from speaking about politics.\n  Let me state some other corporations Congress would have the \nconstitutional authority to silence. The ACLU is a corporation. The \nAARP--the American Association of Retired Persons--is a corporation. \nPeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals is a corporation. Amnesty \nInternational is a corporation. Americans United for Separation of \nChurch and State is a corporation. The Gay & Lesbian Advocates & \nDefenders is a corporation. The National Organization for Women is a \ncorporation. The Center for Reproductive Rights is a corporation. The \nSierra Club is a corporation. La Raza is a corporation. NARAL is a \ncorporation. Planned Parenthood is a corporation. Moveon.org is a \ncorporation. The Human Rights Campaign is a corporation. Greenpeace is \na corporation.\n  People will note that every one I listed is a group that in our \npolitical discourse is often associated with being on the left. Many of \nthose groups are not particular fans of mine as an elected official, \nand that is their right. Indeed, it is their right to scream from the \nmountaintops their criticism of my political positions. I will defend \ntheir right to criticize me or any other Member of this body all day \nlong because the Bill of Rights says Congress shall make no law \nabridging the freedom of speech.\n  Forty-nine Democrats just said that every organization I read--that \nit should be constitutional for Congress to prohibit them from speaking \nabout politics.\n  It seems to me that when we return to our home States, every Senate \nDemocrat who put his or her name to this amendment should expect to \nanswer questions from citizens: Senator, why did you vote for a \nconstitutional amendment to silence my free speech rights? That is a \nquestion we should all expect.\n  I would like to address a couple of red herrings in this debate \nbecause there are arguments put forth by the Democrats who say: No, no, \nno. Pay no attention to the text of the amendment we have introduced. \nPay no attention to the fact that it would give Congress the power to \nban movies, books, and to silence the NAACP. Pay no attention to any of \nthat. It is something else.\n  There are three red herrings that are tossed forward.\n  First, money is not speech. How many times have we heard that over \nand over in floor speeches? Yesterday and today Democrats have stood \nand said: Money is not speech. Money is not speech. It has been \nrepeated over and over. It is a good talking point. It is simply, on \nits face, demonstrably false. It is certainly true that all money is \nnot speech.\n  If you go out and buy a Ferrari, that is not speech, but if you go \nout and erect a billboard and pay money to put up a billboard that says \n``Senator Joe Manchin is a terrific guy,'' that is speech. It takes \nmoney to do that. They don't put up billboards with pixie dust. It \nactually takes some dollars to erect that billboard and to express that \nspeech.\n  If you decide you want to run a radio ad saying that Senator so-and-\nso is terrible or wonderful, they don't run radio ads just because you \nasked ``pretty please.'' It takes money.\n  Let's say you want to run a television ad. It takes money.\n  Let's say you want to launch a Web site. Have you ever launched a Web \nsite for free?\n  Let's say you are a little old lady who wants to put a yard sign on \nyour front yard, and it is going to take $5 to buy some poster board \nand a stick and some crayons and markers and write: I love the First \nAmendment; I love free speech. That takes money.\n  The Federalist Papers were the essence of speech, and it took money \nto print them. Thomas Paine's ``Common Sense''--it took money to print \nit. It took money to print pamphlets.\n  Everyone in the tech community--and I would note that all of our \nDemocratic friends and sponsors of this amendment almost to a person go \nroutinely to the tech community and say: Give us money. Give us \ncampaign contributions.\n  Every Senate Democrat should expect the tech community to say: Wait a \nsecond. Why did you vote for a constitutional amendment to give \nCongress the power to regulate every Web site in America?\n  If a Web site talks about politics, this amendment gives Congress the \npower to regulate that Web site.\n  Listen, I understand there are Members in this body on both sides of \nthe aisle who find it really pesky when citizens dare criticize us. If \nyou don't want to be criticized, don't run for office. Democracy is \nmessy.\n  I guarantee there is no one in this country who truly believes money \nis not speech. It is a talking point, but those examples are \nunquestionably speech, and they have been from the very first days of \nour Republic.\n  A second canard is that corporations are not people. That is often \nsaid. Citizens United said that corporations are people.\n  Of course corporations are not people, but that is not the right \nquestion. It never was the question. Nobody thinks corporations are \npeople. They don't breathe, they don't walk, and they are not human \nbeings. The question is, Do corporations have rights under our \nConstitution? Again, I guarantee that every person in this Chamber and \nevery person in the gallery believes the answer to that question is \nyes. If they don't, the New York Times is a corporation. Do we really \nthink the New York Times has no First Amendment rights?\n  If the canard were true--corporations are not people, so they don't \nhave rights--Congress could pass a law tomorrow that says the New York \nTimes can never again criticize any Republican Member of Congress. I \nthink the paper would probably go out of publication if it had to \nremove that from its content.\n  But it, of course, cannot. Why can't it? Because corporations have \nrights. Every one of us knows that. We would be horrified. That \nlegislation would be blatantly unconstitutional. Why? Because the New \nYork Times has a First Amendment right to speak about politics however \nit likes, whether wrongheaded or right-headed.\n  The groups I mentioned before--the NAACP is a corporation. I \nchallenge any Senator to stand and say the NAACP has no First Amendment \nrights. But every Senator who has said on this Senate floor that \ncorporations\n\n[[Page S5417]]\n\naren't people, that they have no rights, has said the NAACP has no \nconstitutional rights--if you were a first-year law student and put \nthat answer in any constitutional law class in the country, you would \nget an F. It wouldn't be a D-plus or a D-minus; it would be an F. It is \nan obviously blatantly false statement. Yet 49 Democrats rely on it to \njustify trying to gut the First Amendment.\n  The third red herring the Democrats in this body point to is they \npaint a specter of evil billionaires coming to steal our democracy.\n  We have all heard of our friends the Koch brothers--in part because \nthe majority leader has launched an unprecedented slander campaign on \ntwo private citizens. Almost on a daily basis the majority leader \nstands and demagogues two private citizens who have committed the sin \nof creating hundreds of thousands of jobs, being successful in the \nprivate sector, and then exercising their First Amendment rights to \nspeak out about the grave challenges facing this country.\n  If one Member of this body impugns the integrity of another Member of \nthis body, we can rise on a point of personal privilege. I ask the \nPresiding Officer, where is the point of personal privilege for a \nprivate citizen when the majority leader drags his name through the mud \nday after day?\n  What Senator Reid is doing to two private citizens who are fighting \nto exercise their free speech rights is reprehensible. It is an \nembarrassment to this institution. Yet perhaps one might say there is \nsome truth to the matter. We are told these nefarious brothers are \nresponsible for almost everything bad in the world, so it must be that \nthey are playing a huge role in our body politic.\n  Well, if you go look at OpenSecrets, which compiles campaign giving \nfrom 1989 to 2014, so for the past 25 years--and it compiles them from \nthe biggest givers down to the smallest givers--if you look at first 16 \nnames on that list--I have heard what our Democratic Members of this \nbody have said: There are evil, nefarious Republicans trying to steal \nour democracy. And the implication is that they are backing \nRepublicans. So my assumption is, as I look at the list of the top \ndonors, the top 16--how many of them give predominantly to Republicans? \nWell, one would assume, given how great the magnitude is, that it has \nto be a lot of them, probably all of them, or if not all of them, most \nof them--at least half of them.\n  Mr. President, do you know how many of the top 16 groups give \npredominantly to Republicans? Zero. The top 16 political donors in this \ncountry all give either overwhelmingly to Democrats or at best evenly \nbetween the two parties. You have to fall to No. 17 to find a group \nthat gives more heavily to Republicans than to Democrats. Now, that is \ncurious given the story that is being told by our Democratic friends \nabout these evil Republican billionaires stealing democracy. Gosh, the \ntop 16 donors are not Republicans.\n  And how about the Koch brothers who we are told are somewhat like the \nGrinch who stole Christmas? Where do they fall? We have to go down to \nNo. 59 on the list to find Koch Industries.\n  But perhaps you believe there is something to this claim of secret \nmoney. That too is a red herring. The Federal Election Commission \nestimates that over $7 billion was spent in the 2012 election cycle. We \nhave heard from Democrat after Democrat after Democrat that secret \nmoney--money where the donors are not disclosed--is this enormous \nproblem in our democracy that justifies gutting the First Amendment. So \nof that $7 billion, I assume a lot of that is secret money. Well, if \nyou were to assume that, you would be wrong. The Center for Responsive \nPolitics estimates that in 2012 about $315 million was spent by groups \nthat do not disclose all of their donors. That is less than 4.5 percent \nof all the political speech in 2012.\n  So this entire effort to gut the First Amendment, to give Congress \nthe power to ban movies, books, and the NAACP from speaking about \npolitics is justified because of 4.5 percent of political spending, a \nwhole bunch of which is being spent to help Democrats. Those are the \nfacts. As John Adams famously said: Facts are stubborn things.\n  (Ms. WARREN assumed the Chair.)\n  So it raises the question: If the problems they are telling us about \nare not real, why are the Democrats doing this? Why are we spending a \nweek debating this constitutional amendment, the most radical \nconstitutional amendment this body has ever considered, particularly \nbecause every single Member of this body knows the outcome? There are \nnot sufficient votes to adopt this amendment. The Democrats all know \nthis. The Republicans all know this. Then why would they be doing it?\n  Well, if you are a Democrat running for reelection in 2014, you \ncannot run on the economy. The Obama economy is a disaster. Millions of \npeople are out of work. The people who have been hurt the most by the \nObama economy are the most vulnerable among us--young people, \nHispanics, African Americans, single moms. We have not seen such a low \nlabor force participation since 1978, since the stagnation and misery \nand malaise under Jimmy Carter. The Obama economy has recreated that. \nSo if you are a Democrat, you cannot run on the disastrous economic \nrecord of the Obama administration.\n  If you are a Democrat, you certainly cannot run on ObamaCare--the \nmost harmful social services legislation in modern times that has cost \nmillions of Americans their jobs, their health care, their doctors. If \nyou do not believe me, take a look at how the Democrats are running in \ntheir States. You do not see Democrats running saying: We passed \nObamaCare. When you take away millions of people's health care and \ndoctors, and when you look in the TV camera and repeatedly state \nfalsehoods: If you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it, if \nyou like your doctor, you can keep them, you do not really want to \nremind the American people that you deliberately lied to them.\n  And the Democrats certainly cannot run on the Obama-Clinton foreign \npolicy--a policy about which we heard last week the President has no \nstrategy for dealing with the great threats facing this country. \nLeading from behind is not a strategy, and we can see the consequences \nof the Obama-Clinton foreign policy, which is that the entire world is \non fire.\n  If you are a Democratic Senator running for reelection in 2014, you \nhave a problem. You cannot run on your record because the record is \nabysmal. So what is done instead? It is smoke and mirrors. It is \ndistraction.\n  The only explanation I can come up with for why we are spending a \nweek--with all the challenges in the world--a week debating an \namendment that will never ever pass is this is designed to fuel a bunch \nof TV commercials for Democratic Senators, to paint the picture of \nnefarious billionaires coming to steal our democracy. Facts do not get \nin the way of their story. But yet the breadth of this is rather \nenormous.\n  I serve on the constitution subcommittee with the Senator from \nMinnesota, who before being a Senator was a very talented comedic actor \nand comedic writer on ``Saturday Night Live.'' I grew up watching \n``Saturday Night Live.'' I love ``Saturday Night Live.''\n  ``Saturday Night Live'' over the years has had some of the most \ntremendous political satire--for decades. Who can forget Chevy Chase \ntripping and falling over just about everything? Who can forget \nportrayals--Dana Carvey's George Herbert Walker Bush: ``Not going to do \nit.'' Who can forget Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan, Al Gore? Who can \nforget in 2008 the ``Saturday Night Live'' wickedly funny \ncharacterization of the Republican Vice Presidential nominee Sarah \nPalin? It was wickedly funny and also had a profoundly powerful effect \non people's assessment of Governor Palin, who is a friend of mine.\n  When I asked the Senator from Minnesota in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee: Do you believe that Congress should have the constitutional \nauthority to prohibit ``Saturday Night Live'' from making fun of \npoliticians, the good Senator promptly reassured me he had no intention \nof doing any such thing. But what we are debating is not the intentions \nof 100 Senators. What we are debating is a constitutional amendment \nthat 49 Democrats are proposing to be inserted into the Bill of Rights.\n  The only question--it is not the intention of those Senators--but, \nrather, what would that amendment say? What the amendment says is for \nany corporation Congress would have the constitutional authority to \nprohibit it from engaging in political speech.\n\n[[Page S5418]]\n\n  Well, NBC, which airs ``Saturday Night Live,'' is a corporation. \nUnder this amendment 49 Democrats have signed their name to, Congress \nwould have the power to make it a criminal offense. Lorne Michaels \ncould be put in jail under this amendment for making fun of any \npolitician. That is extraordinary, it is breathtaking, and it is \ndangerous.\n  The idea of banning books is not new. Advocates of government power, \nstatists, have long favored silencing the citizenry. It is why our \nFirst Amendment was such a revolutionary concept, the idea that the \nindividual citizen has the authority to challenge any elected official, \nfrom local magistrate all the way up to the President of the United \nStates.\n  But if you are an advocate of governmental power, the citizens having \nthe liberty to speak out is inconvenient; it can lead to inconvenient \ntruths. So on some level it should not be surprising that the modern \nDemocratic Party, which has become the party of government power over \nevery aspect of our lives, would take it to the final conclusion of \ngiving government the power to silence our political speech and to ban \nbooks.\n  I am reminded, in Ray Bradbury's immortal book ``Fahrenheit 451,'' of \nthe words of Captain Beatty: ``If you don't want a man unhappy \npolitically, don't give him two sides to a question to worry him; give \nhim one. Better yet, give him none.'' That was, of course, the chief \nfireman in charge of burning books in ``Fahrenheit 451.'' In the book \nthat is the temperature at which book paper ignites. It breaks my heart \nthat today we are seeing the Fahrenheit 451 Democrats. Today we have \nseen 49 Democrats put their name to a constitutional amendment that \nwould give Congress the power to ban books.\n  Some might dismiss it and say: What does it matter? It is an exercise \nin politics. They do not really believe it. They know it is not going \nto pass. Politicians will be politicians. No wonder the American people \nare cynical. I would be embarrassed if one Senator put his or her name \nto an amendment repealing the free speech protections of the First \nAmendment. Instead of one, it is 49. And much like with Sherlock Holmes \nand ``the dog that didn't bark,'' every bit as troubling as the 49 \nnames of the Senators who are willing to repeal the free speech \nprotections of the First Amendment are the Senators who are not \nspeaking out. In particular, we have not seen a single Democrat have \nthe courage to speak out against this abominable provision.\n  It was not always so. There was a time not long ago when there was \nbipartisan agreement on questions of civil liberties. There was a time \nwhen you could find Democrats for whom the First Amendment meant \nsomething.\n  In 1997, Democrats attempted a similar amendment to give Congress the \npower to regulate free speech, and that lion of the left Ted Kennedy \nstood up and said: ``In the entire history of the Constitution, we have \nnever amended the Bill of Rights, and now is no time to start.''\n  Where are the Ted Kennedys? Where are the Democrats? Where are the \nliberals?\n  Also in 1997, Senator Russ Feingold, another passionate liberal, \nstood up and said:\n\n       . . . the Constitution of this country was not a rough \n     draft. We must stop treating it as such. The First Amendment \n     is the bedrock of the Bill of Rights. It has as its \n     underpinnings that each individual has a natural and \n     fundamental right to disagree with their elected leaders.\n\n  I agree with Ted Kennedy, I agree with Russ Feingold, and I will tell \nyou, privately I have urged Democratic colleagues to come and join me \nin defense of the First Amendment--the handful who have not put their \nnames to this amendment--and all I can surmise is that the partisan \npressures of Washington are too much.\n  This amendment is not going to pass, but it is profoundly dangerous \nthat in the U.S. Senate not a single Democratic Senator will come to \nthe floor in defense of the First Amendment. It is profoundly dangerous \nthat the modern Democratic Party now thinks it is good politics to \ncampaign on repealing the First Amendment. The hashtag #don'trepeal1A \nhas echoed through twitter as individual citizens are amazed.\n  Earlier this year we saw all 55 Democrats stand together against \nreligious liberty, supporting an amendment that would gut the Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act which was passed with overwhelming bipartisan \nsupport and signed into law by Bill Clinton.\n  It used to be on religious liberty there was a bipartisan consensus. \nThe same used to be true on free speech. When did Democrats abandon the \nBill of Rights? When did Democrats abandon civil liberties? I assure \nyou, if it were my party proposing this egregious amendment, I would be \nstanding on the floor of this Senate giving the very same speech trying \nto hold my party to account. Because at the end of the day, when we \ntake our oath of office, it is not to a Democratic Party or the \nRepublican Party, it is to represent the citizens of our State--in my \ncase, 26 million Texans--to fight for their rights and to defend and \nuphold the Constitution of the United States.\n  There is nothing the United States has done in the just under 2 years \nthat I have been in this body that I find more disturbing and more \ndangerous than the fact that 49 Democrats would put their name to a \nproposal to repeal the First Amendment.\n  When my daughters Caroline, 6, and Catherine, 3, came up from Texas \nto Washington for a weekend to visit, I took them to the Newseum. It is \na terrific museum. The front facade of the Newseum has in gigantic \nletters the text of the First Amendment carved in granite.\n  If the Democratic Party has its way, the Bill of Rights will be \nforever altered. We will have to send up workmen to that facade to \ncarve with jackhammers the words of the First Amendment out of the \ngranite in the front of the Newseum.\n  In the Senate Judiciary Committee I introduced a substitute \namendment. It was an amendment to replace every word of this \nextraordinarily dangerous amendment with the following words:\n\n       Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of \n     religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or \n     abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the \n     right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition \n     the Government for a redress of grievances.\n\n  It was word-for-word verbatim the text of the First Amendment of the \nConstitution of the United States, and I am sorry to tell you every \nsingle Senate Democrat on the Judiciary Committee voted against the \ntext of the First Amendment. It was a straight party-line vote.\n  Going back to Senator Kennedy, Senator Kennedy and I would have \nagreed on very little. On matters of policy, he was a big government \nman and I most assuredly am not. On matters of foreign policy, he \nsupported a far weaker military than do I and a far weaker defense of \nour Nation. But on the question of the First Amendment, I am proud to \nstand side by side with Ted Kennedy.\n  What does it say about the modern Democratic Party that not a single \nDemocrat is willing to honor Senator Kennedy's legacy? His words are \nevery bit as true now as they were in 1997.\n\n       In the entire history of the Constitution, we have never \n     amended the Bill of Rights, and now is no time to start.\n\n  It is my plea to the Democratic Members of this body that they \nreconsider the decision of putting their name on this amendment. It may \nseem like harmless election-year politicking that will help in \npolitical campaigns, but it is dangerous when 49 Senators come together \nand say: We no longer support the First Amendment.\n  We have a two-party system--a two-party system on which there should \nbe robust debate. It is even more dangerous when one of the two parties \nbecomes so extreme and so radical that it becomes seen as good politics \nto campaign against the First Amendment.\n  This will not pass this week, but I hope my Democratic colleagues \nwill have second thoughts. I hope we can return to the day where there \nis a bipartisan consensus in favor of civil liberties, in favor of \nprotecting the free speech rights of every American.\n  I hope we will listen to the wise counsel of Senator Kennedy, and I \nhope we will recognize, as Senator Kennedy and Senator Finegold \nobserved, that there are no James Madisons or Thomas Jeffersons serving \nin this body today.\n  The Bill of Rights is not a rough draft, and the U.S. Senate should \nnot\n\n[[Page S5419]]\n\nbe proposing to repeal the First Amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, listening to the good Senator from \nTexas, I feel as though I am in a parallel universe.\n  I rise to support S.J. Res. 19, an amendment to the U.S. Constitution \nthat ensures our democracy is for the people--for the people, not for \ncorporations.\n  I am proud to cosponsor this measure. I am also proud to stand with \nthe overwhelming majority of this country in support of restoring \ncommonsense and fair campaign finance rules.\n  The current Supreme Court has been noted as among the most pro-\ncorporate Supreme Courts in our history. In decision after decision, a \nnarrow conservative majority of the Court has placed the voices of the \ncorporations and special interests over the voices of the people.\n  The Court decided Citizens United in 2010. Corporations are people \nwith free speech rights, said the Court's 5-to-4 majority. Under this \nconstruct that corporations are people, this ruling, Citizens United, \ngranted special interests the right to use corporate treasuries to \ndrown out the voices of the people without being subject to meaningful \ndisclosure requirements.\n  We have already seen the impact of this decision. According to the \nCenter for Responsive Politics, this election year outside groups have \nspent triple the amount they had at the same time in 2010, and the \nelection is still months away.\n  The Court thrust the floodgates even wider with the ruling in the \nMcCutcheon case. This ruling struck down aggregate limits on \ncontributions by individuals. So now billionaires could spend hundreds \nof millions of dollars to influence elections--and they are doing just \nthat.\n  In these two decisions, the majority willfully ignored the reality of \nthe corrupting influence of Big Money in our democracy. It is clear to \nme that the Court got it wrong in both cases. To fix what has been \ndone, Congress must act.\n  The need for action is not just a Democratic or Republican issue. \nNearly 80 percent of Americans support overturning the Supreme Court's \nCitizens United decision. Campaign spending is out of control, and the \nAmerican people strongly support reform. Seventy-one percent believe \nthat individual contributions should be limited, and 76 percent believe \nthat spending by outside groups should also be limited.\n  The American public is clear on this issue. Only in Washington, DC, \nhas this become such a polarized debate. Unchecked and unaccountable, \nspending on campaigns impacts politics and policy across the country, \neven at the State and local levels. From Arizona to Montana to my home \nState of Hawaii, the Supreme Court's extreme decisions on campaign \nfinance are undermining fair, democratic processes.\n  The Citizens United and McCutcheon cases also limit the ability of \nCongress and the States to fix the problems caused by these decisions. \nWhy? Because the Supreme Court has decided that unfettered spending in \nelections is a constitutional right. So the only way we can fix these \nwrong decisions is by amending the Constitution.\n  The Supreme Court's majority claims that allowing unlimited spending \nin elections is essential to protecting the First Amendment, that \nunlimited spending by corporations and individuals is a constitutional \nright.\n  Guess what. Before the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United \nand McCutcheon, the First Amendment and constitutional rights were \nalive and well. So the Court argued that restricting campaign spending \nwould limit the right of individuals and groups to participate in our \ndemocratic process--never mind that they have been participating in our \ndemocratic processes before these decisions.\n  In reality, these rulings institutionalize the power of Big Money in \npolitics at the expense of regular Americans. The Court's decisions \nhave the effect of saying that in our democracy those with the most \nmoney should have the loudest voices and that the very identity of \nthose voices can be hidden from the voters. The huge undisclosed \nexpenditures that these decisions allow have diluted the core principle \nof democracy: one person, one vote.\n  The vast majority of the American people disagree with the Supreme \nCourt's unprecedented interpretation of the First Amendment. The Court \nhas left us with the option we are pursuing today--amending the U.S. \nConstitution. When the Supreme Court said that women did not have the \nright to vote, Congress and the people passed the 19th Amendment. So \namending the Constitution to protect our democracy is not some new or \nradical idea. When the Supreme Court said States could impose poll \ntaxes on the poor, Congress and the people passed the 24th Amendment, \nand the list goes on. Why? Because the Supreme Court is made up of \nhuman beings, and as human beings they sometimes get it wrong, as they \ndid in the Citizens United and McCutcheon decisions.\n  As retired Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in his dissent to Citizens \nUnited:\n\n       The Court's opinion is thus a rejection of the common sense \n     of the American people, who have recognized a need to prevent \n     corporations from undermining self-government since the \n     founding, and who have fought against the distinctive \n     corrupting potential of corporate electioneering since the \n     days of Theodore Roosevelt.\n\n  Justice Stevens has it right and so does the overwhelming majority of \nAmericans. Republicans, Democrats, and Independents all agree that the \nCourt's ruling in Citizen's United and McCutcheon stand for something \nthat is completely inconsistent with America's Constitution, history, \nand values. I say that the First Amendment was alive and well before \nthe Citizens United and the McCutcheon decisions.\n  The constitutional amendment before us does not repeal anything in \nthe Constitution; rather, it undoes the damage that five members of the \nSupreme Court have done to free and fair elections. By the way, money \nbuys speech, it is not speech. I urge my colleagues to support S.J. \nRes. 19.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Thank you, Madam President. Let me first say \nhow much I appreciate all of my colleagues coming to the floor and \ntalking about this amendment. Senator Hirono is here. I know Senator \nWhitehouse is coming down. A number of Senators have come down and \nspoken very eloquently. The Presiding Officer has also taken a good \nstrong position and we so much appreciate all of her good work.\n  An earlier speaker said that the NAACP is against this amendment. In \nfact, the NAACP is for this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a statement off \ntheir Web page of their endorsement of the constitutional amendment I \nam going to talk about.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          [From the NAACP.org]\n\n    Constitutional Amendment To Limit Corrupting Role of Big Money \n                  Contributions to Political Campaigns\n\n\n S.J. RES. 19/H.J. RES. 20, WOULD MAKE CLEAR THAT CONGRESS, INDIVIDUAL \n   STATES AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO MEANINGFULLY \n                       REGULATE CAMPAIGN FINANCE\n\n       It is no secret that the role of money in politics is ever \n     increasing, and that money plays a major role in who stands \n     for office, who wins, and, most critically, the eventual \n     public policy Congress enacts. With the decisions by the U.S. \n     Supreme Court in the 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election \n     Commission (FEC) and 2014 McCutcheon vs. FEC cases, the role \n     of big money, donated by wealthy corporations and \n     individuals, will only continue to grow.\n       Because it is becoming increasingly clear that income and \n     wealth inequality is rooted in political inequality, the \n     NAACP strongly supports several legislative initiatives--\n     including H.R. 20, the Government By the People Act, and S. \n     2023, the Fair Elections Now Act, which put voluntary curbs \n     on campaign spending. Together, these two bills are \n     comprehensive reform packages designed to combat the \n     influence of big money politics, raise civic engagement and \n     amplify the voices of everyday Americans.\n       Yet some have concerns about the voluntary nature of these \n     bills--candidates may opt out of participating and adhering \n     to limits on the amounts raised and spent Thus, in addition \n     to supporting the legislation, the NAACP supports a \n     constitutional amendment that would make clear that Congress, \n     individual states and the American people have the authority \n     to meaningfully regulate campaign finance and to restore \n     transparency and safeguard the role of individual\n\n[[Page S5420]]\n\n     voices in our elections. The constitutional amendment has \n     been proposed by Senator Tom Udall (NM) (S.J. Res. 19) and in \n     the House of Representatives by Congressman Jim McGovern (MA) \n     (H.J. Res. 20).\n       Amending the Constitution is hard--and it should be. But it \n     is not impossible. Already 16 states and hundreds of local \n     governments across the country have called on Congress to \n     take action, showing strong public support for reform from \n     all sides of the political spectrum. Furthermore, supporters \n     of a Constitutional amendment have been promised a vote by \n     the full Senate on S.J. Res. 19 before the end of the year.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Some of our opponents have come down to the floor and asked: Why do \nthis now? Why bother? I would answer: Ask the American people. I think \nthey will tell you. People are listening--not just Democrats but \nRepublicans too--all across the Nation. They are listening and here is \nwhat they are hearing. They are hearing that the Supreme Court has put \na for sale sign on our elections. They are hearing our political \nprocess is on life support, drowning in cash, and most of it coming \nfrom just a few people.\n  Sixty percent of all super PAC money in 2012 was doled out by 100 \nbillionaires and corporations. They are hearing about elections bought \nand paid for by shadowy outside groups given a green light by the \nSupreme Court. Special interests are shelling out at least $216 million \nin 2014 and likely $1 billion by election day. That is 15 times more \nmoney than in 2006 before Citizens United, before the Supreme Court \ndefied common sense and said corporations are people. They are hearing \nthat a lot of money is hidden when over half the money spent in this \nyear's top nine Senate races is not fully disclosed, over half not \nfully disclosed. So in 2 months we will know the outcome of these \nelections, but we will not know who paid for them.\n  The result is not surprising. The American people have lost faith in \nus as they watch this merry-go-round, this constant money chasing, and \nvery little else getting done. This is a vital debate about what \ndemocracy we will have and whether democracy will survive. Will we have \none that caters to billionaires and the privileged few or one that \nlistens to the American people; one that keeps chasing money from \nspecial interests or one that says it is the quality of our ideas, not \nthe size of our bank accounts, that should matter; a democracy that \nanswers to the middle class or to the moneyed class?\n  This debate is crucial. This debate is absolutely crucial to the \nfuture of our country, and I believe the American people are not only \nlistening, they are demanding to be heard, because every voice counts, \nand that is why the majority of Americans support reform. They know the \nsystem is broken.\n  There is only one way to truly fix it. Give power back to the elected \nrepresentatives of the people, to the Congress, and to the States. We \nhave a job to do, but the Supreme Court has rendered us powerless to do \nit. There is one way to change this, one way for real reform; that is, \na constitutional amendment.\n  That is what this debate is all about. The Supreme Court opened the \nfloodgates. The American people want us to close them.\n  The Huffington Post published an article yesterday titled ``Is \nWashington The Only Place Where Campaign Finance Is A Partisan Issue?'' \nThe answer is yes. Poll after poll shows this.\n  A strong majority of Democrats and Republicans outside of Washington \nwant reform, Republicans such as my good friend former Senator Al \nSimpson from Wyoming. Yesterday The Hill published an op-ed that Al and \nI wrote together. As most people know, he has always been someone to \nspeak his mind. When Al edited our draft he added that ``the playing \nfield in our democracy is far from level, and that is driving cynicism, \ndisgust, and mistrust of the political process to dangerous levels.''\n  Sadly, he is right. It is time for us to listen to our constituents. \nOver 3 million people have signed petitions in support of a \nconstitutional amendment. There are 16 States, over 550 cities and \ntowns pushing for reform, demanding a more level playing field and \nfairness, including 75 percent of the voters in Montana, a State where \nMitt Romney won by a 10-point margin. So this is a partisan issue only \nin Washington and in the backrooms of billionaires determined to keep \nthe money flowing and the influence intact.\n  So opponents have ramped up the noise and distraction about the First \nAmendment and free speech. I would not lose any sleep about \nbillionaires and their free speech, but a lot of us are up late nights \nthinking about the rest of America.\n  As Justice Breyer wrote in his dissent to McCutcheon, ``Where enough \nmoney calls the tune, the general public will not be heard.'' Too many \nAmericans feel they are not being heard. The First Amendment has \nalready been hijacked. Our amendment rescues it.\n  Congress has a long history of regulating campaign finance, of doing \nits job and standing up to Big Money and powerful interests. We can go \nall the way back to 1867, and later with the Pendleton Act, the Hatch \nAct, the Bipartisan Campaign Act of 2002--a long history and I would \nargue an honorable one, and without banning books, suppressing \nteachers, suppressing preachers or shutting down newspapers. Reforms \nhave been modest, reasonable, and responsive, passed by both Houses of \nCongress, signed by the President.\n  The other side can talk about imaginary horribles. That is one way to \ngo. But that argument is not supported by history, by logic or by the \nlaw. Our amendment is not radical. It is a simple idea. It will give \npower back to the elected representatives of the people, to Congress, \nand to the States. That is it, period.\n  What is so terrifying about this? Not one thing, except for wealthy \nspecial interests that have their place at the table bought and paid \nfor and want to keep it. That is the bottom line. They oppose any \nreforms, any restrictions on campaign spending. They are listening too. \nTheir message is very clear and unyielding: No reform. None. They want \nto keep writing their checks and staying at the head of the table.\n  This debate is about special interests trying to buy elections in \nsecret with no limits. The Supreme Court says that is just fine. We \nsay, no, in fact, it isn't. Our amendment has a long bipartisan \ntradition back to 1983 when Senator Ted Stevens, a Republican, was the \nlead sponsor. It is common sense. It is fair.\n  We do not dictate specific reforms. We do say Congress has a duty and \na right to enact sensible campaign finance reform. Any specific \nproposals are debatable and answerable to the American people. This \namendment has the support of most Americans because they understand \nbeyond all the noise, beyond all the tortured logic of our opponents \nthat we have a train wreck and we need to get the train back on track \nbefore yet another scandal, before we are back in the Watergate era.\n\n  The voice of Americans should not be drowned out by billionaires \nlobbying for favors, hiding in the corner with gold-plated megaphones. \nIt is time to limit the power of Big Money, to give everyone a say, not \njust the rich, not just the powerful--everyone.\n  Americans are listening, they are watching, and they are waiting \nbecause they know and we know a simple truth: We cannot hand over our \ndemocracy to the biggest spender.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the op-ed I \nmentioned authored by myself and Senator Simpson and that the \nHuffington Post article I referenced be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From thehill.com, Sept. 8, 2014]\n\n   Bipartisan Case for a Constitutional Amendment on Campaign Finance\n\n   (By Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) and former Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wy.))\n\n       Following recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions dismantling \n     our nation's campaign finance laws, all Americans are \n     certainly not equal on Election Day. With 5-4 split \n     decisions, the court has given corporations the ability to \n     spend unlimited money to persuade voters, and also declared \n     limits on large donations to be the equivalent of \n     infringement on speech. The result is an electoral system in \n     which a billionaire can influence elections across the \n     country, while regular voters have just one shot--by casting \n     a single ballot.\n       This is surely not the equality as envisioned by our \n     founders, who would be appalled by corporate spending in \n     elections and unlimited personal donations by billionaires. \n     The solution is to clarify the Constitution so that the \n     people may decide how, when and why to regulate campaign \n     finance. This\n\n[[Page S5421]]\n\n     week, the Senate will vote to begin debate on a \n     constitutional amendment which now has the support of nearly \n     half the Senate, 16 states and over 550 municipalities, \n     including large cities like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago \n     and Philadelphia--all of whom are sick of out-of-control \n     spending in elections and disturbed at the direction the \n     court has taken.\n       The original and honest intent of our campaign finance laws \n     is to rein in the culture of money in politics and ensure \n     that a few donors can't buy an election by spending to \n     benefit one candidate over another. They are rooted in the \n     public's disgust with political corruption. Yet the court's \n     rulings indicate we are headed back to that pre-Watergate era \n     of corruption. We were troubled that Chief Justice Roberts \n     wrote in the McCutcheon decision that quid pro quo \n     corruption--bribery--is the only sufficient justification for \n     Congress to pass regulations. As a result, we are likely to \n     see new challenges against laws that limit the amount an \n     individual may contribute to a candidate, or laws prohibiting \n     contributions to candidates from corporations. The largest \n     corporations are multi-national organizations worth hundreds \n     of billions of dollars and the Supreme Court is leaving us \n     with no way to set reasonable standards.\n       McCutcheon is the most recent case, but there is a history \n     of the court narrowly overturning reasonable campaign finance \n     laws. In 2010, Citizens United v. FEC gave free speech rights \n     to corporations and special interests. But this problem goes \n     all the way back to 1976, when the court held in Buckley v. \n     Valeo that restricting independent campaign expenditures \n     violates the First Amendment right to free speech. In effect, \n     the court said money and speech are the same thing.\n       This is tortured logic that leads to an unacceptable \n     result--that a citizen's access to a constitutional right is \n     dependent on his or her net worth. A result that says the \n     wealthy get to shout, but the rest of you may only whisper.\n       The constitutional amendment would make it clear that \n     campaign finance regulations are up to voters who elect \n     Congress and state legislatures. It would not dictate any \n     specific policies or regulations, but instead would protect \n     sensible and workable campaign finance laws from \n     constitutional challenges.\n       Critics have claimed that the amendment would repeal the \n     First Amendment's free speech protections. But it does the \n     exact opposite--the proposal is an effort to restore the \n     First Amendment so that it applies equally to all Americans. \n     When a few billionaires can drown out the voices of millions \n     of Americans, we can't have any real political debate.\n       The amendment would not simply benefit one party or \n     incumbent. It is similar to bipartisan proposals introduced \n     in nearly every Congress since 1983, when Republican Sen. Ted \n     Stevens (Alaska) was the lead sponsor. Over the years, it has \n     been supported by many Republicans, including Sens. John \n     McCain (Ariz.), Thad Cochran (Miss.), Arlen Specter (Pa.), \n     and Nancy Kassebaum (Kan.), as well as many Democrats.\n       In April, retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens \n     said in his testimony before the Senate Rules Committee that \n     campaign finance regulations ``should create a level playing \n     field . . . to give rival candidates--irrespective of their \n     political party and incumbency status--an equal opportunity \n     to persuade citizens to vote for them.'' Most Americans would \n     agree with Justice Stevens. However, until the Constitution \n     is amended, such laws would be struck down by the current \n     court.\n       The national debate should not be dictated by a handful of \n     wealthy individuals and corporations. After the McCutcheon \n     decision wealthy donors can, and many will, contribute up to \n     $3.6 million in an election cycle. For an average person \n     making minimum wage, it would take 239 years to make that \n     much money. The playing field in our democracy is far from \n     level, and that is driving cynicism, disgust and mistrust of \n     the political process to dangerous levels.\n       Over the course of our Senate careers, spending on \n     campaigns has gotten out of control. According to a joint \n     study by Brookings and the American Enterprise Institute, \n     outside groups spent $457 million to influence Senate and \n     House races in 2012. In the 1978 election, when Senator \n     Simpson was first elected, outside groups spent only \n     $303,000. There is a deeply troubling trend here, and we \n     cannot let it continue.\n       Amending the Constitution is difficult--as it should be--\n     but it is long past time to have an honest and thoughtful \n     national dialogue about our broken electoral process and how \n     we voters can fix it.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Huffington Post, Sept. 8, 2014]\n\n   Is Washington the Only Place Where Campaign Finance Is a Partisan \n                                 Issue?\n\n                          (By Paul Blumenthal)\n\n       Washington.--The Senate voted Monday to debate a \n     constitutional amendment overturning the Supreme Court's 2010 \n     Citizens United decision and allowing Congress and the states \n     to enhance limits on the amount of money raised and spent in \n     elections. The proposed amendment is nearly universally \n     supported by Democrats and opposed by Republicans.\n       Division over the role of money in politics, however, is \n     far less severe among the broader populace. In fact, the \n     majority of Americans in both parties say they think there is \n     too much big money in politics and support the rationale \n     offered by amendment proponents as a reason to amend the \n     Constitution.\n       The amendment up for Senate debate would roll back Supreme \n     Court rulings on campaign finance from the 1976 Buckley v. \n     Valeo decision that first applied First Amendment free speech \n     protection to money raised and spent in elections. That \n     decision allowed Congress to limit contributions, but held \n     that spending limits were a burden on spenders' free speech \n     rights.\n       Americans appear to broadly disagree that money used in \n     political campaigns should be protected by the First \n     Amendment.\n       In February 2013, 55 percent of respondents to a HuffPost/\n     YouGov poll said they did not consider ``money given to \n     political candidates to be a form of free speech protected by \n     the First Amendment to the Constitution.'' Just 23 percent \n     agreed that campaign contributions were a form of free \n     speech.\n       That poll touches only on the issue of campaign \n     contributions. The main issue supporters of the \n     constitutional amendment have with the Buckley decision and \n     subsequent court rulings is the full free speech rights \n     granted to campaign spending.\n       A Gallup poll taken in June 2013 found that 79 percent \n     supported limiting both the amounts politicians can raise and \n     the amounts they can spend. This was supported at almost \n     equal rates by Democrats, Republicans and independents, and \n     in every part of the country.\n       There also are a handful of polls commissioned by groups \n     campaigning for the amendment that asked more specific \n     questions. In one such poll, the reform group Public Citizen \n     released findings in August showing 55 percent in support of \n     a constitutional amendment to overturn the Citizens United \n     decision. Support topped so percent for Democrats, \n     Republicans and independents.\n       The divide between Republican voters and their \n     representatives in Washington also can be seen at the state \n     and local levels. The pro-amendment group Free Speech For \n     People has compiled a list of 137 current and former state \n     Republican officials who support an amendment to enhance \n     limits on campaign finance.\n       This list includes a number of Republican officials who \n     voted for resolutions in support of an amendment to overturn \n     Citizens United and establish other limits to campaign \n     finance. Overall, 16 states have backed resolutions calling \n     for an amendment.\n       In Colorado and Montana, the resolutions were sent to the \n     electorate as ballot initiatives in 2012. In both states--one \n     a tossup in presidential elections, the other solid red--more \n     than 70 percent of voters approved the resolutions. In both \n     states, the amendment outpolled both President Barack Obama, \n     the victor in Colorado, and Mitt Romney, who won Montana.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, may I ask that at the conclusion of \nSenator Walsh's remarks I be recognized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. WALSH. I rise to speak in support of S.J. Res. 19, a \nconstitutional amendment that would give both States and Congress the \npower to undo the damage caused by Citizens United and restore our \nDemocratic traditions.\n  Passing this amendment is vital if we are going to begin to roll back \nthe coercive influence of money in our democracy. Because of the \nSupreme Court's decision in Citizens United, political power has become \nincreasingly concentrated in the hands of corporations and modern-day \ncopper kings. In fact, less than 1 percent of Americans provide over \ntwo-thirds of the money spent on elections. The voices of everyday \nAmericans are simply being silenced.\n  In Montana we have seen firsthand the damage to the process. Turn-of-\nthe-century mining companies made rich off the copper seams in Butte, \nMT, my hometown, bought up the State press and bought off the State \nlegislature. In response to these abuses, Montana banned corporate \npolitical spending by citizen initiative over 100 years ago. However, \nthe recent Supreme Court's Citizens United decision overturned this \ncentury-old protection in an instant, silencing Montanans' voices with \ndark, secretive money and corporate political spending.\n  Montana's experience with the Butte copper kings shows that corporate \npolitical spending, even if it is supposedly independent, corrupts the \npolitical process. We cannot let anonymous, unaccountable corporate \nspending drown out the voices of everyday Americans. When the voices of \nindividual voters become less relevant to politicians, policy decisions \nare divorced from the folks they impact.\n  We simply cannot allow a dysfunctional system of campaign finance to \neliminate our government's responsiveness to its citizens or its \nability to tax our most pressing issues. Montana's history should be \nlearned from, and it is our responsibility to ensure it never happens \nagain.\n\n[[Page S5422]]\n\n  That is why this amendment is so important to the American people. In \n2012 Montana voters overwhelmingly directed the congressional \ndelegation to work to overturn Citizens United to get corporate money \nout of politics. I have heard from thousands of Montanans that they \nwant Congress to refocus on issues that are important to them, to come \ntogether and to do our jobs. Passing this amendment will help us do \njust that.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, before I given my ``Time to Wake \nUp'' speech, I want to react to something that was said on the Senate \nfloor about this joint resolution to correct the error of Citizens \nUnited. What was said on the floor was that the position of those of us \nwho support this joint resolution and who think Citizens United was \nwrongly decided, that our position is an attack on the First Amendment, \nthat we are attacking the First Amendment. That may have some \nrhetorical utility, but it is simply not accurate.\n  The very question we are here to answer is whether the First \nAmendment properly allows unlimited corporate spending. It never did. \nIt never did until Citizens United came along. So the question before \nthis body is, Was Citizens United correctly decided?\n  To say we are attacking the First Amendment is to presume that \nCitizens United was correctly decided. You don't win an argument by \npresuming you are right; you win an argument by making the case why you \nare right.\n\n  Frankly, I have great reverence for the First Amendment, and I think \nit is extremely unfortunate that an argument would be made that is \nreally nothing more than a rhetorical trick and does not respond to the \ngravamen of the dispute, which is whether the First Amendment should \nprotect unlimited corporate spending when in the history of this \ncountry--until the decision by Citizens United--it never had.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Aaron Goldner\n\n  Before I continue, I wish to express my gratitude to Dr. Aaron \nGoldner. He has been instrumental in helping me research and prepare \nthe ``Time to Wake Up'' speeches, and his fellowship in my office came \nto an end yesterday.\n  Aaron earned his Ph.D. in Earth, atmospheric, and planetary sciences \nat Purdue University. He came to my office as an American member of the \nGeophysical Union Congressional Science Fellow, whose research \nspecialty was the development of sophisticated models to help build \ngreater understanding of the past, present, and future effects of \ncarbon pollution on our climate.\n  He lent his considerable scientific expertise and analysis to these \nfloor speeches. He also did research for legislation and prepared for \nhearings in the Environment and Public Works Committee. Since we \napparently somehow were not keeping him busy enough, he managed to find \nthe time to publish a peer-reviewed article over the summer in the \nprestigious journal Nature on the climatic conditions surrounding the \norigination of the Antarctic ice cap.\n  Aaron said this week as he left that he gained a sense of humor \nworking here, which is probably fitting for a scientist having to deal \nwith this body in its present state.\n  I gained the benefit of Aaron's hard work and gracious spirit, and \nthe Senate and the American people gained the benefit of Aaron's \npassion for bringing the best scientific thinking to address our \ngreatest challenges.\n  Aaron is now taking his talents to the Department of Energy, where he \nwill continue to help our government tackle these important questions. \nI am grateful for his service in my office and wish him the best \nsuccess.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  The 113th Congress is now winding down, an election is upon us that \nwill decide the makeup of the next Congress, and I am here for the 77th \ntime to say it is time for my Republican colleagues to wake up to the \nthreat of climate change both for the good of our country and our world \nand ultimately for the good of their own party. No political party can \nlong remain a credible force in our democracy if their position on one \nof the defining threats of our time is to deny its existence or to \nplead total ignorance about it. ``I am not a scientist,'' some have \nbegun to say. Well, when it comes to interfering with women's rights, \nthey don't say, ``I am not a gynecologist.'' But when it is carbon \npollution, they say, ``I am not a scientist.'' Some would say that if \nyou are not a scientist, all the more reason to listen to the \nscientists.\n  Look at what the scientists are saying today. The top person at the \nWorld Meteorological Organization, which knows a little bit about this \narea, just said:\n\n       We know without any doubt that our climate is changing and \n     our weather is becoming more extreme due to human activities \n     such as the burning of fossil fuels.\n\n  Here is the point: ``I am not a scientist'' is not the stance of a \nparty that is ready to lead; it is the stance of a party that is \nbeholden to polluting interests, petrified of losing the millions in \npolluter campaign spending supporting their candidates.\n  We have heard over and over during the last 6 years that Republicans \nwant President Obama to lead. It is a familiar chorus: ``It is time to \nlead.'' ``Where is the leadership?'' ``Why isn't America leading?''\n  One of my Republican Senate colleagues put it this way:\n\n       Every American can agree that the light of peace and \n     liberty would benefit our world. But who will spread it if \n     not America? There is no other Nation that can, and that is \n     why, despite the challenges we face here at home, America \n     must continue to hold this torch. America must continue to \n     lead the way.\n\n  Well, on climate change we are finally leading the way thanks in \nlarge part to President Obama's Climate Action Plan and Secretary \nKerry's passionate efforts. Yet they criticize the Obama \nadministration's leadership on climate change because other countries, \nsuch as China and India, are also big carbon emitters. So Republicans \nwant America to lead except on climate change. On this one issue they \nwould prefer to await leadership from China or India. How convenient \nthat is when you think of all the polluter money funding the \nRepublicans and how badly out of step with America. Just look at the \nnumbers. A recent Wall Street Journal poll showed--notwithstanding \nyears of relentless polluter propaganda--that 61 percent of Americans \nagree that climate change is occurring and that action should be taken, \nand 67 percent of Americans support the administration's proposed rule \nto limit carbon pollution from powerplants.\n  Here is my personal favorite: A survey conducted for the League of \nConservation Voters found that more than half of young Republican \nvoters--to be specific, 53 percent of Republicans under the age of 35--\nwould describe a politician who denies climate change is happening as \n``ignorant,'' ``out of touch,'' or ``crazy.'' That is the young \nRepublican view of the Republican position on climate change.\n  On September 21 thousands of concerned Americans will converge on New \nYork City for what will be known as the People's Climate March. \nOrganizers expect that as many as half a million people will take part \nin this historic citizen action to call attention to the global crisis \nof climate change.\n\n  However you look at it, the American people are sending a message \nloud and clear: They want responsible leadership on carbon pollution. \nWhat is the Republican answer? Well, look at the House. Given control \nof the House, Republicans have already forced over 100 votes to \nundermine the EPA. That is even more times than they have voted to \nrepeal ObamaCare.\n  Paul Ryan, the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, \nsaid last week that the Republican strategy next year will be to send \nthe President bills they know he will veto, including approval of the \nKeystone XL tar sands crude pipeline, and thereby create ``shutdown by \nveto.''\n  Over here in the Senate, our Republican leader already threatens--if \nthe Republicans win the Senate--to force onto key legislation what he \ncalled ``a lot of restrictions on the activities of the bureaucracy.'' \nGee, what agency could he possibly mean? The threat is plain: Give the \nRepublicans polluter-backed, anti-environment legislation or they will \nshut down the government. Again. This is the Republican version of \nleadership.\n  What about out on the campaign trail? Republicans in Congress ignore \nthe public's call for climate action, but\n\n[[Page S5423]]\n\nare Republican candidates out there listening to the people or are they \nlistening to the polluters led by the infamous Koch brothers? Look at \nhow much money the polluters are spending on Republicans and take a \nwild guess. News flash: They are not listening to the people.\n  The Republican nominee for Senate in Iowa has said of climate change: \n``I'm skeptical. It's been changing since the dawn of time. I'm not \ngoing to blame it . . . on the human race.''\n  In New Hampshire the leading Republican Senate candidate recently \nsaid that he does not believe manmade climate change has been \nscientifically proven. Never mind that the underlying science was first \nmeasured back when Abraham Lincoln was President.\n  In North Carolina the Republican nominee has referred to climate \nchange as ``false science.''\n  Well, in the last year I visited Iowa and New Hampshire and North \nCarolina, and I saw firsthand how climate change is already affecting \nthose States. I heard over and over deep concern about climate change. \nI heard about cold-weather sports and tourism threatened by warming \ntemperatures in New Hampshire. I heard about crops threatened by \nshifting weather patterns and about how a booming wind power industry \nhas emerged in Iowa. In North Carolina I heard about homes and \nbusinesses and even air bases threatened by rising seas.\n  If you doubt me, go to the State universities in Iowa and New \nHampshire and North Carolina. They are not denying it. They are \nactively working on and warning about climate change. Iowa State has an \nentire climate science program and wants to be a ``leader in the \nscience of regional climate change.'' The University of New Hampshire \nscientists told me about the danger to New Hampshire's iconic moose \nfrom tick infestations because of climate change. Researchers from the \nUniversity of North Carolina, Duke University, and North Carolina State \ntook me out on a research vessel to see firsthand the effects of \nclimate change on North Carolina's shoreline. The home State \nuniversities are clear; it is just the polluter-funded candidates who \nare denying.\n  It is the same story across the country. Republicans running for the \nSenate, from Alaska to Georgia, from Colorado to West Virginia, \nquestion or outright deny the established climate science. Figure it \nout. Do the math. There is overwhelming consensus among knowledgeable \nscientists that climate change is real and being caused by humans. \nDenying that fact serves the economic interest of a narrow group of \nbig-spending polluters, and the polluters are spending vast fortunes to \nsupport climate deniers.\n  Senate Republican candidates even attended a secret retreat organized \nby the Koch brothers earlier this year and praised the Kochs' political \nnetwork for helping to support their campaign--the polluter political \nlifeline to the Republican Party.\n  A lot of blame here attaches to the Republicans' confederates on the \nSupreme Court--the five Republican-appointed Justices who kicked open \nthe floodgates of corporate special interest spending for Republicans \nin the disastrous Citizens United decision in January of 2010. With \nCitizens United in their pocket, the polluters went right to work.\n  By the 2012 election cycle, the Washington Post and the Center for \nResponsive Politics determined that a donor network organized by the \nKoch brothers spent $400 million to influence that election. This \ngraphic shows the complex apparatus the Koch brothers used to pull \nthose political strings.\n  In the 2014 election cycle, the government accountability group \nCommon Cause has tallied over $34 million in political donations \nalready from 30 of the country's largest oil, gas, coal, and utility \ncorporations. That does not include the dark money fossil fuel \ncorporations have given to political groups which do not disclose their \ndonors--groups such as the American Petroleum Institute, the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, the Koch brothers own so-called Americans for \nProsperity organization, or the secretive identity-laundering machine \nknown as the Donors Trust. We don't know how much these groups have \nactually raised or spent on election activities, but the Koch network \nis expected to spend nearly $300 million on the 2014 midterm elections.\n  The Center for Public Integrity reported last week that the Koch \nbrothers are sponsoring 10 percent of all ads in competitive Senate \nraces. That is more than 43,900 Senate ads between January 2013 and \nlast month. Americans for Prosperity alone--that Koch brothers \norganization--sponsored 27,000 ads. That is one in every 16 ads in all \nSenate races this cycle. And, of course, those polluter-funded ads make \nup way more than 10 percent of just the Republican ads. Why is that? \nBecause the focus of this apparatus is on Republicans, on buying and \nco-opting the Republican Party as the polluters' political instrument.\n  The numbers are staggering. Let's be clear about one thing: Their \nintention is not to add to constructive debate on carbon pollution and \nclimate change. The polluters are determined to silence meaningful \ndebate on the catastrophic effects of their carbon pollution, and it is \nworking. There was a lot of Republican activity on climate change until \nJanuary of 2010 when Citizens United was brought down. And after that, \nwe can't find carbon pollution activity on the Republican side. They \nhave been buried in the threats and the promises of that polluter \nfunding.\n  Well, climate denial may work for Republicans in the short run if it \nkeeps wide open that spigot of polluter money that is funding \nRepublican candidates. We will see how that works out. But no matter \nhow much money the polluters pour into the Republican Party, even a \nRepublican Senate cannot repeal the laws of science--of physics, of \nchemistry, of oceanography.\n  If they win the Senate, it is not just going to be time for them to \nwake up, it is going to be time for them to grow up. Being in the \nmajority means responsibility, not just obstruction and mischief. Being \nin the majority means answering your country and the world, not just \nyour polluter funding base. Being in the majority means hearing the \nvast majority of Americans who want U.S. leadership on climate change, \nnot telling voters the problem doesn't exist or that America should \nabdicate any responsibility for forging an international solution.\n  Our Republican colleagues will discover, if they don't know it \nalready--and many do know it already--that former Senator and Secretary \nof State Hillary Clinton was right when she recently called climate \nchange the ``most consequential, urgent, sweeping collection of \nchallenges we face as a nation and a world.''\n  Secretary Clinton went on to say:\n\n       The data is unforgiving no matter what the deniers try to \n     assert. . . . If we come together to make the hard choices, \n     the smart investment in infrastructure, technology and \n     environmental protection, America can be the clean energy \n     superpower of the 21st century. . . . This is about our \n     strategic position in the world, this is about our \n     competitiveness, our job creation, our economic growth as \n     well as dealing with a challenge that we ignore at our \n     detriment and our peril.\n\n  So the choice for Republicans stands before them: America as a clean \nenergy superpower, leading the world, or America bedeviled with \npolluter-fueled political gridlock and climate denial. Their choice so \nfar is obvious.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I wish to return to the discussion of \nthe constitutional amendment to restrict speech. I made considerable \ncomments yesterday, and there are some other comments I feel should be \nsaid about this--probably a dozen or more things. However, I wish to \nreturn to that discussion.\n  We have heard a lot in this debate about commercials. Everybody is \nconcerned about commercials--those 30-second ads that are driving \neverybody crazy, that everyone wants taken off the air, and that we \nwant to regulate and restrict and punish. We don't like them. No one \nlikes them. We want to make them go away.\n  Well, let's forget about the commercials for just a second. Let's \ntalk about the show. Does anybody watch the show? It sometimes seems as \nthough the only thing on TV that my colleagues care about are the \ncommercials about themselves. But there actually are other things on \nTV. There are actual programs that fill up the time between the \ncommercials. Let's talk about those.\n\n[[Page S5424]]\n\n  There is, of course, all sorts of programming on television: sports, \nmovies, sitcoms, reality shows. Pretty much everything--and I mean \neverything--is on TV now.\n  There are a lot of politics on TV. The politics come in a range of \nformats. It comes unvarnished on C-SPAN. It is delivered through news \nand commentary on cable channels. It is satirized and made fun of on \nthe late night shows. It appears in documentaries and feature films.\n  The Citizens United case itself was the result of a political film--a \nfilm about Hillary Clinton. During the litigation there were arguments \nover whether the film and its advertisements could be treated as \n``electioneering communications'' and, therefore, regulated and \nrestricted by campaign finance laws. In rendering its decision, the \nCourt properly saw, in my view, the film for what it was: An \nencouragement for people to vote against Hillary Clinton. This is what \nthe Court said in its holding: The movie, in essence, is a feature-\nlength negative advertisement that urges viewers to vote against then-\nSenator Clinton for President. In light of this historical footage, \ninterviews with persons critical of her, and voiceover narration, the \nfilm would be understood by most viewers as an extended criticism of \nthe Senator's character and her fitness for the Office of the \nPresidency. The narrative may contain more suggestions and arguments \nthan facts, but there is little doubt that the thesis of the film is \nthat she is unfit for the Presidency.\n  Then the Court went on to say:\n\n       The narrator reminds viewers that Americans have never been \n     keen on dynasties and that a vote for Hillary is a vote to \n     continue 20 years of a Bush or a Clinton in the White \n     House.\n\n  Then the Court found this:\n\n       There is no reasonable interpretation of Hillary other than \n     as an appeal to vote against Senator Clinton. The film \n     qualifies as the functional equivalent of express advocacy.\n\n  Having made that determination, the question then becomes, Should the \ngovernment be able to prevent it from being seen? The court held the \nanswer to that question was no and struck down as unconstitutional the \nlaws that would prevent or constrain the distribution of the film.\n  My colleagues on the other side want those laws to be put back in \nplace. They believe the government should be able to control the \ncontent, the financing, the distribution of films that reference \ncandidates for office, and they are pushing this constitutional \namendment to make that possible.\n  Now, we can expect there will be a lot more about Hillary Clinton on \nTV over the next couple of years. Some of it will be favorable and some \nof it will be unfavorable. Thanks to the Citizens United decision, the \ngovernment won't be able to control what is said about her or any other \npotential candidate for the presidency--either party.\n  My colleagues do not have much to worry about when it comes to \nprogramming about Hillary Clinton. I don't think they need to worry \nabout the show. They know there are a small number of conservative film \nmakers who will attack her and whatever they produce is unlikely to \nreach a wide audience.\n  On the other hand, there is a huge multitude of liberal film \nproducers, directors, and writers who like--if not love--Hillary \nClinton and want to see her get elected to the Presidency, and they \nwill do whatever they can to help her achieve that goal.\n  Secretary Clinton's recent book tour provided a good preview of the \nkind of programming we can expect to see more of should she decide to \nrun for President. And luckily for her, there are plenty of television \npersonalities who will help her sell herself to Americans, not just her \nbook.\n  For example, one recent appearance on the Stephen Colbert show was \nclearly designed to soften her image. In an extended segment that could \nbe seen as either amusing or nauseating, depending on your perspective, \nColbert conducted a phony interview designed to show his viewers how \nsmart and funny Hillary Clinton is.\n  Of course, Colbert can do whatever he wants with his show. No one \nquestions that. But it should be obvious that the show amounts to a \ncorporate-financed and political expenditure. Everything on the show--\nthe studio, the host, the equipment, the writers, the director, the \ncameraman--everything is paid for by a corporation. Is there anyone in \nthe Chamber who thinks that a corporation doesn't have the right to do \nthat? Of course not. They like the show. And those on the other side \nknow they can expect all sorts of similar programming in the months and \nyears ahead. That doesn't bother them.\n  But the commercials are a different story. What if someone wanted to \nbuy a 30-second ad during the show to present an alternative \nperspective. Well, we can't have that, can we? That would be \nintolerable. It would present a threat to our democracy. We have to \namend the Constitution to prevent that. The absurdity is evident.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle think our First \nAmendment allows one sort of programming to have unrestricted and \nunhindered access to the media, while other sorts must be limited and \nconstrained. I submit that is preposterous.\n  In our system of government, all voices have the right to be heard. \nThe First Amendment gives them that right. There is so much nonsense in \nthis debate about buying elections and drowning out voices. We have a \nsystem that allows all voices to be heard, even those that oppose the \nmajority. That is not the antithetical to democracy; it is the essence \nof democracy.\n  So it is time, it seems to me, to stop pretending that allowing more \nvoices to be heard somehow poses a danger just because we don't like \nwhat they are saying.\n  Elections can't be bought. Voters will decide who wins them. They \nwill make that decision based on what they think of the candidates, and \nwhat they think will be based on what they see and hear of the \ncandidates. Then they will vote. When they do so, their vote will be \nequal to that of every other citizen. It doesn't matter how rich they \nare or what they do for a living or whether they even have their own TV \nshow or never even watch TV. Every citizen gets one vote.\n  As they make their decision about how we are going to cast it, we \nneed to make sure they are able to hear all voices. That is what the \nFirst Amendment does. It ensures that all voices have the right to be \nheard, and we don't need to change it to make that happen.\n  Those who are pushing this constitutional amendment don't want more \nvoices to be heard, they want less.\n  There should never be any confusion about the intent of this \nconstitutional amendment. It is to allow this majority to pass laws \nthat will silence their opponents and ignores all the pious claims \nabout the grand intent to recognize it for what it is--a cynical \nattempt to protect themselves from criticism.\n  Don't be fooled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, one man, one woman, one American, one \nvote--that is what the writers of our Constitution put in the \nConstitution--not one corporation, one vote.\n  What I hear on the Senate floor today and yesterday from those \ncandidates who seem to rely on corporate money, who are the \nbeneficiaries of a showering of--not thousands, not tens of thousands, \nnot hundreds of thousands, not millions--tens of millions of dollars, \ncandidates who benefit from the showering of tens of millions of \ndollars for their campaigns, what they are saying on this Senate floor \nis almost laughable.\n  It would be laughable if it weren't so serious. It would be laughable \nif it didn't contribute to the corruption of this institution, of this \ngovernment of which we are so proud--``of the people, by the people, \nfor the people''--one man, one American, one vote.\n  With Citizens United, with McCutcheon the Supreme Court has \neffectively ruled the more money you have, the more influence you have \nover our democracy.\n  When what I hear from the other side--again, those who are the \nbeneficiaries of the millions, of the tens of millions of corporate \ndollars, often Wall Street, often oil companies, often big drug \ncompanies, often big tobacco companies--when they come to the floor and \nplead, they are pleading in many ways that the supporters of this \nconstitutional amendment are restricting the right to free speech. I \nagree.\n\n[[Page S5425]]\n\nWhether it is the Koch brothers, whether it is the Big Tobacco \nexecutives, they should get one vote.\n  But when they can spend millions and millions of dollars and shower \nsome of my colleagues with this kind of corporate money to get their \nway, we know what is happening in this country. We know for the richest \n1 percent of this country incomes have grown and grown, gone up and up.\n  We know for the broad middle, for the bottom 90 percent, for the \nmiddle, for the great majority of people in this country, their wages \nhave been flat. No, they have actually been worse than flat over the \npast 20 years.\n  The wealthy are getting extraordinarily wealthy, extraordinarily \nwealthier. The middle class, even sort of the upper middle class--let \nalone those who are making minimum wage or making $15 an hour, their \nwages have been stagnant or worse.\n  One reason for that is--the Presiding Officer from Massachusetts has \nspoken out about this nationally over and over again--one of the \nreasons wages have been flat in this country--and the rich are getting \nricher and richer--is the corruption of Big Money in our political \nsystem.\n  I know how it works. In my race for reelection in 2012--and I am not \ncomplaining about this. As my wife's book publisher said: No whining on \nthe yacht. If you get to be in the Senate, don't complain. But I also \nunderstand when they spent $42 million against me in my campaign--I am \na big boy, I can take it--it was oil money, it was tobacco money, it \nwas mostly out-of-State money. It was money from some of the richest \npeople in the United States of America.\n  What did they want? They didn't dislike me personally, I assume. \nMaybe they did. I don't really care. But what it was really about is \nthey wanted--whether the person came from Troy, OH, or Troy, MI, or \nTroy, NY--a politician in office from Ohio, as they wanted in \nMassachusetts, as they want this year in New Hampshire, as they want \nthis year in Arkansas, as they want this year in Kansas, as they want \nthis year in North Carolina, in Louisiana, Alaska, and Colorado--they \nwant a lap dog. They want somebody who will go to the well and vote \nwith Big Tobacco, go to the well and vote for Wall Street, and go to \nthe well and vote for oil companies.\n  That is what they will get if we continue this corrupt way of \ncampaign financing.\n  The Presiding Officer remembers--after we passed the Dodd-Frank \nlegislation in this Congress 4 years ago and when she was working to \nestablish a consumer protection agency--after the vote on Dodd-Frank, \ndo we remember what the leading financial services lobbyist in this \ntown said? The President signed the bill--within an hour or two, or at \nleast the same day--and the lobbyist said: Well, folks, it is half-\ntime.\n\n  What did that mean? He wasn't talking about the NFL. He was talking \nabout: Well, we lost in Congress. They actually passed a bill that Wall \nStreet wasn't wild about. They actually passed a bill that the largest \nfinancial institutions were not particularly happy about, but they knew \nthey could use their lobbying, and they have thousands of lobbyists in \nthis town.\n  They have a number of lobbyists for every Member of Congress. They \nknew they could use their lobbying force.\n  They knew they could use the politicians they had--I won't say people \nhere were bought, but you might suggest they are on a long-term lease \nin some cases. They were suggesting just the threat of spending money.\n  So if you cast a vote in this institution next week, let's say, on a \ncontroversial issue, we know a couple of things. You know you should do \nthe right thing. You know what your constituents back in Florida, \nMassachusetts or Ohio are saying, but you also know one other thing. \nYou know if you cast a vote that Wall Street might not like, if you \ncast a vote that Big Tobacco might not like, if you cast a vote that \noil companies may not like, do you know what is going to happen? What \nis in your mind if they come to your State in the next election and \nspend $10 million or $20 million or $30 million or $40 million.\n  I had $40 million spent against me because I don't do what Wall \nStreet wants. I don't do what tobacco wants. I don't do what the oil \nindustry wants. Of course, they are going to come after me.\n  They fell short in 2012--not by much but they fell short. But we know \nthey will do it again. We know every time we cast a vote they are \nkeeping a scorecard and saying: Well, we like what that Senator did, we \nwill help him or her--usually him in that case. We don't like what she \ndid, we don't like what he did, so we may be looking out to spend that \nkind of money. One man, one woman, one American, one vote--not one \ncorporation, one vote.\n  Fortune 500 companies straddle the globe. They reap millions of \ndollars of profits. American corporations are at their most profitable \ntime perhaps in their history sitting on tens, hundreds of millions of \ndollars in profit.\n  It doesn't take a Ph.D. in math to understand they spent a small, \nsmall, microfraction of the money they are making to protect those \nprofits.\n  How do they do it? They come to Ohio, they come to Massachusetts, \nthey come to Florida, they come anywhere in the country and they spend \nmillions. They spend tens of millions to protect themselves on behalf \nof Wall Street, on behalf of Big Oil, on behalf of these big tobacco \ncompanies. It is all pretty simple: one man, one woman, one American, \none vote.\n  Citizens United and McCutcheon make clear there is now an entry fee \nfor participating in our democracy. That is why I support the \nconstitutional amendment proposed by Senator Udall that curbs unlimited \ncampaign spending: one man, one woman, one American.\n  This amendment grants Congress the authority to regulate and limit \nthe raising and spending of money. We are not shutting anybody off. \nAnybody can still give fairly significant amounts of money. But we do \nknow--do the math. After the McCutcheon decision, donors can now \ncontribute up to $3.6 million an election cycle.\n  I don't know for sure, because I have not met most of the 300 million \npeople in our country, but I don't think there are all that many that \nhave the wherewithal financially to contribute $3.6 million. But I also \nknow--because my staff did the math on this one, I acknowledge--the \naverage person making minimum wage at $7.25 an hour--and, \nparenthetically, the same people who love McCutcheon love the millions \nof dollars spent, showered on us from Wall Street or against us from \nWall Street, from Big Tobacco or from Big Oil. Those same people are \nstopping the minimum wage from being increased.\n  The minimum wage is at its lowest level in buying power since 1968. \nIt has been stuck at $7.25 an hour.\n  Back in the era of bipartisanship on minimum wage--we actually passed \none in 2007, my first year in the Senate, signed by Republican \nPresident Bush. Those days seem to be past.\n  Think about the math. At $7.25 an hour, people are allowed to give \n$3.6 million under the McCutcheon decision--pushed by corporations and \nhanded down by the Supreme Court--that says corporations are people \ntoo, more or less.\n  For a minimum wage worker, it would take 239 years, working full \ntime, making $7.25 an hour, to make $3.6 million. And then they would \nhave to give it all away in that election cycle to be able to compete \nwith the oil companies, the drug companies, and Big Tobacco and Wall \nStreet.\n  This is very clear. We can change it.\n  Again, back to the arguments on the other side. They are laughable at \nhome. I don't think I know anybody who thinks it is OK that we are \nallowing somebody to come in and spend--except for colleagues whom I \nlike. Most of the people on the other side of this issue, I like them \npersonally, but I don't know very many people, unless they are in \nWashington, unless they have a stake in this system--I don't know \npeople who think it is a great idea to let people spend $3.6 million. \nThey are not spending it out of their charitable whims. They are \nspending it because they want their people, their water boys, their \nwater girls for the drug companies, the water boys and the water girls \nfor Wall Street, the water boys and the water girls for Big Tobacco, \nthey want those people elected, not people who will stand up to those \ninterest groups and do the right thing.\n  To restore voters' faith in the political system, to ensure voters \nthat their voices are being heard, one man, one\n\n[[Page S5426]]\n\nwoman, one American, one vote, that is what we stand for. Those are our \nvalues. That is why this is an important issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN.

Madam President, Vermont has always been a farming State, \nand it is the dairy, livestock, vegetable, and fruit farms to which we \nowe thanks for the open pastures and spectacular vistas that Vermonters \nand all those who visit our State cherish. None is more beautiful than \nMeeting House Farm in Norwich, owned by Deb and Jay Van Arman. The \nfarm, located on a hill outside of the village, with an expansive view \ndown the beautiful Connecticut River Valley, has been in the family \nsince Deb's and her brother David Pierce's grandparents arrived in a \nSears, Roebuck & Company wagon from Quechee in 1914.\n  On Saturday, August 2, Deb, Jay and David hosted a centennial reunion \nfor a grateful crowd of family and friends who came from as far as \nCalifornia, Holland and South America. The reunion was a celebration of \nfarming, family, and community for those who grew up on or visited the \nfarm over the years. They shared stories of haying and collecting maple \nsap with Deb and David's father ``Bub,'' riding the tractor and \ncollecting eggs, and sitting around the kitchen table sharing one of \ntheir mother Janet's bountiful meals. Janet ran a day care at the farm \nfor local children and later became Norwich's beloved town clerk.\n  The dairy herd was sold in the 1980s, but the haying goes on. There \nare goats and Deb's big vegetable garden, and half a dozen Holstein \ncows from another farm graze the hillside. Meeting House Farm \nrepresents the best of Vermont, and we owe a debt of gratitude to the \nPierce-Van Arman family for keeping it a farm all these years.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article about the centennial on the \nfront page of the August 3rd Valley News be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From The Valley News, Aug. 3, 2014]\n\n A Century of Farming in Norwich: Family Members Flock From Around the \n                       World To Mark Anniversary\n\n                           (By Aimee Caruso)\n\n       Norwich.--A Norwich family marked 100 years of farm life \n     yesterday with hayrides, games and dinner, photographs, \n     storytelling and socializing.\n       Meeting House Farm, owned by Jay and Deb Van Arman, has \n     been in the family for a century, and the trend is set to \n     continue into the future.\n       Yesterday, however, was all about celebrating the crop of \n     longtime friendships and family bonds the Union Village Road \n     farm has produced over the decades. Wearing name tags, people \n     of all ages mingled yesterday, snacking and sharing memories. \n     Milling near a table laden with pies, candy-studded cookies \n     and other goodies, they described the farm as a warm and \n     lively place.\n       Jeff Bradley, who grew up just down the road, was in 4-H \n     with the Van Armans' children and spent many days on the \n     farm, tossing hay bales and collecting sap for maple syrup. \n     He longingly recalled the yeast doughnuts and dill pickles, \n     both of which were eaten dipped in maple syrup, made by Deb's \n     late mother, Janet. And he remembered something else that \n     left a big impression on him.\n       ``No matter what, you stopped by and they had time for \n     you,'' said Bradley, who now lives in Massachusetts with his \n     family. ``Time for a story, time to sit down and have \n     coffee.''\n       People have always dropped in and visited the farm, said \n     Deb Van Arman, seated under a large white tent set up for the \n     occasion. ``It's been important to encourage that so we have \n     a sense of community. We have that, and we're very \n     grateful.''\n       Yesterday's gathering, months in the making, drew about 240 \n     people from across the country and beyond, including 26 of 27 \n     first cousins. The 27th wanted to come, but couldn't make it \n     because his wife was sick, Deb Van Arman explained.\n       The Van Armans' children and their families came in from \n     New York state, Chile and Holland. One family friend came \n     from Taipei, Taiwan; others made the trip from Hamburg, \n     Germany. In addition to relatives, the group included people \n     who had worked on the farm, neighbors, and former neighbors, \n     ``people who have helped us over the years,'' Deb said, \n     choking up. ``It's just great.''\n       Some spent the night on the farm; others bunked with \n     neighbors who had opened their houses for the occasion and \n     provided food and beer, said the Van Armans' son, Tom. ``It's \n     like Airbnb on steroids.''\n       The 116-acre farm, established in the 1780s, is thought to \n     be the town's oldest working farm. It's named for the timbers \n     in the original barn. When Norwich's first meeting house was \n     torn down, the farm's owner, Constant Murdock, bought the \n     beams for his barn, said Nancy Hoggson, president of the \n     Norwich Historical Society. Initially a subsistence farm, it \n     would eventually grow into a dairy business.\n       Deb Van Arman's grandparents, Charles and Lucy Pierce, \n     bought the property in 1913 and moved there from a small farm \n     in Quechee. The Pierces' son, Charles ``Bub'' Pierce, and his \n     wife, Janet, lived with them on the farm, where Janet ran a \n     day care and Bub farmed until he became ill in 1970, the same \n     year the Van Armans married. Bub died the following year, and \n     Janet farmed with the neighbors' help until later in 1971, \n     when Jay took over. They expanded their herd and carried on \n     with the dairy business until 1986.\n       With three children to put through college, a farmer's pay \n     wouldn't cut it, so the couple took part in a federal herd \n     buy-out program, selling their dairy cows. Both are \n     officially retired--Jay was a mail carrier in Norwich, and \n     Deb, a physical therapist, worked at the VA. But their work \n     on the farm didn't end. Deb keeps up the grounds, including \n     the vegetable, herb and flower gardens. Jay runs a composting \n     business and makes hay--he puts up and sells about 14,000 \n     bales a year, their main income. They also depend on the \n     state's current use plan to reduce taxes, he said. ``If it \n     wasn't for current use, we wouldn't be here.''\n       Theirs is one of eight farms featured in Cycles of Change: \n     Farming in Norwich, now on display at the historical society. \n     The exhibit, comprising photographs, video, oral histories \n     and text, will run through next spring.\n       Farming has seen big changes over the past several decades, \n     and rolling with the times has taken perseverance, financial \n     investments and plenty of hard work. New federal regulations \n     in the mid 1900s meant expensive upgrades for dairy farms, \n     Hoggson said. ``A lot of small farmers couldn't adjust to \n     those changes, so they had to close up shop.''\n       She called the fact that the same family has owned Meeting \n     House Farm for a century ``extraordinary.''\n       ``Keeping that land together has been really, really \n     important to the whole family,'' she said. ``It's very \n     unusual, I think, and a real credit to them as individuals \n     and to their commitment to the land, the importance of \n     family, and place that they have been able to do this.''\n       Yesterday's event was, in part, a tribute to that effort.\n       ``We wanted to celebrate all the happiness (the farm) has \n     brought and all the hard work my parents have done through \n     thick and thin,'' said daughter Emily Myers. ``It's not easy, \n     having a lot of property. . . . It can be very expensive, \n     especially with taxes, and they have been able to make it \n     work.''\n       As with most farm kids, summers and the hours after school \n     found the Van Arman children tending to chores. Growing up on \n     the farm has had a lasting impact on them, Myers said. ``It \n     gave us great morals, great values and always a sense of \n     home.''\n       On display yesterday was the Sears and Roebuck wagon Deb's \n     grandparents bought to travel to the farm with their young \n     children. The family had hitched their cows to the wagon, and \n     on the way, one gave birth on Christian Street. Her father \n     retrieved the calf the following day. Their move from Quechee \n     to the farm, made in mud season, was quite a journey, Deb Van \n     Arman said.\n       Within the next few years, a similar, if much more modern, \n     trek will take place, as the Van Armans' daughters, Kate and \n     Emily, plan to return to the farm with their families.\n       ``The only thing I ever knew was this farm,'' Deb Van Arman \n     said. Knowing her children will carry on the tradition ``is \n     very special.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/09/senate-section/article/S5426-3", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5426-S5427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT 20TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, today we commemorate the 20th \nanniversary of the Violence Against Women Act, a landmark piece of \nlegislation that continues to improve the lives of millions of women, \ntheir families, and the communities that support them. I was proud to \ncosponsor this legislation when it was originally enacted in 1994, led \nby then-Senator, now-Vice President Biden. And I was proud to fight for \nits reauthorizations in 2000, 2005,\n\n[[Page S5427]]\n\nand 2013, each time refining and building upon the great work that VAWA \ndoes each day.\n  This legislation stands today as an as an example of what we are \nreally called here to do--meeting people's day-to-day needs. That means \nprotecting people, making their lives better, and providing vital \nresources to those in need. No woman in this country should live in \nfear that her partner will hurt or kill her or her kids. I have zero \ntolerance for domestic violence. If you are beaten and abused, you \nshould have somewhere to turn for help and a path to recovery.\n  VAWA is crucial in all of our communities. Every day VAWA is \nproviding services to families in desperate need. I hear from my \nconstituents far too often about the challenges they are facing, often \ninvolving significant economic struggles only to be complicated by deep \nemotional pain and fear.\n  Here are the statistics: 1 in 4 women will be victims of domestic \nviolence. 16 million children are exposed to domestic violence every \nday. And over 2 million will be victims themselves of physical or \nsexual violence each year. 20,000 of these cases are in my own State of \nMaryland. Since we created the legislation in 1994, the national \nhotline has received millions of calls. Millions of women felt in \ndanger and had the chance of being rescued.\n  In my own State of Maryland VAWA is making recovery possible for \nvictims by finding them legal help to separate from their abusers. They \nare also getting vital services at rape crisis centers and navigating \nour immigration system to ensure protection.\n  Through the years I have heard from too many Marylanders about their \nstruggles. Fortunately, VAWA programs existed to help them. I heard \nfrom one of my constituents, Jean on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. \nJean was married to her husband for 10 years and shared 2 children. She \nbenefited from VAWA's Legal Assistance for Victims Grant after being \nabused so brutally one evening. Jean called the hotline and got the \nlegal assistance to file for a protective order, which she ultimately \nwas awarded and is now living her life safely with her children.\n  I also heard from Danielle. Danielle was sexually assaulted at the \nage of 19 by an associate that she knew. She was aided by VAWA's Sexual \nAssault Services program when she made the connection with the rape \ncrisis center a few days after her attack. Danielle got the support she \nneeded at the crisis center. She received personalized safety planning \nand counseling and was provided a lawyer to help her get a peace order.\n  I also hear from law enforcement in Maryland who say VAWA is helping \nthem make communities safer. The Lethality Assessment Program, \npioneered in Maryland and now a model for the Nation, was strengthened \nin the last VAWA reauthorization. The program is used to identify high \nrisk situations at the outset to link up local police with domestic \nviolence professionals to provide wrap around services and empowerment \nto get victims out of harm's way and reduce homicides. This was made \npossible because of VAWA which provided the Federal funding to make \nthis a reality.\n  As chair of the appropriations subcommittee that funds the Justice \nDepartment, I have secured funding for the Violence Against Women Act \nprograms at the highest levels ever. These programs ensure tougher \npenalties for abusers, coordinated assistance with community \norganizations, and court advocates for abused women to boost reporting \nand prosecution.\n  In the fiscal year 2015 CJS spending bill I provided a robust $430 \nmillion for Violence Against Women grants, continuing a strong \ncommitment to VAWA programs. I also provide strong investments in core \nVAWA programs including: $195 million for STOP formula grants, which \ncoordinates community response to domestic violence and also trains \npolice, prosecutors and judicial staff; $30 million for sexual assault \nservices that direct services for victims of rape; $26 million for \ntransitional housing grants so victims have safe and affordable housing \nafter shelters; and $50 million for Grants to Encourage Arrests, which \nteaches police and prosecutors how to support victims and ensure \noffender accountability.\n  So today, as we mark 20 years of VAWA, we reflect on what it has done \nfor families across our country and women in desperate need. But we \nalso reflect with the renewed knowledge that the programs that have \nbeen in place are reducing domestic violence and improving outcomes. If \nit is anything that the last 20 years have shown us, it is that VAWA \nworks. I am proud of it and am so happy to mark this important \nmilestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/09/senate-section/article/S5427-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. SCHATZ.

That bothered him so bad, he just wanted to go and make it \nright,'' she said.\n  A memorial service was held on November 10, 2007 at Coweta High \nSchool, with burial at the Vernon Cemetery in Coweta, OK.\n  His mother remembers him as very much a single man with a huge sense \nof humor. ``I asked him at Valentine's Day if there was anyone he \nwanted me to send flowers to,'' said his mother. ``He said, `Mom, that \nwould be too many flowers. You couldn't afford it.' ''\n  Cody is survived by his parents Darrel and Pam Carver of Haskell, OK, \nbrothers Lee and Jake Carver of Haskell, OK, and his grandparents \nCharles Orsburn and Barbara Phillippe of Wagoner, OK, and Ronald and \nEdna Carver of Coweta, OK.\n  Today we remember Army PFC Cody M.

He enlisted in the Army in March 1995 and \ncompleted basic and advanced individual training at Fort Benning, GA \nbefore being honorably discharged in June 1998.\n  Returning to active duty in August 1999, he served as a basic \ntraining drill sergeant at Fort Sill, OK, from November 2005 to October \n2007 and was then reassigned to 2nd Battalion, 30th Infantry Regiment, \n4th Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry), Fort \nPolk, LA.\n  A funeral service was held on June 17, 2008 at Schoen Funeral home \nwith internment at Lake Lawn Park Cemetery and Mausoleum in New \nOrleans, LA.\n  David is preceded in death by his mother Harrette Kock and survived \nby his father Max Wayne Hurst, his stepmother Lillian T.

Military service ran in his \nfamily with his grandfather, uncles, brother, and father also \ncompleting service time. ``Jeff was the ultimate warrior,'' said Ronald \nKettle, noting his son joined the Army in 1993 right after graduating \nfrom high school. He was assigned to 2nd Battalion, 7th Special Forces \nGroup based at Fort Bragg, NC and was on his fourth deployment.\n  A memorial service was held August 31, 2007, at Calvary Baptist \nChurch in Texas City, TX. Jeff was buried with military honors at \nArlington National Cemetery on August 22, 2007. His flag-draped coffin \nwas carried to the grave site by a six-man casket team of soldiers from \nthe 3rd Infantry Regiment. In the brief ceremony, relatives including \nhis parents and his wife recited the Lord's Prayer. His father said his \nson, 31, wished to be at Arlington because ``he wanted to be buried \namong heroes.''\n  Jeff is survived by his parents Ron and Cindy Kettle, his wife Brandi \nKettle, two sons Jeffrey and Logan, grandmother Anne Moore, and two \nbrothers Ryan and Clay Kettle.\n  I extend our deepest gratitude and condolences to Jeff's family.

Mallard\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I wish to remember another remarkable \nyoung man, Army CPT Torre R. Mallard. Assigned to 2nd Squadron, 3rd \nArmored Cavalry Regiment, Fort Hood, TX. Torre died March 10, 2008 of \nwounds suffered from an improvised explosive device while serving his \nNation in Balad Ruz, Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  The son of a retired army master sergeant, Torre was born August 20, \n1980 in Anniston, AL, and lived throughout the United States and \nEurope, eventually graduating from Salmen High School in Slidell, LA, \nin 1998.\n  While attending the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, Torre was \nactively involved in the boxing and football programs. During the \nspring semester of his sophomore year at the academy he served a 4-\nmonth term as a company commander, one of the highest positions in the \nCadet Chain of Command at the academy. In June 2002 he earned a \ncommission in the Army and graduated with a degree in computer science.\n  A memorial service was held on March 12, 2008 in Anniston, with \nburial in the U.S. Military Academy Post Cemetery at West Point, NY.\n  Torre is survived by his wife Bonita, two young sons Torre Jr. and \nJoshua, and his parents Mose and Robin Mallard.\n  Today we remember Army CPT Torre R. Mallard, a young man who loved \nhis family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.\n\n\n                     Specialist Michael E. Phillips\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, it is my honor to also pay tribute to \nthe life and sacrifice of Army SPC Michael E. Phillips who died on \nFebruary 24, 2008 in Baghdad, Iraq.\n  Michael left for basic training on June 24, 2006. Upon finishing \nadvanced infantry training, he was assigned to Bravo Company 1 of the \n502nd Strike Brigade of the 101st Airborne Division.\n  On October 13, 2007, he and his teammates deployed to Iraq in support \nof Operation Iraqi Freedom. Just 4 months into his deployment an \nimprovised explosive device tore through the door of the vehicle he was \ndriving. Despite the severity of his injuries he continued to smile and \nreassure those taking care of him. Even in the most grim and serious \ntimes, Michael still fought and lifted up those around him.\n  He is survived by his parents Steven and Angelia Phillips, his \nbrothers David and Anthony, and his sister Barbara--all of Ardmore, OK.\n  Michael excelled at drawing and had been offered admission to the San \nFrancisco Art Institute, his mother said. But serving his country meant \nmore than going to college, she said.\n  ``He came home one day and said he wanted to join the Army, and we \ngot in the car and went down to the recruiting station,'' Anglia \nPhillips said. ``He said terrorism was like a virus. It had to be \nstopped. It had to be contained.'' Her son was reenlisting to join for \n2 more years because ``he didn't want to leave his squad, his guys,'' \nshe said.\n  Today we remember Army SPC Michael E. Phillips, a young man who loved \nhis family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.\n\n\n                      Corporal Bryan J. Scripsick\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Scripsick who, along with three other Marines, succumbed to \ninjuries sustained after a suicide bomber attacked their position in \nAnbar province north of Baghdad, Iraq on September 6, 2007.\n  Bryan was born August 21, 1985. Although the family home is in Wayne, \nOK, he graduated in 2004 from Pauls Valley High School, where he played \nsafety and wide receiver on the football team.\n  Rather than pursuing his dream of playing college football, Bryan \nchose to join the Marine Corps right after his 19th birthday in August \n2004. He was assigned to 3rd Assault amphibian Battalion, 1st Marine \nDivision, I Marine Expeditionary Force, Camp Pendleton, CA and was on \nhis second tour to Iraq.\n  More than 100 people filled the First United Methodist Church for a \nmemorial service held on September 13, 2007. Burial took place at the \nMount Olivet Cemetery in Pauls Valley, OK. At the cemetery, members of \nthe Marine honor guard carried the casket to the gravesite where the \nflag was folded above the casket and presented to Bryan's parents and \nhis brother. He was then honored with three volleys from a rifle party \nand the playing of taps.\n  Bryan is survived by his parents Jon and Jan Scripsick, and his \nbrother Brett Scripsick of Pauls Valley, OK.\n  Today we remember Marine Corps Cpl Bryan J. Scripsick, a young man \nwho loved his family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for \nfreedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/09/senate-section/article/S5429-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CONGRATULATING THE MARLTON REDS BASEBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. MENENDEZ.

Madam President, it is appropriate that the \nSenate take note on occasion of those who ably and honestly serve the \ncountry and their fellow man. Our government has many who do so every \nday.\n  The Reverend Joseph Day was born in rural Dixons Mill, AL, being one \nof eight children. He grew up in Toulminville, near Mobile, AL, and was \na contemporary of baseball great Hank Aaron. They played baseball \ntogether and both attended the Greater Morningstar Missionary Baptist \nChurch.\n  He started work as a U.S. government civilian employee at Brookley \nAir Force Base in Mobile. When Brookley closed, Day transferred to what \nis now Robins Air Force Base, in Warner Robins, GA, retiring after 40 \nyears of service. After returning to Mobile, he then spent 17 years \nworking for Volkert, Inc., in Mobile.\n  He was passionate about helping others. He served as executive \ndirector of the Macon, GA chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership \nConference, and while in Macon was called to preach. Returning to \nMobile, he founded the House of Joshua Christian Center Church where he \npastored until his death. His influence is demonstrated in the \nremarkable fact that the Day family has produced several Christian \nministers.\n  He was an activist and a leader in the causes he believed in. In \n1991, he stood for 7 hours before bulldozers to save a spring fed lake. \nIn the end, the Mobile City Council voted to save the lake and named it \nDay Lake in his honor.\n  His wife of 65 years, Ruby Nell James Day, predeceased him. She was a \nwonderful and beloved woman and a member of the respected James family \nof Mobile.\n  Reverend Day's funeral service was a true celebration of a remarkable \nlife well-lived. Speakers at the service included former Mobile Mayor \nSam Jones, State Representative James Busky, State Senator Vivian \nFigures, and City Councilman Fred Richardson. I was also honored to \nspeak. Several prominent pastors from Mobile conducted the service. \nThey were: Ronald McCree, pastor--Greater Morning Star Baptist Church \n(Eulogy); Clinton Johnson, pastor--New Shiloh Baptist Church \n(Officiating); Fleet Bell, pastor--Rock of Faith Baptist Church (Song); \nDarlett-Lucy Gulley, pastor--New Life Methodist Church (Prayer of \nComfort); Minister Ronald Suggs, Greater Morning Star Baptist Church \n(Old Testament Reading); and Minister Gregory Palmer, Sr., Greater \nMorning Star Baptist Church (New Testament Reading). These pastors have \nearned the respect of the community over many years for their faith and \nservice to others.\n  I came to know and respect Reverend Day's son, Eric, when I hired him \nas the law enforcement coordinator for the U.S. attorney's office in \nMobile, where he still works. He reflects the integrity and faith of \nhis father. I am also proud that Eric's wonderful wife Valerie Day has \nserved as my field representative since I was elected to the Senate \nalmost 18 years ago.\n  This Nation must continue to produce leaders like Reverend Day who, \nin turn, produce families of energy, drive, faith and service. It is \nthey who provide the vision and faith, and the service, that are the \nqualities that make America exceptional. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/09/senate-section/article/S5430-2", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING EDMOND LEE JUNEAU\n\n Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I wish to honor Edmond Lee \nJuneau, a veteran of the U.S. Army.\n  It is my honor to share the story of Edmond's service because no \nveteran's story should ever go unrecognized.\n  Edmond was born in Green Bay, WI, on November 9, 1920, but grew up in \nBrowning, MT, where he was known for his tremendous athleticism, \nplaying football, basketball, and baseball.\n  He graduated from Browning High School and married the love of his \nlife Margie Bird Juneau. He and Margie had eight children: seven boys \nand one girl.\n  On June 22, 1944, Edmond began his service in the U.S. Army with the \n69th Armored Infantry Battalion Company A. He served alongside his \ncousin William ``Bill'' Big Springs and former Montana Governor, Tim \nBabcock. Edmond and Tim became close friends, and it was their time \noverseas that built a strong bond between the two men.\n  Edmond served in three different campaigns: Rhineland, the Ardennes, \nand Central Europe. Edmond didn't talk much about the war but told his \nson Stan one specific memory.\n  Near the end of the war, Edmond and his fellow soldiers were sitting \non their tanks at the Russian border waiting for orders to advance. The \nRussians, just a short distance away, were also sitting on their tanks \nwaiting for their orders. The orders never came, so at night the two \nunits would come together and talk. Edmond was doing diplomacy with the \nRussians before the Cold War even started.\n  Edmond separated from the military on October 23, 1945, passing on \nhis military legacy to his family. Three of his sons, Edmond Jr., \nSamson, and Robert, all went on to bravely serve our country.\n  Edmond's life of service extended far beyond the military. His work \nas a schoolbus driver and officer for the Browning Public Schools \ndemonstrates an unwavering commitment to civic duty and responsibility. \nEdmond passed away on September 20, 1967.\n  Last week, in the presence of his family, it was my honor to present \nStan Juneau and the entire Juneau family with Edmond's medals. The \nfirst medal was the highest medal I had ever given out: the \nDistinguished Service Medal. It is awarded to any person who, while \nserving in any capacity with the U.S. Army, has distinguished him or \nherself with exceptionally meritorious service to the government in a \nduty of great responsibility. The act must merit recognition for \nservice which is clearly exceptional.\n  Edmond also earned the following medals: the Bronze Star, Purple \nHeart, and the Good Conduct Medal.\n  It was my honor to present a European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign \nMedal with Three Bronze Service Stars, a World War II Victory Medal, \nand the Combat Infantryman Badge First Award.\n  I was also honored to present the Sharpshooter Badge with Rifle Bar \nand the Honorable Service Lapel Button, World War II.\n  These decorations are small tokens but powerful symbols of true \nheroism, sacrifice, and dedication to service.\n  These medals are presented on behalf of a grateful nation. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/09/senate-section/article/S5430-3", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5430-S5431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:22 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 231.

Sec. 1331(e), requires \n     the Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance (``the \n     Board'') to issue regulations implementing Section 210 of the \n     CAA relating to provisions of Titles II and III of the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act (``ADA''), 42 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 12131-12150, 12182, 12183 and 12198, made \n     applicable\n\n[[Page S5438]]\n\n     to the legislative branch by the CAA. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1331(b)(1).\n       Section 304(b)(1) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1384(b)(1), \n     requires that the Board issue a general notice of proposed \n     rulemaking by transmitting ``such notice to the Speaker of \n     the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of \n     the Senate for publication in the Congressional Record on the \n     first day on which both Houses are in session following such \n     transmittal.''\n       On behalf of the Board, I am hereby transmitting the \n     attached notice of proposed rulemaking to the President Pro \n     Tempore of the Senate. I request that this notice be \n     published in the Senate section of the Congressional Record \n     on the first day on which both Houses are in session \n     following receipt of this transmittal. In compliance with \n     Section 304(b)(2) of the CAA, a comment period of 30 days \n     after the publication of this notice of proposed rulemaking \n     is being provided before adoption of the rules.\n       All inquiries regarding this notice should be addressed to \n     Barbara J.

Sec. Sec. 12131-12150, 12182, 12183, and 12189 \n     (``ADA'') shall apply to the following entities:\n       (1) each office of the Senate, including each office of a \n     Senator and each committee;\n       (2) each office of the House of Representatives, including \n     each office of a Member of the House of Representatives and \n     each committee;\n       (3) each joint committee of the Congress;\n       (4) the Office of Congressional Accessibility Services;\n       (5) the Capitol Police;\n       (6) the Congressional Budget Office;\n       (7) the Office of the Architect of the Capitol (including \n     the Botanic Garden);\n       (8) the Office of the Attending Physician; and\n       (9) the Office of Compliance.\n\n     2 U.S.C. 1331(b).\n\n       Title II of the ADA generally prohibits discrimination on \n     the basis of disability in the provision of services, \n     programs, or activities by any ``public entity''. Section \n     210(b)(2) of the CAA defines the term ''public entity'' for \n     Title II purposes as any entity listed above that provides \n     public services, programs, or activities. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1331(b)(2).\n       Title III of the ADA generally prohibits discrimination on \n     the basis of disability by public accommodations and requires \n     places of public accommodation and commercial facilities to \n     be designed, constructed, and altered in compliance with \n     accessibility standards. Section 225(f) of the CAA provides \n     that, ``[e]xcept where inconsistent with definitions and \n     exemptions provided in this Act, the definitions and \n     exemptions of the [ADA] shall apply under this Act.'' 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1361(f)(1).\n       Section 210(f) of the CAA requires that the General Counsel \n     of the Office of Compliance on a regular basis, and at least \n     once each Congress, conduct periodic inspections of all \n     covered facilities and report to Congress on compliance with \n     disability access standards under section 210. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1331(f).\n       Section 210(e) of the CAA requires the Board of Directors \n     of the Office of Compliance (``the Board'') established under \n     the CAA to issue regulations implementing the section. 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1331(e). Section 210(e) further states that such \n     regulations ``shall be the same as substantive regulations \n     promulgated by the Attorney General and the Secretary of \n     Transportation to implement the statutory provisions referred \n     to in subsection (b) except to the extent that the Board may \n     determine, for good cause shown and stated together with the \n     regulation, that a modification of such regulations would be \n     more effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections under this section.'' Id. Section 210(e) further \n     provides that the regulations shall include a method of \n     identifying, for purposes of this section and for different \n     categories of violations of subsection (b), the entity \n     responsible for correction of a particular violation. 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1331(e).\n       Additional authority for proposing these regulations is \n     found in CAA Section 304, which sets forth the procedure to \n     be followed for the rulemaking process in general, including \n     notice and comment; Board consideration of comments and \n     adoption of regulations; transmittal to the Speaker and \n     President Pro Tempore for publication in the Congressional \n     Record; and approval by the Congress.\n       Are there ADA public access regulations already in force \n     under the CAA?\n       Yes. The CAA was enacted on January 23, 1995. It applied to \n     the legislative branch of the federal government the \n     protections of 12 (now 13) statutes that previously had \n     applied to the executive branch and/or the private sector, \n     including laws providing for family and medical leave, \n     prohibiting discrimination against eligible veterans, and \n     affording labor-management rights and responsibilities, among \n     others. The CAA established the Office of Compliance as an \n     independent agency to administer and enforce the CAA. The OOC \n     administers an administrative dispute resolution system to \n     resolve certain disputes arising under the Act. The General \n     Counsel of the OOC has independent investigatory and \n     enforcement authority for other violations of the Act, \n     including certain portions of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 12131-12150, 12182, 12183, & 12189.\n       As set forth in the previous answer, the CAA requires the \n     Board to issue regulations implementing the statutory \n     protections provided by the CAA. See, e.g., CAA Sections \n     202(d) (Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993), 206(c) \n     (Veterans' Employment and Reemployment), 212 (d) (Federal \n     Service Labor Management Relations Act). 2 U.S.C. sections \n     1312(d), 1316(c), 1351(d). The Board's regulations ``shall be \n     the same as substantive regulations promulgated by the \n     Attorney General and Secretary of Transportation . . . except \n     insofar as the Board may determine, for good cause shown and \n     stated together with the regulation, that a modification of \n     such regulations would be more effective for the \n     implementation of the rights and protections under this \n     section.'' 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(e)(2).\n       The CAA does not simply apply to the legislative branch the \n     substantive protections of these laws, and direct that the \n     implementing regulations essentially mirror those of the \n     executive branch. The statute further provides that, while \n     the CAA rulemaking procedure is underway, the corresponding \n     executive branch regulations are to be applied. Section 411 \n     of the Act provides:\n       ``Effect of failure to issue regulations.\n       In any proceeding under section 1405, 1406, 1407, or 1408 \n     of this title . . . if the Board has not issued a regulation \n     on a matter for which this chapter requires a regulation to \n     be issued, the hearing officer, Board, or court, as the case \n     may be, shall apply, to the extent necessary and appropriate, \n     the most relevant substantive executive agency regulation \n     promulgated to implement the statutory provision at issue in \n     the proceeding.''\n       This statutory scheme makes plain that ADA public access \n     regulations are presently in force. First, regulations \n     virtually identical to these were adopted by the Board, \n     presented to the House of Representatives and the Senate on \n     September 19, 1996, and published on January 7, 1997. 142 \n     Cong. Rec. S10984-11018 and 143 Cong. Rec. S30-66. No action \n     was taken and thus the regulations were not issued. As set \n     forth above, in these circumstances the CAA applies ``the \n     most relevant substantive executive agency regulations,'' \n     i.e., the Departments of Justice (``DOJ'') and Department of \n     Transportation (``DOT'') ADA public access regulations. 2 \n     U.S.C Sec. 1411.\n       A contrary interpretation would render meaningless several \n     sections of the CAA. For example, Congress directed the AOC \n     and other employing offices to conduct an initial study of \n     legislative branch facilities from January 23, 1995 through \n     December 31, 1996, ``to identify any violations of subsection \n     (b) of [section 210], to determine the costs of compliance, \n     and to take any necessary corrective action to abate any \n     violations.'' 2 U.S.C. section 1331(f)(3). Congress \n     instructed the OOC to assist the employing offices by \n     ``arranging for inspections and other technical assistance at \n     their request.'' Id. The CAA was enacted on January 23, 1995. \n     No implementing regulations could have taken effect as of \n     that date. Plainly, Congress intended the employing offices \n     and the OOC to look to the DOJ and DOT ADA public access \n     regulations, with which the CAA explicitly required employing \n     offices to comply, when conducting the initial study and \n     abatement actions.\n       Other sections of the CAA support this reading. For \n     example, the CAA requires the Board to exclude from labor \n     relations regulations employees of Member offices, Senate and \n     House Legislative Counsel, the Congressional Budget Office \n     and several other employing offices if the Board finds a \n     conflict of interest or appearance thereof. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1351(e)(1)(B). Where, as here, a statute explicitly \n     provides for certain regulatory exemptions, it would be \n     illogical to interpret language that expressly provides \n     for regulatory compliance to mean anything else. When \n     Congress intended to exempt employing offices from \n     regulations, the CAA did so explicitly.\n       Why are these regulations being proposed at this time?\n       As set forth in the previous answer, the CAA requires \n     employing offices to comply with ADA public access \n     regulations issued by the DOJ and DOT pursuant to the ADA. \n     The CAA also requires the Board to issue its own regulations \n     implementing the ADA public\n\n[[Page S5439]]\n\n     access provisions of the CAA. The statute obligates the \n     Board's regulations to be the same as the DOJ and DOT \n     regulations except to the extent that the Board may determine \n     that a modification would be more effective in implementing \n     ADA public access protections. CAA section 210(e)(2). These \n     proposed regulations will clarify that covered entities must \n     comply with the ADA public access provisions applied to \n     public entities and accommodations to implement Titles II and \n     III of the ADA. Congressional approval and Board issuance of \n     ADA public access under the CAA will also eliminate any \n     question as to the ADA public access protections that are \n     applicable in the legislative branch.\n       The Board adopted proposed regulations and presented them \n     to the House of Representatives and the Senate in 1996. The \n     regulations were published on January 7, 1997, during the \n     105th Congress. 142 Cong. Rec. S10984-11018 and 143 Cong. \n     Rec. S30-66. No Congressional action was taken and therefore \n     the regulations were not issued. The Board adopted the \n     present proposal, with updated proposed regulations, to \n     facilitate Congressional consideration of the ADA \n     regulations.\n       Which ADA public access regulations are applied to covered \n     entities in 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(e)? \n       Section 210(e) of the CAA requires the Board to issue \n     regulations that are ``the same as substantive regulations \n     promulgated by the Attorney General and the Secretary of \n     Transportation to implement the statutory provisions . . . \n     except to the extent that the Board may determine, for good \n     cause shown and stated together with the regulation, that a \n     modification of such regulations would be more effective for \n     the implementation of the rights and protections under this \n     section.'' 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(e).\n       Consistent with its prior decisions on this issue, the \n     Board has determined that all regulations promulgated after a \n     notice and comment by the DOJ and/or the DOT to implement the \n     provisions of Title II and Title III of the ADA applied by \n     section 210(b) of the CAA are ``substantive regulations'' \n     within the meaning of section 210(e). See, e.g., 142 Cong. \n     Rec. S5070, S5071-72 (daily ed. May 15, 1996) (NPRM \n     implementing section 220(d) regulations); 141 Cong. Rec. \n     S17605 (daily ed. Nov. 28, 1995) (NPRM implementing section \n     203 regulations).\n       See also Reves v. Ernst & Young, 494 U.S. 56, 64 (1993) \n     (where same phrase or term is used in two different places in \n     the same statute, it is reasonable for court to give each use \n     a similar construction); Sorenson v. Secretary of the \n     Treasury, 475 U.S. 851, 860 (1986) (normal rule of statutory \n     construction assumes that identical words in different parts \n     of the same act are intended to have the same meaning).\n       In this regard, the Board has reviewed the provisions of \n     section 210 of the CAA, the sections of the ADA applied by \n     that section, and the regulations of the DOJ and DOT, to \n     determine whether and to what extent those regulations are \n     substantive regulations which implement the provisions of \n     Title II and Title III of the ADA applied by section 210(b) \n     of the CAA. As explained more fully below, the Board proposes \n     to adopt the following otherwise applicable regulations of \n     the DOJ published at Parts 35 and 36 of Title 28 of the Code \n     of Federal Regulations (``CFR'') and those of the DOT \n     published at Parts 37 and 38 of Title 49 of the CFR:\n       1. DOJ's regulations at Part 35 of Title 28 of the CFR: The \n     DOJ's regulations at Part 35 implement subtitle A of Title II \n     of the ADA (sections 201 through 205), the rights and \n     protections of which are applied to covered entities under \n     section 210(b) of the CAA. See 28 CFR Sec. 35.101 (Purpose). \n     Therefore, the Board determines that these regulations will \n     be adopted in the proposed regulations under section 210(e).\n       2. DOJ's regulations at Part 36 of Title 28 of the CFR: The \n     DOJ's regulations at Part 36 implement Title III of the ADA \n     (sections 301 through 309). See 28 CFR Sec. 36.101 (Purpose). \n     Section 210(b) only applies the rights and protections of \n     three sections of Title III with respect to public \n     accommodations: prohibitions against discrimination (section \n     302), provisions regarding new construction and alterations \n     (section 303), and provisions regarding examinations and \n     courses (section 309). Therefore, only those regulations in \n     Part 36 that are reasonably necessary to implement the \n     statutory provisions of sections 302, 303, and 309 will be \n     adopted by the Board under section 210(e) of the CAA.\n       3. DOT's regulations at Parts 37 and 38 of Title 49 of the \n     CFR: The DOT's regulations at Parts 37 and 38 implement the \n     transportation provisions of Title II and Title III of the \n     ADA. See 49 CFR Sec. Sec. 37.101 (Purpose) and 38.1 \n     (Purpose). The provisions of Title II and Title III of the \n     ADA relating to transportation and applied to covered \n     entities by section 210(b) of the CAA are subtitle B of Title \n     II (sections 221 through 230) and certain portions of section \n     302 of Title III. Thus, those regulations of the Secretary \n     that are reasonably necessary to implement the statutory \n     provisions of sections 221 through 230, 302, and 303 of the \n     ADA will be adopted by the Board under section 210(e) of the \n     CAA.\n       The Board proposes not to adopt those regulatory provisions \n     of the regulations of the DOJ or DOT that have no conceivable \n     applicability to operations of entities within the \n     Legislative Branch or are unlikely to be invoked. See 141 \n     Cong. Rec. at S17604 (daily ed. Nov. 28, 1995) (NPRM \n     implementing section 203 regulations). Unless public comments \n     demonstrate otherwise, the Board intends to include in the \n     adopted regulations a provision stating that the Board has \n     issued substantive regulations on all matters for which \n     section 210(e) requires a regulation. See section 411 of the \n     CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1411.\n       In addition, the Board has proposed to make technical \n     changes in definitions and nomenclature so that the \n     regulations comport with the CAA and the organizational \n     structure of the Office of Compliance. In the Board's \n     judgment, making such changes satisfies the CAA's ``good \n     cause'' requirement. With the exception of these technical \n     and nomenclature changes and additional proposed regulations \n     relating to the investigation and inspection authority \n     granted to the General Counsel under the CAA, the Board does \n     not propose substantial departure from otherwise applicable \n     regulations.\n       The Board notes that the General Counsel applied the above-\n     referenced standards of Parts 35 and 36 of the DOJ's \n     regulations and Parts 37 and 38 of the DOT's regulations \n     during the past inspections of Legislative Branch facilities \n     pursuant to section 210(f) of the CAA. In contrast to other \n     sections of the CAA, which generally give the Office of \n     Compliance only adjudicatory and regulatory responsibilities, \n     the General Counsel has the authority to investigate and \n     prosecute alleged violations of disability standards under \n     section 210, as well as the responsibility for inspecting \n     covered facilities to ensure compliance. According to the \n     General Counsel's final inspection reports, the Title II and \n     Title III regulations encompass the following requirements:\n       1. Program accessibility: This standard is applied to \n     ensure physical access to public programs, services, or \n     activities. Under this standard, covered entities must modify \n     policies, practices, and procedures to ensure an equal \n     opportunity for individuals with disabilities. If policy and \n     procedural modifications are ineffective, then structural \n     modifications may be required.\n       2. Effective communication: This standard requires covered \n     entities to make sure that their communications with \n     individuals with disabilities (such as in the context of \n     constituent meetings and committee hearings) are as effective \n     as their communications with others. Covered entities are \n     required to make information available in alternate formats \n     such as large print, Braille, or audio tape, or use methods \n     that provide individuals with disabilities the opportunity to \n     effectively communicate, such as sign language interpreters \n     or the use of pen and paper. Primary consideration must be \n     given to the method preferred by the individual.\n       3. ADA Standards for Accessible Design: These standards are \n     applied to architectural barriers, including structural \n     barriers to communication, such as telephone booths, to \n     ensure that existing facilities, new construction, and new \n     alterations, are accessible to individuals with disabilities.\n       The Board recognizes that, as with other obligations under \n     the CAA, covered entities will need information and guidance \n     regarding compliance with these ADA standards as adopted in \n     these proposed regulations, which the Office will provide as \n     part of its education and information activities.\n       How do these regulations differ from those proposed by the \n     Board on January 7, 1997?\n       These regulations are very similar to those proposed by the \n     Board in 1997; however, there are three significant \n     differences:\n       1. These regulations have been updated to incorporate the \n     changes made in the DOJ and DOT regulations since 1997. One \n     of the most significant changes made by the DOJ occurred on \n     September 15, 2010 when the DOJ published regulations \n     adopting the 2010 Standards for Accessible Design (``2010 \n     Standards''). The 2010 Standards became fully effective on \n     March 15, 2012 and replaced the 1991 Standards for Accessible \n     Design (``1991 Standards'') that were referenced in the \n     regulations proposed by the Board in 1997. These regulations \n     incorporate by reference the pertinent DOJ and DOT \n     regulations that are in effect as of the date of the \n     publication of this notice, which means that the 2010 \n     Standards will be applied. The Board has also changed the \n     format of the incorporated regulations. Rather than \n     reprinting each of the regulations with minor changes to \n     reflect different nomenclature used in the CAA (i.e., \n     changing references to ``Assistant Attorney General,'' \n     ``Department of Justice,'' ``FTA Administrator,'' ``FTA \n     regional office,'' ``Administrator,'' and ``Secretary'' to \n     ``General Counsel''), these regulations contain a \n     definitional section in Sec. 1.105(a) which make these \n     changes and incorporates the DOJ and DOT regulations by \n     reference.\n       2. Unlike the Board in 1997, the current Board has decided \n     not to propose adoption of the DOJ Title II regulation \n     relating to employment discrimination, 28 C.F.R. Sec. 35.140. \n     The Board notes that since 1997 most courts considering this \n     issue have decided that employees of public entities must use \n     the procedures in Title I of the ADA to pursue employment \n     discrimination claims and that these claims cannot be pursued \n     under Title II. See, e.g., Brumfield v. City of Chicago, 735 \n     F.3d 619 (7th Cir. 2013); Elwell v. Okla. ex rel. Bd. of \n     Regents of the Univ. of Okla., 693 F.3d 1303 (10th Cir. \n     2012); Zimmerman v. Or. Dep't of Justice, 170 F.3d 1169 (9th \n     Cir. 1999). The prohibition against employment discrimination \n     because of disability in Title I of the ADA is incorporated \n     into section 201(a)(3) of the CAA. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1311(a)(3). \n     Under section 210(c) of the CAA, ``with respect to any claim \n     of employment discrimination asserted by any covered \n     employee, the exclusive remedy shall be under section 1311 of \n     this title.'' 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(c). Similarly, under section \n     225(e) of the CAA, ``[o]nly a covered entity\n\n[[Page S5440]]\n\n     who has undertaken and completed the procedures in sections \n     1402 and 1403 of this title may be granted a remedy under \n     part A of this subchapter.'' 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1361(e). When \n     taken together, these sections of the CAA make it clear that \n     the exclusive method for obtaining relief for employment \n     discrimination because of disability is under section 201, \n     which involves using the counseling and mediation procedures \n     contained in sections 402 and 403 of the CAA. For these \n     reasons, the Board has found good cause not to incorporate \n     the DOJ Title II regulation relating to employment \n     discrimination, 28 C.F.R. Sec. 35.140, into these \n     regulations.\n       3. In Parts 2 and 3 of these regulations, the Board has \n     proposed regulations relating to the two unique statutory \n     duties imposed by the CAA upon the General Counsel of the \n     Office of Compliance that are not imposed upon the DOJ and \n     DOT: (1) the investigation and prosecution of charges of \n     discrimination using the Office's mediation and hearing \n     processes (section 210(d) of the CAA) and (2) the biennial \n     inspection and reporting obligations (section 210(f) of the \n     CAA). Parts 2 and 3 of these regulations were not contained \n     in the regulations proposed in 1997; however, the Board has \n     determined that there is good cause to propose these \n     regulations to fully implement section 210 of the CAA. See, 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1331(e)(1). In formulating the substance of these \n     regulations, the Board has directed the Office's statutory \n     employees to consult with stakeholders and has considered \n     their comments and suggestions.\n       The Board has also reviewed the biennial ADA reports from \n     the General Counsel and considered what the General Counsel \n     has learned since 1995 while investigating charges of \n     discrimination and conducting and reporting upon ADA \n     inspections. Of particular note is the regulation proposed as \n     Sec. 3.103(d) which addresses concerns raised by oversight \n     and appropriations staff over finding a cost-efficient \n     process that would allow better identification and \n     elimination of potential ADA compliance issues during the \n     pre-construction phases of new construction and alteration \n     projects.\n     Procedural Summary:\n       How are substantive regulations proposed and approved under \n     the CAA? \n       Pursuant to Section 304 of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1384, the \n     procedure for proposing and approving such substantive \n     regulations provides that:\n       (1) the Board of Directors propose substantive regulations \n     and publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking in the \n     Congressional Record;\n       (2) there be a comment period of at least 30 days after the \n     date of publication of the general notice of proposed \n     rulemaking;\n       (3) after consideration of comments by the Board of \n     Directors, the Board adopt regulations and transmit notice of \n     such action (together with the regulations and a \n     recommendation regarding the method for Congressional \n     approval of the regulations) to the Speaker of the House and \n     President [P]ro [T]empore of the Senate for publication in \n     the Congressional Record;\n       (4) there be committee referral and action on the proposed \n     regulations by resolution in each House, concurrent \n     resolution, or by joint resolution; and\n       (5) final publication of the approved regulations in the \n     Congressional Record, with an effective date prescribed in \n     the final publication.\n       For more detail, please reference the text of 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1384. This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is step (1) of \n     the outline set forth above.\n       Are these proposed regulations also recommended by the \n     Office of Compliance's Executive Director, the Deputy \n     Executive Director for the Senate, and the Deputy Executive \n     Director for the House of Representatives? \n       As required by Section 304(b)(1) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1384(b)(1), the substance of these regulations is also \n     recommended by the Executive Director, the Deputy Executive \n     Director for the Senate and the Deputy Executive Director for \n     the House of Representatives.\n       Has the Board of Directors previously proposed substantive \n     regulations implementing the ADA public access provisions \n     pursuant to 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331?\n       Yes. Proposed regulations were previously adopted by the \n     Board and presented to the House of Representatives and the \n     Senate on September 19, 1996. The regulations were published \n     on January 7, 1997. 142 Cong. Rec. S10984-11018 and 143 Cong. \n     Rec. S30-66. No Congressional action was taken on these \n     regulations.\n       What is the approach taken by these proposed substantive \n     regulations?\n       The Board will follow the procedure as enumerated above and \n     as required by statute. The Board will review any comments \n     received under step (2) of the outline above, and respond to \n     the comments and make any changes necessary to ensure that \n     the regulations fully implement section 210 of the CAA and \n     reflect the practices and policies particular to the \n     legislative branch.\n       What responsibilities would covered entities have in \n     effectively implementing these regulations?\n       The CAA charges covered entities with the responsibility to \n     comply with these regulations. CAA Sec. 210, 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1331.\n       Are there substantive differences in the proposed \n     regulations for the House of Representatives, the Senate, and \n     the other employing offices?\n       No. The Board of Directors has identified no ``good cause'' \n     for proposing different regulations for these entities and \n     accordingly has not done so. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(e)(2).\n       Are these proposed substantive regulations available to \n     persons with disabilities in an alternate format?\n       This Notice of Proposed Regulations is available on the \n     OOC's web site, www.compliance.gov, which is compliant with \n     Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended, 29 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 794d. This Notice can also be made available in \n     large print or Braille. Requests for this Notice in an \n     alternative format should be made to: Annie Leftwood, \n     Executive Assistant, Office of Compliance, 110 2nd Street, \n     S.E., Room LA-200, Washington, D.C. 20540; 202-724-9250; TDD: \n     202-426-1912; FAX: 202-426-1913.\n     30 Day Comment Period Regarding the Proposed Regulations\n       How long do I have to submit comments regarding the \n     proposed regulations?\n       Comments regarding the proposed regulations of the OOC set \n     forth in this Notice are invited for a period of thirty (30) \n     days following the date of the appearance of this Notice in \n     the Congressional Record.\n       How do I submit comments?\n       Comments must be made in writing to the Executive Director, \n     Office of Compliance, 110 Second Street, S.E., Room LA-200, \n     Washington, D.C. 20540-1999. Those wishing to receive \n     confirmation of the receipt of their comments are requested \n     to provide a self-addressed, stamped post card with their \n     submission.

Comments may also be submitted by facsimile to the \n     Executive Director at 202-426-1913 (a non-toll-free number).\n       Am I allowed to view copies of comments submitted by \n     others?\n       Yes. Copies of submitted comments will be available for \n     review on the Office's web site at www.compliance.gov, and at \n     the Office of Compliance, 110 Second Street, S.E., \n     Washington, D.C. 20540-1999, on Monday through Friday (non-\n     Federal holidays) between the hours of 9:30 a.m. and 4:30 \n     p.m.\n     Summary:\n       The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, PL 104-1, was \n     enacted into law on January 23, 1995. The CAA, as amended, \n     applies the rights and protections of thirteen federal labor \n     and employment statutes to covered employees and employing \n     offices within the legislative branch of the federal \n     government. Section 210 of the CAA applies that the rights \n     and protections against discrimination in the provision of \n     public services and accommodations established by of Titles \n     II and III (sections 201 through 230, 302, 303, and 309) of \n     the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 12131-12150, 12182, 12183, and 12189 (``ADA'') shall \n     apply to Legislative Branch entities covered by the CAA. The \n     above provisions of section 210 became effective on January \n     1, 1997. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(h).\n       The Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance is now \n     publishing proposed regulations to implement Section 210 of \n     the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (``CAA''), 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1301-1438, as applied to covered entities of the \n     House of Representatives, the Senate, and certain \n     Congressional instrumentalities listed below.\n       In addition to inviting comment in this Notice, the Board, \n     through the statutory appointees of the Office, sought \n     consultation with the stakeholders regarding the development \n     of these regulations. The Board also notes that the General \n     Counsel of the Office of Compliance has completed inspections \n     of covered facilities for compliance with disability access \n     standards under section 210 of the CAA during each Congress \n     since the CAA was enacted and has submitted reports to \n     Congress after each of these inspections. Based on \n     information gleaned from these consultations and the \n     experience gained from the General Counsel's inspections, the \n     Board is publishing these proposed regulations, pursuant to \n     section 210(e) of the CAA, 2 Sec. 1331(e).\n       The purpose of these regulations is to implement section \n     210 of the CAA. In this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \n     (``NPRM'' or ``Notice'') the Board proposes that virtually \n     identical regulations be adopted for the Senate, the House of \n     Representatives, and the seven Congressional \n     instrumentalities. Accordingly:\n       (1) Senate. It is proposed that regulations as described in \n     this Notice be included in the body of regulations that shall \n     apply to entities within the Senate, and this proposal \n     regarding the Senate entities is recommended by the Office of \n     Compliance's Deputy Executive Director for the Senate.\n       (2) House of Representatives. It is further proposed that \n     regulations as described in this Notice be included in the \n     body of regulations that shall apply to entities within the \n     House of Representatives, and this proposal regarding the \n     House of Representatives entities is recommended by the \n     Office of Compliance's Deputy Executive Director for the \n     House of Representatives.\n       (3) Certain Congressional instrumentalities. It is further \n     proposed that regulations as described in this Notice be \n     included in the body of regulations that shall apply to the \n     Office of Congressional Accessibility Services, the Capitol \n     Police, the Congressional Budget Office, the Office of the \n     Architect of the Capitol (including the Botanic Garden), the \n     Office of the Attending Physician, and the Office of \n     Compliance; and this proposal regarding these six \n     Congressional instrumentalities is recommended by the Office \n     of Compliance's Executive Director.\n\n[[Page S5441]]\n\n       Dates: Comments are due within 30 days after the date of \n     publication of this Notice in the Congressional Record.\n     Supplementary Information:\n       The regulations set forth below (Parts 1, 2, and 3) are the \n     substantive regulations that the Board of Directors of the \n     Office of Compliance are proposing pursuant to section 210(e) \n     of the CAA. Part 1 contains the general provisions applicable \n     to all regulations under section 210, the method of \n     identifying entities responsible for correcting a violation \n     of section 210, and the list of executive branch regulations \n     incorporated by reference which define and clarify the \n     prohibition against discrimination on the basis of disability \n     in the provision of public services and accommodations. Part \n     2 contains the provisions pertaining to investigation and \n     prosecution of charges of discrimination. Part 3 contains the \n     provisions regarding the periodic inspections and reports to \n     Congress on compliance with the disability access standards. \n     These three parts correspond to the three general duties \n     imposed upon the Office of Compliance by section 210 which \n     are as follows:\n       1. Under section 210(e) of the CAA, the Board of Directors \n     of the Office of Compliance must promulgate substantive \n     regulations which implement the rights and protections \n     provided by section 210. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(e)(1).\n       2. Under Section 210(d) of the CAA, the General Counsel of \n     the Office of Compliance must receive and investigate charges \n     of discrimination alleging violations of the rights and \n     protections provided by Titles II and III of the ADA, may \n     request mediation of such charges upon believing that a \n     violation may have occurred, and, if mediation has not \n     succeeded in resolving the dispute, may file a complaint and \n     prosecute the complaint through the Office of Compliance's \n     hearing and review process 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(d).\n       3. Under section 210(f) of the CAA, the General Counsel of \n     the Office of Compliance on a regular basis, and at least \n     once each Congress, must conduct periodic inspections of all \n     covered facilities and report to Congress on compliance with \n     disability access standards under section 210. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1331(f).\n       Regulations proposed in Part 1.\n       Sec. 1.101 Purpose and scope. This section references and \n     cites the sections of Title II and III of the ADA \n     incorporated by reference into the CAA, follows the statutory \n     language of the CAA to identify the covered entities and the \n     statutory duties of the General Counsel of the Office of \n     Compliance and describes how the regulations are organized.\n       Sec. 1.102 Definitions. This section describes the \n     abbreviations that are used throughout the regulations.\n       Sec. 1.103 Authority of the Board. This section describes \n     the authority of the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance to issue regulations under section 210 of the CAA \n     and the intended effect of the technical and nomenclature \n     changes made to the regulations promulgated by the Attorney \n     General and Secretary of Transportation.\n       Sec. 1.104 Method for identifying the entity responsible \n     for correcting violations of section 210. The regulation in \n     this section is required by section 210(e)(3) of the CAA. \n     This regulation hues very closely to the DOJ Title III \n     regulation set forth in 28 C.F.R. Sec. 36.201 which in turn \n     is based on the statutory language in 42 U.S.C. Sec. 12182(a) \n     (one of the ADA statutory sections incorporated by reference \n     in section 210(b) of the CAA). Under section 302 of the ADA, \n     owners, operators, lessors and lessees are all jointly and \n     severally liable for ADA violations. See, e.g., Botosan v. \n     McNally Realty, 216 F.3d 827, 832 (9th Cir. 2000). The \n     proposed regulation allows consideration of relevant \n     statutes, contracts, orders, and other enforceable \n     arrangements or relationships to allocate responsibility. The \n     term ``enforceable arrangement'' is used intentionally since \n     certain indemnification and contribution contracts allocating \n     liability under the ADA have been found to be unenforceable. \n     See, e.g., Equal Rights Center v. Archstone-Smith Trust, 602 \n     F.3d 597 (4th Cir. 2010, cert denied, 131 S. Ct. 504 (2010). \n     Although the concepts of ``ownership'' or ``leasing'' do not \n     appear to apply to Legislative Branch facilities on Capitol \n     Hill, the Architect of the Capitol does have statutory \n     superintendence responsibility for certain legislative branch \n     buildings and facilities, including the Capitol Building, \n     which includes duties and responsibilities analogous to those \n     of a ``landlord''. See 40 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 163-166 (Capitol \n     Building), 167-175 and 185a (House and Senate office \n     buildings), 193a (Capitol grounds), 216b (Botanical Garden) \n     and 2 U.S.C. Sec. 141(a)(1) (Library of Congress buildings). \n     The Board believes that, where two or more entities may have \n     compliance obligations under section 210(b) as ``responsible \n     entities'' under the proposed regulations, those entities \n     should have the ability to allocate responsibility by \n     agreement similar to the case of landlords and tenants with \n     respect to public accommodations under Title III of the ADA. \n     Thus, the proposed regulations adopt such provisions modeled \n     after section 36.201(b) of the DOJ regulations. However, by \n     promulgating this provision, the Board does not intend any \n     substantive change in the statutory responsibility of \n     entities under section 210(b) or the applicable substantive \n     rights and protections of the ADA applied thereunder. See 142 \n     Cong. Rec. at S270 (final rule under section 205 of the CAA \n     substitutes the term ``privatization'' for ``sale of \n     business'' in the Secretary of Labor's regulations under the \n     Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act).\n       Sec. 1.105 Regulations incorporated by reference. As \n     explained above, consistent with its prior decisions on this \n     issue, the Board has determined that all regulations \n     promulgated after a notice and comment by the DOJ and/or the \n     DOT to implement the provisions of Title II and Title III of \n     the ADA applied by section 210(b) of the CAA are \n     ``substantive regulations'' within the meaning of section \n     210(e). See, e.g., 142 Cong. Rec. S5070, S5071-72 (daily ed. \n     May 15, 1996) (NPRM implementing section 220(d) regulations); \n     141 Cong. Rec. S17605 (daily ed. Nov. 28, 1995) (NPRM \n     implementing section 203 regulations). In this regard, the \n     Board has reviewed the provisions of section 210 of the CAA, \n     the sections of the ADA applied by that section, and the \n     regulations of the DOJ and DOT, to determine whether and to \n     what extent those regulations are substantive regulations \n     which implement the provisions of Title II and Title III of \n     the ADA applied by section 210(b) of the CAA.\n       In section 1.105(a)(1), the Board has modified the \n     nomenclature used in the incorporated regulations to comport \n     with the CAA and the organizational structure of the Office \n     of Compliance. In the Board's judgment, making such changes \n     satisfies the CAA's ``good cause'' requirement. With the \n     exception of these technical and nomenclature changes and \n     additional proposed regulations relating to the investigation \n     and inspection authority granted to the General Counsel under \n     the CAA, the Board does not propose substantial departure \n     from otherwise applicable regulations. The dates referenced \n     in section 1.105(a)(2) reflect that the ADA public access \n     provisions of the CAA became effective on January 1, 1997 \n     rather than effective date of the ADA which was January 26, \n     1992. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(h). The three year provision in \n     section 1.105(a)(3) was developed after consultation with the \n     Office of the Architect of the Capitol regarding what would \n     be a reasonable time frame for implementing these provisions \n     of the regulations. In several portions of DOJ and DOT \n     regulations, references are made to dates such as the \n     effective date of the regulations or effective dates derived \n     from the statutory provisions of the ADA. The Board proposes \n     to substitute dates which correspond to analogous periods for \n     the purposes of the CAA. In this way covered entities under \n     section 210 may have the same time to come into compliance \n     relative to the effective date of section 210 of the CAA \n     afforded public entities subject to Title II of the ADA. In \n     the Board's judgment, such changes satisfy the CAA's ``good \n     cause'' requirement. In section 1.105(a)(4), which was also \n     developed based upon consultations with the Office of the \n     Architect of the Capitol (``AOC''), the Board modified the \n     exception for ``historic'' property to include properties, \n     buildings, or facilities designated as an historic or \n     heritage assets by the AOC. This was necessary because the \n     DOJ regulations limit the definition of historic properties \n     to those ``listed or eligible for listing in the National \n     Register of Historic Places or properties designated as \n     historic under State or local law'' 28 C.F.R. Sec. 35.104. \n     While there are certainly properties on Capitol Hill which \n     have historically significant features that are worthy of \n     preservation, these properties are not eligible for listing \n     on the National Register of Historic Places or considered \n     historic under State of local law. See, Historic Preservation \n     Act of 1966, 16 U.S.C. 470g (exempting the White House and \n     its grounds, the Supreme Court building and its grounds, and \n     the United States Capitol and its related buildings and \n     grounds from the provisions of the Historic Preservation \n     Act).\n       In section 1.105(b), the Board has adopted a rule of \n     interpretation to cover the few instances where there are \n     differences between regulations implementing Title II and \n     Title III of the ADA. The CAA is unique in that it applies \n     both Title II and Title III provisions to covered public \n     entities. The public accommodation provisions of Title III of \n     the ADA are otherwise only applicable to private entities. \n     See, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 12181(7). This section of the regulation \n     reflects the Board's determination that Congress applied \n     provisions of both Title II and Title III of the ADA to \n     legislative branch entities to ensure that individuals with \n     disabilities are provided the most access to public services, \n     programs, activities and accommodations provided by law.\n       In section 1.105(c), the Board has listed the specific DOJ \n     regulations incorporated into the regulations being issued \n     under section 210 of the CAA. As noted earlier, the Board has \n     adopted all of the DOJ regulations implementing Titles II and \n     III of the ADA with the following exceptions:\n       1. The Board is not incorporating the DOJ regulations \n     regarding retaliation or coercion (28 C.F.R. Sec. Sec. 35.134 \n     & 36.206). Sections 35.134 and 36.206 of the DOJ's \n     regulations implement section 503 of the ADA, which prohibits \n     retaliation against any individual who exercises his or her \n     rights under the ADA. 28 CFR pt. 35, App. A at 464 & pt. 36, \n     App. B at 598 (section-by-section analysis). Sections 35.134 \n     and 36.206 are not provisions which implement a right or \n     protection applied to covered entities under section 210(b) \n     of the CAA and, therefore, they will not be included within \n     the adopted regulations. The Board notes, however, that \n     section 207 of the CAA provides a comprehensive retaliation \n     protection for employees (including applicants and former \n     employees) who may invoke their rights under section 210, \n     although section 207 does not apply to nonemployees who may \n     enjoy rights and protections against discrimination under \n     section 210.\n\n[[Page S5442]]\n\n       2. As noted above, unlike the Board in 1997, the current \n     Board has decided not to propose adoption of the DOJ Title II \n     regulation relating to employment discrimination, 28 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 35.140. The Board notes that since 1997 most courts \n     considering this issue have decided that employees of public \n     entities must use the procedures in Title I of the ADA to \n     pursue employment discrimination claims and that these claims \n     cannot be pursued under Title II. See, e.g., Brumfield v. \n     City of Chicago, 735 F.3d 619 (7th Cir. 2013); Elwell v. \n     Okla. ex rel. Bd. of Regents of the Univ. of Okla., 693 F.3d \n     1303 (10th Cir. 2012); Zimmerman v. Or. Dep't of Justice, 170 \n     F.3d 1169 (9th Cir. 1999). The prohibition against employment \n     discrimination because of disability in Title I of the ADA is \n     incorporated into section 201(a)(3) of the CAA. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1311(a)(3). Under section 210(c) of the CAA, ``with \n     respect to any claim of employment discrimination asserted by \n     any covered employee, the exclusive remedy shall be under \n     section 1311 of this title.'' 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(c). \n     Similarly, under section 225(e) of the CAA, ``[o]nly a \n     covered entity who has undertaken and completed the \n     procedures in sections 1402 and 1403 of this title may be \n     granted a remedy under part A of this subchapter.'' 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1361(e). When taken together, these sections of the CAA \n     make it clear that the exclusive method for obtaining relief \n     for employment discrimination because of disability is under \n     section 201, which involves using the counseling and \n     mediation procedures contained in sections 402 and 403 of the \n     CAA. For these reasons, the Board has found good cause not to \n     incorporate the DOJ Title II regulation relating to \n     employment discrimination, 28 C.F.R. Sec. 35.140, into these \n     regulations.\n       3. The Board has not incorporated Subpart F of the DOJ's \n     regulations (28 C.F.R. Sec. Sec. 35.170-35.189), which set \n     forth administrative enforcement procedures under Title II. \n     Subpart F implements the provisions of section 203 of the \n     ADA, which is applied to covered entities under section 210 \n     of the CAA. Although procedural in nature, such provisions \n     address the remedies, procedures, and rights under section \n     203 of the ADA, and thus the otherwise applicable provisions \n     of these regulations are ``substantive regulations'' for \n     section 210(e) purposes. See 142 Cong. Rec. at S5071-72 \n     (similar analysis under section 220(d) of the CAA). However, \n     since section 303 of the CAA reserves to the Executive \n     Director the authority to promulgate regulations that \n     ``govern the procedures of the Office,'' and since the Board \n     believes that the benefit of having one set of procedural \n     rules provides the ``good cause'' for modifying the DOJ's \n     regulations, the Board proposes to incorporate the provisions \n     of Subpart F into the Office's procedural rules, to omit \n     provisions that set forth procedures which conflict with \n     express provisions of section 210 of the CAA or are already \n     provided for under comparable provisions of the Office s \n     rules, and to omit rules with no applicability to the \n     Legislative Branch (such as provisions covering entities \n     subject to section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, provisions \n     regarding State immunity, and provisions regarding referral \n     of complaints to the Justice Department). See 142 Cong. Rec. \n     at S5071-72 (similar analysis and conclusion under section \n     220(d) of the CAA).\n       4. The Board has not incorporated Subpart G of the DOJ's \n     regulations, which designates the Federal agencies \n     responsible for investigating complaints under Title II of \n     the ADA. Given the structure of the CAA, such provisions are \n     not applicable to covered Legislative Branch entities and, \n     therefore, will not be adopted under section 210(e).\n       5. The Board has not incorporated the insurance provisions \n     contained in 28 C.F.R. Sec. 36.212. Section 36.212 of the \n     DOJ's regulations restates section 501(c) of the ADA, which \n     provides that the ADA shall not be construed to restrict \n     certain insurance practices on the part of insurance \n     companies and employers, so long as such practices are not \n     used to evade the purposes of the ADA. Section 501(c) of the \n     ADA is not incorporated by reference into section 210 of the \n     CAA. Because section 36.212 implements a section of the ADA \n     which is not incorporated into the CAA and appears intended \n     primarily to cover insurance companies which are not covered \n     entities under the CAA, the Board finds good cause not to \n     incorporate this regulation.\n       6. The Board has not incorporated Subpart E of the DOJ's \n     regulations (sections 36.501 through 36.599) setting forth \n     the enforcement procedures under Title III of the ADA. As the \n     Justice Department noted in its NPRM regarding subpart E, the \n     Department of Justice does not have the authority to \n     establish procedures for judicial review and enforcement and, \n     therefore, ``Subpart E generally restates the statutory \n     procedures for enforcement''. 28 CFR pt. 36, App. B at 638 \n     (section-by-section analysis). Additionally, the regulations \n     derive from the provisions of section 308 of the ADA, which \n     is not applied to covered entities under section 210(b) of \n     the CAA. Thus, the regulations in subpart E are not \n     promulgated by the Attorney General as substantive \n     regulations to implement the statutory provisions of the ADA \n     referred to in section 210(b), within the meaning of section \n     210(e).\n       7. The Board has not incorporated Subpart F of the DOJ's \n     regulations which establishes procedures to implement section \n     308(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the ADA regarding compliance with State \n     laws or building codes as evidence of compliance with \n     accessibility standards under the ADA. 28 CFR pt. 36, App. B \n     at 640 (section-by-section analysis). Section 308 is not one \n     of the laws applied to covered entities under section 210(b) \n     of the CAA and, therefore, these regulations will not be \n     adopted under section 210(e).\n       In section 1.105(d), the Board has listed the specific DOT \n     regulations incorporated into the regulations being issued \n     under section 210 of the CAA. As noted earlier, the Board has \n     adopted all of the DOT regulations implementing Titles II and \n     III of the ADA with the following exceptions:\n       1. Although the Board has adopted the definitions in \n     section 37.3 of the DOT's regulations, relating to \n     implementation of Part II of Title II of the ADA (sections \n     241 through 246), those definitions dealing with public \n     transportation by intercity and commuter rail are not adopted \n     because sections 241 through 246 of the ADA were not within \n     the rights and protections applied to covered entities under \n     section 210(b) and, therefore, the regulations implementing \n     such sections are not substantive regulations of the DOT \n     required to be adopted by the Board within the meaning of \n     section 210(e). Accordingly, the Board will give no effect to \n     the definitions of terms such as ``commerce,'' ``commuter \n     authority,'' ``commuter rail car,'' ``commuter rail \n     transportation,'' ``intercity rail passenger car,'' and \n     ``intercity rail transportation,'' which relate to sections \n     241 through 246 of the ADA.\n       2. Although the Board has adopted the Nondiscrimination \n     regulation set forth in section 37.5 of the DOT's \n     regulations, subsection (f) of section 37.5 of the this \n     regulation relates to private entities primarily engaged in \n     the business of transporting people and whose operations \n     affect commerce. This subsection implements section 304 of \n     the ADA, which is not a right or protection applied to \n     covered entities under section 210(b) of the CAA. See 56 Fed. \n     Reg. 13856, 13858 (April 4, 1991) (preamble to NPRM regarding \n     Part 37). Therefore, it is not a regulation of the DOT \n     included within the scope of rulemaking under section 210(e) \n     of the CAA and will not be considered by the Board to be \n     included in these regulations.\n       3. Several portions of the DOT's regulations refer to \n     obligations of entities regulated by state agencies \n     administering federal transportation funds. See, e.g., \n     sections 37.77(d) (requires filing of equivalent service \n     certificates with state administering agency), 37.135(f) \n     (submission of paratransit development plan to state \n     administering agency) and 37.145 (State comments on \n     paratransit plans). Any references to obligations not \n     imposed on covered entities, such as state law \n     requirements and laws regulating entities that receive \n     Federal financial assistance, will be considered excluded \n     from these proposed regulations.\n       4. The Board has not adopted section 37.11 of the DOT's \n     regulations relating to administrative enforcement because it \n     does not implement any provision of the ADA applied to \n     covered entities under section 210 of the CAA. Moreover, the \n     enforcement procedures of section 210 are explicitly provided \n     for in section 210(d) (``Available Procedures''). \n     Accordingly, this section will not be included within the \n     incorporated regulations. The subject matter of enforcement \n     procedures is addressed in the Office's procedural rules and \n     in Part 2 of these regulations.\n       5. Certain sections of Subparts B (Applicability) and C \n     (Transportation Facilities) of the Secretary's regulations \n     were promulgated to implement sections 242 and 304 of the \n     ADA, provisions that are not applied to covered entities \n     under section 210(b) of the CAA or are otherwise inapplicable \n     to Legislative Branch entities. Therefore, the Board will \n     exclude the following sections from its substantive \n     regulations on that basis: 37.21(a)(2) and (b) (relating to \n     private entities under section 304 of the ADA and private \n     entities receiving Federal assistance from the Transportation \n     Department), 37.25 (university transportation systems), 37.29 \n     (private taxi services), 37.33 (airport transportation \n     systems), 37.37(a) and 37.37(e)-(g) (relating to coverage of \n     private entities and other entities under section 304 of the \n     ADA), and 37.49-37.57 (relating to intercity and commuter \n     rail systems). Similarly, the Board proposes modifying \n     sections 37.21(c), 37.37(d), and 37.37(h) and other sections \n     where references are made to requirements or circumstances \n     strictly encompassed by the provisions of section 304 of the \n     ADA and, therefore, not applicable to covered entities under \n     the CAA. See, e.g., sections 37.25-37.27 (transportation for \n     elementary and secondary education systems).\n       6. Subpart D (sections 37.71 through 37.95) of the DOT's \n     regulations relate to acquisition of accessible vehicles by \n     public entities. Certain sections of subpart D were \n     promulgated to implement sections 242 and 304 of the ADA, \n     which were not applied to covered entities under section \n     210(b) of the CAA, or are otherwise inapplicable to \n     Legislative Branch entities. Therefore, the Board will \n     exclude the following sections from its substantive \n     regulations on that basis: 37.87-37.91 and 37.93(b) (relating \n     to intercity and commuter rail service).\n       7. Subpart E (sections 37.101 through 37.109) of the DOT's \n     regulations relates to acquisition of accessible vehicles by \n     private entities. Section 37.101, relating to acquisition of \n     vehicles by private entities not primarily engaged in the \n     business of transporting people, implements section 302 of \n     the ADA, which is applied to covered entities under section \n     210(b). Therefore, the Board will adopt section 37.101 as \n     part of its section 210(e) regulations. Sections 37.103, \n     37.107, and 37.109 of the regulations implement section 304 \n     of the ADA, which is inapplicable to covered entities under \n     the ADA. Therefore, the Board\n\n[[Page S5443]]\n\n     proposes not to include them within its substantive \n     regulations under section 210(e) of the CAA.\n       8. Part 37 of the DOT's regulations includes several \n     appendices, only two of which the Board proposes to adopt as \n     part of these regulations. The Board proposes to adopt as an \n     appendix to these regulations Appendix A (Modifications to \n     Standards for Accessible Transportation Facilities, ADA \n     Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities), which \n     provides guidance regarding the design, construction, and \n     alteration of buildings and facilities covered by Titles II \n     and III of the ADA. 49 CFR pt. 37, App. A. Such guidelines, \n     where not inconsistent with express provisions of the CAA or \n     of the regulations adopted by the Board, may be relied upon \n     by covered entities and other in proceedings under section \n     210 of the CAA to the same extent as similarly situated \n     persons may rely upon them in actions brought under Title II \n     and Title III of the ADA. See 142 Cong. Rec. at S222 and 141 \n     Cong. Rec. at S17606 (similar resolution regarding Secretary \n     of Labor's interpretative bulletins under the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act for section 203 purposes). The Board proposes \n     not to adopt Appendix B, which gives the addresses of FTA \n     regional offices. Such information is not relevant to covered \n     entities under the CAA. The Board also proposes not to adopt \n     Appendix C, which contain forms for certification of \n     equivalent service. These forms appears to be irrelevant to \n     entities covered by the CAA and therefore will not be adopted \n     by the Board. Finally, the Board will adopt Appendix D to \n     Part 37, the section-by-section analysis of Part 37. The \n     Board notes that the section-by-section analysis may have \n     some relevance in interpreting the sections of Part 37 that \n     the Board has adopted.\n       9. The Board proposes to adopt, with minimal technical and \n     nomenclature changes, the regulations contained in Part 38 \n     and accompanying appendix, with the exception of the \n     following subparts which the Board has determined implement \n     portions of the ADA not applied to covered entities under \n     section 210(b) of the CAA and/or the Board believe have no \n     conceivable applicability to legislative branch operations: \n     Subpart E, Commuter Rail Cars and Systems; and Subpart F, \n     Intercity Rail Cars and Systems.\n       In section 1.105(d), the Board has proposed the adoption of \n     one regulation promulgated by the Access Board, 36 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 1190.34, relating to the accessibility of leased \n     buildings and facilities. While the DOJ does not have a \n     regulation pertaining to leased buildings and facilities, the \n     Access Board has promulgated this regulation that sets \n     minimal accessible standards whenever the federal government \n     leases a building or facility (or a portion thereof). \n     Generally, this regulation requires that fully accessible \n     space be leased when available, but also sets some minimal \n     accessibility requirements when fully accessible spaces are \n     not available. These minimum requirements include at least \n     one accessible entrance, an accessible route to major \n     function areas, an accessible toilet, and accessible parking \n     (if that is included in the rent). If there is no space \n     available that meets even these minimal requirements, the \n     regulation does contain an exception that would permit the \n     short term leasing of spaces that do not even meet these \n     minimal standards. The most common ADA public access \n     complaint received by the General Counsel from members of the \n     public relates to the lack of ADA access to spaces being \n     leased by legislative branch offices. The Board therefore \n     finds good cause to clarify the ADA access obligations \n     regarding leased spaces by adopting 36 C.F.R. Sec. 1190.34.\n       Regulations proposed in Part 2.\n       Sec. 2.101 Purpose and scope. This section references and \n     notes that Part 2 of these regulations implements section \n     210(d) of the CAA which requires that the General Counsel \n     accept and investigate charges of discrimination filed by \n     qualified individuals with disabilities who allege a \n     violation of Title II or Title III of the ADA by a covered \n     entity. It also notes that by procedural rule or policy, the \n     General Counsel or the Office may further describe how the \n     General Counsel will exercise the statutory authority \n     provided by section 210(d) of the CAA. The Board notes that \n     the Executive Director is proposing amendments to the \n     Office's Procedural Rules that do include provisions relating \n     to section 210(d) of the CAA.\n       Sec. 2.102 Definitions. This section provides definitions \n     for the undefined terms used in section 210(d) of the CAA. In \n     Sec. 2.102(a), the term ``charge'' is defined in a manner \n     consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in Fed. Express \n     Corp. v. Holowecki, 552 U.S. 389, 402 (2008). In \n     Sec. 2.102(b), the definition of the term ``file a charge'' \n     clarifies how charges can be presented to the General Counsel \n     by listing the methods by which the General Counsel has \n     accepted charges in the past. In Sec. 2.102(c), the term \n     ``occurrence of the alleged violation'' is defined in a \n     manner that includes both isolated acts of discrimination and \n     continuing violations. See, e.g., Havens Realty Corp. v. \n     Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 380 (1982). In Sec. 2.102(d), the term \n     ``the rights and protections against discrimination in the \n     provision of public services and accommodations'' is defined \n     by referencing the specific sections of Titles II and III \n     that are incorporated into the CAA in section 210(b)(1). 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1331(b)(1).\n       Sec. 2.103 Investigatory Authority. This section explains \n     the investigatory methods that the General Counsel will use \n     when investigating charges of discrimination and clarifies \n     the duty of cooperation owed by all parties. The language \n     used to describe the investigatory methods listed in \n     Sec. 2.103(a) is derived from the Supreme Court's decision in \n     Dow Chemical Co. v. United States, 476 U.S. 227, 233 (1986) \n     which describes what is intended when an agency is granted \n     investigatory authority that is not otherwise defined in the \n     statute. The duty to cooperate with investigations described \n     in Sec. 2.103(b) is implicit in the CAA. By empowering the \n     General Counsel to investigate potential violations of the \n     the ADA, Congress expressed its expectation that legislative \n     branch employees and offices would cooperate fully with \n     investigations conducted by the General Counsel pursuant to \n     this authority. This regulation is consistent with prior \n     policy guidance the General Counsel has provided to covered \n     entities.\n       Sec. 2.104 Mediation. This section explains when the \n     General Counsel will request mediation of a charge of \n     discrimination. The language in Sec. 2.104(a) is derived from \n     section 210(d)(2) of the CAA. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(d)(2). The \n     explanation of what happens when mediation results in a \n     settlement is contained in Sec. 2.104(b) and is consistent \n     with the language in section 210(d)(3) and with the General \n     Counsel's past practice of closing cases that are resolved \n     during mediation. The language in Sec. 2.104(c) is derived \n     from section 210(d)(3) of the CAA. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(d)(3).\n       Sec. 2.105 Complaint. The language in this section is is \n     derived from section 210(d)(3) of the CAA. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1331(d)(3).\n       Sec. 2.106 Intervention by charging individual. The \n     language in this section is is derived from section 210(d)(3) \n     of the CAA. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(d)(3).\n       Sec. 2.107 Remedies and Compliance. This section describes \n     the remedies available and the compliance dates when a \n     violation of section 210 is found. The remedy language in \n     Sec. 2.107(a) is based upon the statutory language in section \n     210(c) of the CAA. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(d)(3). The allowance of \n     attorney's fees and costs described in Sec. 2.107(a)(1) is \n     based upon the language in 28 C.F.R. Sec. 35.175 & 36.505 \n     which recognize that attorney's fees may be awarded under \n     both Titles II and III of the ADA. The availability of \n     compensatory damages described in Sec. 2.107(a)(2) derives \n     from sections 210(c) and of the CAA which incorporates by \n     reference the remedies contained sections 203 and 308(a) of \n     the ADA. Section 203 of the ADA provides that the remedies \n     set forth in the Rehabilitation Act (at 29 U.S.C. Sec. 794a) \n     shall be the remedies for violations of Title II of the ADA. \n     The Supreme Court has made clear that the remedies available \n     under Title II of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act are \n     ``coextensive with the remedies available in a private cause \n     of action brought under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of \n     1964'' which includes compensatory, but not punitive, \n     damages. Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U.S. 181, 185 (2002). The \n     language in Sec. 2.107(a)(1) & (a)(2) requiring that payment \n     be made by the covered entity responsible for correcting the \n     violation is from section 415(c) of the CAA which requires \n     that funds to correct ADA violations ``may be paid only from \n     funds appropriated to the employing office or entity \n     responsible for correcting such violations.'' 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1415(c). The compliance date set forth in Sec. 2.107(b) \n     is from section 210(d)(5) of the CAA. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1331(d)(5).\n       Sec. 2.108 Judicial Review. This section is from section \n     210(d)(4) of the CAA. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(d)(4).\n       Regulations proposed in Part 3.\n       Sec. 3.101 Purpose and scope. This section references and \n     notes that Part 3 of these regulations implements section \n     210(f) of the CAA which requires that the General Counsel, on \n     a regular basis, at least once each Congress, inspect the \n     facilities of covered entities to ensure compliance with the \n     Titles II and III of the ADA and to prepare and submit a \n     report to Congress containing the results of the periodic \n     inspections, describing any violations, assessing any \n     limitations in accessibility, and providing the estimated \n     cost and time needed for abatement. It also notes that by \n     procedural rule or policy, the General Counsel or the Office \n     may further describe how the General Counsel will exercise \n     the statutory authority provided by section 210(d) of the \n     CAA. The Board notes that the Executive Director is proposing \n     amendments to the Office's Procedural Rules that do include \n     provisions relating to section 210(f) of the CAA.\n       Sec. 3.102 Definitions. This section defines terms used in \n     section 210(f) of the CAA which are not defined in the \n     statute. In Sec. 3.102(a), the term ``facilities of covered \n     entities'' is defined. The term ``facility'' is defined in 28 \n     C.F.R. Sec. 35.104, which is incorporated by reference into \n     these regulations. See Sec. 1.105(c). ``Facilities of covered \n     entities'' is defined to include all facilities where covered \n     entities provide public programs, activities, services or \n     accommodations, including those facilities designed, \n     maintained, altered or constructed by a covered entity. \n     Because the General Counsel's inspections under section \n     210(f) of the CAA are focused upon finding barriers to access \n     in facilities, the term ``violation'' is defined in \n     Sec. 3.102(b) as any barrier to access caused by \n     noncompliance with the applicable standards. The definition \n     of ``estimated cost and time needed for abatement'' was \n     developed in consultation with Office of the Architect of the \n     Capitol which proposed that reporting regarding estimated \n     abatement cost and time be provided using a range of dollar \n     amounts and dates due to the difficulty in precisely \n     estimating such costs and dates.\n       Sec. 3.103 Inspection authority. This section describes the \n     general scope of the General\n\n[[Page S5444]]\n\n     Counsel's inspection authority [Sec. 3.103(a)] and recognizes \n     that the General Counsel has the right to review information \n     and documents [Sec. 3.103(b)], receive cooperation from \n     covered entities [Sec. 3.103(c)], and become involved in pre-\n     construction review of alteration and construction projects \n     [Sec. 3.103(d)].\n       The general scope of authority in Sec. 3.103(a) is derived \n     from the language in section 210(f)(1) of the CAA. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1331(f)(1). This subsection also describes the \n     discretion that the General Counsel has exercised when \n     conducting these inspections since the enactment of the CAA.\n       The document and information review described in \n     Sec. 3.103(b) recognizes that a thorough inspection of \n     facilities can require the review of documents and other \n     information to ascertain whether a covered entity is in \n     compliance with the ADA. The language in this subsection is \n     based upon prior policy guidance the General Counsel has \n     provided to covered entities.\n       The duty to cooperate with inspections described in \n     Sec. 3.103(c), like the duty to cooperate with investigations \n     described in Sec. 2.103(b), is implicit in the CAA. By \n     empowering the General Counsel to inspect all facilities for \n     potential violations of the the ADA, Congress expressed its \n     expectation that legislative branch employees and offices \n     would cooperate fully with such inspections conducted by the \n     General Counsel pursuant to this authority. This regulation \n     is consistent with prior policy guidance the General Counsel \n     has provided to covered entities.\n       The pre-construction review of alteration and construction \n     projects described in Sec. 3.103(d) was developed after \n     consultation with the Office of the Architect of the Capitol \n     and addresses concerns raised by oversight and appropriations \n     staff over finding a cost efficient process that would allow \n     better identification and elimination of potential ADA \n     compliance issues during the pre-construction phases of new \n     construction and alteration projects.\n       Sec. 3.104 Reporting, estimating cost & time and compliance \n     date. This section describes the reporting obligations of the \n     General Counsel set forth in section 210(f)(2) of the CAA. 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1331(f)(2). The language in Sec. 3.104(a) is \n     directly from section 210(f)(2) of the CAA. Subsection \n     3.104(b) merely recognizes that the General Counsel needs the \n     cooperation of covered entities to provide the cost and time \n     estimates for abatement required by section 210(f)(2). The \n     compliance date set forth in Sec. 3.104(c) is from section \n     210(d)(5) of the CAA. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(d)(5).\n     Proposed Regulations:\n\nPART 1--MATTERS OF GENERAL APPLICABILITY TO ALL REGULATIONS PROMULGATED \n   UNDER SECTION 210 OF THE CONGRESSIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1995\n\n       Sec. 1.101 PURPOSE AND SCOPE\n       Sec. 1.102 DEFINITIONS\n       Sec. 1.103 AUTHORITY OF THE BOARD\n       Sec. 1.104 METHOD FOR IDENTIFYING THE ENTITY RESPONSIBLE \n     FOR CORRECTING VIOLATIONS OF SECTION 210\n       Sec. 1.105 REGULATIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE\n\n     Sec. 1.101 Purpose and scope.\n\n       (a) CAA. Enacted into law on January 23, 1995, the \n     Congressional Accountability Act (``CAA'') in Section 210(b) \n     provides that the rights and protections against \n     discrimination in the provision of public services and \n     accommodations established by the provisions of Title II and \n     III (Sections 201 through 230, 302, 303, and 309) of the \n     Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 12131-12150, 12182, 12183, and 12189 (``ADA'') \n     shall apply to the following entities:\n       (1) each office of the Senate, including each office of a \n     Senator and each committee;\n       (2) each office of the House of Representatives, including \n     each office of a Member of the House of Representatives and \n     each committee;\n       (3) each joint committee of the Congress;\n       (4) the Office of Congressional Accessibility Services;\n       (5) the United States Capitol Police;\n       (6) the Congressional Budget Office;\n       (7) the Office of the Architect of the Capitol (including \n     the Botanic Garden);\n       (8) the Office of the Attending Physician; and\n       (9) the Office of Compliance;\n       Title II of the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis \n     of disability in the provision of public services, programs, \n     activities by any ``public entity.'' Section 210(b)(2) of the \n     CAA provides that for the purpose of applying Title II of the \n     ADA the term ``public entity'' means any entity listed above \n     that provides public services, programs, or activities. Title \n     III of the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of \n     disability by public accommodations and requires places of \n     public accommodation and commercial facilities to be \n     designed, constructed, and altered in compliance with \n     accessibility standards. Section 225(f) of the CAA provides \n     that, ``[e]xcept where inconsistent with definitions and \n     exemptions provided in this Act, the definitions and \n     exemptions of the [ADA] shall apply under this Act.'' 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1361(f)(1).\n       Section 210(d) of the CAA requires that the General Counsel \n     of the Office of Compliance accept and investigate charges of \n     discrimination filed by qualified individuals with \n     disabilities who allege a violation of Title II or Title III \n     of the ADA by a covered entity. If the General Counsel \n     believes that a violation may have occurred, the General \n     Counsel may file with the Office a complaint against any \n     entity responsible for correcting the violation. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1361(d).\n       Section 210(f) of the CAA requires that the General Counsel \n     of the Office of Compliance on a regular basis, and at least \n     once each Congress, conduct periodic inspections of all \n     covered facilities and to report to Congress on compliance \n     with disability access standards under Section 210. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1331(f).\n       (b) Purpose and scope of regulations. The regulations set \n     forth herein (Parts 1, 2, and 3) are the substantive \n     regulations that the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance has promulgated pursuant to Section 210(e) of the \n     CAA. Part 1 contains the general provisions applicable to all \n     regulations under Section 210, the method of identifying \n     entities responsible for correcting a violation of Section \n     210, and the list of executive branch regulations \n     incorporated by reference which define and clarify the \n     prohibition against discrimination on the basis of disability \n     in the provision of public services and accommodations. Part \n     2 contains the provisions pertaining to investigation and \n     prosecution of charges of discrimination. Part 3 contains the \n     provisions regarding the periodic inspections and reports to \n     Congress on compliance with the disability access standards.\n\n     Sec. 1.102 Definitions.\n\n       Except as otherwise specifically provided in these \n     regulations, as used in these regulations:\n       (a) Act or CAA means the Congressional Accountability Act \n     of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-1, 109 Stat. 3, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1301-\n     1438).\n       (b) ADA means the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 \n     (42 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 12131-12150, 12182, 12183, and 12189) as \n     applied to covered entities by Section 210 of the CAA.\n       (c) Covered entity and public entity include any of the \n     entities listed in Sec. 1.101(a) that provide public \n     services, programs, or activities, or operates a place of \n     public accommodation within the meaning of Section 210 of the \n     CAA. In the regulations implementing Title III, private \n     entity includes covered entities.\n       (d) Board means the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance.\n       (e) Office means the Office of Compliance.\n       (f) General Counsel means the General Counsel of the Office \n     of Compliance.\n       Sec. 1.103 Authority of the Board.\n       Pursuant to Sections 210 and 304 of the CAA, the Board is \n     authorized to issue regulations to implement the rights and \n     protections against discrimination on the basis of disability \n     in the provision of public services and accommodations under \n     the ADA. Section 210(e) of the CAA directs the Board to \n     promulgate regulations implementing Section 210 that are \n     ``the same as substantive regulations promulgated by the \n     Attorney General and the Secretary of Transportation to \n     implement the statutory provisions referred to in subsection \n     (b) except to the extent that the Board may determine, for \n     good cause shown and stated together with the regulation, \n     that a modification of such regulations would be more \n     effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections under this section.'' 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(e). \n     Specifically, it is the Board's considered judgment, based on \n     the information available to it at the time of promulgation \n     of these regulations, that, with the exception of the \n     regulations adopted and set forth herein, there are no other \n     ``substantive regulations promulgated by the Attorney General \n     and the Secretary of Transportation to implement the \n     statutory provisions referred to in subsection (b) [of \n     Section 210 of the CAA]'' that need be adopted.\n       In promulgating these regulations, the Board has made \n     certain technical and nomenclature changes to the regulations \n     as promulgated by the Attorney General and the Secretary of \n     Transportation. Such changes are intended to make the \n     provisions adopted accord more naturally to situations in the \n     Legislative Branch. However, by making these changes, the \n     Board does not intend a substantive difference between these \n     regulations and those of the Attorney General and/or the \n     Secretary from which they are derived. Moreover, such \n     changes, in and of themselves, are not intended to constitute \n     an interpretation of the regulations or of the statutory \n     provisions of the CAA upon which they are based.\n\n     Sec. 1.104 Method for identifying the entity responsible for \n       correction of violations of section 210.\n\n       (a) Purpose and scope. Section 210(e)(3) of the CAA \n     provides that regulations under Section 210(e) include a \n     method of identifying, for purposes of this section and for \n     categories of violations of Section 210(b), the entity \n     responsible for correcting a particular violation. This \n     section sets forth the method for identifying responsible \n     entities for the purpose of allocating responsibility for \n     correcting violations of Section 210(b).\n       (b) Violations. A covered entity may violate Section 210(b) \n     if it discriminates against a qualified individual with a \n     disability within the meaning of Title II or Title III of the \n     ADA.\n       (c) Entities Responsible for Correcting Violations. \n     Correction of a violation of the rights and protections \n     against discrimination is the responsibility of the entities \n     listed in subsection (a) of Section 210 of the CAA that \n     provide the specific public service, program, activity, or \n     accommodation that forms the basis for the particular \n     violation of Title II or Title III rights and protections \n     and, when the violation involves a physical\n\n[[Page S5445]]\n\n     access barrier, the entities responsible for designing, \n     maintaining, managing, altering or constructing the facility \n     in which the specific public service program, activity or \n     accommodation is conducted or provided.\n       (d) Allocation of Responsibility for Correction of Title II \n     and/or Title III Violations. Where more than one entity is \n     found to be an entity responsible for correction of a \n     violation of Title II and/or Title III rights and protections \n     under the method set forth in this section, as between those \n     parties, allocation of responsibility for correcting the \n     violations of Title II or Title III of the ADA may be \n     determined by statute, contract, order, or other enforceable \n     arrangement or relationship.\n\n     Sec. 1.105 Regulations incorporated by reference.\n\n       (a) Technical and Nomenclature Changes to Regulations \n     Incorporated by Reference. The definitions in the regulations \n     incorporated by reference (``incorporated regulations'') \n     shall be used to interpret these regulations except when they \n     differ from the definitions in Sec. 1.102 or the \n     modifications listed below, in which case the definition in \n     Sec. 1.102 or the modification listed below shall be used. \n     The incorporated regulations are hereby modified as follows:\n       (1) When the incorporated regulations refer to ``Assistant \n     Attorney General,'' ``Department of Justice,'' ``FTA \n     Administrator,'' ``FTA regional office,'' ``Administrator,'' \n     ``Secretary,'' or any other executive branch office or \n     officer, ``General Counsel'' is hereby substituted.\n       (2) When the incorporated regulations refer to the date \n     ``January 26, 1992,'' the date ``January 1, 1997'' is hereby \n     substituted.\n       (3) When the incorporated regulations otherwise specify a \n     date by which some action must be completed, the date that is \n     three years from the effective date of these regulations is \n     hereby substituted.\n       (4) When the incorporated regulations contain an exception \n     for an ``historic'' property, building, or facility that \n     exception shall apply to properties, buildings, or facilities \n     designated as an historic or heritage asset by the Office of \n     the Architect of the Capitol in accordance with its \n     preservation policy and standards and where, in accordance \n     with its preservation policy and standards, the Office of the \n     Architect of the Capitol determines that compliance with the \n     requirements for accessible routes, entrances, or toilet \n     facilities would threaten or destroy the historic \n     significance of the building or facility, the exceptions for \n     alterations to qualified historic buildings or facilities for \n     that element shall be permitted to apply.\n       (b) Rule of Interpretation. When a covered entity is \n     subject to conflicting regulations implementing both Title II \n     and Title III of the ADA, the regulation providing the most \n     access shall apply.\n       (c) Incorporated Regulations from 28 C.F.R.

Part 2 of these regulations contains the provisions \n     pertaining to investigation and prosecution of charges of \n     discrimination. By procedural rule or policy, the General \n     Counsel or the Office may further describe how the General \n     Counsel will exercise the statutory authority provided by \n     Section 210.\n\n     Sec. 2.102 Definitions.\n\n       (a) Charge means any written document from a qualified \n     individual with a disability or that individual's designated \n     representative which suggests or alleges that a covered \n     entity denied that individual the rights and protections \n     against discrimination in the provision of public services \n     and accommodations provided in Section 210(b)(1) of the CAA.\n       (b) File a charge means providing a charge to the General \n     Counsel in person, by mail, by electronic transmission, or by \n     any other means used by the General Counsel to receive \n     documents. Charges shall be filed within 180 days of the \n     occurrence of the alleged violation.\n       (c) The occurrence of the alleged violation means the later \n     of (1) the date on which the charging individual was \n     allegedly discriminated against; or (2) the last date on \n     which the service, activity, program or public accommodation \n     described by the charging party was operated in a way that \n     denied access in the manner alleged by the charging party.\n       (d) The rights and protections against discrimination in \n     the provision of public services and accommodations means all \n     of the rights and protections provided by Section 210(b)(1) \n     of the CAA through incorporation of Sections 201 through 230, \n     203, 303, and 309 of the ADA and by the regulations issued by \n     the Board to implement Section 210 of the CAA.\n\n     Sec. 2.103 Investigatory Authority.\n\n       (a) Investigatory Methods.

The authorized methods of \n     investigation include, but are not limited to, the following: \n     (1) requiring the parties to provide or produce ready access \n     to: all physical areas subject to an inspection or \n     investigation, individuals with relevant knowledge concerning \n     the inspection or investigation who can be interviewed or \n     questioned, and documents pertinent to the investigation; and \n     (2) requiring the parties to provide written answers to \n     questions, statements of position, and any other information \n     relating to a potential violation or demonstrating \n     compliance.\n       (b) Duty to Cooperate with Investigations. Charging \n     individuals and covered entities shall cooperate with \n     investigations conducted by the General Counsel. Cooperation \n     includes providing timely responses to reasonable requests \n     for information and documents (including the making and \n     retention of copies of records and documents), allowing the \n     General Counsel to review documents and interview relevant \n     witnesses confidentially and without managerial interference \n     or influence, and granting the General Counsel ready access \n     to all facilities where covered services, programs and \n     activities are being provided and all places of public \n     accommodation.\n\n     Sec. 2.104  Mediation.\n\n       (a) Belief that violation may have occurred. If, after \n     investigation, the General Counsel believes that a violation \n     of the ADA may have occurred and that mediation may be \n     helpful in resolving the dispute, prior to filing a \n     complaint, the General Counsel may request, but not \n     participate in, mediation under subsections (b) through (d) \n     of Section 403 of the CAA between the charging individual and \n     any entity responsible for correcting the alleged violation.\n       (b) Settlement. If, prior to the filing of a complaint, the \n     charging individual and the entity responsible for correcting \n     the violation reach a settlement agreement that fully \n     resolves the dispute, the General Counsel shall close the \n     investigation of the charge without taking further action.\n       (c) Mediation Unsuccessful. If mediation under (a) has not \n     succeeded in resolving the dispute, and if the General \n     Counsel believes that a violation of the ADA may have \n     occurred, the General Counsel may file with the Office a \n     complaint against any entity responsible for correcting the \n     violation.\n\n     Sec. 2.105  Complaint.\n\n       The complaint filed by the General Counsel shall be \n     submitted to a hearing officer for decision pursuant to \n     subsections (b) through (h) of Section 405 of the CAA.

The remedy for a violation of Section 210 of \n     the CAA shall be such remedy as would be appropriate if \n     awarded under Section 203 or 308(a) of the ADA.\n       (1) Attorney Fees and Costs. In any action commenced \n     pursuant to Section 210 of the CAA by the General Counsel, \n     when a charging individual has intervened, the hearing \n     officer and the Board, in their discretion, may allow the \n     prevailing charging individual a reasonable attorney's fee, \n     including litigation expenses, and costs, and the covered \n     entity responsible for correcting the violation shall pay \n     such fees, expenses and costs from its appropriated funds as \n     part of the funds to correct violations of Section 210 under \n     Section 415(c) of the CAA.\n       (2) Compensatory Damages. In any action commenced pursuant \n     to Section 210 of the CAA by the General Counsel, when a \n     charging individual has intervened, the hearing officer and \n     the Board, in their discretion, may award compensatory \n     damages to the prevailing charging individual, and the \n     covered entity responsible for correcting the violation shall \n     pay such compensatory damages from its appropriated funds as \n     part of the funds to correct violations of Section 210 under \n     Section 415(c) of the CAA.\n       (b) Compliance Date. Compliance shall take place as soon as \n     possible, but no later than the fiscal year following the end \n     of the fiscal year in which the order requiring correction \n     becomes final and not subject to further review.\n\n     Sec. 2.108  Judicial Review.\n\n       A charging individual who has intervened or any respondent \n     to the complaint, if aggrieved by a final decision of the \n     Board, may file a petition for review in the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, pursuant to Section \n     407 of the CAA.\n       PART 3--MATTERS PERTAINING TO PERIODIC INSPECTIONS AND \n     REPORTING.\n       Sec. 3.101  PURPOSE AND SCOPE\n       Sec. 3.102  DEFINITIONS\n       Sec. 3.103  INSPECTION AUTHORITY\n       Sec. 3.104  REPORTING, ESTIMATED COST & TIME AND COMPLIANCE\n\n     Sec. 3.101 Purpose and scope.\n\n       Section 210(f) of the CAA requires that the General \n     Counsel, on a regular basis, at least once each Congress, \n     inspect the facilities of covered entities to ensure \n     compliance with the Titles II and III of the ADA and to \n     prepare and submit a report to Congress containing the \n     results of the periodic inspections, describing any \n     violations, assessing any limitations in accessibility, and \n     providing the estimated cost and time needed for abatement. \n     Part 3 of these regulations contains the provisions \n     pertaining to these inspection and reporting duties.

The General Counsel may receive requests for \n     ADA inspections, including anonymous requests, and conduct \n     inspections for compliance with Titles II and III of\n\n[[Page S5447]]\n\n     the ADA in the same manner that the General Counsel receives \n     and investigates requests for inspections under Section \n     215(c)(1) of the CAA.\n       (b) Review of information and documents. When conducting \n     inspections under Section 210(f) of the CAA, the General \n     Counsel may request, obtain, and review any and all \n     information or documents deemed by the General Counsel to be \n     relevant to a determination of whether the covered entity is \n     in compliance with Section 210 of the CAA.\n       (c) Duty to cooperate.

Section 303 (2 U.S.C. \n     1383) directs that the Executive Director, as the Chief \n     Operating Officer of the agency, adopt rules of procedure \n     governing the Office of Compliance, subject to approval by \n     the Board of Directors of the Office.\n       The rules of procedure establish the process by which \n     alleged violations of the 13 laws made applicable to the \n     Legislative Branch under the CAA will be considered and \n     resolved. Subpart A covers general provisions pertaining to \n     scope and policy, definitions, and information on various \n     filings and computation of time. Proposed Amendments to \n     Subpart A provide for electronic filing and clarify \n     requirements and procedures concerning confidentiality. \n     Subpart B provides procedures for counseling, mediation, and \n     election between filing an administrative complaint with the \n     Office of Compliance or filing a civil action in U.S. \n     District Court. A new Subpart C of the Procedural Rules sets \n     forth the proposed rules and procedures for enforcement of \n     the inspection, investigation and complaint sections 210(d) \n     and (f) of the CAA relating to Public Services and \n     Accommodations under Titles II and III of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act (ADA). Subpart C has been reserved for these \n     rules since 1995. Because the Office of the General Counsel \n     conducts ADA inspections and investigates ADA charges using \n     procedures that are similar to what are used in its \n     Occupational, Safety and Health (OSH) inspections and \n     investigations conducted under section 215 of the CAA, the \n     procedural rules are similar to what are contained in Subpart \n     D of the Procedural Rules relating to OSH inspections and \n     investigations. The proposed Amendments to Subpart D clarify \n     potential ambiguities in the rules and procedures and make \n     modifications in terminology to better comport with the \n     statutory language used in Section 215 of the CAA. Subparts \n     E, F, and G include the process for the conduct of \n     administrative hearings held as the result of the\n\n[[Page S5448]]\n\n     filing of an administrative complaint. Subpart H sets forth \n     the procedures for appeals of decisions by hearing officers \n     to the Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance and for \n     appeals of decisions by the Board of Directors to the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Proposed \n     Amendments to Subpart H also reference procedures for other \n     proceedings before the Board. Subpart I of the Rules contain \n     other matters of general applicability to the dispute \n     resolution process and to the operation of the Office of \n     Compliance, including proposed Amendments concerning \n     attorney's fees and violations of formal settlement \n     agreements.\n       These proposed amendments to the Rules of Procedure are the \n     result of the experience of the Office in processing disputes \n     under the CAA since the original adoption of these Rules in \n     1995. The proposed Amendments to Subpart D of the Procedural \n     Rules reflect the experience of the Office of General Counsel \n     in conducting OSH inspections and investigations since 1995.\n\n\n       EXPLANATION REGARDING THE TEXT OF THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS\n\n       Material from the 2004 version of the Rules is printed in \n     roman type. The text of the proposed amendments shows \n      deletions in italicized type within bold italics brackets  \n     and added text in bold.

Nothing in these rules prohibits a party or \n     its representative from disclosing information obtained in \n     confidential proceedings when reasonably necessary to \n     investigate claims, ensure compliance with the Act or prepare \n     its prosecution or defense. However, the party making the \n     disclosure shall take all reasonably appropriate steps to \n     ensure that persons to whom the information is disclosed \n     maintain the confidentiality of such information. These rules \n     do not preclude a mediator from consulting with the Office, \n     except that when the covered employee is an employee of the \n     Office a mediator shall not consult with any individual \n     within the Office who might be a party or witness. These \n     rules do not preclude the Office from reporting statistical \n     information to the Senate and House of Representatives. \n       (e) Waiver.

Section 416(a) of the CAA provides that \n     counseling under section 402 shall be strictly confidential, \n     except that the Office and a covered employee may agree to \n     notify the employing office of the allegations. Section \n     416(b) provides that all mediation shall be strictly \n     confidential. Section 416(c) provides that all proceedings \n     and deliberations of Hearing Officers and the Board, \n     including any related records shall be confidential, except \n     for release of records necessary for judicial actions, access \n     by certain committees of Congress, and, in accordance with \n     section 416(f), publication of certain final decisions. \n     Section 416(c) does not apply to proceedings under section \n     215 of the Act, but does apply to the deliberations of \n     Hearing Officers and the Board under section 215. See also \n     sections 1.06, 5.04, and 7.12 of these rules.\n       (b) Prohibition. Unless specifically authorized by the \n     provisions of the CAA or by order of the Board, the Hearing \n     Officer or a court, or by the procedural rules of the Office, \n     no participant in counseling, mediation or other proceedings \n     made confidential under section 416 of the CAA \n     (``confidential proceedings'') may disclose the contents or \n     records of those proceedings to any person or entity, Nothing \n     in these rules prohibits a bona fide representative of a \n     party under section 1.05 from engaging in communications with \n     that party for the purpose of participation in the \n     proceedings, provided that such disclosure is not made in the \n     presence of individuals not reasonably necessary to the \n     representative's representation of that party. Moreover, \n     nothing in these rules prohibits a party or its \n     representative from disclosing information obtained in \n     confidential proceedings for the limited purposes of \n     investigating claims, ensuring compliance with the Act or \n     preparing its prosecution or defense, to the extent that such \n     disclosure is reasonably necessary to accomplish the \n     aforementioned purposes and provided that the party making \n     the disclosure takes all reasonably appropriate steps to \n     ensure that persons to whom the information is disclosed \n     maintain the confidentiality of such information.\n       (c) Participant. For the purposes of this rule, participant \n     means any individual or party, including a designated \n     representative, that becomes a participant in counseling \n     under section 402, mediation under section 403, the complaint \n     and hearing process under section 405, or an appeal to the \n     Board under section 406 of the Act, or any related proceeding \n     which is expressly or by necessity deemed confidential under \n     the Act or these rules. \n       (d) Contents or Records of Confidential Proceedings.

A participant is free to disclose facts and other \n     information obtained from any source outside of the \n     confidential proceedings. For example, an employing office or \n     its representatives may disclose information about its \n     employment practices and personnel actions, provided that the \n     information was not obtained in a confidential proceeding. \n     However, an employee who obtains that information in \n     mediation or other confidential proceeding may not disclose \n     such information. Similarly, information forming the basis \n     for the allegation of a complaining employee may be disclosed \n     by that employee, provided that the information contained in \n     those allegations was not obtained in a confidential \n     proceeding. However, the employing office or its \n     representatives may not disclose that information if it was \n     obtained a confidential proceeding. \n       (e) Violation of Confidentiality. Any complaint regarding a \n     violation of the confidentiality provisions must be made to \n     the Executive Director no later than 30 days after the date \n     of the alleged violation. Such complaints may be referred by \n     the Executive Director to a Hearing Officer. The Hearing \n     Officer is also authorized to initiate proceedings on his or \n     her own initiative, or at the direction of the Board, if the \n     alleged violation occurred in the context of Board \n     proceedings. Upon a finding of a violation of the \n     confidentiality provisions, the Hearing Officer, after notice \n     and hearing, may impose an appropriate sanction, which may \n     include any of the sanctions listed in section 7.02 of these \n     rules, as well as any of the following: \n       (1) an order that the matters regarding which the violation \n     occurred or any other designated facts shall be taken to be \n     established against the violating party for the purposes of \n     the action in accordance with the claim of the other party; \n       (2) an order refusing to allow the violating party to \n     support or oppose designated claims or defenses, or \n     prohibiting him from introducing designated matters in \n     evidence; \n       (3) an order striking out pleadings or parts thereof, or \n     staying further proceedings until the order is obeyed, or \n     dismissing with or without prejudice the action or \n     proceedings or any part thereof, or rendering a judgment by \n     default against the violating party; \n       (4) in lieu of any of the foregoing orders or in addition \n     thereto, the Hearing Officer shall require the party \n     violating the confidentiality provisions or the \n     representative advising him, or both, to pay, at such time as \n     ordered by the Hearing Officer, the reasonable expenses, \n     including attorney fees, caused by the violation, unless the \n     Hearing Officer finds that the failure was substantially \n     justified or that other circumstances make an award of \n     expenses unjust. Such an order shall be subject to review on \n     appeal of the final decision of the Hearing Officer under \n     section 406 of the Act. No sanctions may be imposed under \n     this section except for good cause and the particulars of \n     which must be stated in the sanction order. \n\n  Subpart B--Pre-Complaint Procedures Applicable to Consideration of \n     Alleged Violations of Part A of Title II of the Congressional \n                       Accountability Act of 1995\n\n     Sec. 2.01 Matters Covered by Subpart B \n     Sec. 2.02 Requests for Advice and Information\n     Sec. 2.03 Counseling\n     Sec. 2.04 Mediation\n     Sec. 2.05 Election of Proceedings \n     Sec. 2.06 Filing of Civil Action \n\n     Sec. 2.01 Matters Covered by Subpart B.\n\n       (a) These rules govern the processing of any allegation \n     that sections 201 through 206 of the Act have been violated \n     and any allegation of intimidation or reprisal prohibited \n     under section 207 of the Act.

[All \n     requests for counseling shall be confidential, unless the \n     employee agrees to waive his or her right to confidentiality \n     under section 2.03(e)(2), below.]\n\n[[Page S5451]]\n\n       (b) Who May Request Counseling. A covered employee who, in \n     good faith, believes that he or she has been or is the \n     subject of a violation of the Act as referred to in section \n     2.01(a) may formally request counseling.\n\n                             .  .  .  .  .\n\n       (d) [Purpose] Overview  of  the  Counseling Period. The \n     Office will maintain strict confidentiality throughout the \n     counseling period. The [purpose of the] counseling period \n     [shall] should be used: to discuss the employee's concerns \n     and elicit information regarding the matter(s) which the \n     employee believes constitute a violation(s) of the Act; to \n     advise the employee of his or her rights and responsibilities \n     under the Act and the procedures of the Office under these \n     rules; to evaluate the matter; and to assist the employee in \n     achieving an early resolution of the matter, if possible.\n       (e) Confidentiality and Waiver.\n       (1) Absent a waiver under paragraph 2, below, all \n     counseling shall be kept strictly confidential and shall not \n     be subject to discovery. All participants in counseling shall \n     be advised of the requirement for confidentiality and that \n     disclosure of information deemed confidential could result in \n     sanctions later in the proceedings. Nothing in these rules \n     shall prevent a counselor from consulting with personnel \n     within the Office concerning a matter in counseling, except \n     that, when the person being counseled is an employee of the \n     Office, the counselor shall not consult with any individual \n     within the Office who might be a party or witness without the \n     consent of the person requesting counseling. Nothing \n     contained in these rules shall prevent the Executive Director \n     from compiling and publishing statistical information such as \n     that required by Section 301(h)(3) of the Act. [so long as \n     that statistical information does not reveal the identity of \n     the employees involved or of employing offices that are the \n     subject of a request for counseling.]\n       (2) The employee and the Office may agree to waive \n     confidentiality [of] during the counseling process for the \n     limited purpose of allowing the Office [contacting the \n     employing office] to [obtain information] notify the \n     employing office of the allegations.[to be used in counseling \n     the employee or to attempt a resolution of any disputed \n     matter(s).] Such a limited waiver must be written on the form \n     supplied by the Office and signed by both the counselor and \n     the employee.\n\n                             .  .  .  .  .\n\n       (g) Role of Counselor [in Defining Concerns]. The counselor \n     [may] shall:\n       (1) obtain the name, home and office mailing and e-mail \n     addresses, and home and office telephone numbers of the \n     person being counseled;\n       (2) obtain the name and title of the person(s) whom the \n     employee claims has engaged in a violation of the Act, e-mail \n     address, if known, and the employing office in which this \n     person(s) works;\n\n                             .  .  .  .  .\n\n       (5) obtain the name, business and e-mail addresses, and \n     telephone number of the employee's representative, if any, \n     and whether the representative is an attorney.\n        [(i)](h)Counselor Not a Representative. The counselor \n     shall inform the person being counseled that the counselor \n     does not represent either the employing office or the \n     employee. The counselor provides information regarding the \n     Act and the Office and may act as a third-party intermediary \n     with the goals of increasing the individual's understanding \n     of his or her rights and responsibilities under the Act and \n     of promoting the early resolution of the matter.\n        [(j)] (i) Duration of Counseling Period. The period for \n     counseling shall be 30 days, beginning on the date that the \n     request for counseling is [received by the Office]  filed by \n     the employee in accordance with section 1.03(a) of these \n     rules, unless the employee requests in writing on a form \n     provided by the Office to reduce the period and the  [Office] \n     Executive Director agrees [to reduce the period].\n        [(h)] (j) Role of Counselor in Attempting Informal \n     Resolution. In order to attempt to resolve the matter brought \n     to the attention of the counselor, the counselor must obtain \n     a waiver of confidentiality pursuant to section 2.03(e)(2) of \n     these rules. If the employee executes such a waiver, the \n     counselor may:\n       (1) conduct a limited inquiry for the purpose of obtaining \n     any information necessary to attempt an informal resolution \n     or formal settlement;\n       (2) reduce to writing any formal settlement achieved and \n     secure the signatures of the employee, his or her \n     representative, if any, and a member of the employing office \n     who is authorized to enter into a settlement on the employing \n     office's behalf; and, pursuant to section 414 of the Act and \n     section 9.05 of these rules, seek the approval of the \n     Executive Director. Nothing in this subsection, however, \n     precludes the employee, the employing office or their \n     representatives from reducing to writing any formal \n     settlement.\n       (k) Duty to Proceed. An employee who initiates a proceeding \n     under this part shall be responsible at all times for \n     proceeding, regardless of whether he or she has designated a \n     representative, and shall notify the Office in writing of any \n     change in pertinent contact information, such as address, e-\n     mail, fax number, etc. An employee, however, may withdraw \n     from counseling once without prejudice to the employee's \n     right to reinstate counseling regarding the same matter, \n     provided that the request to reinstate counseling must be in \n     writing and is [received in] filed with the Office not later \n     than 180 days after the date of the alleged violation of the \n     Act and that counseling on a single matter will not last \n     longer than a total of 30 days.\n       (l) Conclusion of the Counseling Period and Notice. The \n     Executive Director shall notify the employee in writing of \n     the end of the counseling period[,] by [certified mail, \n     return receipt requested,] first class mail, [or by] personal \n     delivery evidenced by a written receipt, or electronic \n     transmission. The Executive Director, as part of the \n     notification of the end of the counseling period, shall \n     inform the employee of the right and obligation, should the \n     employee choose to pursue his or her claim, to file with the \n     Office a request for mediation within 15 days after receipt \n     by the employee of the notice of the end of the counseling \n     period.\n       (m) Employees of the Office of the Architect of the Capitol \n     and Capitol Police.\n       (1) Where an employee of the Office of the Architect of the \n     Capitol or of the Capitol Police requests counseling under \n     the Act and these rules, the Executive Director, in his or \n     her sole discretion, may recommend that the employee use the \n     [grievance] internal procedures of the Architect of the \n     Capitol or the Capitol Police pursuant to a Memorandum of \n     Understanding (MOU) between the Architect of the Capitol and \n     the Office or the Capitol Police and the Office addressing \n     certain procedural and notification requirements. The term \n     ``[grievance] internal procedure(s)'' refers to any internal \n     procedure of the Architect of the Capitol and the Capitol \n     Police, including grievance procedures referred to in section \n     401 of the Act, that can provide a resolution of the \n     matter(s) about which counseling was requested. Pursuant to \n     section 401 of the Act when the Executive Director makes such \n     a recommendation, the following procedures shall apply:\n       (i) The Executive Director shall recommend in writing to \n     the employee that the employee use an  [grievance] internal \n     procedure of the Architect of the Capitol or of the Capitol \n     Police, as appropriate, for a period generally up to 90 days, \n     unless the Executive Director determines, in writing, that a \n     longer period is appropriate [for resolution of the \n     employee's complaint through the grievance procedures of  the \n     Architect of the Capitol or the Capitol Police . Once the \n     employee notifies the Office that he or she is using the \n     internal procedure, the employee shall provide a waiver of \n     confidentiality to allow the Executive Director to notify \n     the Architect of the Capitol or the Capitol Police that \n     the employee will be using the internal procedure.\n       (ii) The period during which the matter is pending in the \n     internal procedure shall not count against the time available \n     for counseling or mediation under the Act.\n       (iii) If the dispute is resolved to the employee's \n     satisfaction, the employee shall so notify the Office within \n     20 days after the employee has been served with a final \n     decision.\n        (ii)  (iv) After  having contacted the Office and having \n     utilized  using the   grievance  internal procedures  of the \n     Architect of the Capitol or of the Capitol Police , the \n     employee may notify the Office that he or she wishes to \n     return to the procedures under these rules:\n       (A) within 60 days after the expiration of the period \n     recommended by the Executive Director, or longer if the \n     Executive Director has extended the time period, if the \n     matter has not resulted in a final decision or a decision not \n     to proceed; or\n       (B) within 20 days after service of a final decision or a \n     decision not to proceed, resulting from the  grievance  \n     internal procedures  of the Architect of the Capitol or of \n     the Capitol Police Board. \n        (iii) The period during which the matter is pending in the \n     internal grievance procedure shall not count against the time \n     available for counseling or mediation under the Act. If the \n     grievance is resolved to the employee's satisfaction, the \n     employee shall so notify the Office within 20 days after the \n     employee has received service of the final decision resulting \n     from the grievance procedure. If no request to return to the \n     procedures under these rules is received within 60 days after \n     the expiration of the period recommended by the Executive \n     Director the Office will issue a Notice of End of Counseling, \n     as specified in section 2.04(i) of these Rules. \n       (v) If a request to return to counseling is not made by the \n     employee within the time periods outlined above, the Office \n     will issue a Notice of the End of Counseling.\n       (2) Notice to Employees who Have Not Initiated Counseling \n     with the Office. When an employee of the Architect of the \n     Capitol or the Capitol Police raises in the internal \n     procedures of the Architect of the Capitol or of the Capitol \n     Police  Board  an allegation which may also be raised under \n     the procedures set forth in this subpart, the Architect of \n     the Capitol or the Capitol Police  Board should  shall, in \n     accordance with the MOU with the Office, advise the employee \n     in writing that a request for counseling about the allegation \n     must be initiated with the Office within 180 days after the \n     alleged violation of law occurred if the employee intends to \n     use the procedures of the Office.\n       (3) Notice in Final Decisions when Employees Have Not \n     Initiated Counseling with the Office. When an employee raises \n     in the internal procedures of the Architect of the Capitol or \n     of the Capitol Police  Board  an allegation which may also be \n     raised under the procedures set forth in this subpart, any \n      final  decision issued  pursuant to the procedures of the \n     Architect of the Capitol or of the Capitol Police Board \n     should  under such procedure, shall, pursuant to the MOU with \n     the Office, include notice to the employee of his or her \n     right to initiate the procedures under\n\n[[Page S5452]]\n\n     these rules within 180 days after the alleged violation \n     occurred.\n       (4) Notice in Final Decisions when There Has Been a \n     Recommendation by the Executive Director. When the Executive \n     Director has made a recommendation under paragraph 1 above, \n     the Architect of the Capitol or the Capitol Police  Board \n     should  shall, pursuant to the MOU with the Office, include \n     with the final decision notice to the employee of his or her \n     right to resume the procedures under these rules within 20 \n     days after service on the employee of the final decision and \n     shall transmit a copy of the final decision, settlement \n     agreement, or other final disposition of the case to the \n     Executive Director.\n\n     Sec. 2.04 Mediation.\n\n       (a)  Explanation] Overview. Mediation is a process in which \n     employees, employing offices and their representatives, if \n     any, meet separately and/or jointly with a  neutral  mediator \n     trained to assist them in resolving disputes. As  parties to  \n     participants in the mediation, employees, employing offices, \n     and their representatives discuss alternatives to continuing \n     their dispute, including the possibility of reaching a \n     voluntary, mutually satisfactory resolution. The  neutral  \n     mediator has no power to impose a specific resolution, and \n     the mediation process, whether or not a resolution is \n     reached, is strictly confidential, pursuant to section 416 of \n     the Act.\n       (b) Initiation. Not more than 15 days after receipt by the \n     employee of the notice of the conclusion of the counseling \n     period under section 2.03(l), the employee may file with the \n     Office a written request for mediation. Except to provide for \n     the services of a mediator and notice to the employing \n     office, the invocation of mediation shall be kept \n     confidential by the Office. The request for mediation shall \n     contain the employee's name, home and e-mail addresses,  and  \n     telephone number, and the name of the employing office that \n     is the subject of the request. Failure to request mediation \n     within the prescribed period  will  may preclude the \n     employee's further pursuit of his or her claim. If a request \n     for mediation is not filed within 15 days of receipt of a \n     Notice of the End of Counseling, without good cause shown, \n     the case will be closed and the employee will be so notified.\n\n                               . . . . .\n\n       (d) Selection of  Neutrals  Mediators; Disqualification. \n     Upon receipt of the request for mediation, the Executive \n     Director shall assign one or more  neutrals  mediators to \n     commence the mediation process. In the event that a  neutral  \n     mediator considers him or herself unable to perform in a \n     neutral role in a given situation, he or she shall withdraw \n     from the matter and immediately shall notify the Office of \n     the withdrawal. Any party may ask the Office to disqualify a \n      neutral  mediator by filing a written request, including the \n     reasons for such request, with the Executive Director. This \n     request shall be filed as soon as the party has reason to \n     believe there is a basis for disqualification. The Executive \n     Director's decision on this request shall be final and \n     unreviewable.\n       (e) Duration and Extension. \n\n                               . . . . .\n\n       (2) The  Office  Executive Director may extend the \n     mediation period upon the joint written request of the \n     parties, or of the appointed mediator on behalf of the \n     parties , to the attention of the Executive Director . The \n     request shall be written and filed with the  Office  \n     Executive Director no later than the last day of the \n     mediation period. The request shall set forth the joint \n     nature of the request and the reasons therefore, and specify \n     when the parties expect to conclude their discussions. \n     Requests for additional extensions may be made in the same \n     manner. Approval of any extensions shall be within the sole \n     discretion of the  Office  Executive Director.\n       (f) Procedures. \n       (1) The  Neutral's  Mediator's Role. After assignment of \n     the case, the  neutral  mediator will promptly contact the \n     parties. The  neutral  mediator has the responsibility to \n     conduct the mediation, including deciding how many meetings \n     are necessary and who may participate in each meeting. The \n      neutral  mediator may accept and may ask the parties to \n     provide written submissions.\n       (2) The Agreement to Mediate. At the commencement of the \n     mediation, the  neutral  mediator will ask the  parties  \n     participants and/or their representatives to sign an \n     agreement prepared by the Office (``the Agreement to \n     Mediate''). The Agreement to Mediate will define what is to \n     be kept confidential during mediation and set out the \n     conditions under which mediation will occur, including the \n     requirement that the participants adhere to the \n     confidentiality of the process and a notice that a breach of \n     the mediation agreement could result in sanctions later in \n     the proceedings. The Agreement to Mediate will also provide \n     that the parties to the mediation will not seek to have the \n     counselor or the  neutral  mediator participate, testify or \n     otherwise present evidence in any subsequent administrative \n     action under section 405 or any civil action under section \n     408 of the Act or any other proceeding.\n       (g) Who May Participate. The covered employee ,  and the \n     employing office  , their respective representatives, and the \n     Office may meet, jointly or separately, with the neutral.

The mediator will determine, \n     as best serves the interests of mediation, whether the \n     participants may meet jointly or separately with the \n     mediator.\n       (h) Informal Resolutions and Settlement Agreements. At any \n     time during mediation the parties may resolve or settle a \n     dispute in accordance with section  9.05  9.03 of these \n     rules.\n       (i) Conclusion of the Mediation Period and Notice. If, at \n     the end of the mediation period, the parties have not \n     resolved the matter that forms the basis of the request for \n     mediation, the Office shall provide the employee, and the \n     employing office, and their representatives, with written \n     notice that the mediation period has concluded. The written \n     notice  to the employee  will be  sent by certified mail, \n     return receipt requested, or will be  personally delivered \n     evidenced by a written receipt, or sent by first class mail, \n     e-mail, or fax.  , and it  The notice will specify the mode \n     of delivery and also  notify  provide information about the \n     employee's  of his or her  right to elect to file a complaint \n     with the Office in accordance with section 405 of the Act and \n     section 5.01 of these rules or to file a civil action \n     pursuant to section 408 of the Act and section  2.06  2.07 of \n     these rules.\n       (j) Independence of the Mediation Process and the  Neutral  \n     Mediator. The Office will maintain the independence of the \n     mediation process and the  neutral  mediator. No individual, \n     who is appointed by the Executive Director to mediate, may \n     conduct or aid in a hearing conducted under section 405 of \n     the Act with respect to the same matter or shall be subject \n     to subpoena or any other compulsory process with respect to \n     the same matter.\n        (k) Confidentiality. Except as necessary to consult with \n     the parties, the parties' their counsel or other designated \n     representatives, the parties to, the mediation, the  neutral \n     and the Office shall not disclose, in whole or in part, \n     any information or records obtained through, or prepared \n     specifically for, the mediation process. This rule shall \n     not preclude a neutral from consulting with the Office, \n     except that when the covered employee is an employee of \n     the Office a neutral shall not consult with any individual \n     within the Office who might be a party or witness. This \n     rule shall also not preclude the Office from reporting \n     statistical information to the Senate and House of \n     Representatives that does not reveal the identity of the \n     employees or employing offices involved in the mediation. \n     All parties to the action and their representatives will \n     be advised of the confidentiality requirements of this \n     process and of the sanctions that might be imposed for \n     violating these requirements. \n       (k) Violation of Confidentiality in Mediation. An \n     allegation regarding a violation of the confidentiality \n     provisions may be made by a party in a mediation to the \n     mediator during the mediation period and, if not resolved by \n     agreement in mediation, to a Hearing Officer during \n     proceedings brought under Section 405 of the Act.\n\n                               . . . . .\n\n     Sec. 2.05 Election of Proceeding.\n\n       (a) Pursuant to section 404 of the Act, not later than 90 \n     days after a covered employee receives notice of the end of \n     mediation under section 2.04(i) of these rules but no sooner \n     than 30 days after that date, the covered employee may \n     either:\n\n                               . . . . .\n\n       (2) file a civil action in accordance with section 408 of \n     the Act and section 2.06 2.07, below in the United States \n      District Court  district court for the district in which the \n     employee is employed or for the District of Columbia.\n       (b) A covered employee who files a civil action pursuant to \n     section  2.06  408 of the Act and section 2.07 below, may not \n     thereafter file a complaint under section 405 of the Act and \n     section 5.01 below on the same matter.\n\n     Sec. 2.06 Certification of the Official Record\n\n       (a) Certification of the Official Record shall contain the \n     date the Request for Counseling was made; the date and method \n     of delivery the Notification of End of Counseling Period was \n     sent to the complainant; the date the Notice was deemed by \n     the Office to have been received by the complainant; the date \n     the Request for Mediation was filed; the date and method of \n     delivery the Notification of End of Mediation Period was sent \n     to the complainant; and the date the Notice was deemed by the \n     Office to have been received by the complainant.\n       (b) At any time after a complaint has been filed with the \n     Office in accordance with section 405 of the Act and the \n     procedure set out in section 5.01, below; or a civil action \n     filed in accordance with section 408 of the Act and section \n     2.07 below in the United States district court, a party may \n     request and receive from the Office Certification of the \n     Official Record.\n       (c) Certification of the Official Record will not be \n     provided until after a complaint has been filed with the \n     Office or the Office has been notified that a civil action \n     has been filed in district court.\n\n[[Page S5453]]\n\n     Sec.  2.06  2.07 Filing of Civil Action.\n\n                               . . . . .\n\n       (c) Communication Regarding Civil Actions Filed with \n     District Court.

For the purpose of sections 3.01 through \n     3.18, references to the ``General Counsel'' include any \n     authorized representative of the General Counsel. In \n     situations where sections 3.01 through 3.18 set forth general \n     enforcement policies rather than substantive or procedural \n     rules, such policies may be modified in specific \n     circumstances where the General Counsel or the General \n     Counsel's designee determines that an alternative course of \n     action would better serve the objectives of section 210 of \n     the CAA.\n\n     Sec. 3.02 Authority for Inspection.\n\n       (a) Under section 210(f)(1) of the CAA, the General Counsel \n     is authorized to enter without delay and at reasonable times \n     any facility of any entity listed in section 210(a) \n     (``covered entities''), to inspect and investigate during \n     regular working hours and at other reasonable times, and \n     within reasonable limits and in a reasonable manner, any \n     facility, and all pertinent conditions, structures, machines, \n     apparatus, devices, equipment and materials therein; to \n     question privately any covered entity, employee, operator, or \n     agent; and to review records maintained by or under the \n     control of the covered entity.\n       (b) Prior to inspecting areas containing information which \n     is classified by an agency of the United States Government \n     (and/or by any congressional committee or other authorized \n     entity within the Legislative Branch) in the interest of \n     national security, and for which security clearance is \n     required as a condition for access to the area(s) to be \n     inspected, the individual(s) conducting the inspection shall \n     have obtained the appropriate security clearance.\n\n     Sec. 3.03 Requests for Inspections by Members of the Public \n       and Covered Entities.\n\n       (a) By Members of the Public.\n       (1) Any person who believes that a violation of section 210 \n     of the CAA exists in any facility of a covered entity may \n     request an inspection of such facility by giving notice of \n     the alleged violation to the General Counsel. Any such notice \n     shall be reduced to writing on a form available from the \n     Office, shall set forth with reasonable particularity the \n     grounds for the notice, and shall be signed by the person or \n     the representative of the person. A copy shall be provided to \n     the covered entity or its agent by the General Counsel or the \n     General Counsel's designee no later than at the time of \n     inspection, except that, upon the written request of the \n     person giving such notice, his or her name and the names of \n     individual employees referred to therein shall not appear in \n     such copy or on any record published, released, or made \n     available by the General Counsel. If the person making the \n     request is a qualified individual with a disability, as \n     defined by section 201(2) of the Americans with Disabilities \n     Act of 1990 (ADA) (42 U.S.C. 12131(2)), the request for \n     inspection shall be considered a charge of discrimination \n     within the meaning of section 210(d)(1) of the CAA.\n       (2) If upon receipt of such notification the General \n     Counsel's designee determines that the notice meets the \n     requirements set forth in subparagraph (1) of this section, \n     and that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the \n     alleged violation exists, he or she shall cause an inspection \n     to be made as soon as practicable, to determine if such \n     alleged violation exists. Inspections under this section \n     shall not be limited to matters referred to in the notice.\n       (3) Prior to or during any inspection of a facility, any \n     person may notify the General Counsel's designee, in writing, \n     of any violation of section 210 of the CAA which he or she \n     has reason to believe exists in such facility.

The General Counsel's designee shall \n     endeavor to ascertain the reason for such refusal, and shall \n     immediately report the refusal and the reason therefor to the \n     General Counsel, who shall take appropriate action.\n\n     Sec. 3.05 Entry Not a Waiver.\n\n       Any permission to enter, inspect, review records, or \n     question any person, shall not imply or be conditioned upon a \n     waiver of any cause of action under section 210 of the CAA.\n\n     Sec. 3.06 Advance Notice of Inspections.\n\n       (a) Advance notice of inspections may not be given, except \n     in the following situations:\n       (1) in circumstances where the inspection can most \n     effectively be conducted after regular business hours or \n     where special preparations are necessary for an inspection;\n       (2) where necessary to assure the presence of \n     representatives of the covered entity and employees or the \n     appropriate personnel needed to aid in the inspection; and\n       (3) in other circumstances where the General Counsel \n     determines that the giving of advance notice would enhance \n     the probability of an effective and thorough inspection.\n       (b) In the situations described in paragraph (a) of this \n     section, advance notice of inspections may be given only if \n     authorized by the General Counsel or by the General Counsel's \n     designee.\n\n     Sec. 3.07 Conduct of Inspections.\n\n       (a) Subject to the provisions of section 3.02, inspections \n     shall take place at such times and in such places of \n     employment as the General Counsel may direct. At the \n     beginning of an inspection, the General Counsel's designee \n     shall present his or her credentials to the operator of the \n     facility or the management employee in charge at the facility \n     to be inspected; explain the nature and purpose of the \n     inspection; and indicate generally the scope of the \n     inspection and the records specified in section 3.02 which he \n     or she wishes to review. However, such designation of records \n     shall not preclude access to additional records specified in \n     section 3.02.\n       (b) The General Counsel's designee shall have authority to \n     take or obtain photographs related to the purpose of the \n     inspection, employ other reasonable investigative techniques, \n     and question privately, any covered entity, operator, agent \n     or employee of a covered facility. As used herein, the term \n     ``employ other reasonable investigative techniques'' \n     includes, but is not limited to, the use of measuring \n     devices, testing equipment, or other equipment used to assess \n     accessibility or compliance with the ADA Standards.\n       (c) In taking photographs and samples, the General \n     Counsel's designees shall take reasonable precautions to \n     insure that such actions with flash, spark-producing, or \n     other equipment would not be hazardous. The General Counsel's \n     designees shall comply with all employing office safety and \n     health rules and practices at the workplace or location being \n     inspected, and they shall wear and use appropriate protective \n     clothing and equipment.\n       (d) The conduct of inspections shall be such as to preclude \n     unreasonable disruption of the operations of the covered \n     entity.\n       (e) At the conclusion of an inspection, the General \n     Counsel's designee shall confer with the covered entity or \n     its representative and informally advise it of any apparent \n     ADA violations disclosed by the inspection. During such \n     conference, the employing office shall be afforded an \n     opportunity to bring to the attention of the General \n     Counsel's designee any pertinent information regarding \n     accessibility in the facility.\n       (f) Inspections shall be conducted in accordance with the \n     requirements of this subpart.\n\n     Sec. 3.08 Representatives of Covered Entities.\n\n       (a) The General Counsel's designee shall be in charge of \n     inspections and questioning of persons. A representative of \n     the covered entity shall be given an opportunity to accompany \n     the General Counsel's designee during the physical inspection \n     of any facility for the purpose of aiding such inspection. \n     The General Counsel's designee may permit additional \n     representatives from the covered entity to accompany the \n     designee where he or she determines that such additional \n     representatives will further aid the inspection. A different \n     covered entity representative may accompany the General \n     Counsel's designee during each different phase of an \n     inspection if this will not interfere with the conduct of the \n     inspection.\n\n[[Page S5454]]\n\n       (b) The General Counsel's designee shall have authority to \n     resolve all disputes as to whom is the representative \n     authorized by the covered entity for the purpose of this \n     section.\n       (c) If in the judgment of the General Counsel's designee, \n     good cause has been shown why accompaniment by a third party \n     who is not the requestor or an employee of the covered entity \n     (such as a sign language interpreter, braille reader, \n     architect or accessibility expert) is reasonably necessary to \n     the conduct of an effective and thorough physical inspection \n     of the workplace, such third party may accompany the General \n     Counsel's designee during the inspection.\n       (d) The General Counsel's designee may deny the right of \n     accompaniment under this section to any person whose conduct \n     interferes with a fair and orderly inspection.

The complaining party may \n     obtain review of such determination by submitting a written \n     statement of position with the General Counsel and, at the \n     same time, providing the covered entity with a copy of such \n     statement. The covered entity may submit an opposing written \n     statement of position with the General Counsel and, at the \n     same time, provide the complaining party with a copy of such \n     statement. Upon the request of the complaining party or the \n     covered entity, the General Counsel, at his or her \n     discretion, may hold an informal conference in which the \n     complaining party and the covered entity may orally present \n     their views. After considering all written and oral views \n     presented, the General Counsel shall affirm, modify, or \n     reverse the designee's determination and furnish the \n     complaining party and the covered entity with written \n     notification of this decision and the reasons therefor. The \n     decision of the General Counsel shall be final and not \n     reviewable.\n       (b) If the General Counsel's designee determines that an \n     inspection is not warranted because the requirements of \n     section 3.03(a)(1) have not been met, he or she shall notify \n     the complaining party in writing of such determination.

Notices of de minimis violations \n     need not be posted.\n       (b) Each citation, notice, or a copy thereof, shall remain \n     posted until the violation has been abated, or for 3 working \n     days, whichever is later. The pendency of any proceedings \n     regarding the citation shall not affect its posting \n     responsibility under this section unless and until the Board \n     issues a final order vacating the citation.\n\n                         .    .    .    .    .\n\n     Sec. 4.15 Informal Conferences.\n\n       At the request of an affected employing office, employee, \n     or representative of employees, the General Counsel may hold \n     an informal conference for the purpose of discussing any \n     issues raised by an inspection, citation, or notice issued by \n     the General Counsel.

A violation of the \n     confidentiality requirements of the Act and these rules \n     [could] may result in the imposition of procedural or \n     evidentiary sanctions. [Nothing in these rules shall prevent \n     the Executive Director from reporting statistical information \n     to the Senate and House of Representatives, so long as that \n     statistical information does not reveal the identity of the \n     employees involved or of employing offices that are the \n     subject of a matter.] See also sections [1.06] [1.07] 1.08 \n     and 7.12 of these rules.\n\n                   Subpart F--Discovery and Subpoenas\n\n     Sec. 6.01 Discovery\n     Sec. 6.02 Requests for Subpoenas\n     Sec. 6.03 Service\n     Sec. 6.04 Proof of Service\n     Sec. 6.05 Motion to Quash\n     Sec. 6.06 Enforcement\n\n     Sec. 6.01 Discovery.\n\n       (a) [Explanation] Description. Discovery is the process by \n     which a party may obtain from another person, including a \n     party, information, not privileged, reasonably calculated to \n     lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, for the purpose \n     of assisting that party in developing, preparing and \n     presenting its case at the hearing. No discovery, oral or \n     written, by any party shall [This provision  shall not be \n     construed to permit any discovery, oral or written, to  be \n     taken of, or from, an employee of the Office of \n     Compliance,  or the  counselor (s) , or mediator  the \n     neutral(s) involved in counseling and mediation. , \n     including files, records, or notes produced during \n     counseling and mediation and maintained by the Office. \n       (b) Initial Disclosure.  Office Policy Regarding Discovery. \n     It is the policy of the Office to encourage the early and \n     voluntary exchange of relevant and material nonprivileged \n     information between the parties, including the names and \n     addresses of witnesses and copies of relevant and material \n     documents, and to encourage Hearing Officers to develop \n     procedures which allow for the greatest exchange of relevant \n     and material information and which minimizes the need for \n     parties to formally request such information.  Within 14 days \n     after the pre-hearing conference and except as otherwise \n     stipulated or ordered by the Hearing Officer, a party must, \n     without awaiting a discovery request, provide to the other \n     parties: the name and, if known, mail and e-mail addresses \n     and telephone number of each individual likely to have \n     discoverable information that the disclosing party may use to \n     support its claims or defenses; and a copy or a description \n     by category and location of all documents, electronically \n     stored information, and tangible things that the disclosing \n     party has in its possession, custody, or control and may use \n     to support its claims or defenses.\n       (c) Discovery Availability. Pursuant to section 405(e) of \n     the Act,  the Hearing Officer in his or her discretion may \n     permit  the parties may engage in reasonable prehearing \n     discovery.  In exercising that discretion, the Hearing \n     Officer may be guided by the Federal Rules of Civil \n     Procedure. \n       (1) The  Hearing Officer may authorize  parties may take \n     discovery by one or more of the following methods: \n     depositions upon oral examination or written questions; \n     written interrogatories; production of documents or things or \n     permission to enter upon land or other property for \n     inspection or other purposes; physical and mental \n     examinations; and requests for admission.\n       (2) The Hearing Officer may adopt standing orders or make \n     any order setting forth the forms and extent of discovery, \n     including orders limiting the number of depositions, \n     interrogatories, and requests for production of documents, \n     and may also limit the length of depositions.\n\n                               . . . . .\n\n       (d) Claims of Privilege.\n       (1) Information Withheld. Whenever a party withholds \n     information otherwise discoverable under these rules by \n     claiming that it is privileged or confidential or subject to \n     protection as hearing or trial preparation materials, the \n     party shall make the claim expressly in writing and shall \n     describe the nature of the documents, communications or \n     things not produced or disclosed in a manner that, without \n     revealing the information itself privileged or protected, \n     will enable other parties to assess the applicability of the \n     privilege or protection. A party must make a claim for \n     privilege no later than the due date for the production of \n     the information.\n       (2) Information Produced As Inadvertent Disclosure. If \n     information produced in discovery is subject to a claim of \n     privilege or of protection as hearing preparation material, \n     the party making the claim may notify any party that received \n     the information of the claim and the basis for it. After \n     being notified, a party must promptly return, sequester, or \n     destroy the specified information and any copies it has; must \n     not use or disclose the information until the claim is \n     resolved; must take reasonable steps to retrieve the \n     information if the party disclosed it before being notified; \n     and may promptly present the information to the Hearing \n     Officer or the Board under seal for a determination of the \n     claim. The producing party must preserve the information \n     until the claim is resolved.\n\n     Sec. 6.02 Request for Subpoena.\n\n       (a) Authority to Issue Subpoenas. At the request of a \n     party, a Hearing Officer may issue subpoenas for the \n     attendance and testimony of witnesses and for the production \n     of correspondence, books, papers, documents, or other \n     records. The attendance of witnesses and the production of \n     records may be required from any place within the United \n     States. However, no subpoena by any party may be issued for \n     the attendance or testimony of an employee  with  of the \n     Office of Compliance, a counselor, or a mediator, including \n     files, records, or notes produced during counseling and \n     mediation and maintained by the Office. Employing offices \n     shall make their employees available for discovery and \n     hearing without requiring a subpoena.\n       (d) Rulings. The Hearing Officer shall promptly rule on the \n     request for the subpoena.\n\n                               * * * * *\n\n                          Subpart G--Hearings\n\n     Sec. 7.01 The Hearing Officer\n     Sec. 7.02 Sanctions \n     Sec. 7.03 Disqualification of the Hearing Officer \n     Sec. 7.04 Motions and Prehearing Conference \n\n[[Page S5457]]\n\n     Sec. 7.05 Scheduling the Hearing \n     Sec. 7.06 Consolidation and Joinder of Cases \n     Sec. 7.07 Conduct of Hearing; Disqualification of \n         Representatives \n     Sec. 7.08 Transcript \n     Sec. 7.09 Admissibility of Evidence \n     Sec. 7.10 Stipulations \n     Sec. 7.11 Official Notice \n     Sec. 7.12 Confidentiality \n     Sec. 7.13 Immediate Board Review of a Ruling by a Hearing \n         Officer \n     Sec. 7.14 Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law; \n         Posthearing Briefs \n     Sec. 7.15 Closing the record \n     Sec. 7.16 Hearing Officer Decisions; Entry in Records of the \n         Office; Corrections to the Record; Motions to Alter, \n         Amend or Vacate the Decision. \n\n     Sec. 7.01 The Hearing Officer. \n\n                               . . . . .\n\n       (b) Authority. Hearing Officers shall conduct fair and \n     impartial hearings and take all necessary action to avoid \n     undue delay in the disposition of all proceedings. They shall \n     have all powers necessary to that end unless otherwise \n     limited by law, including, but not limited to, the authority \n     to:\n\n                               . . . . .\n\n       (14) maintain and enforce the confidentiality of \n     proceedings; and\n\n                               . . . . .\n\n     Sec. 7.02 Sanctions.\n\n                               . . . . .\n\n       (b) The Hearing Officer may impose sanctions upon the \n     parties under, but not limited to, the circumstances set \n     forth in this section.\n       (1) Failure to Comply with an Order. When a party fails to \n     comply with an order (including an order for the taking of a \n     deposition, for the production of evidence within the party's \n     control, or for production of witnesses), the Hearing Officer \n     may:\n       [(a)](A) draw an inference in favor of the requesting party \n     on the issue related to the information sought;\n       [(b)](B) stay further proceedings until the order is \n     obeyed;\n       [(c)](C) prohibit the party failing to comply with such \n     order from introducing evidence concerning, or otherwise \n     relying upon, evidence relating to the information sought;\n       [(d)](D) permit the requesting party to introduce secondary \n     evidence concerning the information sought;\n       [(e)](E) strike, in whole or in part, [any part of] the \n     complaint, briefs, answer, or other submissions of the party \n     failing to comply with the order, as appropriate; \n       [(f)](F) direct judgment against the non-complying party in \n     whole or in part; or\n       [(g)](G) order that the non-complying party, or the \n     representative advising that party, pay all or part of the \n     attorney's fees and reasonable expenses of the other party or \n     parties or of the Office, caused by such non-compliance, \n     unless the Hearing Officer or the Board finds that the \n     failure was substantially justified or that other \n     circumstances make an award of attorney's fees and/or \n     expenses unjust.\n       (2) Failure to Prosecute or Defend. If a party fails to \n     prosecute or defend a position, the Hearing Officer may \n     dismiss the action with prejudice or [rule for the \n     complainant] decide the matter, where appropriate. \n\n                               . . . . .\n\n       (4) Filing of frivolous claims.

An allegation \n     regarding a violation of the confidentiality provisions may \n     be made to a Hearing Officer in proceedings under Section 405 \n     of the CAA. If, after notice and hearing, the Hearing Officer \n     determines that a party has violated the confidentiality \n     provisions, the Hearing Officer may: \n       (A) direct that the matters related to the breach of \n     confidentiality or other designated facts be taken as \n     established for purposes of the action, as the prevailing \n     party claims;\n       (B) prohibit the party breaching confidentiality from \n     supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses, or from \n     introducing designated matters in evidence;\n       (C) strike the pleadings in whole or in part; \n       (D) stay further proceedings until the breach of \n     confidentiality is resolved to the extent possible; \n       (E) dismiss the action or proceeding in whole or in part; \n     or\n       (F) render a default judgment against the party breaching \n     confidentiality. \n       (c) No sanctions may be imposed under this section except \n     for good cause and the particulars of which must be stated in \n     the sanction order. \n\n                               . . . . .\n\n     Sec. 7.04  Motions and Prehearing Conference.\n\n                               . . . . .\n\n       (b) Scheduling of the Prehearing Conference.

The Hearing Officer shall \n     issue an order, which recites the action taken at the \n     conference and the agreements made by the parties as to any \n     of the matters considered and which limits the issues to \n     those not disposed of by admissions, stipulations, or \n     agreements of the parties.

In that event, the \n     agreement shall be in writing and submitted to the Executive \n     Director for review and approval. The settlement is not \n     effective until it has been approved by the Executive \n     Director. If the Executive Director does not approve the \n     settlement, such disapproval shall be in writing, shall set \n     forth the grounds therefor, and shall render the settlement \n     ineffective.\n       (c) Requirements for a Formal Settlement Agreement. A \n     formal settlement agreement requires the signature of all \n     parties or their designated representatives on the agreement \n     document before the agreement can be submitted to the \n     Executive Director for signature. A formal settlement \n     agreement cannot be submitted to the Executive Director for \n     signature until the appropriate revocation periods have \n     expired. A formal settlement agreement cannot be rescinded \n     after the signatures of all parties have been affixed to the \n     agreement, unless by written revocation of the agreement \n     voluntarily signed by all parties, or as otherwise permitted \n     by law.\n       (d) Violation of a Formal Settlement Agreement.

If the  particular  \n     formal settlement agreement does not have a stipulated method \n     for dispute resolution of an alleged violation  of the \n     agreement , the Office may provide assistance in resolving \n     the dispute, including the services of a mediator as \n     determined by the Executive Director.  the following dispute \n     resolution procedure shall be deemed to be a part of each \n     formal settlement agreement approved by the Executive \n     Director pursuant to section 414 of the Act:  Where the \n     settlement agreement does not have a stipulated method for \n     resolving violation allegations,  Any complaint  an \n     allegation  regarding  of a violation  of a formal settlement \n     agreement may  must be filed with the Executive Director no \n     later than 60 days after the party to the agreement becomes \n     aware of the alleged violation. Such  complaints may be \n     referred by the Executive Director to a Hearing Officer for a \n     final decision. The procedures for hearing and determining \n     such complaints shall be governed by subparts F, G, and H of \n     these Rule.  allegations will be reviewed, investigated or \n     mediated, as appropriate, by the Executive Director or \n     designee.\n        9.06  Sec. 9.04 Payments required pursuant to Decisions, \n         Awards, or Settlements under section 415(a) of the Act.\n       Whenever a final decision or award pursuant to sections \n     405(g), 406(e), 407, or 408 of the Act, or an approved \n     settlement pursuant to section 414 of the Act, require the \n     payment of funds pursuant to section 415(a) of the Act, the \n     decision, award, or settlement shall be submitted to the \n     Executive Director to be processed by the Office for \n     requisition from the account of the Office of Compliance in \n     the Department of the Treasury, and payment.

WASHINGTON HIGH SCHOOL\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak for \na few moments this evening before the Senate adjourns its workday.\n  I begin with a couple points of personal privilege. One is to \ncongratulate a local high school in Miami, FL, by the name of Booker T. \nWashington. This is a school which has now won 29 consecutive games. \nThey were the national champions last year in high school football, and \nI think they are headed to that again this year.\n  But what really impresses me about this program is the work they do \nwith these young men. These young men come from a very challenging part \nof Miami, of Overtown, and have really overcome tremendous obstacles in \ntheir personal lives to achieve both in the classroom and on the field.\n  What I am most impressed about, as I tell Coach Harris every time I \nget to see him, is that it is not the kind of football players he has \nmade them--because they are excellent--but the kind\n\n[[Page S5462]]\n\nof young men they are becoming. I think they are worthy of \ncongratulations.\n  I was at their game on Friday against another very good team from \nSouth Florida, both ranked in the top 10 nationally in high school. I \nassure my colleagues from States such as California and Texas that \nwhile their football is good, our football is special.\n  Enough bragging on them. They are a great team, and we are fortunate \nto be able to witness what they have been able to do over the last \ncouple of years.\n\n\n                       Remembering Steven Sotloff\n\n  The second point, which is related to my comments here in a moment, \nis toward the family of Steven Sotloff, who lost his life tragically in \nthe Middle East over the last few days. We are all familiar with that \nhorrific tale.\n  Steven actually lived in Miami, FL, with his family literally blocks \naway from where I go to church, literally blocks away from where I \nlive. He was a member of our community.\n  As I said last week at his memorial service, Steven had dedicated his \nlife to revealing the suffering and the reality of what was happening \nin some of the most dangerous areas of the world. And while he lost his \nlife tragically, I think it is both ironic and appropriate that in his \nlast act, as he lost his life he revealed the true nature of what we \nconfront in that part of the world and the true nature of the Islamic \nState, who they are, and what they are all about. This was a young man \nwho, as I said, dedicated his life not just to journalism but to \njournalism in the most dangerous part of the world and in so doing was \nable to bring that reality to us even in the last moments of his life.\n\n\n                        Constitutional Amendment\n\n  Intriguing, of course, is the debate which has occurred here over the \nlast couple of days on this very interesting political matter. There is \na lot of hyperbole being thrown around about the influence money has on \nour political process. I have found there is plenty of money on both \nsides of every issue, and certainly all of my colleagues here, \nincluding those who support this amendment before us, have been the \nbeneficiaries of vast amounts of campaign spending. In fact, as some of \nmy colleagues pointed to earlier, the majority of the money being \nraised and spent in political campaigns, including from Wall Street, is \non behalf of many of the same people who are now here condemning it. If \nin fact it is so unseemly, as they say, then perhaps they should take a \nunilateral pledge not to accept these sources of funds. Of course they \nwon't, but it is an interesting dynamic at a time when our Nation faces \nso many struggles.\n\n\n                          Economic Challenges\n\n  What I hope and wish is that more time in this Chamber would be \ndedicated to the issues this country faces, the ones that threaten our \nstatus as a special and unique nation.\n  When we look across the country today at the economic challenges our \npeople are facing, they are pervasive and they are real. We see that \nthe 21st century has brought extraordinary and rapid change to our \nlives. The economy that once produced millions of jobs which allowed \npeople to make it to the middle class and achieve that American dream--\nmany of those jobs have been outsourced. They are automated. They have \ngone away.\n  Millions of people who have worked their entire lives are now \nstruggling to find a job that allows them to keep pace with the cost of \nliving. People are stuck in low-wage jobs, and I will have more to say \nabout that later this week. People are working for $9 or $10 an hour \nand cannot make ends meet, especially when the cost of living continues \nto rise in every facet of our lives.\n  We have students who have gone to school, graduated with a degree, \nhave done everything they were told they needed to do to succeed, and \nnow cannot find a job with the degree they sought, but they potentially \nowe tens of thousands of dollars in student loans--an issue I am both \nsensitive to and familiar with because I myself owed well over \n$100,000, including on the day I swore into the Senate. This is a real \nstrain on people.\n  Whatever it may be, there are millions of Americans who are starting \nto doubt whether that fundamental promise of America--that if they work \nhard, they can get ahead and achieve happiness as they define it--is \nstill true. We understand the reasons why, and this is something we \nneed to address, and we address it by addressing the core challenges of \nour time, which are not the different issues I heard thrown around here \ntoday.\n  The core challenges of our time are that, first and foremost, the \nnature of our economy has changed rapidly. America faces more global \ncompetition than ever for investment and for innovation. There are more \ncountries than ever competing with us for investment and for \ninnovation, and tragically we haven't kept pace with that change. We \nstill have policies in this country deeply rooted in the last century, \nin an era that has come and gone. We continue to impose taxes and \nregulations and a national debt and a health care law and all sorts of \nother measures that put us at a competitive disadvantage.\n  I wish the No. 1 priority of the Senate was to make America once \nagain the single-best place in the world to invest and to innovate so \nwe could create millions of higher paying 21st-century jobs.\n  I wish that were our No. 1 priority, followed closely by our No. 2 \npriority, which is equipping people with the skills they need for the \njobs of the 21st century. It wasn't that long ago that someone could \ncome to this country or grow up in this country, not have a lot of \nadvanced education, and still make it to the middle class. My parents \ndid it. They worked service sector jobs. My mother was a maid and a \ncashier at hotels, and my father was a banquet bartender. They never \nmade a lot of money. Yet they achieved the American dream.\n\n  The American dream has never been about how much money you make or \nhow many things you own; it is about achieving happiness. For them, \nachieving happiness was giving us the chance to do all the things they \nnever could, and they were able to do that in the 20th century in \nservice sector jobs.\n  That is still possible in America for many people, but it is \nincreasingly more difficult. I wish we would address that because the \nreason it has become more difficult is because almost all the higher \npaying jobs of the 21st century require some sort of advanced skill \nacquisition, and millions of our people simply don't have it. The \nreason is because our educational system is not a 21st-century one. Why \nhave we stigmatized vocational education in America? Why have we told \npeople that if they want to be an electrician or a plumber or a \ntruckdriver or a welder or any other number of vocational professions--\nwhy have we stigmatized that when we know there are jobs available in \nthose fields and we need people to fill them?\n  The second issue is, what about the people trapped in those low-\npaying jobs--the single mother who works as a home health aide for $10 \nan hour, the receptionist at a law firm making $11 an hour, the people \nworking in a fast food restaurant for $9 an hour? There is nothing \nwrong with those jobs, but I am sure that as time goes on they want \nmore, and we have to equip them with the skills to be able to do more \nso that the home health aide can become an ultrasound technician or a \ndental hygienist not making $12 an hour but making $30 an hour, so that \nthe young man who is on the unemployment line can become a welder or a \nbuilding specialist or some other 21st-century career or profession \nthat gives him the skills he needs for those better paying jobs. I wish \nwe were focused on that.\n  By the way, how about informing our college students about the true \nvalue of their degrees? In America--a free country--you can study \nanything you want, but before you borrow $50,000 to attain a major in \nGreek philosophy, you deserve to know that the market for Greek \nphilosophers is tight and that it is going to be difficult to pay off \nthat loan. I think every student in America who is taking out student \nloans has the right to know how much people make when they graduate \nfrom their school with that degree so they can make informed and \neducated decisions about whether they should borrow money to pay for \nthe specific degree they seek.\n  This is an important issue, and I wish that was our second top \npriority here, that we would focus more on how to help people trapped \nin low-paying jobs, how to help people who are struggling with the \nchallenges of the 21st century, how to help these people acquire the \nskills they need for better paying jobs.\n\n[[Page S5463]]\n\nWe have seen virtually no conversations about those two issues here in \nthe last few days.\n  No wonder people are disgusted with Washington. We don't spend any \ntime here talking about what they are worried about. We spend very \nlittle time talking about what they are concerned about. Our discourse \nin this body is so irrelevant to their daily lives that they have \nreason not just to be disgusted with politics but quite frankly to be \ntempted to give up on us and our ability to address any of these \nchallenges.\n\n\n                              World Events\n\n  There is a third 21st-century challenge and one I hope to speak about \nin the moments I have remaining; that is, the reality that world events \nhave an impact on us greater than ever before. I am not saying world \nevents never used to matter. Of course they did. But we are \nincreasingly members of a growing global economy, which means that \ntoday when there is instability on this planet, it isn't just our \nnational security that is threatened, it is our economic security as \nwell.\n  We are 6 percent of the world's population. In order to achieve more \nprosperity, we have to sell more things to more people everywhere in \nthe world. But that depends on peace and stability across the planet, \nand we can't have peace and stability when the world is in chaos. So I \nwould say today that foreign relations and foreign policy matter more \nfrom an economic perspective than they ever have in the history of this \nNation. I wish there were more focus in this body on what is happening \nall over the world because the world is in total chaos.\n  In the Asia-Pacific region, China is undergoing a dramatic \nmodernization of its military capabilities--increasingly challenging, \nfor example, U.S. air power in the region and increasingly acting out \non illegitimate territorial claims.\n  In Latin America we have seen an erosion of democratic order, the \nrise of antidemocratic governments that threaten to erode almost two \ndecades of democratic progress in the region.\n  By the way, in this body we have endeavored to address one of those \nchallenges in Venezuela--an outrage, a place full of corruption and \nhuman rights violations, an anti-American government that does \neverything possible to undermine us and our interests, not just the \ninterests of their own people. We have been blocked in our efforts to \naddress it because somehow the Venezuelan Government, acting through \nCITGO--a wholly owned company of the Venezuelan Government--got \nlobbyists to come here to the Senate and lobby for blockage and \nstoppage of a measure we were ready to pass by unanimous consent.\n  So I come to the floor to ask the majority leader to please schedule \na vote on these sanctions on Venezuela because it will pass \noverwhelmingly. Do not allow lobbyists for the Venezuelan Government to \nbe able to come to Washington, DC, and impede action on this matter.\n  In Europe we see chaos too. Russia has invaded Ukraine. Maybe they \nswitched uniforms and have lied about it, but they have invaded \nUkraine, and NATO has been helpless to do anything about it. I hope we \nwill be more forceful in our response because the implications not just \nfor that region but for the world are very significant.\n  But the one I want to close on tonight is focused on--and this \nrelates to Steven Sotloff, as discussed a moment ago--what is happening \nwith ISIL.\n  Tomorrow night I believe the President will give the most important \naddress of his Presidency--perhaps the most important address of any \nPresidency in the last decade. Tomorrow night I hope he comes before \nthe American people and explains to them what is truly at stake. I was \nabout to say that I thought he should have done this weeks ago, maybe \nmonths ago, but I am glad he is doing this.\n  I would ask my Republican colleagues--all of my colleagues--that at \nthis time of such critical national security importance, we try as much \nas possible to rally behind our efforts to address this challenge \nbecause it is a real challenge. If and when this group comes after the \nUnited States, both around the world or here at home, they will not be \ncoming after Republicans and they will not be coming after Democrats; \nthey will be coming after Americans; the threat we face is real.\n  We have a tradition in this government of rallying together and \nacting in a nonpartisan way when it comes to national security. That is \nnot just something we do because it is polite; it is something we must \ndo because unity is important in order to address these challenges.\n  I have been critical of the President. I have been critical of the \nslow response. I think it is valid to point out the mistakes he has \nmade so we can learn and so he can be held accountable. But I also \nthink it is important to look forward at what we can do now.\n  While I thought that what the President is about to do he should have \ndone weeks and months ago, I am glad he is finally doing it. Tomorrow \nnight's address to the Nation is an important one. I hope all Americans \ntune in.\n  Here are the three points I hope the President will make: First, I \nhope he clearly outlines to our fellow Americans what is at stake here. \nISIL is not just a collection of crazy terrorists. It is the single \nmost dangerous terrorist challenge this Nation has ever faced. We faced \nsome dangerous terrorists before. We are familiar with Al Qaeda and \ntheir capability. We are familiar with some of the nation-states we \nfaced down in the past.\n\n  This group is uniquely dangerous for a number of reasons. First, it \nis by far the best funded terrorist operation perhaps in all of human \nhistory. They are generating millions of dollars a day alone just from \noil revenue. Second, they are replete with foreign fighters, including \nthousands of foreign fighters that have visa waiver passports from \ncountries where all they have to do is buy a plane ticket to come to \nthe United States. Among those, by the way, are Americans, including \none who is from Florida who even came back to the United States for a \nnumber of weeks and then returned and conducted a suicide attack on \nbehalf of this group.\n  Last but not least, they control territory. We know that in order to \ncarry out the 9/11 attacks Al Qaeda needed a safe haven in parts of \nAfghanistan. These folks in the Islamic State--these lunatics--control \na vast space. Most of northern Syria and vast portions of Iraq are \nunder their control. This makes this group very significant and \ndangerous with intentions not just on taking over Iraq but dominating \nthe region, ultimately moving into Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, and \nother places, and conducting attacks against the United States.\n  It is simple. ISIL cannot fulfill its regional ambitions if it \ndoesn't drive the United States out of the Middle East, and the only \nway they can draw us out of the Middle East is by terrorizing us out of \nthe Middle East. To terrorize us they will have to conduct terrorist \nattacks against us both abroad and here in the homeland. Here we have \nthe most well-funded, most capable terrorist group in modern history \nwith a clear intention and desire to attack us in order to terrorize us \nout of the region. This is a very serious national security threat, and \nit is important for the President to clearly explain that to our fellow \nAmericans.\n  The second thing I hope we will do is outline a clear goal about what \nwe intend to achieve and that goal should be unequivocal: the complete \ndefeat and annihilation of ISIL. That goal is accomplished in three \nsteps: first, by stopping their continued spread; second, by eroding \ntheir capability and control of territory; and ultimately by defeating \nthem as an organization--by eliminating them as an organization.\n  So after he has outlined who this group is and why it is in our \nnational interest to defeat them and he has outlined his goal to defeat \nthem, I hope the President will explain to the American people in as \nmuch detail as possible--and clearly there are things he cannot share \nfor operational security purposes--but in as much detail as possible \nhow he intends to defeat them.\n  I think this is a multi-faceted process, but it should include the \ncontinued air strikes in northern Iraq. Air strikes are most successful \nwhen they are done in coordination with Kurds and Iraqi ground forces \nthere on the ground now--by continuing to supply and equip the Kurds by \ngiving them logistical support they need in order to take on the \nsupplies and get them out to the troops by hopefully working with the \nnew Iraqi government that was just formed to stand as a unified\n\n[[Page S5464]]\n\nIraqi government that is capable not just of supplying a government \nthat unites all of the people of Iraq but also one that is capable of \nfielding security forces capable of conducting operations without \ndividing the country along the Shia and Sunni lines.\n  We also need more cooperation from Arabs in the region because they \nare immediately threatened. They are coming after the Crown in Saudi \nArabia; they are coming after the Crown in Jordan. They are eventually \ngoing to move into Lebanon as well. They pose a real and present threat \nto all the nations in this region and they must act. We need their \ncooperation both militarily and diplomatically but also by using the \nmegaphone that the government and state-run media provides to \nstigmatize this group by revealing them for who they truly are. There \nshould be nothing romantic about ISIL in the minds of any Arab, about \njoining their ranks or their efforts. We need the government's help in \nspreading that word and revealing that reality.\n  By the way, we also need to work with them and other regional \ngovernments--especially the Turks--to help cut off ISIL's access to \nfunds and to fighters. The Turks need to step up and do a better job of \nsecuring that border. Cutting off their funds requires us to go after \ntheir most significant source of funds and that is the refinery \ncapacity in Syria. I will have more to say about that in a moment. We \nshould target that because the black market sale of oil in Syria is the \nsingle and fastest growing source of revenue for ISIL, but it is also a \nfuel for their terrorist operations.\n  But ultimately there is no way to defeat ISIL without defeating them \nin Syria. Someone is going to have to confront them in Syria and defeat \nthem. It is my hope that it will be a combination of U.S. air power and \nqualified, well-equipped, well-trained competent moderate rebel forces \nwithin Syria, because here is the problem: If you eliminate ISIL but \nyou don't have some sort of capable moderate group left behind, then \nall you are doing is replacing ISIL with al-Nusra or some other radical \nIslamic group on the ground there. So it is important that we do both.\n  I know no one wants to get into another conflict. We have no choice. \nWe are going to have to deal with ISIL. The choice is not whether we \ndeal with them. The choice is do we deal with them now while they are \nstill growing or do we deal with them later when they have grown and \nwhen they have controlled vast and larger territories than they do now, \nwhen they have more fighters and are better funded. That is the choice \nbefore us.\n  I submit to you that I know of no medical condition that is easier to \ntreat later rather than earlier. Every medical condition that I know--\nISIL has been compared to cancer--every cancer that I know is easier to \ntreat if you catch it earlier rather than later. I would say this is \ntrue with this cancer, ISIL. If we deal with them sooner, it will not \nbe costless or fast, but it will be easier to deal with them then, than \nif we wait until later. But to do so will ultimately require someone to \nconfront them and defeat them within Syria itself, and defeating them \nin Syria alone is not enough. We have to ensure that there is some \ngroup there on the ground, some moderate rebel force that can take over \nnot just from them but from the Assad regime.\n  There is collusion between Assad and ISIL. The refineries that ISIL \ncontrols in Syria are former Assad refineries which he won't bomb \nbecause he hopes to take them one day intact so he can use them. There \nis collusion between them. If anybody has any illusions about who Assad \nreally is, I hope the President will outline this for us tomorrow. It \nis important for us and for our future.\n  I will make one more point about why this is the most important \nspeech that the President will give. Because this threat will probably \noutlive his Presidency. We have to be prepared for the fact that ISIL \nmay not be defeated in 24 months, that the next President of the United \nStates and many of us--whether it is serving here, whether it is \ncontrolled by Republicans or Democrats--will have to remain committed \nto this goal, because this threat in all likelihood will outlive the \nPresidency of Barack Obama. It is important for him to put in place a \nclear goal and a plan that can survive his Presidency so that we can \ncarry out this task. It is critical for our country.\n  I wish the President the best on his address tomorrow, and I hope we \ncan come together in a bipartisan way to confront and defeat this evil \nbefore it is too late.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/09/09/senate-section/article/S5464-1", "month": "09", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
