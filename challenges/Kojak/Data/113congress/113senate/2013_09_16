Mr. President, the Sergeant at Arms is here on the Senate \nfloor. The Republican leader is here.\n  When I was doing my exercise this morning, I heard there was an \nincident at the Navy Yard and traffic was tied up. I didn't know what \nit was. Of course, coming to the Capitol I knew something was up \nbecause I saw our police officers with their automatic weapons that \nthey usually don't carry, at least in view of everybody on Constitution \nAvenue and other places.\n  I was saddened to hear about the events here in Washington, alluded \nto in the prayer by the Chaplain, that occurred at the Navy Yard this \nmorning, hearing that a number of people have been injured. I don't \nknow all the details. We know at least there is one dead. I don't know \nall the details--I don't know a lot of the details of this tragedy or \nwho the perpetrator or perpetrators may be. But according to the \nreports we have received, several people were killed and several were \ninjured, including a Washington Metropolitan police officer and a \nmilitary police officer. My sympathies are, of course, with those \nfamilies who have loved ones who died, with those who have been \ninjured, and my wishes go out to all of those who work in the Navy Yard \ncomplex which is a short distance from here and the surrounding \nneighborhood.\n  As usual with these events, we have to recognize the first responders \nwho rushed to the scene and their professionalism. I don't know all \nabout it, but I am certain it was there. My thanks go to the brave law \nenforcement officials who are on the scene and who put their lives on \nthe line. Today we realize that they do put their lives on the line to \nkeep this Capitol complex safe and the city safe.\n  I urge everyone in the area to follow law enforcement direction for \ntheir own safety, whether that be sheltering in place or simply \navoiding the Navy Yard area today. The shooters, to my knowledge, have \nnot been apprehended. I have been told they have their fixation on who \none of them might be, but we will all continue to follow this situation \nas it develops.\n  Based upon this, as I indicated, I have spoken with the Sergeant at \nArms, and the Republican leader has been advised of everything I have \nsaid and what I am going to suggest. In light of the events at the Navy \nYard, we have decided to recess the Senate until tomorrow morning. The \nvote scheduled for this evening will be rescheduled. We will have an \nannouncement later on the time of those votes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if the majority leader would suspend.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am sorry I didn't do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/16/senate-section/article/S6473-7", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

It is painful for all \nof us to think about and having to worry about their safety when they \ncome home too.\n  Many people in the area, and across the country, will be directly \naffected by this terrible tragedy and we pray for them all. These kinds \nof incidents always remind us how fragile life is. They also remind \nthose of us who work in and around the Capitol how much we all owe to \nthe men and women who work so hard to keep us safe every day.\n  I wish to take this opportunity to thank Terry Gainer and his team, \nChief Dine, and the entire Capitol Police force for all they do day in \nand day out, and for everyone else who is working through this tragedy, \nincluding the first responders, the medical personnel, and DC police. I \nwant them all to know one thing: We are all thankful for your hard work \nand your sacrifice. Everyone is deeply grateful, especially on days \nsuch as this.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate very much my friend's \nstatement. Earlier this morning I had in my office a Capitol Police \nofficer. I said, what is the number on your badge? I don't remember \nexactly--3,600 and something. I said, look at my cabinet there, look at \nmy badge. Mine was 363.\n  So Senator McConnell is absolutely right, we take for granted the \nwork these men and women do for us here. It is significant. They do \neverything they can to protect us and all of the thousands of people \nwho work in this Capitol complex.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/16/senate-section/article/S6474-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. REID.

At critical times in our Nation's history, these veterans \neach played a role in defending the world from tyranny, truly earning \ntheir reputation as guardians of peace and democracy through their \nservice and sacrifice. Now, thanks to Honor Flight, these combat \nveterans came to Washington, DC, to visit the national memorials built \nto honor those who served and those who fell. They have also come to \nshare their experiences with later generations and to pay tribute to \nthose who gave their lives. I am proud to welcome them here, and I join \nwith all Coloradans in thanking them for all they have done for us.\n  I also want to thank the volunteers from Honor Flight of Northern \nColorado who made this trip possible. These volunteers are great \nColoradans in their own right, and their mission to bring our veterans \nto Washington, DC, is truly commendable.\n  I wish to publicly recognize the veterans who visited our Nation's \ncapital, many seeing for the first time the memorials built as a \ntribute to their selfless service. Today, I honor these Colorado \nveterans on their visit to Washington, DC, and I join them in paying \ntribute to those who made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of liberty.\n  Veterans from World War II include: Homer Anderson, Ernest Baugh, \nNorman Bever, William Compton, Alton Cooper, Arthur Cushing, Robert \nDavis, Harold Dawe, Jr., Richard Doyle, Robert Eldridge, Stewart Fonda, \nJr., Donald Forry, Albert Gablehouse, Charles Gebauer, William Hammond, \nSidney Hanks, William Hargis, Walter Hayward, Herman Huwa, Reinard \nJansssen, Donald Larson, Evelyn Lee, John MacQueen, Robert Martin, \nIsaac Martinez, George Norton, Eugene Olson, Herbert Pugh, Eugene \nReplogle, William Ripple, Max Rodgers, Loyal Smoke, Glen Springer, \nHarold Sutton, Donald Steinshouer, Eugene Turnbull, Roger Van Thorre, \nCharles Webb, James Whitley and Lawrence Zuppan.\n  Veterans from the Korean War include: Harry Ahlbrandt, Wallace Akers, \nRonald Anderson, Joseph Annello, Filbert Baca, Gilbert Ball, Delbert \nBlack, Keith Bordewyk, Delmar Bonser, Emilio Brito, Robert Burkholder, \nCharles Crihfield, Marvin Crihfield, Charles Dunfee, Sr., Thomas \nEckrich, Verne Einspahr, Virtus Einspahr, Frank Faiella, Theodore \nFarwell, Edwin Foss, Loren Garretson, Henry Geisert, Scott Goshorn, \nEarl Graham, Howard Hanson, Fred Hara, Jerry Herring, Bernard Hill, \nJohn Holloway, Harold Hoyland, Vealess Hudspeth, William Hughes, Jimmie \nHylton, John Jacobson, Ray Jacoby, Richard Jaggers, Kenneth Jan, \nFrances Killinger, Jr., Raymond Kosley, Edward Kirvonak, William \nKrupke, Pat Lanphear, Owen Lecheler, William Leppert, Clarence Lueb, \nRobert MacLauchlin, Philip Mahoney, Roquez Martinez, Horacio \nMasearenas, Edward Minch, Howard Morgan, Robert Muller, Leonard \nPeatrowsky, William Phillips, Dean Pope, Charles Pugh, George Pugh, \nTeddy Putnum, Thomas Ramm, Tommy Richie, Theodore Roos, Leonard \nSchmidt, Paul Schroeder, Lloyd Seekamp, Robert Sharrett, Richard \nSherman, James Sparks, Boyd Stark, Harvey Steward, Joseph Stockert, \nLeon Stone, Richard Stoner, Jr., Betty Taylor, Leo Thielen, John Toth, \nJohn Wachsmann, Benjamin Wagner, Roger Warden, Jr., Robert Weber, \nLester Weers and James Weitz.\n  Veterans from other conflicts include: Frank Griggs, James Smith and \nRobert Wideman.\n  Our Nation asked a great deal of these individuals--to leave their \nfamilies to fight in unknown lands and put their lives on the line. \nEach one of these brave Coloradans bravely answered the call.
