The bills will \nbe placed on the calendar.\n\n\n               Child Care and Development Block Grant Act\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in our great country we think of a college \neducation as the key to unlock our children's success. But many \nfamilies in this country struggle to afford child care, leaving no \nmoney whatsoever for higher education.\n  In 2011, in most States, 1 year of daycare for an infant was more \nexpensive than 1 year of tuition at a public university.\n  Let me repeat that. In America, in almost every State, 1 year of \ndaycare is more expensive than 1 year of tuition at a public \nuniversity. It is no wonder that middle-class families are struggling \nwith sticker shock, and for many low-income families childcare is \nsimply out of reach.\n  For millions of families in the United States, childcare is their \nsingle largest household expense at nearly $15,000 a year. In an \neconomy where most families have two working parents, childcare isn't a \nluxury, it is a necessity.\n  That is why President Bush signed the first Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant Act into law in 1990. He did this to ensure \nworking families\n\n[[Page S1532]]\n\nhave access to quality, affordable childcare.\n  I thank HELP Committee Chairman Harkin and Senators Burr, Mikulski, \nand Alexander for their diligent bipartisan work to reauthorize this \nmeasure.\n  The program serves more than 1.6 million children, including more \nthan 7,300 in Nevada, making access to affordable, high-quality care \npossible. But the program serves only a fraction of the need. We should \nbe doing more to guarantee every parent who wants to work can afford \nadequate supervision for their children and for every child, regardless \nof income, so that kids have a safe place to learn.\n  This bipartisan measure is an investment in America's mothers, 65 \npercent of whom work outside the home. Yet women earn less and are less \nlikely to go back to work after having children--than men--in part \nbecause of the shortage of safe, affordable daycare.\n  This program is helping millions of parents, and especially mothers, \nget back to work to help support their families. In the two decades \nsince this important program was last authorized, we have learned a \ngreat deal about the importance of early childhood education and high-\nquality childcare.\n  This bipartisan measure builds on that knowledge, updates health and \nsafety standards for childcare centers, and requires providers to \nundergo comprehensive background checks.\n  This reauthorization is only the first step. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle on the larger \neffort to broaden access to quality early childhood education.\n  We are going to take up this bill later today. As I have said before, \nand I will say again so everyone understands, this is a bipartisan \nbill. I hope the managers of this bill will do everything they can to \nmove this expeditiously through this body. But we are going to finish--\nnot finish it this week, but I prefer finishing it, and I hope we can \ndo that.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, shortly we will be voting on some \nnominees, and I want to thank all the nominees and their families for \ntheir willingness to serve the public. This is a real sacrifice. People \nare giving up other opportunities in order to serve their country. It \nis not just the individual who accepts these positions of public \nservice, it is a family matter, and so I applaud them all for their \nservice to our country.\n  I would like to speak in particular about the last vote we will have \nin this series, and that is the confirmation of Sarah Bloom Raskin as \nDeputy Secretary of the Treasury. Sarah is a person who has given much \nto public service throughout her career. I know her personally. She is \na Marylander, and we are very proud of the fact she is a Marylander.\n  If Sarah is confirmed, she will be the highest ranking woman in the \nhistory of the Treasury, and I am very proud of that accomplishment. \nShe has been very active in Maryland and at the national level. For the \npast several years Sarah has served on the Federal Reserve Board of \nGovernors. Her deep financial and regulatory knowledge and sound \njudgment made her an essential asset during her tenure there. As the \nPresiding Officer knows, this has been a very turbulent time in regard \nto the economy of our Nation, and during this great economic unease her \ndedication to strong consumer protections has been especially valuable.\n  Even before joining the Board of Governors, Sarah was no stranger to \nsuccessfully navigating choppy economic waters. In 2007 she was \nappointed Commissioner of Financial Regulation for the State of \nMaryland, so I have had the chance to observe her and her dedication \nand her effectiveness at the State level and also at the national \nlevel.\n  At the State level she has significantly improved consumer \nprotections and supported banks through the many challenges of the \nfinancial crisis. That is where I got to see her work firsthand and her \nthoughtfulness and how dedicated she was, and her ability to bring \npeople of different persuasions together, different stakeholders in our \nfinancial community, and to chart a course where we could have a \npositive result not only for the financial institutions but for \nconsumers and for our economy.\n  Sarah is also part of a family of government service. Her husband \nJamie is a member of the Maryland State Senate and has an excellent \nrecord of public service in his own right. So this is a family that has \ngiven much to public service. We need people in the administration like \nSarah Bloom Raskin. Her background, her education, and her job training \nall serve to make her particularly well suited to be the deputy \nsecretary.\n  I, for one, am thankful to Sarah and her family that she is willing \nto serve in an extremely challenging position. This is not going to be \nan easy position, obviously, as Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. It \ngives me great confidence to know Sarah will be handling the many \nresponsibilities demanded of the deputy secretary, and it gives me \ngreat pride that a fellow Marylander may continue to be among the \nfinancial leaders who guide our economy toward our future growth and \nstability.\n  I urge my colleagues to support her confirmation. We are indeed \nfortunate to have a person of her skills willing to serve as Deputy \nSecretary of the Treasury.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I got the chance to meet David Weis, a 22-\nyear-old student at Georgetown University, about a week ago. David's \nstory, unfortunately, although it may sound exceptional, is not. He was \njust about to celebrate his 19th birthday, when 2 days before it, in \n2010, he was diagnosed with thyroid and lymphatic cancer--a devastating \ndiagnosis that came just as he was preparing to start college.\n  As most of his classmates were enjoying the first days of their \nfreshman year at Georgetown University, David was dealing with a \nrigorous course of treatment for his disease that left him tired, left \nhim confused, and left him anxious about his future. David had an ace \nup his sleeve, and that was the fact he had insurance. But he only has \nit as long as he is covered as a student.\n  David came to the U.S. Capitol last week to testify in favor and in \nsupport of the Affordable Care Act, because he knows that with the \npassage of this bill his diagnosis will not be a death sentence; that \nhe will be able to get the coverage he needs; and that he will be able \nto pursue his dreams when he graduates rather than have his life \ndecisions dictated by his illness--having to choose a job simply \nbecause it provides health care or having to be locked into a career \nsimply because he can't afford going without insurance to cover his \ncancer.\n  David's story can be repeated hundreds of thousands of times all \nacross\n\n[[Page S1533]]\n\nthis country by young people in their teens and their twenties and in \ntheir thirties who thought they were invincible but who got knocked off \ntheir feet by a devastating disease such as cancer and who desperately \nneed health care insurance at the time of that illness in order to get \nback onto their feet.\n  Some of the best news that has come out over the past several months, \nas the enrollment has started to ramp up on the Affordable Care Act, \nhas been the number of young people who have signed up. We have seen \nthat 31 percent of all of the people who have signed up for insurance \nexchanges all across this country are 34 years or under. This is a real \nsignal that young people are recognizing that, although they may feel \nas if they are going to live forever, they desperately need insurance, \njust as everyone else does. So that is why I was so glad to see \nPresident Obama yesterday go on the show ``Between Two Ferns,'' with \nZach Galifianakis, to talk about the importance of young people signing \nup.\n  We all know about the ``Two Ferns'' effect. Previously unknown stars \nsuch as Will Ferrell and Bradley Cooper went on ``Two Ferns'' and were \ncatapulted to stardom. I am glad to see the ``Two Ferns'' effect has \nhad the same impact on health care enrollment. Since President Obama \nwent on ``Two Ferns,'' 19,000 people were referred to the Web site of \nenrollment from the ``Funny or Die'' Web site. By 6 p.m. that day the \nvideo had sent 32,000 people to healthcare.gov. HHS officials said \ntraffic on healthcare.gov had risen by 40 percent on Tuesday to over \n890,000 visits in 1 day.\n  It is a signal that when young people, through whatever means is \navailable to them, find out about the benefits of the Affordable Care \nAct, they are interested and they are signing up. I hope President \nObama uses more innovative tools and methods to try to get the word out \nto young adults in their late teens, twenties, and thirties about the \nimportance of signing up for the Affordable Care Act because it is \nimportant. Some 70,000 adolescents and young adults are diagnosed with \ncancer every single year in this country. There are 151,000 people \nbelow the age of 20 living with diabetes right now. So despite the fact \nthat we may think we are going to live forever or think we may not need \ncoverage, young people need it as well. It is affordable.\n  The President said yesterday on this show: You effectively can get \ncoverage for the cost of a cell phone bill. And it is true. Having a \ncell phone is pretty important, but being able to get treatment when \nyou get a serious disease is pretty important as well.\n  In Connecticut the numbers are pretty reasonable. A 22-year-old in \nHartford making a $25,000 salary--which is the salary I made in my \nfirst job in Hartford--can get a bronze policy for as low as $66 a \nmonth through Anthem. A 25-year-old living in Bridgeport making a \nlittle more, $30,000, can get a bronze policy for as low as $108 a \nmonth. About two-thirds of all young adults across the country who are \ncurrently uninsured are eligible for these subsidies.\n  For all of these young people who were previously going to the \nmarketplace and often having to pay full price, often buying insurance \non their own with no ability to negotiate a group discount, this health \ncare law is transformational. Fifty or sixty dollars a month is the \nprice for bronze plans. And this doesn't even count the catastrophic \noption open to most young people as well.\n  The good news continues to roll in when it comes to the numbers of \npeople signing up. Yesterday the administration announced that 4.2 \nmillion people have enrolled in marketplaces through March 1; 943,000 \npeople enrolled in the short month of February; and 31 percent of all \nthose people are 34 or younger. And, of course, we haven't even gotten \nto crunch time yet.\n  I wish this weren't the case, but I know something about how young \npeople think. Too many leave big decisions until the last minute, \nwhether it be studying for a test, writing a term paper, or signing up \nfor health care.\n  As we have seen in the past on a lot of these enrollment deadlines, \nlike the enrollment deadline for Medicare Part D, the surge comes in \nthe final few weeks of enrollment. So we expect to see the numbers pick \nup in a significant way through March.\n  Knowing how people in their twenties and thirties think, I expect we \nwill see a major surge in enrollment from young people as well. But \nthey shouldn't wait until the last minute. It does take more than a few \nhours to look at the choices and decide which is best. In Connecticut \nwe have three insurance plans offering coverage, but each one of them \nhas three or four different plans. So I hope young adults in their \ntwenties and thirties take more than a few hours or a day to sign up \nbecause we want to make sure they get the plan available for them. It \nis easy to do with a phone call to an enrollment center, a visit in \nConnecticut to the in-person centers in New Britain and New Haven, and \nvery simple to do on healthcare.gov.\n  In Connecticut our exchange is going like gangbusters. We had a goal \nof signing up 80,000 to 100,000 people, and a full 30 days before the \ndeadline we have signed up 152,000 people. Of those individuals in \nConnecticut, about 25 percent are 25 years or younger. We are on track \nto double our original estimates in Connecticut.\n  Connecticut is a State that had a pretty high rate of insured to \nbegin with, so our delta to get to full insurance was relatively small \ncompared to other States. But guess what Connecticut is doing. \nConnecticut is actually working to implement the law rather than \nworking to undermine the law. We put a lot of time and thought into \ngetting a working Web site, into doing the kind of outreach other \nStates are not doing to get people to sign up. When we have done that, \nyoung people and old people across the board have flocked to sign up.\n  I was glad to see the President do his outreach yesterday to young \npeople all across the country. I was glad to see the spike in interest \non healthcare.gov. I am glad to see that 4.2 million people have signed \nup for health care, as more people all across the country--young people \nespecially--are realizing the Affordable Care Act works.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/12/senate-section/article/S1533-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, too often in Washington our friends on \nthe left seem to operate under a very dangerous assumption: that good \nintentions are more important than a good outcome. I say it is \ndangerous because we see all the time how liberal Washington politics \nthat aim to alleviate problems such as poverty or wage stagnation or \nother social or economic problems just seem to make things worse. Yet, \ndespite the evidence, the policies never seem to change. More money \njust gets thrown at the same failed programs year after year with \nbarely any thought as to whether they actually work.\n  ObamaCare is a case in point. Here is a big-government bill that \nWashington Democrats thought they could just pass and--poof--health \ncare would magically be made more affordable for everybody. Yet for \nmillions of Americans just the opposite happened. Contrary to the \nassurances, ObamaCare has upended lives and businesses all across our \ncountry. It has forced painful choices for people who could barely get \nby as it was. It is a mess.\n  So one would assume Washington Democrats would step back and take a \nlong hard look at the accumulating evidence and start thinking about \nways to keep this thing from pummeling even more Americans. But we \nwould be wrong. They just keep doubling down.\n  When the Web site crashed, they called it a glitch. When people \nstarted losing their doctors and their plans, they told them: You can \nlive with it. When Americans started sharing their ObamaCare horror \nstories, they basically called them all liars. That would tell us \nsomething we need to know about how much Washington liberals care about \nmiddle-class Americans. They are captive to the most extreme ideologies \nof the left, and they don't even try to hide it anymore. Forget reason \nor economics or sound argument; it is all about ideology with these \nguys.\n  We saw it all on vivid display a couple nights ago with the \nDemocrats' all-\n\n[[Page S1534]]\n\nnight talkathon on global warming. The reason for the all-nighter was \npretty obvious: It was a command performance for a leftwing activist \ndonor out in California. And the fact that taxpayers were basically \nsubsidizing the whole thing was bad enough, but what about the basic \nsubstance of the issue Democrats were talking about the other night. \nWhat about that. It is just one more case where good intentions trump \nthe impact their proposals would have on ordinary Americans.\n  See, the Obama administration seems to think that if it just wishes \nreally hard and issues enough regulations, it can singlehandedly reduce \nglobal carbon emissions--without bringing Beijing and New Delhi \nonboard. It is an alternate universe where ``victory'' means U.S. \nemissions going down by some negligible amount--and where China and \nIndia don't simultaneously eclipse that tiny emissions reduction with \nexpanded energy of their own. It is a universe where the massive \neconomic consequence of acting so recklessly doesn't seem to matter, \nand it is a universe where middle-class Americans somehow don't take \nthe hit to our economic output right on the chin. In other words, it is \nthe kind of thing that could only make sense to a party blinded by \nextremist ideology.\n  Of course, Washington Democrats love to pull out that old straw man \nand say: Either you support our approach completely--even if it won't \nactually solve the problem it purports to--or you hate the environment. \nIt is kind of like when they said: Either you vote for ObamaCare or you \nhate affordable health care. Well, our constituents remember how that \nworked out, and our constituents are quite capable of seeing the \ncomplexity in the world which so often eludes our friends on the left. \nThey are capable of caring deeply about the environment, for instance, \nwhile disagreeing with the administration's ideological crusade.\n  Of course, every ideological crusade needs an enemy. In the \nadministration's war on coal, Washington Democrats appear to have found \ntheir foil. It is not some fat cat. It is not some Wall Street titan. \nNo. This time it seems to be middle-class Kentucky families--miners who \nstruggle every day just to put food on the table, the kinds of \nAmericans who work hard so the rest of us can have a better life. Well, \nit is unfair and it is wrong.\n  Where Washington Democrats seem to see faceless adversaries, I see \nhuman beings, people who are hurting. I wish my Democratic colleagues \nwould join me sometime as I travel around Kentucky listening to their \nconcerns.\n  At one recent hearing, a miner named Howard Abshire had this message \nfor President Obama:\n\n       Come and look at our little children, look at our people, \n     Mr. President. You're not hurting for a job; you've got one. \n     I don't have one.\n\n  Another miner, Gary Lockhart, said his biggest worry was just trying \nto keep a roof over his family's head and food on the table. When it \ncomes to his fellow miners, here is what he had to say:\n\n       Many of these men, who have never asked the government for \n     any kind of assistance in their lives . . . [are] having to \n     go home and tell their families that their pay's going to be \n     cut to practically nothing, [that] there'll be very little \n     Christmas this year, no vacations, nothing extra.\n\n  Miners aren't the only ones affected by all the pain out there in \ncoal country. I will read a letter I received from Bill Scaggs, a \nbusinessman and pastor from Pikeville. Here is what Bill had to say:\n\n       We have had to lay off employees due to the closings of \n     mines and the [effect] they have had. Our business is losing \n     thousands of dollars due to the negative impact of the EPA. \n     As a pastor . . . our benevolence to the community has \n     increased fivefold with help for food, power bills, clothing, \n     and just the day to day living expenses that families need.\n\n  Americans may not always know it, but they owe a lot to coal miners \nlike the ones I represent in Kentucky. Whether it is watching a TV \nshow, drying a pair of jeans, or saving some leftover takeout for \ntomorrow, we often probably have a miner to thank for the electricity \nthat makes it all possible. That is also true if we try to keep the \nlights on all night long.\n  So I hope our friends on the other side will remember to be thankful \nfor the electricity that makes all-night talkathons actually possible. \nHonestly, I still don't get the point of the stunt. They didn't \nintroduce legislation or schedule votes on the national electricity tax \nthey seem to want so badly. Remember, they control the Senate, so they \ncan bring it up for debate whenever they want to. Where is the climate \nchange debate? Where is the bill? People who were speaking all night \ncontrol the Senate. Bring up the bill. Here is the point: Republicans \ncare deeply about the environment. We also care deeply about creating \njobs and growing the middle class, and we do not think our country \nshould have to sacrifice one priority for the other. The American \npeople do not either. So it is time for Washington Democrats to drop \nthe billionaire-approved ideological crusades, to quit all the talk and \nget onboard with sensible forward-looking action to create jobs. We \nhave tried the left's wish-upon-a-star approach already and real people \nhave been hurt. So why not try some things that will actually work.\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Will the Senator withhold his \nrequest?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will withhold.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to talk about the new numbers that \nhave been released on the President's health care plan. Yesterday the \nadministration announced that slightly more than 4.2 million people \nhave signed up for health plans through the exchanges. As we all know, \nthat is substantially below their first goal and substantially below \ntheir adjusted goal just a few weeks ago.\n  One of the things, in an effort by the Washington Post to find out \nhow many of those people hadn't had insurance before--the group that \nwas supposed to be served well by this--their estimate was in an \narticle also this week, about 1 million people--an incredible amount of \neffort to add 1 million people to the insurance rolls, particularly \nwith the stories from the millions of people who were on the insurance \nrolls that come to our offices every day; stories that clearly reflect \nproblems with this law and problems, more importantly, for the American \nfamilies who are impacted.\n  I brought a few of them with me today--since I was talking about this \ntopic last week--that have come to our office. These are stories where \nwe reached back, contacted these people, said I was going to come to \nthe floor with their story. I mentioned their first name and where they \nare from, are they concerned with that. Time after time people say, oh, \nno, we want this story told, which is why we reached out to you.\n  Gary in Lake Ozark, MO, says what so many people are saying--that his \ndeductible is now the problem. In fact, his deductible on the policy he \ncan now have--let me just read what he said:\n\n       Before I knew I'd be able to stay on my company's plan--\n\n  He was going to be able to stay on his company plan 1 year longer \nthan he thought he was just a few months ago--\n\n       Before I knew I'd be able to stay on my company's plan, I \n     went to the exchange to seek coverage. I found a plan \n     available to me but was shocked to learn that my deductible \n     was going to be over $8,000 per family member.\n\n  This is quickly becoming the new group of people who aren't able to \nmeet their health care costs. I met with a number of health care \nadministrators, hospital administrators from Missouri recently. They \nsaid their fastest growing category of unpaid bills, of unpaid debt, is \nfrom people who have insurance. So many people with insurance now have \na deductible that is a deductible they believe they cannot pay, and \nbecause they believe they cannot pay it, they simply do not pay it. So \nwhether it is the $8,000 on Gary's policy or the other lower amounts--\nhopefully, I will find some lower amounts here.\n  Here is one from another Gary. This Gary is in southeast Missouri. \nHis wife's deductible went from $500 to $1,800--story after story. What \nhappens when you have that growing deductible, whether it is the $1,800 \nor the $3,000 or the $8,000, if it was $500 and that was all you were \ngoing to have to pay, you might figure out how to put together $500 or \nmaybe even more than that, but when you see $1,800 or $3,000\n\n[[Page S1535]]\n\nor $8,000, apparently people who used to pay their $500 deductible say \nthey can't possibly pay that, so the hospital needs to write that off, \nI guess, as bad debt. They are going to come after me for $7,500 just \nlike they would have for $8,000.\n  So a deductible that used to be reasonable and was paid, now the \nfamily looks at that and says we cannot possibly ever get to that \ndeductible, so there is no reason to even start down that path.\n  I have a whole list of Gary's here on top of this. I don't think they \nare all making up the name Gary. This Gary from Higginsville--I could \nhave organized these to have a little more variety in the first three, \nbut this is Gary from Higginsville, MO. They said his prescription \ncosts for his premium for Humana Gold Plus Medicare Advantage and his \ncopays have all gone up significantly. He is concerned about Medicare \nAdvantage.\n  Just a few days ago I was here--in fact, I ran into this person. \nReading this letter:\n\n       I am the man you spoke with outside Starbucks in \n     Independence, MO, across from the mall. You leaned down on my \n     car door of which the window was down. . . .\n\n  He called me over to talk about ObamaCare.\n\n       What has changed is that several of my medications have \n     gone up in price . . . my premium has gone up for Human Gold \n     Plus Medicare Advantage. My deductibles and co-pays have gone \n     up--\n\n  Things that are the result of the cuts made to Medicare now actually \ncost him the money that used to be paid for by Medicare. When you cut \nMedicare $500 billion to start a new program, somebody who is on the \nold program is going to be impacted by that. It is not like when we \ndebated this we said, well, this Medicare Program is in such great \nshape that now we can start a new program and use money from Medicare \nto do that. That was done in the face of the understanding that \nMedicare, one of the principal obligations the country has made to \nretired people--people over 65, going back to 1965--that this was a \nprogram that wasn't going to be able to support itself.\n\n  So what do we decide to do as a Congress--and I voted against it and \nI am glad I did, but the ultimate decision was we are going to cut \nMedicare to start a new program, and we will see what happens to a \nprogram we already know is in trouble when we do that.\n  Frank from Kansas City's policy was canceled for not meeting the \nAffordable Care Act requirements. So he was forced to sign up on the \nexchange for himself, his wife, his 22-year-old daughter, his 19-year-\nold son, his 11-year-old daughter.\n  Frank was told that his 11-year-old daughter would qualify for \nMedicaid. He submitted three applications that they said they never \nreceived. After 2 months they asked him for additional information \nabout his daughter, including tax information not available until April \n1. Because of all this the Affordable Care Act is causing his daughter \nto go uninsured, according to Frank, until at least June.\n  This is one of those States that has an exchange the States have set \nup. A couple of places have never been able to sign up one single \nperson. It is not October 1, it is now much closer to April 1, and this \nsystem is just not meeting the needs of families or meeting the goals \nthat clearly it set for itself.\n  Farrell from Versailles, MO, says he is facing financial hardship \nbecause his employer cut his hours to avoid covering his health \ninsurance. The employer told him ObamaCare was the reason they were \ncutting his hours. He was teaching at a community college as an adjunct \nprofessor for 8 years. He said he quit his full-time job because, \naccording to him, he was teaching four courses each semester and a \ncourse over the summer and that appeared to be meeting his needs.\n  Suddenly the new law comes along and his employer says: If you work \nas much as you have been working, we will have to provide health \ninsurance.\n  Something that you and I would both be interested in too, having \nworked together for a long time, is seeing the response that even local \ngovernments and State governments have had for people they always--\nbecause they thought it was the right thing to do--provided health \ncare. But sadly when the Federal Government said here is what you have \nto do, then that drew an interesting line across our society. It also \nmeans if you have to do this, you do not have to do anything for people \nwho do not meet the requirement--the 30-hour workweek, the impact it \nhas had on people.\n  I was in a location the other day, and I said to the manager of the \nstore: How are you doing, meaning I thought this would be a skill \ndiscussion; how are you doing with the skill levels you may need to \nfind here for people who are dealing with customers. He said it is \nharder all the time because now we have to hire four people, where we \nused to have to hire three people because nobody new whom we are hiring \nis working more than 29 hours a week. So instead of finding three \npeople to do that job to work 40 hours a week, now we are having to \nfind four people who work less than 30 hours a week.\n  He went on to say managers and people who were already working, \nnobody's getting their hours cut, but he said: When we are hiring new \npeople, we are doing what our competitors are doing, which is hiring \npart-time people who do not have benefits.\n  Emmett at Lake Ozark, despite the fact that he was paying all his \npremiums through his employer, his employer dropped early retirees from \nthe company policy.\n  He did not feel comfortable submitting his information to \nhealthcare.gov, he says, for security reasons. By the way, nobody \ncontends that this Web site is secure or that the information people \nput on it is secure. In fact, it is just the opposite. Every indication \nhas been it is not secure. He did say he used ``the website to find a \nplan, but three months later, when I finally got a quote, it was \nunaffordable, and much higher than the quotes I was able to find'' \noutside of the exchange.\n  Bob from Wentzville, MO, said he has seen his insurance increase by \n15 percent over the past 3 years. I feel like writing back to Bob, \nsaying, based on all the other letters, with 15 percent you should be \nfeeling pretty good about that, but nobody feels good about a 15-\npercent increase. It is just that so many people are seeing an increase \nthat is so much higher than that.\n  On the other hand, his insurance premiums have increased by 15 \npercent, but--back to the earlier discussion--his deductible has gone \nfrom $500 annually to $4,000 annually or $8,000 for the family.\n  Is this the kind of insurance families need? They used to pay a \npremium that was just a little bit less, 15 percent less, but they had \na $500 annual deductible, not a $4,000 annual deductible.\n  Beverly from Potosi, MO, went to her doctor for her annual screening \nand was told she could only have one now every 2 years because of the \nAffordable Care Act. Although her risk of cancer increases with age, \nshe believes she is getting less care than she got before.\n  Holly from Jefferson County, MO, is a registered nurse who is now \nworking two part-time jobs. She is living paycheck to paycheck. Here is \nwhat she says in her letter:\n\n       I am a registered nurse that is only working part-time at 2 \n     jobs. I live paycheck to paycheck like most people since the \n     economic crisis. I am barely able to keep my bills paid much \n     less able to add another one. I am upset that my right as a \n     US citizen has been taken away from me to decide for myself \n     if I want health insurance or not.\n\n  I think she could have added to that, to decide for herself whether \nshe wanted it and what she wanted. I cannot tell what the President's \nlatest announcement was, but it appears to be if you had insurance, \neven if it has been canceled because it didn't meet the qualifications, \nnow somehow it is not canceled--and how you deal with that as someone \nwho has maybe gotten another policy or maybe moved beyond the insurance \nyou had and do not qualify to go back.\n  I don't know how many times we can change this law without finally \nadmitting the law is not working. Let's take everything we know now, \nwhich is so much more than the country knew and most Members of \nCongress knew when the law passed--let's take everything we know now \nand go back and do this the right way.\n  Jason from Pleasant Hill and his wife purchased plans through their \nemployer. Again, they experienced price increases without added \nbenefits and in fact with less benefits than they had before.\n\n[[Page S1536]]\n\n  There is one letter after another coming to our office in various \nways every day. I could stand here and read them for a long time, but \nif I read the clock correctly, I think my time is out and we are ready \nto move on to other business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/12/senate-section/article/S1536-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1536-S1537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the last two days, we have spent \nunnecessary floor time overcoming procedural obstacles so that we can \nvote to confirm the five judicial nominations before us today. Every \nsingle one of the nominees that we will vote on today has bipartisan \nsupport and will be confirmed by significant margins. Judge Carolyn \nMcHugh was nominated last May, while all four nominees to the Eastern \nDistrict of Michigan were nominated last July. All of these nominees \ncould and should have been confirmed before we adjourned last year. \nInstead, because Republicans refused to consent to hold these \nnominations in the Senate, and every single one had to be returned to \nthe President at the end of last year. They then had to be re-nominated \nand re-processed through Committee this year and were all reported out \nwith bipartisan support on January 16, 2014.\n  We have not had a vote on a judicial nomination this year that was \nnot subjected to a Republican filibuster. I appreciate very much the \ntwo Republican senators, Senator Collins and Senator Murkowski, who \nhave voted each time to end the filibuster of judicial nominees. For \nother Republican senators, however, I have started to notice a pattern \nof voting to end filibusters only if a nominee is from a state with at \nleast one Republican home state Senator. Most recently this happened \nearlier this week on the cloture vote for Judge McHugh with nine \nRepublicans voting to end the filibuster. It should not require a \njudicial nominee to be from a state with one or more Republican home \nstate senators for some senators to do the right thing. Filling \nvacancies so that our Federal judiciary can be fully functioning should \nnot be a partisan issue.\n  Today, we will finally vote to confirm the following nominees:\n  Judge Carolyn McHugh has been nominated to fill a vacancy in the \nTenth Circuit Court of Appeals. She has served since 2005 as a judge on \nthe Utah Court of Appeals and as the Presiding Judge of that court \nsince 2012. She previously worked in private practice at Parr Brown Gee \n& Loveless as an Associate, 1983-1987, and subsequently as a \nShareholder, 1987-2005. She has served as an Adjunct Professor at the \nUniversity of Utah Law School and at the University of Utah College of \nSocial and Behavioral Science. Judge McHugh earned her J.D., Order of \nthe Coif, from the University of Utah Law School in 1982. After law \nschool, she clerked for Judge Bruce S. Jenkins of the United States \nDistrict Court for the District of Utah. The ABA Standing Committee on \nthe Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Judge McHugh ``Well Qualified'' \nto serve on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, its \nhighest rating. She has the support of her home state senators, Senator \nHatch and Senator Lee.\n  Matthew Leitman is nominated to fill a judicial emergency vacancy in \nthe Eastern District of Michigan. He has worked in private practice for \nalmost 20 years, including as senior principal, 2005-present, and \nsenior counsel, 2004, at Miller, Canfield, Paddock, and Stone, P.L.C, \nand as Partner, 2000-2004, and Associate, 1994-1999, at Miro, Weiner, & \nKramer, P.C. He earned his J.D., magna cum laude, from Harvard Law \nSchool in 1993. Following his graduation from law school, he served as \na law clerk to Justice Charles L. Levin of the Michigan Supreme Court. \nThe ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated \nMr. Leitman ``Well Qualified'' to serve on the U.S. District Court for \nthe Eastern District of Michigan, its highest rating.\n  Judith Levy is nominated to fill a judicial emergency vacancy in the \nEastern District of Michigan. She has served since 2000 as an Assistant \nU.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of Michigan, where she has served \nas the Chief of the Civil Rights Unit since 2010. She has also worked \nas an Adjunct Professor of Law at the University of Michigan Law \nSchool, 2005-present, and as a trial attorney for the United States \nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission, 1999-2000. She earned her \nJ.D., cum laude, from Michigan Law School in 1996. Following her \ngraduation from law school, she served as a law clerk to Judge Bernard \nFriedman of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern of District of \nMichigan, 1996-1999.\n  Judge Laurie Michelson is nominated to fill a vacancy in the Eastern \nDistrict of Michigan. She has served since 2011 as a U.S. Magistrate \nJudge in the Eastern District of Michigan. Prior to her judicial \nservice, she worked in private practice for 18 years at Butzel Long as \nan associate, 1993-2000, and subsequently as a shareholder, 2000-2011. \nShe has also served for 3 years as an Adjunct Professor at Oakland \nUniversity, 2003-2006. She earned her J.D. from Northwestern University \nLaw School in 1992. Following her graduation from law school, she \nserved as a law clerk to Judge Cornelia G. Kennedy of the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Sixth Circuit.

Thompson of the District of Columbia Superior Court, \n1983-1985.\n  All four of the district court nominees have the support of their \nhome state senators--Senator Levin and Senator Stabenow. I hope my \nfellow senators will join me today to confirm these nominees so that \nthey can begin working on behalf of the American people.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, consideration of judicial nominees is among \nthe most important duties of the Senate. I am pleased that four, well-\nqualified nominees to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District \nof Michigan will now be before the Senate, and I urge my colleagues to \nconfirm them. Each of them has demonstrated a commitment to impartial \njustice and a thorough knowledge of the law. Each was recommended by an \nindependent screening committee that Senator Stabenow and I have \nformed. It is broadly based and chaired by one of Michigan's truly \noutstanding lawyers, Eugene Driker.\n  Each of the nominees has a distinguished background. Matthew Leitman \nserved as a clerk to Justice Charles Levin on the Michigan Supreme \nCourt and has extensive experience in private practice, focusing on \ncomplex commercial litigation, criminal defense, and appellate \nlitigation. He has argued before State and Federal trial courts, as \nwell as numerous appeals before State and Federal appellate courts, and \nhas written a number of influential journal articles on important \naspects of State and Federal law such as immigration and fraud \nenforcement. He has on many occasions been recognized by his peers as \none of the most effective and knowledgeable litigators in our State.\n  He is also dedicated to public service. He has been a pro bono \nhonoree for the Eastern District of Michigan every year since 2008.\n  Judith Ellen Levy worked in private practice and as a trial attorney \nfor the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in Detroit. She \nhas conducted research and taught classes and seminars at the \nUniversity of Michigan. Since 2000, she has served as an assistant U.S. \nattorney and Civil Rights Unit chief in the U.S. Attorney's Office in \nDetroit. There, she is responsible for investigating and litigating \ncivil rights cases on behalf of the United States, including fair \nhousing, fair lending,\n\n[[Page S1537]]\n\ndisability access, and police misconduct cases, and for handling \ncitizen civil rights complaints addressed to the office and conducting \noutreach regarding a variety of office programs.\n  Ms. Levy has also received numerous awards for her dedication to \ncommunity service, including several Department of Justice Civil Rights \nDivision Certificates of Commendation and an award from the University \nof Michigan Council for Disability Concerns.\n  Judge Laurie J. Michelson served as law clerk to the Honorable \nCornelia G. Kennedy of the U.S. Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit and \nthen for nearly 18 years worked in private practice in the areas of \nwhite-collar criminal defense and media and intellectual property law. \nShe was sworn in as a magistrate judge for the Eastern District of \nMichigan in February 2011.\n  In private practice and as a magistrate judge, Judge Michelson has \nably navigated some of the most complex areas of Federal law but has \nnever lost sight of the fact that the law has a human impact.\n  Judge Linda Vivienne Parker served as the director of the Michigan \nDepartment of Civil Rights from 2003 to 2008. She also worked in \nprivate practice and served as the first executive assistant U.S. \nattorney for the Eastern District of Michigan under U.S. attorney Saul \nA. Green from 1994 to 2000. In 2008, she was appointed to the Third \nJudicial Circuit Court in Wayne County. In addition to her criminal \ndocket, Judge Parker serves as a judge in the Adult Drug Treatment \nCourt.\n  Judge Parker has dedicated her legal career to public service and has \ncommitted a great deal of time to serving and advocating for homeless \nfamilies and teenage mothers. She served as the Chair of New Steps, an \norganization committed to providing services for economically \ndisadvantaged new mothers in substance abuse recovery.\n  Each of these nominees knows the law and is ready to bear the \nresponsibilities of a Federal judge. I urge my colleagues to confirm \ntheir nominations so they can begin serving the people of the Eastern \nDistrict of Michigan.\n  I would yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/12/senate-section/article/S1537-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp).

Madam President, I am pleased the Senate is now \nconsidering the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2014. I \nhave a first-degree amendment to the committee-reported substitute \namendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2811.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To include rural and remote areas as underserved areas \n                     identified in the State plan)\n\n       On page 88, line 8, insert ``, such as rural and remote \n     areas'' after ``underserved areas''.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, we are now on the Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant Act of 2014. I know Senator Alexander and I, \nand others, are anxious to consider amendments. I encourage people who \nhave amendments to bring them to the floor so Senator Burr, Senator \nAlexander, Senator Mikulski or I could look at them and get things \nlined up.\n  It is my intent--and I hope I can speak for Senator Alexander on this \ntoo--to have an open yet managed process with respect to this bill and \nfor Senators who have relevant amendments to have the opportunity to \nhave them offered and to be voted on. I expect we would have a couple \nof votes within the next few hours. I don't even know when but sometime \nsoon. So again, I strongly encourage Senators with amendments to bring \nthem over and file them so we can get them discussed expeditiously.\n  This bill was voted unanimously out of the HELP Committee last \nSeptember. I hope it will receive strong bipartisan support here on the \nSenate floor. I give tremendous credit and thanks to Senators Mikulski \nand\n\n[[Page S1546]]\n\nBurr, the sponsors of this legislation, for their leadership in this \nprocess over a couple of years working together, creating a bill which \ntakes huge steps in improving the lives of children and their families.\n  At the outset I also thank our ranking member Senator Alexander for \nhis partnership and for working with us to reauthorize this vital \nprogram. Our offices have worked collaboratively over the last couple \nof years to produce a strong bipartisan bill.\n  I would start first by saying this program has a big impact in my \nState of Iowa. Right now Iowa serves about 15,800 children every month \nwith CCDBG funds: 28 percent infants and toddlers; 26 percent ages 3 to \n4; and about half or 46 percent, ages 5 to 13.\n  Most people think of this simply as a childcare-type bill for infants \nand toddlers, but this is not true. This goes to age 13, but over half \ngoes to those under the age of 5.\n  The last time this was reauthorized in 1996, 18 years ago, this \nprogram was basically looked at as mainly a work support program, \ntaking care of kids while parents went to work. It was only \nincidentally thought of as something which could have a real impact on \nthe lives of kids. Well, 18 years later and backed by scientific \nresearch, we know the program can and should be much more. In addition \nto providing vital work support for parents, it could be a rich early \nlearning opportunity for children.\n\n  In 2000 the National Research Council published a groundbreaking \nreport called ``Neurons to Neighborhoods.'' The report's author said:\n\n       From the time of conception to the first day of \n     kindergarten, development proceeds at a pace exceeding that \n     of any subsequent stage of life. . . . that what happens \n     during the first months and years of life matters a lot, not \n     because this period of development provides an indelible \n     blueprint for adult well-being, but because it sets either a \n     sturdy or fragile stage for what follows.\n\n  What this bill does is set that sturdy stage.\n  This report that I talk about from the National Research Council \nreinforces what we already know--that learning starts at birth and that \npreparation for learning begins even before birth. Eighty percent of a \nchild's brain develops between birth and age 3. Because much of a \nchild's intellect and skills develop before he or she begins \nkindergarten, we need to give all children every opportunity to reach \ntheir full potential at their earliest stages in life. This means \nsupporting access to high-quality early-learning programs, including \nhigh-quality childcare.\n  The bill before us represents a strong and positive advance for low-\nincome families who benefit from the childcare subsidies. The bill \nmakes many needed improvements that will help establish high \nexpectations for federally subsidized childcare in this country. The \nbill accomplishes a lot of good. I will highlight two or three items \nhere.\n  First of all, education and training for childcare workers. Under \nthis bill the States that apply and get these block grants will need to \ndevelop minimum education and training requirements for childcare \nworkers that describe what they must know and be able to do to promote \nthe health and development of the children they serve. Just as we know \nthat a great teacher is one of the most important factors in a \nclassroom, we also know that one of the most critical components of \nearly development in children is whether they have supportive nurturing \ninteractions with caring adults.\n  Another important thing we do in the bill is to promote safety and \nhealth standards. This bill ensures that licensed childcare providers \nreceive a prelicensure inspection and one annual inspection thereafter. \nAlarmingly, some States inspect childcare centers only once in 5 years. \nSome States don't even do a prelicensure inspection until a provider is \nserving more than a dozen children.\n  The bill also stipulates and focuses on vulnerable populations, \nincluding children with disabilities, infants and toddlers, and \nchildren whose parents work nontraditional hours. I want to highlight \nthat the sponsors of this bill, Senator Burr and Senator Mikulski, took \ngreat care to ensure that childcare programs supported through this \nblock grant would be well-suited for children with special needs and \ntheir families. The legislation asks States to consider the unique \nneeds of children with disabilities when developing training \nrequirements for childcare workers. A childcare worker may be trained \nto take care of nondisabled children. But taking care of a child with a \ndisability requires a little bit more expertise and a little extra \ntraining, and that is what this bill does provide. It also lets parents \nknow the types of services available through the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act.\n  The bill also provides families with stability and continuity of care \nfor families. Once they receive care, they are going to get it for at \nleast 1 year if they are initially deemed eligible. Currently, some \nStates require parents to reapply for care after only a few months. In \nsome cases States will kick parents off of care if they receive a small \npay raise that makes them ineligible under the State's eligibility \nguidelines. This bill remedies this by ensuring that as long as a \nparent is working or is in a training program and whose income does not \nexceed 85 percent of the State's median income, they will get care for \nat least 1 year without having to work. Again, this helps children \nbecause we know that a lot of times these kinds of disruptions can \nreally set a child back, and this allows at least for continuity for 1 \nyear.\n  The bill also supports the development of a Web site. I know Senator \nBurr was very interested in that and helped promote and put that in the \nbill. The Web site is going to be available for all parents to show \nthem the range of childcare providers in their area so they can shop \naround and see what is out there.\n  Right now the law says States can set the eligibility requirement as \nlong as it does not exceed 85 percent of the State's median income. If \nyou look at all of the children ages 0 to age 13--because the bill \ncovers up to age 13--if you look at preschool age kids 0 to 5, we do a \nlittle bit better. States are serving a little more than a quarter of \nthe children who would be eligible under the Federal guidelines. I \nthink this shows the present landscape right now. Out of 100 percent of \nthe kids that are eligible, we have 73 percent eligible preschool-aged \nchildren not being served. There are about 27 percent of preschool-aged \nchildren being served. So we do have a long way to go. As chairman of \nthe Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, \nEducation, and Related Agencies, our committee has fought for years to \nincrease funding so we can serve more children. The fiscal year 2014 \nomnibus included more than a $154 million increase for the childcare \nprogram. I know that sounds like a lot, but all that it did was replace \nthe $118 million cut that happened because of sequestration. We \nreplaced the $118 million plus whatever that figures out to--about \nanother $36 more million. So it helps. The increased funding will help \nStates improve access to quality and affordable childcare by increasing \nthe number of kids who can receive it.\n  But actually we have a long way to go. The last chart shows what is \nhappening. If you look at the blue line at the bottom, that is the \nactual funding in this program. If you go back to 2005 and see what was \nin place, we are about $600 million short of where we would be if we \nkept up with inflation. You see, this is 2005. Those who have been \naround since then, we know what it was like before that. We have lost a \nlot of ground. So we need to make that up, and I hope we can do that in \nour appropriations bills that are coming up.\n  This bill changes the landscape and makes it a lot better for \nfamilies out there. The bill authorizes the funding, but the \nappropriations have to fund it. I hope that we can in fiscal year 2015 \ncontinue to be able to keep up the funding increases for the childcare \ndevelopment block grants.\n  It is a good bill. I am very proud of this bill, proud of the efforts \nthat Senator Burr and Senator Mikulski put into it over a long period \nof time. So I urge my colleagues to join in the bipartisan spirit of \ncooperation that we have witnessed in the health committee over the \nlast year.\n  If Senators have amendments that are germane to the bill, I encourage \nthem to bring them over so we can take a look at them and determine a \nfair path forward with respect to those amendments.\n  Again, I thank Senator Alexander for a great working relationship on \nthis committee and thank him for\n\n[[Page S1547]]\n\nworking so hard to help bring this bill forward to the bill today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I want to say to the Senator from \nIowa how much I appreciate working with him.\n  We were talking yesterday, and he told me--I think I have these facts \nabout right--that our committee in this Congress has reported 17 bills \nthat have passed the Senate and 10 that have become law, which I \nsuspect exceeds that of any other committee. As our hearing this \nmorning on the minimum wage showed, it is not because we always agree \nwith each other all the time. We probably have the most ideologically \nsplit committee in the Congress by party, but we get a lot done. That \nis due in great measure to the way the Senator from Iowa leads the \ncommittee, and I appreciate that very much.\n  I will have more to say about Senator Burr and Senator Mikulski in a \nfew moments because they have done the yeoman's work on this. They are \nthe leaders of this effort. They immersed themselves in it for the last \ntwo years. They brought it to a position which convinced everybody on \nthe committee it was time to move ahead, but that is not where we were \nwhen we started. We had lots of differences of opinions, and we came to \na conclusion that they will be explaining in detail.\n  So the way we will proceed today is this. After my remarks, Senator \nMikulski and Senator Burr will step up and begin to manage the bill. \nSenator Harkin and I will be here. We are continuing right through the \nafternoon.\n  We hope that Senators will bring their amendments to the floor. What \nwe are hoping to do is to have a debate about the child care and \ndevelopment block grant. We are hoping to have amendments, and we will \nhave votes on those amendments. It is not our desire to pick this \nDemocratic amendment or this Republican amendment. If you have an \namendment on the child care and development block grant that is related \nto the bill, please bring it over and talk to Senator Burr, Senator \nMikulski, Senator Harkin, or me, and we will start lining them up. \nThere will be time for debate. There will be a vote and it will be \nconsidered.\n  Our hope is to have votes this afternoon, votes tomorrow morning, and \nto let Senators know that there won't be votes tonight so they can plan \ntheir schedules. Senator Burr will talk more about that and the time \nfor attempting to conclude the bill tomorrow. That is our goal. That is \nthe way the Senate traditionally has worked. It is the way we hope it \nworks today.\n  Since Senator Mikulski from Maryland and the Senator from North \nCarolina have done the principal amount of work on the bill, I see no \nneed for me to go through the details of the bill. I think they are \nbetter equipped and prepared to do that. Let me try to put the whole \neffort in perspective before I step aside and Senator Mikulski and \nSenator Burr step up.\n  During World War II there were a great many mothers, women, who took \njobs outside the home. That was different. In our agricultural society \nfamilies worked together. As the industrial society in America \ndeveloped during the 20th century, men largely went away from home to \nwork and women mostly worked at home.\n  But in World War II something different happened. Many of the men \nwere overseas fighting. There was a lot of work to be done at home, and \nso women took jobs in the factories that they didn't have before. That \nproduced a new phenomenon in the American society which was called \nworksite daycare. Someone had to take care of the children. In many \ncases companies employing large numbers of women during World War II \nprovided sites at the workplace so that mothers could bring their \nchildren while they worked.\n  Then after the war was over, things went back to the way they were \nbefore, and most American women worked at home. That began to change \nprobably in the 1970s. It is probably fair to say that the greatest \nsocial change in our country over the last 40 years has been the \ngradual and steady phenomenon of more women in the workplace outside \nthe home and the adjustments our society has made to that.\n  I was lucky. I had an early head start in the little town of \nMaryville, Tennessee, where I grew up at the edge of the Smoky \nMountains. My mother had one of the town's two preschool education \nprograms. She had it in a converted garage in her backyard. She had \nbeen trained in Kansas and in a settlement house in Chicago. It is hard \nfor me today to imagine how she could do this, but she had 25 3-year-\nolds and 4-year-olds in the morning and 25 5-year-olds in the \nafternoon. That was Mrs. Alexander's preschool, which we called the \ninstitution of lower learning.\n  She had nowhere else to put me, so I became the first Senator to have \n5 years of kindergarten, which I probably needed, but which gave me a \nhead start. It gave me the understanding of what Senator Harkin said \nearlier--that research then, but especially now, shows the brain \ndevelops at least from the moment of conception and that all of the \ninfluences around an infant are important to that person's development \nover a long period of time.\n  Most parents who understand that want to make sure that they are with \na child at a very early age stimulating that child, or if they can't be \nwith their child for some period of time for some reason, someone else \nis looking after their child. Along with the changing role of women in \nthe workforce came the idea of more childcare.\n\n  I remember in 1986 when I was Governor of Tennessee, the head of our \nhuman services division--a woman named Marguerite Sallee, now \nMarguerite Kondracke--came to me, and she proposed that I ask the \nbusinesses in Tennessee to create 1,000 worksite daycare places. I was \nkind of taken aback by that because I didn't understand the need for \nit, and I didn't think the businesses would do it voluntarily.\n  Well, we did that, and we got twice as many worksite daycare places \nas we requested. It was good for businesses to do and there was plenty \nof demand for it from the parents who had to take their children to \nwork. The next year I was out of a job--I was through with my time as \nGovernor--and so was Marguerite. Along with Captain Kangaroo--Bob \nKeeshan--my wife, and Brad Martin, we founded a company called \nCorporate Child Care, which provided worksite daycare places. After \nabout 10 years, it merged with its major competitor Bright Horizons, \nand they became what is today the largest provider of worksite daycare \nin the world.\n  Companies have realized the importance of worksite daycare, but not \nall mothers and fathers can send their children to Bright Horizons \nwhile they work, and so there came to be a recognition that there \nneeded to be some response by the Federal Government.\n  The next year, about 1988, the first Federal childcare programs came \ninto existence. In 1996, the law we are considering today was basically \na part of the reform of the Welfare Act. It is a remarkable law because \nit involves lots of State flexibility. In other words, it acknowledges \nthat what is good for Maryland may not be good for North Carolina. It \nmodels our higher education system by letting the money follow the \nchild to the institution that the parent thinks is best for their \nchild. These are vouchers. It has gradually grown to an area where we \nspend $5 billion or $6 billion of taxpayers' money each year to provide \nabout 1\\1/2\\ million children with an opportunity for childcare.\n  I will mention one success story so we have an example of exactly \nwhat we are talking about. I am thinking of a young mother in Memphis, \nTN, who was attending LeMoyne-Owen College and earning a business \ndegree. She had an infant child, and so she put that child in a \nchildcare center she chose. The voucher, through this program we are \ntalking about today, provided $500 to $600 a month to help pay for the \nbill. Infant childcare is especially expensive. If you think about it, \nthis is understandable.\n  The success part of the story is that she earned her degree. She is \nnow an assistant manager at Walmart in Memphis. She has a second child \nwho attends the same childcare center now, but she earns enough to pay \nthe full cost.\n  This program encourages work, it encourages job training, and for \nthose Americans who are low income and working or low income and \ntraining or educating themselves for a job, this helps them get that \njob. This is an important bill for many families.\n\n[[Page S1548]]\n\n  In Tennessee, we have about 20,000 families affected each month and \nnearly 40,000 children. It is a big help to them. It makes a difference \nin their lives.\n  I thank Senator Mikulski and Senator Burr for their work on this \nlegislation. I know of no two Senators in this body who approach issues \nin a more serious, effective, and determined way. They also understand \nthat in a body of 100 Members, where we each have a right to object, \nthat no bill is going to be exactly what any of us want.\n  For example, I am leery of the extent of the background checks \nrequired by this bill, which is one of its major accomplishments. As a \nformer Governor, I am very skeptical of Washington setting rules for \nStates, but I accept the compromise they have agreed to with the \nbackground checks. We talked that matter through, and I think it is a \nsound proposal. I congratulate them for the way they have done this \nover the last 2 years and the way we have approached it.\n  I will conclude with where I started. We are asking Senators to join \nus in a debate about the child care and development block grant. We \nhope Senators will come to the floor with their ideas on it. We know \nthere are a number of Senators who have amendments on both sides of the \naisle. What we are saying to those Senators is if you have an amendment \nthat is related to our bill, you will have a chance to talk about it \nand you will have a chance for it to be voted on and perhaps accepted \nby the full Senate, and hopefully this bill will go to the House and \nbecome law.\n  We know that has not been the story as often as it should be in the \nSenate, but we would like to see that happen more often. It requires a \nlittle bit of restraint on the part of each of us as Senators. We can't \nall exercise all of our rights all the time and get anything done. It \nrequires some trust and restraint on the part of our leaders, Senator \nReid and Senator McConnell. We appreciate them turning the management \nof the bill over to Senator Mikulski and Senator Burr, with Senator \nHarkin and me in support of their efforts.\n  We appreciate the cooperation of the many Senators who have already \ncome up with excellent amendments and notified us about them. Senator \nBurr and Senator Mikulski know about them and will talk about them.\n  At this stage, I wish to step down and turn this matter over to \nSenator Mikulski first, and then Senator Burr. We invite Senators to \ncome over. We will continue through lunch and discuss, debate, talk, \nand begin voting on the Child Care and Development Block Grant \nReauthorization.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I am so pleased to bring to the floor \nthis very important bipartisan legislation, the Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant Act of 2014. I am standing here today to speak \non behalf of families and children across this Nation.\n  I am excited to bring forward this bill for two reasons; one, the \ncontent it represents--a reauthorization framework for the childcare \nand development block grant, one of the most important tools families \nhave to be able to afford child are so they may go to work. It is a \nchildcare development bill and it is a work assistance bill.\n  I am also proud of the process by which we are undertaking this bill, \nthe process by which we arrived at and brought this bill to the floor \ntoday.\n  This legislation has not been reauthorized since 1996. Senator \nRichard Burr of North Carolina and I serve on the HELP Committee, of \nwhich the Presiding Officer is a member. We once shared the \nSubcommittee on Children and Families. Senator Burr and I, who have a \nlongstanding professional relationship, said: Let's see what we can get \ndone on that committee. Where can we find common ground? Where can we \nfind that sensible center? How can we move things forward on a \nbipartisan basis where we add value to our country but don't add to our \ndebt?\n  We put our heads together, and by looking at the childcare needs in \nour country, we began a regular order process. We held three hearings, \nlots of meetings with stakeholders, over 50 organizations, as well as \nmeetings with our staffs and each other, characterized by three \nfactors: mutual respect, focusing on national needs, and how we could \nbe smart in terms of our policies yet frugal in terms of the way we \nwent about the money. We didn't expand the vouchers the way some of us \nwould like, but we looked at how we could expand value by focusing on \nquality. Because of the tone we set with each other, we were able to do \nthis.\n  This is how the Senate should operate. We should have mutual respect, \ntalking with each other and not at each other, listening to the \nexperts, listening to the grassroots, and paying attention to the \nbottom line. We were able to accomplish what we set out to do.\n  Today, as we come to the floor, this is an open amendment process. We \ntalk a lot about regular order. There are very few Members of the \nSenate--particularly those who have been elected since 2006--who know \nwhat regular order is. A quick thumbnail of it means legislation is \nbrought to the floor, we offer an open amendment process, debate, \ndeliberate, and vote. This is how we hope to be able to proceed today.\n  There will be no strong-arming, no stiff-arming, no heavy hand, just \nregular order, regular debate, with every Senator having the \nopportunity to have their day and their say. This is how the Senate \nshould operate.\n  What also excites me in coming to the floor is not only being the \nSenator from Maryland, but also, as the Presiding Officer knows, I am a \nprofessionally trained social worker. I have a master's degree in \nsocial work. I was a foster care worker for Catholic Charities, and I \nwas a child abuse worker for the Department of Social Services. One of \nthe reasons I came into politics was to be able to take the value of a \nsocial worker and bring it to the floor of the U.S. Congress to make \nsure we looked at families and their needs. This is what I think this \nbill does.\n  We are looking at childcare. Every family in America with children is \nconcerned about childcare. They wonder if it is available. They wonder \nif it is affordable. They worry if it is safe, and they are also \nconcerned about whether it will help their children to be ready to \nlearn.\n  We all say that children are one of our most important resources, \nwhich also means childcare is one of our most important decisions. \nFamilies will scrimp and save to make sure they have adequate \nchildcare. If you are a single parent and working a double shift, you \nwonder if childcare is safe and sound. If you are a student working \ntoward a degree, you want to make sure that while you are in school, \nyour children are in a good preschool or daycare program. These worries \nweigh heavily on the shoulders of parents everywhere, and our bill \nlifts that burden. This bill gives families and children the childcare \nthey need.\n  This bill, as I said, is the product of a bipartisan effort. \nChildcare is something all families worry about, regardless of income \nor ZIP Code. This bill ensures that all children get the care they need \nand deserve. What we did was focus on those needs.\n  Childcare has not been evaluated since 1996. At that time the program \nwas solely a vision as a workforce aid. What we know today is that this \nis also the time of the most rapid period of brain development, and \nthat is why it is imperative we ensure our young children are in high-\nquality childcare programs. We need to make sure that childcare \nnurtures their development, prepares their minds, and prepares them for \nschool.\n  The current program is out of date. It doesn't go far enough to \npromote health and safety and also make sure that the staff is ready to \nmeet emergency responses and take care of the needs of those children.\n  When we worked on this legislation, we focused on quality. I will \nelaborate on that in more detail.\n  Way back when this bill was first signed into law, it was under \nGeorge Herbert Bush. It was so women could go from welfare to work. \nPresident Clinton came in, and part of the welfare reform was to be \nable to do that. Now it is a new day, and we want to make sure that \nchildcare not only helps the parents but it also focuses on the \nchildren. We want to ensure that when parents leave their children at \ndaycare, they know their children's providers are trained, that the \nenvironment is safe, and their program will\n\n[[Page S1549]]\n\nhelp their children prepare for their education.\n  We know there are differences in North Carolina compared to Maryland. \nWe know there are differences in Utah compared to Maine. So what we \nhave provided is the ability to make sure there is incredible State \nflexibility. I will go into that in more detail.\n  I hope my colleagues will join Senator Burr, Senator Alexander, \nSenator Harkin, and myself in passing this bill. I look forward to \nfurther debate and discussion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I thank the Chair, and I thank my good \nfriend and colleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski.\n  In the Senate, for those of us who have been around for a while, we \nunderstand how it works. I am not sure the media does justice to the \nAmerican people in terms of how difficult it is for legislation to \nactually pass the Senate. As a matter of fact, the historical threshold \nof 67 and then 60 in agreement means that if a Senator is a serious \nlegislator and their interest is to work on good policy--not perfect; I \nthink Senator Alexander said we have never seen a perfect bill--then \nthe first thought that goes through a Senator's mind as they work on a \nlegislative agenda is, who on the other side of the aisle can I look to \nwhom this would be appealing to from the standpoint of their interests \nand, No. 2, an individual who understands how to get through difficult \ntimes? I am here to say to my colleagues that Barbara Mikulski is a \nSenator who fills that category not just as it pertains to this \nlegislation but as it pertains to so much because of her great depth of \nknowledge and, more importantly, her tenacity and her willingness to \ntell people no and to pursue what is right. Because at the end of the \nday--I think I can speak for both of us--this is not about headlines; \nthis is about looking at a generation of kids who will be benefited by \nreforms to a reauthorization that hasn't happened since 1996.\n  Historically on this issue, George H.W. Bush started the program, and \nit was under the Clinton administration, under welfare reform, that we \nformalized these vouchers. The vouchers were really created so families \nwho struggled to keep a job and were low income but had childcare needs \ndidn't have to worry about the childcare piece. There was Federal \nassistance that was determined on a sliding scale.\n  By the way, let me say to my colleagues, if a State doesn't provide a \nwaiver to a family, then they have skin in the game on these vouchers. \nSo this is not free across the board.\n  This has benefited now 1.6 million families. In North Carolina, there \nare 74,000 vouchers on an annual basis that benefit our children. Those \nare family members who are either in education or who work, and they \ncan commit to those jobs because they know that childcare is available \nand the cost is affordable because of this Federal voucher program.\n  I think Senator Mikulski would agree with me in saying we hope we \nnever see a program that waits this long to be reauthorized. Every \nprogram here deserves to be reevaluated every 5 years--No. 1, on its \neffectiveness, and No. 2, do we still have the problem we had when the \nprogram was started. I daresay in her time here--and she has been here \na lot longer than I have, and I don't say that with regard to her age--\nthere are programs still on the books that don't have a constituency \nanymore. But the hardest thing for Congress to do is to get rid of \nsomething or to consolidate. I think Senator Mikulski and I have always \ntaken the attitude that if we can make this better and have a positive \neffect on the folks it was intended for, then that is our job. That is \nour responsibility as Members of the Senate.\n  So I certainly look forward, after the 2 years we have spent on an \nissue--some might listen to the debate today and say: Geez, why didn't \nthey go to the floor and pass it by unanimous consent?\n  That is an option. But we also believe we are not perfect, and by \nreaching out to Members and colleagues and saying: Come to the floor; \nif Senators can make this bill better, then come to the floor and offer \namendments--if a Senator comes to the floor with an amendment and we \nthink it makes the bill worse, then we are going to vote against it, \nbut we promise this: We will have a vote. That is an important part of \nthe Senate, that Members always feel they can put their fingerprints, \nthey can put their State's interest into every piece of legislation \nwhether or not they are on that committee or subcommittee. We have now, \nwith this bill, returned to a process that I think reaches out and \nincorporates that.\n  Let me say to our colleagues, it is our intent when I finish speaking \nto start accepting amendments. At some point, with both leaders' \nagreement, this afternoon we will target a period when we will vote on \nwhatever stacked amendments we have been able to process. After that, \nwe will hopefully go back and consider more amendments. I think it is \nour intent to not have votes tonight but to work with the leaders in \norder to roll those votes to tomorrow morning.\n  Let me make this perfectly clear to our colleagues: It is our intent \nto finish this bill tomorrow afternoon, period. So the way to effect \npositive change in this legislation--to get Senators' input into it and \nfingerprints on it--is to not wait until tomorrow afternoon but to come \ndown this afternoon and debate the amendments, process the amendments, \nand let's work as the Senate is designed to work. So I encourage my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to do that.\n  I rise today to speak about S. 1986, the childcare development block \ngrant reauthorization bill, with my good friend Senator Mikulski. I \nmust say we wouldn't be here if it weren't for the cooperation of \nSenator Harkin and Senator Alexander. Senator Harkin has a long history \nof interest and involvement with policies that affect children. He is \npassionate about it. Senator Alexander has a similar lifetime \ncommitment, a Senator who has served as the education governor of \nTennessee, the Secretary of Education of the United States, and the \npresident of the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. So both of them \ncome with a tremendous amount of expertise and passion for this issue.\n  This legislation is actually necessary to build on what the Child \nCare Development Block Grant Program was established for. As I said \nearlier, 1.6 million children nationally are served today--74,000 in \nNorth Carolina--and there tends to be a lot of talk in this body about \nstrengthening job training, getting people back to work, and \nincentivizing self-reliance. I wish to recommend to my colleagues that \nis exactly what the Child Care Development Block Grant Program does. It \nsays to a family: Work and we will help you with childcare. Get \nadditional education and we will help you with childcare.\n  But one of the problems since 1996 when this program was created was \nthe way we looked at one's income was an instantaneous snapshot. So as \na parent, if I was offered a second shift where I could earn a little \nmore money, I would look at how that might affect my child's childcare \nvoucher and realize that they will take my voucher away if I take that \nsecond shift or if I work overtime and get time-and-a-half pay.\n\n  Well, this is evidence that we have looked at all angles. We have \nreached out to the communities that are affected. We have talked to \npeople who are providers. We have talked to parents. We have looked at \nthe difficulties they struggle with, because our intent is to make sure \nwe have a piece of legislation that parents can choose to accept that \nshift offer, can accept working overtime and know they are not going to \nbe adversely affected because now we are looking at the yearlong versus \nthe individual snapshot.\n  So through Federal vouchers, parents who demonstrate that they are \nworking or they are in job-training programs or furthering their \neducation and who are below 85 percent of the State median income are \neligible to receive the childcare voucher and to use that at a \nchildcare provider of their choice in their State. This is not one \nwhere we are saying: You have to go here and you have to go there. We \nopen it for the choice of the parent.\n  In addition, CDBG requires families, as I said earlier, to have skin \nin the game on a sliding scale based upon their income. As a block \ngrant, States have great flexibility in how they administer these funds \nbut are generally required to set health, safety, and quality \nguidelines to promote parental\n\n[[Page S1550]]\n\nchoice, assist parents in becoming independent through work promotion, \nand provide good consumer information so parents can make good \ndecisions about their child's care.\n  S. 1086, the legislation we have offered, would reauthorize this law \nfor the first time since 1996. It would do so by making some \ncommonsense changes that address the realities which I have \nhighlighted, prioritizing the safety of children who receive care with \nFederal dollars.\n  First, we would require all providers and individuals who have \nunsupervised access to children to submit to a criminal background \ncheck. That check would ensure our young children are not left alone \nwith individuals who have committed felonies such as murder, rape, \nchild abuse, neglect, robbery, and other serious offenses. This \nprovision is the result of legislation I introduced over the past \nseveral Congresses called the Child Care Protection Act, which I \nbelieve will do a great deal to improve the safety of our children.\n  Let me just stop there and say this is incredible because I think \nmost Americans probably believe these background checks take place \ntoday. And to some degree they are right. States such as North Carolina \nhave been responsible, and they do carry out some degree of background \nchecks--although not all States, not all providers. But when this bill \nbecomes law, it will say to all States and to all providers that \nreceive Federal vouchers: You must do this. You must assure every \nparent that these felons are not part of the workforce that has \nunsupervised access to your children.\n  Second, this bill asks States to monitor through inspections the \nquality of childcare settings so that basic health and safety \nprecautions are taken. Many States currently conduct no checks at all \nfor certain settings or conduct them years apart, all while providers \nreceive State and Federal tax dollars. At the very least, parents who \nare working several jobs just to make it should know that their child \nis in someone's care who has been trained in the basics of CPR, fire \nprevention, and other commonsense precautions.\n  I think one of our colleagues--Senator Landrieu--will come to the \nfloor sometime this afternoon and offer an amendment that requires \nevacuation plans. Well, for a Senator from Louisiana who lived this \nfirsthand, this is really important. It is a great job of where a \nMember's amendment is going to help to perfect our bill. For anybody \nwho lives in a coastal State such as North Carolina--I am sorry I \ndidn't think of exactly what she did--but when we look at tornadoes and \nwhen we look at fires, we are all susceptible to the need of a daycare \nfacility having an evacuation plan so that local officials and, more \nimportantly, parents and the providers who work there understand what \nto do.\n  Third, it asks States to make transparent all the information as \nwidely as possible so parents are armed with all the information they \nneed when they shop for childcare under the Federal childcare vouchers.\n  Fourth, in keeping with the maximum flexibility afforded to States \nunder the CDBG, this bill provides States the option of seeking waivers \nfrom any Federal law that funds early learning or childcare that might \nhave conflicting or onerous results for the delivery of that care and \nrequires the Secretary of HHS to work with other agencies to provide a \nwaiver for those requirements so States and childcare providers can \nfocus on providing quality care and not just complying with \nWashington's confusing set of requirements. In other words, the focus \nof this is to make sure the childcare quality component is the single \nmost important feature to providers.\n\n  Fifth, it promotes continued employment incentives for parents to \nmove higher in their careers by providing better guidance to States on \nhow they determine the eligibility of parents and their children. To \nme, it is just common sense that we should not penalize a parent from \ntaking on an extra shift or working overtime. But at the same time we \nrequire States to make sure that only the most needy parents receive \nthe childcare vouchers and that they can demonstrate they are following \nthe law's work rules. Let me say again--because I think this is lost \nbecause we have not talked about this in almost two decades--for many \nin the communities we all represent, this is the difference between a \nfamily being able to keep a job or to be 100 percent on assistance. \nWhat we have is a Federal program that is not just beneficial, we have \nthe data to prove it works, and that matrix continues to be in place.\n  Finally, it asks States to place a greater emphasis on building \nquality care settings by gradually increasing the amount of Federal \ndollars that can be set aside from the current law's 4 percent to 10 \npercent over the several years that must be used to improve quality \nprograms.\n  Let me explain. Today, we say you can set aside up to 4 percent for \nquality. We want to extend that. We want to create an incubator that is \nan investment in what we can do to further enhance the quality of what \nthese children are exposed to.\n  I think Senator Harkin, Senator Alexander, and Senator Mikulski have \nall pointed out that when we go from infancy to age 13, we have the \nmajority of the learning period of a child's life. Some of it we pick \nup in the education system. But if they go to childcare after that or \nthey go to childcare before it, we want to make sure the quality of \nthat, and, more importantly, the innovation of that quality, is such \nthat all students, all children can advance because of it.\n  This bipartisan legislation is the result of work in the HELP \nCommittee. It was influenced and really ramrodded by my good friend \nSenator Mikulski. She was tireless at inviting experts. She sought \npractitioners in all of our States. It was that, and the leadership of \nour chairman and our ranking member, that brings us here today.\n  I believe this legislation will go a long way toward improving \nchildcare in our country but also toward promoting self-sufficiency and \nindependence for working parents. This is not a Federal handout. This \nis a partnership between the Federal Government and the opportunity for \nparents to have a better life. I think the way we have addressed the \ncommonsense changes in reauthorization makes it more likely, not less \nlikely, that more parents will succeed at that.\n  So I encourage my colleagues to support this bill. But I really do \nstress with my colleagues, now is the time to come to the floor. Bring \nyour amendments to the floor. Let's debate the amendments. Let's vote \non the amendments. Let's prove the Senate can function in a very open \nprocess because in this particular case those vulnerable parents and \nthose children, who are the next generation, really do matter and what \nwe do really does affect them.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, I thank my colleague from Maryland, \nand I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I know we will be offering amendments \nthroughout the afternoon, and we look forward to ample debate and \ndiscussion on them.\n  I want to reiterate my appreciation to Senator Burr for the way we \nhave worked together on this bill. He was very generous in his comments \nto me and about me, and I appreciate it. But what I so appreciated in \nworking with him is that his whole focus was: How do we protect these \nchildren? And his work to ensure that the children are safe when they \nare at the daycare, regardless of the size of the provider, was \nimportant. So, yes, we have good background checks. At the same time, \nwe were looking at health and safety standards, making sure the staffs \nare at least trained in the elements of first aid, so that if the \nchildren needed help because they swallowed something--until the 911 \nresponders could be there--they would have that training. That is \nreally important.\n  Yet we had to look at it in a way in which we did not overregulate. \nSo we wanted quality standards, but we did not want to have so many \nrules, so many regs--exactly what Senator Alexander cautioned us about: \nLet's not overregulate so that we then stifle or end up shrinking the \npool. So we, again, worked on what--the phrase ``sensible center'' \ncomes from Colin Powell: that if we work hard and listen to each other, \nwe can find that sensible center. So it was the balance between Federal \nstandards but also local flexibility on the best way to achieve those \nstandards, and also to help States pay\n\n[[Page S1551]]\n\nthe bill for the training. One of the aspects of our bill is to set \naside 3 percent of funding to expand access to improve the quality of \ncare, especially for infants and toddlers--the most vulnerable \npopulations because they cannot tell you things. They cannot tell you \nwhere they hurt or some of these other things.\n  In addition, the amounts States set aside for quality improvement \nalso must be at least 10 percent within 5 years of enactment. And \nStates must say what they choose to invest in. We hope not only to have \nreporting and accountability but to get an idea for best practices that \nwe can circulate among providers. We think this will be important.\n  The other area we focused on was in the area Senator Burr talked \nabout, providing protections for children who receive assistance. That \nis exactly what I heard in Maryland. This is all income based; in other \nwords, your voucher. This is a means-tested program. But if your means \nchange in the program, you could lose your daycare. So it was an actual \ndisincentive from improving yourself or maybe taking a seasonal job. So \nif you had the opportunity perhaps to work in retail during the holiday \nseason--exactly for your own family's holiday celebration--you were \ngoing to be tremendously disadvantaged because it would be a boost, it \nwould look like you were going up, when actually your income might be \nthe same if you have taken that part-time job.\n  We want to reward work. We want to reward personal responsibility. So \nwe were able to provide that flexibility that when parents redetermine \ntheir eligibility, they will give them ample opportunity to do so. So \nif your child is in daycare, and you take that part-time job or your \nincome goes up, you will not lose the daycare you have for that year or \nthat determination. We thought that was important.\n  The other was meeting the needs of children with disabilities. This \nis a strong passion of Senator Harkin, a well-known advocate for people \nwith disabilities, and I know he will speak to that. But it will \nrequire States to examine: What are they doing to coordinate with the \nIDEA programs, again for preschool-age children with disabilities. \nOften a child who faces a disability is at a disadvantage because the \ndaycare they are in does not promote learning.\n  I have a constituent in Maryland. She spoke at our press conference \nyesterday. Her name is Cathy Rivera. She is the mother of two children, \nages 7 and 2. She is also a resource person working at the CentroNia \nfamily center, which is information services and also focuses on early \nchildhood education.\n  Her little girl was born without an ear. That is rough going. So \nimagine being an infant, then a toddler, trying to learn a language, \nyour family is bilingual--that could be a great asset, but when you \ncannot really hear, and the doctors are doing the most for you to help \nyou, you still need to be in an environment that acknowledges that and \nis helping with the learning in childcare, at your pace, your way, so \nthat your language skills are also developing because language and \nbrain development are tied together. So without the proper environment, \nthis little girl would have been doubly disadvantaged--one, with the \nphysical situation from birth, but then the learning situation because \nof where she was.\n  Well, fortunately--with her mother working in the field of daycare, \nworking at an agency that provides information and resources, with the \nhelp of the childcare subsidy--this little girl could be in the daycare \nthat she needs, to not only look out to see that her physical needs are \nbeing met but that her learning needs are being met.\n  Isn't that a great story? But here is a mother who is working, a bit \nstrapped financially, but with her own sense of motherhood and personal \nresponsibility, she found what she needed. The childcare subsidy was \nable to help her pay for the daycare, and now this little girl has a \nchance. It is going to be a challenging future for her, but she is up \nfor this challenge.\n  That is what this is. This is not only about numbers and statistics. \nSo when we talk about improving quality, we have really tried to take \ninto consideration these needs.\n  Daycare is expensive. In Maryland, the Maryland Family Network tells \nme that they had--with all of the licensed daycares--over 23,000 \nchildren who were on the wait list for this program--not for daycare--\nthat is even larger--but for this program.\n  So this is why we want to pass this bill and really be able to move \nforward on it. But, again, I am going to come back to this bipartisan \neffort of focusing on safety, security, and also learning readiness.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I will say more later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I want to take this opportunity to say to \nmy colleagues, we are now at a point where we would like to consider \namendments. So if you have improvements to this bill, it is now after \nlunch. Before you take a nap, come down to the Senate floor, offer your \namendment. Let's talk about it, and let's process as many as we \npossibly can. It is our intent to consider amendments for the majority \nof the afternoon, at some point--with the cooperation and agreement of \nleaders on both sides--to set a time that we would then vote on the \namendments that have been processed, hopefully continue to take some \namendments early in the evening, but our intent would be not to have \nvotes tonight so that the schedules are predictable, and to come back \nin the morning, with the leaders' agreement, at a specified time to \nconsider the votes that might be stacked, any additional amendments \nthat need to be debated and voted on, and it would be Senator \nMikulski's and my intent, and it is our goal--and when she has a goal, \nlet me say to my colleagues, she will achieve that goal--it is our \nintent and our goal to finish this bill tomorrow afternoon.\n  We want to make sure we have accommodated every Member who has an \namendment, every Member who wants to make an improvement to this bill, \nbut we ask Members to come to the floor, preferably today, to introduce \nthat, call it up, debate it, let us schedule in a queue of votes, and \nwe will feel more confident of exactly the timeline we are on as that \nprocess starts.\n  I remind my colleagues that the key enhancements in this bill are it \nimproves quality while simultaneously ensuring that Federal funds \nsupport low-income and at-risk children and facilities; two, it \naddresses the nutritional and physical activity needs of children in a \nchildcare setting; three, it is strengthening coordination and the \nalignment to contribute a more comprehensive early childhood education \nand care system; four, it meets the needs of children with disabilities \nwho require childcare; five, it provides protections for children and \nfamilies who receive assistance; six, it safeguards the health and the \nsafety of children.\n  I cannot think of points that are more important as it relates to \nchanges to a bill that was created in 1996 and still embraces, I might \nsay, the context that it was negotiated in, which was welfare reform.\n  How do we provide the avenue for more individuals to enjoy what great \nthings this country has to offer for those who are willing to work? \nWelfare reform was a pathway, bipartisanly agreed to, to lead people \nfrom unemployment to employment and hopefully to continue to whatever \ndegree of prosperity they chose to pursue.\n  We all know that means you have to have a partner and you have to \nhave flexibility, whether that flexibility is being able to meet the \nhours that might put you up for a promotion or to get the skills you \nneed to consider a different career or the next level. Every parent \nshould probably look at this as I did with mine; that they are the \nsingle most important part. There are sacrifices every parent makes for \nthemselves because of what they provide for their children. That is the \nright thing to do. But through this partnership, for 1.6 million \nchildren and for 900,000-plus families, we have now provided for over \ntwo decades a Federal program that helps make that decision so it is \nnot either/or; they can pursue a career, they can pursue advancement, \nthey can increase their skills, they can increase their education \nwithout sacrificing that Federal subsidy that provides them the ability \nto drop their kids off in the morning and those kids are taken care of.\n  This is a win-win. It is what welfare reform was written to do. I am \nproud\n\n[[Page S1552]]\n\nto work with my good friend Senator Mikulski to make sure we get this \nacross the finish line. Come to the floor. Bring your amendments. Make \nthis bill better. Let's debate them, let's vote them, but we are going \nto finish tomorrow afternoon.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I reiterate Senator Burr's request. \nPeople wanted an open amendment process. We are open. Come on and \namend. We are looking forward to it. While we are waiting for our \nMembers to come careening to the floor to offer amendments--by the way, \n20 have been filed, so here we are.\n  I wish to comment on something else.\n\n\n                              Girl Scouts\n\n  You notice I am dressed in green today. I also have on a Girl Scout \npin. Do I not look like a Girl Scout standing here? I feel like a Girl \nScout. I was a Girl Scout. Once a Girl Scout, always a Girl Scout.\n  Today we are celebrating the 102nd anniversary of Girl Scouts in \nAmerica. What started out as a group of 18 girls in Georgia, organized \nby Juliette Low, has grown into an organization of 3.2 million girls \nand women.\n  As a Girl Scout, I knew firsthand about what it was like learning, \nabout leadership and service. I loved working on my badges. I liked the \ncamaraderie of working with other girls on the various challenges we \nhad. I was a child during World War II. The Girl Scout program run out \nof our parish was very important. It provided important activities for \ngirls after school. There were comparable Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts, \njust like we had the Daisies and the Girl Scouts.\n  These were important activities because in my community women were \nworking as ``Rosie the riveter.'' So these afterschool programs were \ncritical so we could be in a safe environment. We learned wonderful \nskills. We learned about our responsibilities.\n  I cannot think enough about Ms. Helen Nimick, who was my Girl Scout \nleader. I wanted to grow up and be like Ms. Nimick, who seemed to know \nhow to do 43 things with oatmeal boxes. I do not know if they did it in \nthe days of the Presiding Officer; there is a little bit of an age \ndifference between us.\n  But you know what I loved the most were our pledges. I will just say \ntoday, first of all, you know the Girl Scout promise: ``To serve God \nand my country, to help people at all times, and live by the Girl Scout \nlaw.'' Pretty good. But here is the Girl Scout law. I actually carried \nthis in my wallet. I will tell you why. Because if you follow the Girl \nScout law, you are in pretty good shape. By the way, I think over 90 \npercent of the women in the Senate were either a Daisy or a Girl Scout, \nbut the Girl Scout law says this: ``I will do my best to be honest and \nfair, friendly and helpful, considerate and caring, courageous and \nstrong, and responsible for what I say and what I do, and to respect \nmyself and others, respect authority, use resources wisely, make the \nworld a better place, and be a sister to every Girl Scout, and a sister \nto every Boy Scout.''\n  I think this is great. To Girl Scouts everywhere, whether they are \nDaisies or senior leadership, we say congratulations on the 102d \nanniversary. But I want to do a particular shout out to the leaders, \npeople who give of their own time and their own dime to help young \nwomen learn about their country, the world they live in, working \ncollegially and in comradeship, camaraderie with others.\n  I believe the values I learned as a Girl Scout, though I smile about \nit today, were the lessons of a lifetime. Quite frankly, if I can live \nup to the Girl Scout law, I think I will be a pretty good Senator. So \nhats off to Girl Scouts everywhere, a big thanks to the leaders who do \nit, and let's eat those cookies, even if you are on a different kind of \nprogram than they are often called for.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, let me admit I was not a Girl Scout. I \nguess I should have assumed Barbara Mikulski was a Girl Scout because \nscouting has made a significant difference in the lives of so many, not \njust in America but globally.\n  It is many of the qualities that come from that experience that lead \nto some of our most important national leaders, both in the past and in \nthe future. So I join her in recognizing this significant milestone for \nthe Girl Scouts. I know it must be challenging in today's nutritional \nenvironment to actually fund everything off of cookies. But as we have \nseen the drastic change in the way they are marketed, I will assure you \nwe are raising a generation of Girl Scouts who are the most creative in \nhow they market and sell their products to fund their programs of any \ngeneration I have seen today.\n  I think when kids are challenged at that age to be their own \nentrepreneurs, it is good for this country. We should be proud as \nparents and we should continue to support programs such as Scouting.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I wish to pay tribute to the Girl \nScouts as the organization celebrates Girl Scout Day. One hundred and \ntwo years ago, on March 12, 1912, Juliette ``Daisy'' Gordon Low founded \nthe first chapter of the Girl Scouts of the United States of America in \nSavannah, GA. Today, the Girl Scouts count over 2 million girls as \nmembers, including nearly 100,000 in my home State of New Jersey.\n  We all know and enjoy their incredibly successful--and delicious--\nGirl Scout Cookie program, but beyond the cookies, this program is the \nlargest and most successful business run by girls in the world, earning \nnearly $800 million a year. By participating in this program, girls are \ntaught five essential entrepreneurial skills, including goal-setting, \ndecision-making, money management, people skills, and business ethics. \nThis has helped the Girl Scouts teach their members financial literacy \nand business skills, and has inspired generations of women business \nowners and executives.\n  The mission of the Girl Scouts has been and continues to be building \ngirls of courage, confidence, and character, who make the world a \nbetter place. In that respect, I commend the Girl Scouts for launching \na program in 2012 known as Be a Friend First, or BFF, to tackle \nbullying among middle school girls. A recent study found that girls \ndeveloped key relationship and leadership skills from this program, and \nthat Hispanic girls experienced a particular benefit from the Girl \nScouts' gender-specific program.\n  I would also like to applaud the Girl Scouts for their continuing \nefforts to encourage careers in the Science, Technology, Engineering, \nand Math, STEM, fields. Only 1 year after they were founded, in 1913, \nthe Girl Scouts began awarding their first merit badges in STEM fields, \nthe electrician badge and the flyer badge. Today, the Girl Scouts \ncontinue to encourage girls to consider pursuing careers in STEM \nfields. For the United States to be able to continue to remain the \nworld's leading innovator, the participation of women in STEM fields is \ncritical. Therefore I commend them for their efforts towards increasing \nthe participation of women in STEM careers and education.\n  On this Girl Scout Day, for these reasons and for many others, I \napplaud the Girl Scouts for the outstanding work that they do in our \ncommunities and for girls across America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. HELLER. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Heller are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. HELLER. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today to discuss my disappointment \nin\n\n[[Page S1553]]\n\nthe recent turn of events involving the sustainable growth rate \nformula, or what we call the SGR or the doc fix. Enacted in 1997, the \nSGR was conceived as a means of trying to balance the budget by \nrestraining health care costs in Medicare, but it was deeply flawed \nfrom the start. Its reimbursement cuts to physicians would cripple \nseniors' ability to get the quality health care they deserve from their \ndoctors.\n  Consequently, since 2002, when the SGR came into effect, Congress has \npatched it on a regular basis, and there has been bipartisan support \nfor doing so. These ``patches'' have frequently been cobbled together \nat the midnight hour between leadership of both parties and included in \nlarger legislation, without the input of the Members or even going \nthrough the regular legislative process. Now, this perverse annual \ndark-of-night ritual has to stop. Seniors and physicians understand \nthat. Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate understand \nthat.\n  For the better part of a year, Congress--to the surprise of many--\nworked to fully repeal the SGR and replace it with more reasonable \nreforms that moved Medicare's physician fee-for-service reimbursement \nsystem toward a system that rewards doctors for providing quality care \nbased on outcomes, and we have made tremendous progress. Senator Baucus \nand I worked for months on a bill that sailed through the Finance \nCommittee on a bipartisan basis. The two relevant House committees \npassed bipartisan legislation repealing the SGR as well.\n  Then, in a turn of events that is all too rare these days, the \nchairman and ranking members of the Senate Finance Committee, the House \nWays and Means Committee, and the House Energy and Commerce Committee \nworked tirelessly to come up with one unified policy that House and \nSenate Democrats and Republicans could all support. Believe it or not, \nwe succeeded. We succeeded by involving all stakeholders, including the \ninfluential American Medical Association, in a fair and equitable \nmanner that resulted in near-unanimous support across the health care \ncommunity. For the first time since its enactment in 1997, the House \nand Senate united behind a policy that gets rid of this flawed Medicare \nreimbursement system.\n  So, Madam President, if we have moved this far, what is the problem? \nWhy am I disappointed? Well, I am going to tell you.\n  Last night I was informed that the majority leader is bringing \nstraight to the floor of this body the very policy we successfully \nnegotiated--tacking on what are known as the health care extenders \nwhich the Finance Committee passed but which were not included in what \nthe House and Senate agreed upon with the SGR. But--and here is the \nproblem--the Democrats have no plans whatsoever to pay for it. So \nSenate Democrats want to pass a bill that has a roughly $177 billion \nprice tag without even trying to offset any of the cost. Sadly, these \nsame Democrats don't seem to care that they have quickly turned what \nwas a true bipartisan accomplishment into another partisan political \nploy. This is deeply disappointing.\n  I am very sympathetic to those who say that since Congress has never \nlet the SGR go into effect, we should not have to pay for it. But let's \nbe honest--there is no way that right now a bill that would add close \nto $200 billion to the deficit is ever going to pass the House. And I \ndon't blame the House. This is reality.\n  Democrats in the Senate have blasted the House SGR repeal bill that \nis paid for by repealing ObamaCare's individual mandate. The Senate \nmajority leader has said that what the House is doing has ``no \ncredibility'' and that House Republicans ``gotta find something else'' \nto pay for it. But can't the very same thing be said of what the Senate \nDemocrats are doing--that their plan has ``no credibility'' and that \nthey have to find a way of paying for this if they are going to do it? \nI think we all know the answer to that.\n  I just don't understand how we have gotten here. I don't understand \nwhy there are these unfortunate attempts to poison a bipartisan product \nwith needless partisanship. We all want to repeal the SGR, so let's \ndispense with the games and get back to work figuring out a real path \nforward and one that involves an offset.\n  What is even more astonishing is that Senate Democrats are proceeding \nin this manner on the very week some of my colleagues are trying to \nmake the Senate work. Senators Burr and Mikulski have put forward a \nbill that the Senate is set to consider to reform the Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant Program. That is an important bill--certainly \nto me because I was one of the few who rammed that through way back \nwhen and took a lot of flak in the process. But it has worked amazingly \nwell.\n  Now Senators Burr and Mikulski have put forward this bill, after a \nlot of work by Senator Alexander and Senator Schumer to get the Senate \nworking again, to allow amendments and debate, and I have to say I \ncommend them, and I think Senators Burr and Mikulski deserve great \napplause and commendation, as do Senators Alexander and Schumer. That \nis what I don't understand.\n  Everybody here knows I have a record of working across the aisle, \nsometimes to the chagrin of Members of my own party and certainly \nsometimes to the irritation of some of our very far-right people in \nUtah. Why turn this bipartisan proposal into a partisan exercise when \nso many Senators want to work together to fix the problems the American \npeople face each and every day?\n  Let me be clear. I support what House Republicans have proposed. It \nis a reasonable approach to paying for a full repeal of the doc fix. \nAlmost every week, the White House delays or repeals another part of \nObamaCare, so it is time for the American people to get a reprieve as \nwell. It is the right thing to do. But I am interested in a result.\n  I want to fix the SGR system once and for all, and I hope that after \nthis pointless exercise designed for political cover we can come \ntogether to do what is right. Let's go back to our winning formula and \nget our bipartisan, bicameral negotiations underway to find a \nresponsible path forward.\n  Look, I like both of our leaders. They are strong people. They have \ndiffering philosophies. There is much to commend both of them and I \nsuppose some would say much to criticize in each case. But there is no \nreason for this type of ramming something through that has no chance of \npassing the House. Frankly, it doesn't have much chance of having any \nRepublican support at this point because we believe this kind of a \nprogram has to be offset to literally be valid and to be viable. I \nthink everybody here knows that, and so we have to find an offset to do \nit. If we can't find an offset, we have to keep the SGR alive until we \ndo. But to make it into a partisan game at this point, after all the \nbipartisan work that has been done, is really a tragedy.\n  We were on the verge of getting this solved. I hope that doesn't \nhappen this time because a lot of us have worked our guts out to get \nthis to this point, on both sides of the aisle. It would be an absolute \ntragedy if we can't get the cooperation to get this through.\n  The Democrats, if they do not like the offset the House has come up \nwith, although it seems to make sense to me, they control this body, \ncan come up with an offset both sides can agree to. But we have to have \nan offset and we have to do this the right way or we will be right back \nat base one after all the work that has been put into it in a \nbipartisan way to get this done.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Enzi] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2812.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S1554]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in \n  conjunction with the Secretary of Education, to conduct a review of \n Federal early learning and care programs and make recommendations for \n                   streamlining the various programs)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. REVIEW OF FEDERAL EARLY LEARNING AND CARE PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services, in conjunction with the Secretary of Education, \n     shall conduct an interdepartmental review of all early \n     learning and care programs in order to--\n       (1) develop a plan for the elimination of duplicative and \n     overlapping programs, as identified by the Government \n     Accountability Office's 2012 annual report (GAO-12-342SP); \n     and\n       (2) make recommendations to Congress for streamlining all \n     such programs.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services, in consultation with the Secretary of Education and \n     the heads of all Federal agencies that administer Federal \n     early learning and care programs, shall submit to the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the \n     Senate and the Committee on Education and the Workforce of \n     the House of Representatives, a detailed report that outlines \n     the efficiencies that can be achieved by, as well as specific \n     recommendations for, eliminating duplication, overlap, and \n     fragmentation among all Federal early learning and care \n     programs.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, when the Child Care and Development Block \nGrant Program was first created in the 1990s, it was seen primarily as \na way to help parents enter the workforce or get job training.\n  The program, which is administered by the U.S. Department of Health \nand Human Services, gets about $5.2 billion a year in Federal funding \nplus State matching funds, although the fiscal year 2014 appropriation \nis approximately $2.4 billion.\n  The last reauthorization of this program took place nearly 20 years \nago. This bipartisan CCDBG reauthorization, the Mikulski-Burr-Harkin-\nAlexander bill, puts a greater emphasis on the quality of the childcare \nprograms children are entering. The bipartisan bill would refocus the \nprogram on quality, not just access.\n  The legislation emphasizes the protection of vulnerable populations, \nincentivizing self-sufficiency and individual responsibility. The bill \nalso improves coordination among Federal early childhood education \nprograms.\n  As a block grant, States have a great deal of flexibility in how they \nadminister child care and development block grant funds but are \ngenerally required to set health, safety, and quality guidelines, \npromote parental choice, assist parents in becoming independent through \nwork promotion, and provide consumer information so parents can make \ndecisions about their child's care. The money helps States provide \ngrants to low-income parents to cover the cost of childcare and \nafterschool care, typically through a voucher which parents can use at \nthe home-based program or childcare center of their choice.\n  My amendment requires the Secretaries of Health and Human Services \nand Education to carry out an interdepartmental review of all early \nlearning and childcare programs administered by the Federal \nGovernment--and we have lots of them.\n  We all agree the funding invested in early education programs saves \ntaxpayers money down the road. So for a long time the Federal \nGovernment has been doing a lot to increase access to these important \nprograms. Federal support for early learning and childcare developed \nover time to meet emerging needs, but at this point multiple Federal \nagencies administer this important investment through numerous \nprograms.\n  What my amendment does is ask Health and Human Services and the \nDepartment of Education to report back to Congress with a plan for \neliminating duplication and overlap, as well as a plan with ways we can \nstreamline these programs.\n  Every year the Government Accountability Office, GAO, submits a \nreport to Congress with recommendations for ways to reduce duplication, \noverlap, and fragmentation in Federal Governmental programs. In its \n2012 annual report to Congress, GAO recommended the Department of \nEducation and Health and Human Services should extend their \ncoordination efforts to other Federal agencies with early learning and \nchildcare programs to combat program fragmentation, simplify children's \naccess to these services, collect the data necessary to coordinate \noperation of these programs, and identify and minimize overlap and \nduplication.\n  GAO identified 45 early learning and childcare programs funded by the \nFederal Government. Twelve of these programs explicitly provide only \nearly learning or childcare services. These 45 programs are \nadministered by multiple agencies, including the Department of \nEducation, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of \nAgriculture, Department of the Interior, Department of Justice, \nDepartment of Labor, Department of Housing and Urban Development, the \nGeneral Services Administration, and the Appalachian Regional \nCommission. When I was chairman of the HELP Committee, the late Senator \nTed Kennedy and I worked to eliminate duplication and overlap in \nprograms under our jurisdiction--we got it down from about 119 to 69--\nbut could not look at any of the programs administered by other \nagencies. We knew there was room for streamlining programs at other \nagencies, but we couldn't work on it, which was frustrating and shows \nhow far-flung some of these programs are. Let me report again: the 45 \nprograms administered by multiple agencies, including not only \nEducation but Health and Human Services, Agriculture, Interior, \nJustice, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, General Services \nAdministration, and the Appalachian Regional Commission.\n  We have to believe we ought to be able to do some consolidation there \nand save some money and improve the quality of programs while we are at \nit.\n  In a recent GAO report issued on February 5, 2014, GAO noted that as \nof December 2013, Education and Health and Human Services has taken \ninitial steps toward greater coordination but had not yet included all \nFederal agencies which administer these early learning and childcare \nprograms in their established interdepartmental workgroup.\n  This amendment takes a further step in identifying fragmentation, \noverlap, duplication, and inefficiencies in the Federal Government's \ndelivery of numerous learning and care programs beyond the Government \nAdministration Organization's report. Streamlining programs to \neliminate duplication is essential for program integrity and good \ngovernance but also for eliminating service gaps for eligible children.\n  We are doing a lot. We can do better with less through coordination \nand getting it down to where there are less sources and less places \nwhere there has to be permission, regulation, and oversight. We can do \nbetter for the kids, and all we are asking for with this is to come up \nwith a plan. It doesn't force anything, but hopefully it is a plan we \nwill pay attention to and not just put it on the shelf.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I first thank Senator Enzi again for \nworking with us for a long time on the committee to put this bill \ntogether, and I thank him for this amendment.\n  Basically, GAO's 2012 annual report noted the Department of Education \nand Health and Human Services should be increasing their coordination \nefforts in dealing with childcare and early learning programs. This \namendment would require them to collaborate and conduct a comprehensive \nreview of the 45 programs which currently support early learning and \nchildcare across the country. This would ensure better coordination, \nreduction in duplication, and effective programming for children.\n  I say to my friend from Wyoming, on Monday I was in my home State of \nIowa, in Des Moines, visiting an early learning center. On Saturday, I \nwas in Ames visiting an early learning center in preparation for this \nbill to be on the floor. Monday, I was meeting with everyone there. \nWith all of the different funding streams which come through and all of \nthe different cross-purposes, I finally said: Stop a minute. I am \nconfused.\n  They said: If you are confused, so are we.\n  Even the people running the programs--everything has some different\n\n[[Page S1555]]\n\nthing they have to fill out paperwork for to qualify.\n  So I am particularly sensitive to the Senator's amendment, having \njust tried to wade through all of that just a couple days ago in Iowa.\n  I thank my friend from Wyoming. It is a good amendment and should be \nadopted. We certainly support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I also applaud my colleague Senator Enzi. \nThis is a needed amendment. It makes the bill better.\n  I will note for my colleagues, most recently the 2014 Omnibus \nappropriations legislation created two new programs, including the \nEarly Head Start-Child Care Partnerships Program funded at $500 million \nand the Race to the Top pre-K program funded at $250 million.\n  I point these out because both of these further underline the \ninteractions which might exist with the current programs. I would think \nany attempt of this would be an administrative responsibility to find \nways to consolidate, but clearly this is a case where more is not \nbetter.\n  This requires the Secretary to look at all these programs and find \nways to consolidate in a way which provides a better outcome for those \nwho are the beneficiaries. So I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  I also say to my colleagues, through their staffs, it is probably the \nintent of the Senate to have some votes about 2:30. I think there are \nnotifications going out on both sides, but I just want Members to be \naware. We are trying to accommodate the afternoon schedules of both \nsides of the aisle on commitments they have, one at the White House and \na Member's meeting on Ukraine this afternoon. So it is our intent right \nnow to have up to two votes by 2:30 this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, might I ask the Senator from Iowa and \nthe Senator from North Carolina, is it not also likely, given the good \nprogress we are making, we may be able to have another vote or two \nbetween 5 and 5:30 this afternoon so as not to interfere with meetings \nor the briefing many Senators are attending at 5:30?\n  Mr. BURR. I would say, it is our intent probably right before the \nUkraine briefing to hopefully be in a position to dispose of about two \nadditional amendments.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. So that would be two votes at 2:30 and perhaps two \nmore at probably about 5:15.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I concur.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senators from Iowa and \nNorth Carolina.\n  I also thank the Senator from Wyoming for his leadership. For a \nnumber of years he was the ranking member of the Health, Education, \nLabor & Pensions Committee, and while he was there he focused on trying \nto help us spend our money more efficiently--which all of us want to \ndo.\n  Sometimes we forget that Head Start is not the only early learning \nprogram we have in the country. It is the most famous. It is best \nknown. It is very popular with most people. It is about $8.6 billion, \nbut the bill we are debating today, the child care and development \nblock grant, is another $5.3 billion. It is two-thirds the size of Head \nStart and affects 1.5 million children. And then there is another of $5 \nbillion or so of Federal funding for early learning and early \nchildhood. Without getting into a debate about whether we should have \nnew programs, I think there is a consensus among most of us that we \nshould at least start by taking the money we are spending for early \nchildhood and spend it wisely.\n\n  One step we took a few years ago was to create centers of excellence \nfor Head Start. This was, I believe, in 2007. The idea there was that \nthe Governor of each State would be permitted to pick at least two \ncommunities or cities where they were doing the best job of spending \nmoney in a coordinated way for early learning and childhood \ndevelopment. Not only are these 18 billion Federal dollars being spent, \nbut many States have additional funding for early childhood, most \nStates have kindergarten programs, and many States have programs for 3-\nyear-olds and 4-year-olds. The idea was to see if we could encourage \nNashville or Denver or Des Moines to take a look at all the children \nbetween 0 and 6 and all the dollars being spent--public, private, \nFederal, State and local--and see who is doing the best job of putting \nthat all together. It is always a problem with a big, complex country \nsuch as this when you have a decentralized government and there are \nseveral layers. There are lots of silos, and children don't live in \nsilos. They are by themselves needing help and we need to find a way of \ngetting the money to them. So the centers of excellence was a modest \nbeginning to try to encourage better spending of what is up to $18 \nbillion of money already being spent.\n  I think Senator Enzi's amendment, which I strongly support, would \ngive us more information about how to better spend the Federal dollars \nwe already spend for early childhood. I simply wanted to call the \nattention of the Senate and others who may be paying attention to that \ncenters of excellence program. In the committee chaired by the Senator \nfrom Iowa, we had excellent testimony from the representative from \nDenver who had one of the first centers of excellence. She talked about \nthe progress they have made in taking all the available money and using \nit in the most effective way to help children.\n  I hope as we move along through the process of dealing with the \ndebate about how do we do a better job of early childhood education \nthat we consider centers of excellence, and I hope Senator Enzi's \namendment is adopted today because it will help us. It will make us a \nbetter steward of taxpayer dollars, and that means doing a better job \nof helping children.\n  Thank you, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2818\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Thank you.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2822\n\n  I rise in strong support of the child care development and block \ngrant, or CCDBG, and to urge my colleagues to support the amendment \nSenator Murkowski and I put forward.\n  Our amendment would help strengthen CCDBG by making sure we are \naddressing some of our Nation's communities that will benefit most from \nit, the people who are members of tribes or tribal organizations all \nover this Nation. American Indians experience exceptionally high \nunemployment levels compared with the rest of the Nation. Furthermore, \nAmerican Indian children and youth experience some of the poorest \neducational outcomes in America. These are exactly the sort of \nchallenges CCDBG is designed to address. Our amendment would lift the \ncurrent ceiling on tribal childcare funding so CCDBG can go to where \nthe funds are needed most. This would enable more funds to flow to \ntribes and tribal organizations but without reducing the amount that \ngoes to States. The amendment specifies that the amount of CCDBG funds \nreserved for tribes only rises if the overall funding level for CCDBG \ngoes above its current levels.\n  I thank our cosponsors, Senators Murray, Thune, Hirono, Baldwin, and \nHeitkamp, for their support of this amendment. I thank Senators Harkin \nand Alexander and Senators Mikulski and Burr for working together to \nbring this bill to the floor.\n  Thank you very much.\n  I would yield for my colleague from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment, \nand I urge my colleagues--this is a reasonable improvement to the bill, \nand I think Senator Franken stated it very well.\n  This amendment increases the amount of CCDBG funding set aside for \ntribes from not more than 2 percent to not less than 2 percent. It \nsounds like not much of a difference, but this has a tremendous impact \non the predictability to tribes of the dollars that are going to be \navailable to them.\n  So I would urge my colleagues to support the Franken-Murkowski \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I wish to join with Senator Burr in supporting the \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2812\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, for the benefit of Senators, I wish \nto ask something about the schedule. I would like to ask the Senator \nfrom Iowa, the Senator from North Carolina, and Senator Mikulski about \nthe schedule of this bill. We are off to a fast start. We have the \nFranken amendment to be voted on now. This is my understanding of the \nschedule, and I want to see if I have it about right and then ask the \nchairman and the floor managers if it is right.\n  We expect there to be a colloquy from 3 o'clock until about 4 o'clock \ninvolving several Senators on the child care and development block \ngrant. Then at 5:15 we expect to have a vote--at least one vote--and \nmay accept others by voice and maybe have some nominations. Senators \nwho have other amendments are free to come and\n\n[[Page S1557]]\n\nspeak between 4 o'clock and 5 o'clock. We would expect to have other \nvotes tomorrow before lunch and finish the bill, it is my \nunderstanding, if we don't run into a snag, right after lunch tomorrow, \nabout 2:00 or 2:15. That is the course we hope to be on.\n  I thank Chairman Harkin and Senator Mikulski and Senator Burr for \ngetting us off to a fast start. We have had about 20 amendments from \nboth sides brought forward. We have been able to deal with them all.\n  Is that about right in terms of the schedule?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, that sounds exactly how we are proceeding.\n  I thank the Senator from Tennessee for all the good work and the \ncooperation we have had on both sides. I think we are on a good path.\n  I reiterate and reemphasize that if anyone has amendments they want \nto offer and speak about, I would say between 4 and 5 is a good time to \ndo it today. Then we will have two votes probably around 5:15. We are \nhoping maybe one can be voice voted at that time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2822\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, now, for the next hour, you are going to \nsee the women of the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, speaking up on the \nissue of childcare. We have worked long and hard together.\n  I am going to withhold my time and turn to the Senator from Nebraska. \nWhat you need to realize is we are not a caucus. We disagree on many \nthings, but on childcare we are united that this bill is a good bill. \nIt could be improved through the amendment process. We recognize that.\n  So here we are, as a force trying to change the tone, trying to \nchange the tide, and really help America's children.\n  I yield to Senator Fischer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nreauthorization of the Child Care and Development Block Grant Program. \nI thank the Senator from Maryland for her courtesy. In addition, I \nwould like to address an amendment I have proposed to the underlying \nbill.\n  Promoting policies that enable job creation is a basic duty of the \npeople's government. This bill we have on the floor before us now \nprovides low-income, hard-working mothers and fathers with the \nopportunity to have quality childcare while they earn a steady paycheck \nor as they go back to school.\n  Americans work hard. They work hard to provide for their families and \nto make a better life for their children. As a mother and a grandmother \nI understand that knowing your children are safe and secure is \nessential to maintaining a steady job. We need to encourage responsible \nadults to enter and to maintain their presence in our workforce. That \nis why I appreciate my colleagues' work and their compromise on this \nbipartisan legislation. I also appreciate how this effort has helped to \nbring some regular order back to the processes of the Senate. I \nespecially want to recognize Senators Barbara Mikulski, Lamar \nAlexander, and Richard Burr, who I know worked very hard in a \ncollaborative and bipartisan fashion in order to get this bill to the \nfloor.\n  As part of that process, I filed a proposed amendment that I have \nwith Senator King and Senator Rubio to the child care and development \nblock grant reauthorization. Our bipartisan amendment is a commonsense \nsolution to the FDA's overregulation of low-risk health information \ntechnology. That includes mobile wellness apps, scheduling software, \nand electronic health records. Under current law, which was established \nin 1976, the FDA can apply its definition of a ``medical device'' to \nassert broad regulatory authority over a wide array of health IT, \nincluding applications that do not pose any threat to human safety.\n  Our amendment allows the FDA to keep its focus on regulating medical \ndevices, while creating a modernized oversight framework for low-risk \ncategories of health IT. Since proposing this amendment, I have had the \nopportunity to speak with Senator Alexander, the ranking member of the \nSenate HELP Committee. I am happy to say he has expressed an interest \nin that amendment. That is identical to the language introduced as a \nstand-alone bill called the PROTECT Act.\n  I look forward to having the opportunity to work with him and \ncommittee members to advance the core ideas included in the PROTECT \nAct, because I believe with the guidance of the committee, and with the \nguidance of other Senators, we will be able to achieve another \nbipartisan success in this Chamber.\n  At Senator Alexander's request, and in response to his kind offers to \nwork collaboratively on the PROTECT Act, I have agreed not to formally \noffer this amendment to the bill on the floor, but I do look forward to \nworking with the Senator from Tennessee and others to improve upon \nthat.\n  Again, I thank the leadership of Senator Mikulski, Senator Alexander, \nand Senator Burr on the important legislation before us today. I thank \nthem for their work. I thank them for their courtesies in allowing me \nto rise and speak on this very important amendment. I also thank them \nand look forward to working with them on the PROTECT Act in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I now yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New York, \nanother cosponsor of the bill, Senator Gillibrand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I wish to start by thanking Senator \nMikulski for championing the reauthorization of the Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant Program, which is a bipartisan bill that \nreflects the values of this country. It serves more than 1.5 million \nchildren nationwide every month, including over 120,000 children in New \nYork State alone. I also thank Chairman Harkin for his leadership in \nbringing this important legislation through the committee and to the \nfloor.\n  Everywhere I go in my State of New York I listen to families. I hear \nthe exact same sense of struggle from every single one of them, that \nthey are doing everything they can do to get by,\n\n[[Page S1558]]\n\nto provide for their kids and give them the best possible chance to \nsucceed. But no matter how hard they work, making ends meet is \ndifficult. Their day-to-day expenses keep going, while their paychecks \neither stay the same, or, sadly, are diminished.\n  As a result, too many families feel they cannot get ahead. So for our \neconomy to get going again, it has to face the reality that the face of \nthe American workforce has changed. We still have workplace policies \nthat reflect the realities of decades ago, in the 1950s and 1960s. But \nin fact, today, 48 percent of the workforce in my State are women.\n  In order for us to unleash the full potential of our economy, we have \nto recognize that women are the new more often breadwinners of too many \nfamilies. They are the primary income earners for a growing share \nacross America. For that reason, we have to focus on an immovable \nreality for working mothers. That is childcare.\n  Today, more women are going back to work sooner after having a child, \ncreating a greater demand for affordable childcare that allows them to \nstay in their jobs. In 2012 New York ranked the second least affordable \nState in the Nation for full-time daycare for an infant, according to a \nreport by Child Care Aware.\n  A two-parent family in New York spends an average of 16.5 percent of \ntheir annual income to care for an infant. For a single mom in New \nYork, the cost was greater than 57 percent of her income. If you cannot \nafford childcare, as many middle-class families cannot, and you do not \nhave a family option, the choice you are left with is to leave your job \nand stay home to care for your child. That means less income for \nworking families, more women leaving the workforce and a weaker middle \nclass. It does not have to be this way. We can keep more working \nmothers in their jobs and more children in quality daycare when we make \nit affordable.\n  Our policies must reflect today's reality that women have to work for \na living. It is not a lifestyle choice for most working mothers, it is \na fact of survival. That is why I support Senator Mikulski's \noutstanding bill, because it will make daycare more affordable for \nmillions of children every single year. It is also why I am a cosponsor \nof Senator Boxer's amendment that will double the childcare tax credit \nfamilies can take to cover the cost of childcare and make it \nrefundable.\n  Making the tax credit refundable would help those who are working and \nstruggling the most but do not earn enough to use the tax credit. It \nmeans more savings going right back into the pockets of working \nfamilies.\n  I also have an amendment that will make middle-class tax cuts better \nfor childcare expenses. It will let them deduct the cost of childcare \nas a business expense.\n  This proposal, called childcare deduction, will allow you to deduct \nup to $14,000 for two kids or more. That makes perfect sense, because \nin New York, the average daycare for a toddler is $12,000; for an \ninfant it is almost $15,000. This will go a long way to making sure our \nhard-working middle-class families have the funds they need to provide \nfor their kids.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMichigan, also a sister social worker and a real advocate for good \nnutrition for children.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first, as everyone else, I congratulate \nour leader on this issue and on so many issues, including having the \nright kind of appropriations process to invest the dollars that \nAmericans work hard to earn, to make sure they are invested in ways \nthat help families, children, and to help the middle class to be able \nto succeed in this country.\n  I thank Senator Mikulski, the senior Senator from Maryland. Her work \non this issue, the child care and development block grant, has been \nextraordinary and bipartisan, as is all of her work. She is laser \nfocused on creating opportunities for children and families to succeed.\n  I think all of, certainly, the women who are speaking today and \nhopefully all of our colleagues understand that quality, affordable \nchildcare is not a frill. I realize the Presiding Officer has wonderful \nchildren as well and understands this is a necessity.\n  We care for our children. We want to make sure we are able to work, \nput a roof over their heads, food on the table, to be able to buy their \nschool clothes and get them what they need, to be able to pay for \ncollege, and to be able to do all the things we want to do for \nourselves, our children, and our families. The costs of childcare are \npart of that equation, being able to do those things for our families \nthat we need to do.\n  The average cost of childcare for 2 children is $14,872 a year. I \nhave heard from my friend and colleague from New York that it was \nhigher in New York. I am sure it is higher in many places. But, on \naverage, across the country, families are having to come up with almost \n$15,000 a year which equals, if they are working minimum wage, a 40-\nhour workweek, working full time for a year. Think about that. If \nsomeone is in a minimum-wage job--and hopefully we are going to change \nthat by raising the minimum wage--trying to make it and they work for 1 \nyear, that is the average childcare cost for two children. That is why \nthis investment in children and families is so important. This is the \nhighest household expense for many families.\n  In most States 1 year of daycare is more expensive than 1 year of \ntuition at a public university. We are all talking to parents. They are \nall worried about saving for college. With three small grandchildren, I \nthink how can I help be part of that process of saving for college. Yet \n1 year of daycare is more expensive than 1 year of tuition at a public \nuniversity. This is too much for many of our families to afford. Very \ndifficult choices are being made, choices that families are agonizing \nover.\n  This is especially unaffordable for so many hard-working families who \nare trying to climb the ladder of opportunity, trying to get into the \nmiddle class or maybe holding on by their fingertips and trying to stay \nin the middle class. That is why we have child care and development \nblock grants to be able to help families afford a necessity and \nsomething that is critical for our society, which is having safe, \naffordable, quality childcare for our children.\n  This is a critically important program signed into law by President \nGeorge H. W. Bush that 1.6 million children every month rely on; 1.6 \nmillion children in our country and their parents rely on this every \nmonth.\n  States use this funding to help low-income families gain access to \nquality, affordable childcare and afterschool programs. These families \nare trying to make ends meet and make sure their children have the \nopportunities they need to be successful. I want to stress that this \nfunding goes to parents who are working--are working--are training for \nwork or are enrolled in school.\n  I believe the reason we have strong bipartisan support is people \nunderstand how critical it is to hard-working families. This is an \ninvestment in our families. It is an investment in America's moms and \ndads. Sixty-five percent of moms work outside the home. In fact, if \nthey go back to work, they are earning, in Michigan, only 74 cents on \nevery dollar. They don't get a discount on their childcare, just \nbecause women are only getting three-quarters of a salary. Somehow, \nthey are still paying the full price, but this is particularly critical \nfor women across America.\n  This program helps millions of families, as I indicated, especially \nmoms--especially moms getting back to work without having to worry \nabout whether their children are going to be safe. Talk about peace of \nmind, this is peace-of-mind legislation for moms and dads to make sure \ntheir children will have a quality place, affordable place, and a safe \nplace to be while they are working to earn a living for their families.\n  It has now been 24 years since this law was signed by President Bush, \n18 years since it was last reauthorized. It is time to update it to \nreflect the changing conditions and challenges for our families.\n  This bipartisan reauthorization addresses issues facing families who \nneed childcare. It improves program quality, making sure funds go to \nfamilies in need; ensures children and childcare get the things they \nneed to succeed: good nutrition, which is so critical for\n\n[[Page S1559]]\n\ntheir growth, physical activity, well-being by developing guidelines \nand incorporating health and wellness training for professional \ndevelopment; making sure children's needs are addressed when children \nhave disabilities. It is very important for them and their families, \nmaking sure all childcare providers are properly trained to care for \nchildren and have been screened. That means first aid, CPR, how to \nprevent sudden infant death syndrome, child abuse, and undergoing a \nbackground check.\n  The bottom line is this is a bill that we need to pass. I am grateful \nand appreciative of the bipartisan support that has gotten us to this \npoint, and the 45 national organizations that support it, including the \nAfterschool Alliance, the American Professional Society on the Abuse of \nChildren, the National Association for Family Child Care, Teach for \nAmerica, United Way Worldwide, and so many others.\n  I am pleased to join with all of my colleagues and urge them that we \npass this bill as quickly as possible.\n  Again, congratulations to our leader, the senior Senator from \nMaryland, who has gotten us to this point. I know we will get it all \nthe way through the process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield the floor to Senator Baldwin of Wisconsin, one \nof our newest Members but not new to this issue. Her record in the \nHouse on advocacy for children is well-known and respected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. In America, we know that quality education and a fair \nshot at work is the path to the middle class, economic security, and \ngetting ahead. Today we have an opportunity to make an important \nbipartisan action to help strengthen that path to the middle class.\n  For many families in this country, quality, affordable childcare is a \nchallenge they struggle with every morning. This is why President \nGeorge H. W. Bush signed the child care and development block grant law \nin 1990, to ensure that working families have access to quality, \naffordable childcare.\n  Today I join a bipartisan group of my Senate colleagues in calling \nfor reauthorization of the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act \nbecause of the support it provides working families across this country \nand across the State of Wisconsin, my home State.\n  I thank HELP Committee Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Alexander, \nand Senator Mikulski and Senator Burr for their working across party \nlines to move this important legislation forward.\n  This bipartisan work is an endorsement of our shared responsibility \nto build a shared path to the middle class that begins by investing in \naffordable childcare and high-quality early learning programs.\n  I am proud to say that Wisconsin has long been a leader in investing \nin our children early. Education for 4-year-olds was part of \nWisconsin's Constitution in 1845, and the first kindergarten in the \nUnited States was founded in Watertown, WI, in 1856. Wisconsin is \nnearing universal 4K, with over 90 percent of school districts offering \nkindergarten for 4-year-olds.\n  My State has also recognized the importance of effective \ncollaborations to support early childhood care and education. Wisconsin \nEarly Childhood Collaborating Partners is a statewide partnership \nrepresenting over 50 public and private agencies, led by Wisconsin's \nDepartment of Public Instruction, with the goal of providing every \nchild access to a comprehensive delivery system for high-quality \neducation and care.\n  I am proud that my State has undertaken a community approach to \nimplementing high-quality childcare and early education. More work \nremains to be done, however, both in Wisconsin and nationwide to ensure \nhigh-quality childcare and education is accessible to every family.\n  Our Nation continues to recover from the most severe economic \ndownturn since the Great Depression. As our country continues this \nrecovery, families have had to get by with less. Americans are in need \nof affordable childcare now more than ever. My home State of Wisconsin \nis no exception to this trend. Today, many parents are in the \nworkforce, including over 70 percent of mothers in Wisconsin. For many \nhardworking middle-class families, childcare is necessary but also \nexpensive. For millions of families in the United States, childcare is \ntheir single largest household expense at nearly $15,000 per year.\n  In Wisconsin, the cost of childcare for an infant is approximately 40 \npercent of a single mother's median income. Two-parent families can \nexpect to spend more than 10 percent of their income on childcare.\n  Further, in Wisconsin, nearly one-third of children receiving the \nchild care and development block grant funding are under the age of 3, \nmaking this a truly sound investment in those crucial years of early \nlife.\n  The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act is a bipartisan effort \nto reauthorize, reform, and revitalize the block grant program by \nstrengthening Federal safety standards and placing a greater focus on \nthe quality of childcare programs.\n  This investment in affordable quality childcare will help more than \n1.5 million children, including over 30,000 children in Wisconsin.\n  I once again thank my colleagues for working in a bipartisan manner \nto guide us in reauthorizing this vital legislation. High-quality \nchildcare and education is essential to the future success of our \nchildren and our overall success as a nation.\n  I am proud to support this legislation as it focuses on improving the \nquality and safety of childcare programs, focuses on supporting infants \nand toddlers with high-quality care, and reflects the realities of \nworking families in this difficult economic environment. But, as \nimportantly, I am proud to join a bipartisan effort in Washington that \nis squarely focused on both parties working together to build a \nstronger future for our middle class.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 2813 and 2814 en bloc\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent to make pending Landrieu \namendments No. 2813 and No. 2814.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendments en bloc.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski], for Ms. Landrieu, \n     for herself, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. Inhofe, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2813.\n       The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski], for Ms. Landrieu, \n     for herself, Mr. Blunt, and Mr. Inhofe, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2814.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2813\n\n (Purpose: To allow children in foster care to receive services under \n  the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 while their \n  families (including foster families) are taking necessary action to \n   comply with immunization and other health and safety requirements)\n\n       On page 82, lines 9 and 10, strike ``to receive services \n     under this subchapter while their families'' and insert ``and \n     children in foster care to receive services under this \n     subchapter while their families (including foster \n     families)''.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2814\n\n  (Purpose: To require the State plan to describe how the State will \n   coordinate the services supported to carry out the Child Care and \n Development Block Grant Act of 1990 with State agencies and programs \n    serving children in foster care and the foster families of such \n                               children)\n\n       On page 93, strike lines 3 and 4 and insert the following:\n\n     11432(g)(1)(J)(ii));\n       ``(VII) State agencies and programs serving children in \n     foster care and the foster families of such children; and\n       ``(VIII) other Federal programs\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I note that on the floor are three \noutstanding Senators who wish to speak on this bill: Senator Cantwell, \nSenator Murkowski, and Senator Collins. They come as the deans of the \nRepublican women. I ask unanimous consent that they each be allowed to \nspeak for 5 minutes in the order in which I stated: Senator Cantwell, \nSenator Murkowski, and then Senator Collins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Harkin and certainly\n\n[[Page S1560]]\n\nSenator Mikulski and Senator Burr for their leadership on this \nbipartisan issue but especially Senator Mikulski for her constant \nleadership in making sure families in America are cared for.\n  This is important bipartisan legislation, and the reauthorization of \nthis legislation--the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of \n2014--will help ensure that families have access to quality, affordable \nchildcare.\n  The Child Care and Development Block Grant Program serves more than \n1.6 million children per month nationwide. In my State it serves more \nthan 39,000 children per month. With the support of these grants, \nparents can work, look for work, and participate in job-training \nprograms while their children receive affordable childcare at quality \ncenters or in the child's home.\n  The child care and development block grants are a primary source of \nFederal support for childcare assistance, and they play a key role in \npromoting healthy development of children, especially at young ages. \nResearch on the effects of early childhood development has continually \nshown that the foundation provided by early learning and childcare \nnetworks can prevent the achievement gaps at a young age. This bill \nenables States to invest in the programs that have proven to work for \nchildren and families.\n  In Washington more than half of the children served by the child care \nand development block grants are younger than 4 years old, so in my \nState these grants are vital for preparing our youngest children with \nthe support and skills they need to stay ahead once they enter into \nkindergarten.\n  Professor Cathryn Booth-LaForce, at the University of Washington, \nsaid:\n\n       Child care affects so many children that for society at \n     large, even small effects are important.\n\n  This bill would provide an additional 22,000 children across our \nNation with childcare. That is a major effect. Expanding access to \nquality care can help thousands more children across the Nation get a \nrunning start on school. By preventing achievement gaps for our \nyoungest children, we are creating successful students and building a \nskilled workforce for the future.\n  This bill allows Washington to make the important investments in our \nyoungest learners and in our future economy. So I am so proud to be \nhere in support of this bipartisan effort, and again I thank Senator \nMikulski, Senator Burr, and others for working together at a time when \npeople didn't think this level of compromise would result in such an \nimportant piece of legislation moving forward.\n  Once again I particularly wish to thank the dean of the women \nSenators, Senator Mikulski, for this effort and encourage my colleagues \nto support this bill, S. 1086, and make sure we get it passed before \nthe end of this week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I, too, am pleased to rise today to \njoin my fellow women Senators on the floor this afternoon to speak in \nsupport of the bipartisan Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of \n2014. I also commend Senator Mikulski and Senator Burr on their \nleadership in developing a truly bipartisan bill as we are moving \nforward. They have worked diligently and they have worked in a positive \nand constructive manner that does credit to the Senate operations. I \nalso would like to recognize and commend Senator Harkin and Senator \nAlexander, as they have brought this bill through the committee and \nonto the floor.\n  I believe this legislation walks that line between asking the States, \nour tribes, and providers to plan ways to improve childcare quality \nwithout actually dictating the who and how and the what of every aspect \nof childcare. What the bill really does is it strengthens the ways in \nwhich providers can combine CCDBG, Head Start, title I, and IDEA funds \nto serve more kids, and if we can serve more kids, that is all good. It \nasks them to take an updated look at how they serve children with \ndisabilities and how they will address nutrition and fitness and health \nand safety issues, but it will continue to let them figure out the best \nways to achieve the goals, and that really does make sense.\n  In addition, as a result of the bipartisan nature of how this bill \nhas come together, Alaskan voices were heard on this, and Alaskan \nconcerns about several provisions in the original draft of the bill \nwere addressed. For example, States that will be required to perform \nhealth, safety, and fire inspections may delegate to qualified agencies \nthose inspections that require specialized expertise. That helps us in \nAlaska.\n  The committee report clarified that States' disaster preparedness \nstandards include specific mention of children with disabilities and \nfamily reunification.\n  I was pleased to work with my colleague from Hawaii, Senator Hirono, \nto make sure the bill managers included the technical amendments she \nhad requested, which ensured that Native Hawaiian children were not \ninadvertently left out.\n  I again thank Senators Mikulski, Burr, Alexander, and Harkin for \naccepting those amendments that have made this bill that much better.\n  Mr. President, ensuring that families and children are well served by \nthe childcare they pay for, in part with CCDBG assistance, is an \nimportant task before the Congress because this is not just about \ndaycare or early learning, as important as those topics are. The fact \nis that access to high-quality, safe, and affordable childcare is \nreally the key component when we are talking about those things that \nbuild strong economies and strong American communities.\n  This assistance allows parents to get the education or the training \nthey need to qualify for a good job. It allows them to accept and keep \na good job that will help pay those bills. It helps employers hire \nqualified employees who are then able to work. It helps the children \nget the foundation they need both academically and socially to be \nprepared to succeed in school and life.\n  Getting CCDBG-funded childcare up to speed with the 21st century is a \nkey element in addressing income inequality and the deep recession that \nis still present for so many low-income American families. This is \nespecially true for American Indian and Alaska Native families. \nAmerican Indians and Alaska Natives experience exceptionally high \nunemployment levels compared to the rest of the Nation. I think the \nPresiding Officer knows this from his State, but in many regions of \nAlaska unemployment among our Native people is more than double our \nstatewide rate. In the lower 48, unemployment on our Indian \nreservations was at approximately 50 percent in 2012.\n  We also know that high-quality early education can have an important \nand positive effect on the often very difficult academic and social \noutcomes we can see with our American Indians and our Alaska Native \nchildren if they do not have some of these foundational opportunities \nbefore them. So increasing these families' access to quality early \neducation can have an important, positive effect on these children by \nimproving their academic outcomes and their economic opportunities and \nreally bringing hope to the community.\n  I thank the Senators on the floor for supporting the amendment we \njust had in front of us. Senator Franken and I had offered the tribal \nset-aside. This change, which moves the set-aside from a ceiling to a \nfloor, will provide tribes with an opportunity to work with HHS to \nreceive additional support for the childcare opportunities that are so \nneeded in Indian Country.\n  I am proud of the work we are doing in the Senate this week. We could \nhave hotlined this bill and passed it by unanimous consent, but I think \nthe path we have taken is the right one in bringing the bill to the \nfloor and giving each Member the opportunity to be heard on ways to \nimprove the bill. Holding votes on amendments in the regular order is \nthe right thing to do. I applaud the chairwoman and those who have \nworked so hard, and I look forward to supporting this bill as we see \nits conclusion.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues this \nafternoon in expressing support for the\n\n[[Page S1561]]\n\nreauthorization of the Child Care and Development Block Grant Program, \nand I too commend Senator Mikulski, Senator Burr, Senator Harkin, and \nSenator Alexander for crafting this bipartisan bill and bringing it to \nthe Senate floor for debate and amendment.\n  Childcare for working parents is essential to families throughout the \nNation, and Maine is no exception. For years the CCDBG Program has \nassisted low-income parents in affording childcare. The support \nprovided by this important program enables parents to obtain needed \ncare for their children so they may work or improve their own skills \nand education.\n  Mr. President, 2,600 children from 1,800 Maine families receive \nFederal childcare subsidies through this program. Particularly during \nthese difficult economic times, this program goes a long way in helping \nfamilies in Maine and across the country.\n  I have seen firsthand the impact of high-quality early learning on a \nchild's ability to succeed and grow. Educare Central Maine, located in \nWaterville, which I visited a few years ago, is a state-of-the-art \nearly learning center that serves more than 200 mostly low-income \nchildren from birth to age 5. Almost half of these children come from \nfamilies that are eligible for assistance, and many rely on the CCDBG \nvoucher to help cover the cost of their attending Educare. Educare is a \ngreat example of quality childcare in my State and of the real impact \nof this program's funding at work in our communities.\n  As I saw at Educare in Waterville, the vouchers provided under this \nprogram allow parents to choose the best childcare setting for their \nchildren. That is a critical aspect of this program. Vouchers give \nparents the flexibility they want and need to make the best choice for \ntheir children about the kind of care that best serves their needs, \nwhether it is at a childcare center, at a family care home, or with a \nrelative or friend. The voucher program helps to keep the decisions in \nthe hands of parents.\n  I am also pleased this reauthorization requires coordination among \nthe early learning advisory councils and Head Start and the IDEA \nprograms that serve children with special needs. Aligning these \nprograms will help to improve the quality of all services offered for \ninfants, toddlers, and preschool-aged children.\n  High-quality early learning experiences help ensure that children are \nwell prepared for school. This bill improves the current program by \nmaking sure those providers receiving funding are qualified, receive \ntraining, and are regularly inspected and monitored.\n  I also express my gratitude to the members of the Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee for including in this legislation \nprovisions from the Child Care Infant Mortality Prevention Act. That is \na bill I introduced with the Senator from California, Dianne Feinstein. \nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as \nthe American Academy of Pediatrics, half of the approximately 4,500 \nsudden infant death syndrome cases in the United States are entirely \npreventable with effective training and implementation of correct sleep \npractices. I am very pleased this reauthorization includes sudden \ninfant death syndrome prevention and safe sleeping practices among the \nnew health and safety training topics for providers.\n  Childcare is not only important to the developmental health of our \nchildren but also to the well-being of their parents. When parents know \ntheir children have a place to go where they will be safe and where \nthey will learn, then parents have the peace of mind to earn a living \nto support their families.\n  Balancing the need to work with the need for childcare can be very \ndifficult. At times, a parent's salary would be almost completely \noffset by the cost of childcare in a low-income family. This bill will \nhelp more parents get the support they need while reinforcing the \nrequirement for high-quality care in healthy, stimulating, and safe \nenvironments.\n  Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to support this \nreauthorization bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Senators from Maine and \nAlaska for their comments, as well as the Senator from Washington \nState. Wasn't it impressive that for the last hour, from both sides of \nthe aisle, the women of the Senate have spoken out. Yet this bill is \nnot a woman's bill. This is a family bill, where the men and women of \nthe Senate came together on a bipartisan basis and have developed a \nframework for a sensible, affordable reauthorization of the Child Care \nand Development Block Grant Act.\n  I am so pleased to be a part of this with Senator Harkin, chairman of \nthe health and education committee, Senator Lamar Alexander, and \nSenator Richard Burr, my counterpart on the subcommittee, where we \nworked so hard to do this.\n  We the women of the Senate often joke, but it is no laughing matter \nwhen we say we work on the macro issues of our economy and of our \nnational security. But we also work on the macaroni and cheese issues \naffecting America's families, and there is no bigger macaroni and \ncheese issue than general education, and of course early childhood \neducation, which occurs both in the home--remember, the first teachers \nare always the family--and then childcare. With now more than 40 \npercent of American women in the workforce, childcare is indeed a \ncompelling issue.\n  Childcare is one of the most important decisions a parent can make in \nraising their child. Yet when one asks who is worried about childcare \nor when there is a single mom working double shifts because she might \nmake the minimum wage and she is trying to hold body and soul together \nor a married couple where the wife is working in the marketplace as a \nlab technician and the father has a job which might have him commuting \nmore than 2 hours a day one way, they need to be able to have \naffordable childhood care. What about the police officer who works the \nnight shift? When we say ``police officer,'' it could be female or \nmale.\n  Our bill helps lift the burden, giving families and children the \nchildcare they need. This is why I am so proud the Senate women have \njoined me to support this bill. Many families want childcare which is \nreliable, undeniable, safe, affordable, and accessible. This bill does \njust that.\n  So how does it work? The Federal Government provides States and \nIndian tribes with funding. This funding is used to help lower-income \nfamilies afford childcare while their parents work or train for work. \nFamilies are given vouchers based on their income level to help cover \nthe cost of care. These vouchers can be used by parents for care in a \nchildcare home, care in a relative's home or in a child care center.\n  Every month the CCDBG Program helps more than 1.5 million American \nchildren. In my own home State of Maryland, 20,000 children are served \nmonthly; 20,000 families benefit from this.\n  So why is the program important? Childcare is expensive. Even when \nparents are contributing to childcare, it is often one of their highest \nexpenditures. On average, Maryland families spend 20 percent of their \nfamily income on child care. Maryland has 54,000 working moms with \ninfants under the age of 1 year. The childcare for this is $13,000 a \nyear. We have 148,000 single moms with children under the age of 18. We \nhave 200,000 working moms with children under the age of 6. Childcare \nfor them for a 4-year-old is about $9,000 a year. This is more than \nwhat it costs to go to a community college. This is what it costs to go \nto more than some of the campuses at the University of Maryland.\n  Childcare is expensive. Taking care of children who are preschool is \nexpensive because in order to do the right thing they have to have \ntrained staff who not only provide a safe environment for the children, \nbut the kind of environment which nurtures their development, develops \ntheir mind, and prepares them for school. This is why we focused on \nhigh-quality childcare.\n  Safeguarding their health and safety, ensuring children have a \ncontinuity of care, making sure their nutritional concerns are also \naddressed. We have done this, again, on a bipartisan basis to make sure \nwhen we provide childcare, and we also provide local flexibility.\n\n[[Page S1562]]\n\n  The needs in a rural State like Utah or Montana are different than \nMaryland or New York. Look at the lead sponsors of this bill: \nTennessee, North Carolina, Iowa, Maryland. So we provide the local \nflexibility which is so important.\n  This bill will make sure we have strong background checks to make \nsure the children are safe. We are going to make sure they meet certain \nbasic health requirements where the staff knows basic first aid. We are \nalso going to make sure there is money for training and curriculum \ndevelopment so each child benefits in a safe learning environment.\n  There is much more I could say about this bill, but the most \nimportant is this. Let's get our amendments done and let's move it. I \nam proud of what we have done, and I really think that if we work \ntogether, we can offer our amendments and be done by sometime tomorrow.\n  So I again reach out to all of my colleagues. We have a good bill. It \nis a bill which helps families and, at the same time, it does not \nreally increase bureaucracy.\n  I yield the floor and look forward to a continuing debate on the \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown).

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, would the Senator yield 2 minutes?\n  I thank the Senator from Iowa for his generosity spirit, and I rise \nin strong support of the bill.\n  Since 1990 this important block grant has helped States provide \nvouchers to our low-income families to help them afford quality \nchildcare programs. We all know how important that is.\n  With over 70 percent of moms in today's workforce, it certainly is a \ncritical issue for our children and their families and for our economy.\n  I have been involved in this issue both when I was a young mom and \nnow as an older grandmother. Childcare can be very expensive. The \naverage low-income family spends over 32 percent of their income on \nchildcare every month and about the same for their rent. They don't \nhave much left over. It is very difficult. In California we have almost \n6 million children whose parents are working, and in our State we were \nable to help over 100,000 children through this very important program.\n  I commend the sponsors of this bill, the HELP Committee, for the \ngreat work they have done. I have a couple of amendments, and I will \nfinish in just a moment.\n  Senator Burr and I have proposed amendment No. 2809, which simply \nensures that all childcare programs on Federal facilities, such as \nmilitary bases, conduct the same comprehensive background checks the \nbill already requires of childcare providers on State land. So it is \nlike a little bit of an oversight that was left out.\n  So we make sure if there is a childcare center on Federal lands--and, \nby the way, there are many--it is taken care of. Unfortunately, we have \nhad experiences of all kinds of assaults on Federal lands, and I don't \nneed to go into that.\n  Amendment No. 2810 would help more parents afford quality childcare \nby increasing the child and dependent care tax credit from $3,000 to \n$6,000 per child, and making it refundable.\n  I do hope we all support the underlying bill, and I thank the Senator \nfrom Iowa for his generosity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in the last few weeks I have come to the \nfloor many times to speak about how the Senate has deteriorated from \nbeing the deliberative body it is supposed to be. Considering the \ncomity on the floor on this bill under the direction of Senator Harkin, \nmy colleague from Iowa, and other people, this is probably not the most \nappropriate time to give a speech like this. But we still have problems \nin the Senate and I wish to address them.\n  We need to restore the Senate as a deliberative body. I am very \nconcerned the Senate is no longer living up to its reputation as the \n``World's Greatest Deliberative Body.''\n  I have outlined how the Senate ought to function by quoting at length \nthe writings of the primary architect of the U.S. Constitution James \nMadison. When trying to understand what the authors of the Constitution \nintended the role of the Senate to be, we can't do any better than \nJames Madison, the father of the Constitution.\n  The writings of Madison, along with Hamilton and Jay, in the \nFederalist Papers comprise the most comprehensive and detailed \nexplanation of what the framers of the Constitution intended. This \nprovides an important and\n\n[[Page S1564]]\n\nvery nonpartisan frame of reference about the role the Senate is \nsupposed to play in our system of government. By going back to our \nfounding document and first principles, we can rise above petty \npartisan squabbling and start working on how to restore the Senate as \nthe deliberative body it is supposed to be.\n  I will start by recapping some of the lessons from the Federalist \nPapers where the Senate has gone off course. Then I will talk about \nsolutions to restore the Senate. I am introducing this solution today \nwith cosponsorship of other Senators, which I will get to in a minute.\n  In Federalist No. 62, this new creation of a Senate is being \nexplained to the people of New York to convince them to ratify the \nConstitution. It tells of the lessons Americans learned in the first \nyears of independence under the Articles of Confederation, which had a \nunicameral legislature, as did most of the States at that time. Based \non lessons learned from practical experience then of these State \nlegislatures, James Madison lists four problems that a republic such as \nours could face if it doesn't have a properly functioning Senate.\n\n  The first problem Madison recounts is a tendency for a group to form \nin a legislative body that pushes its own agenda as opposed to what the \npeople elected them to do. Madison explains that having a second \nChamber like a Senate makes such ``schemes of usurpation or perfidy'' \nless likely because they would have to capture both Chambers at the \nsame time. The Senate, with longer staggered terms as the Constitution \nspells out, makes that even less likely.\n  The second lesson is that a single-chamber legislature with lots of \nMembers tends to ``yield to the impulse of sudden and violent passions \nand to be seduced by factious leaders into intemperate and pernicious \nresolutions.''\n  If that sounds like the House of Representatives today, that is \nbecause it is supposed to work that way. The House is supposed to \nreflect the immediate passions of the day, even if those passions take \non a partisan pen. However, when laws are made only by factious \nleaders, you end up with what Madison calls, ``intemperate and \npernicious resolutions.''\n  So that is where he says the function of the Senate as a deliberative \nbody comes into play.\n  Madison's third lesson has to do with a need for a body with longer \nterms that is serious about doing the hard work of legislating, instead \nof pushing short-term agendas, such as might be the case in a House of \nRepresentatives.\n  To quote Madison:\n\n       What indeed are all the repealing, explaining, and amending \n     laws, which fill and disgrace our voluminous codes, but so \n     many monuments of deficient wisdom; so many impeachments \n     exhibited by each succeeding against each preceding session; \n     so many admonitions to people, of the value of those aids \n     which may be expected from a well constituted senate?\n\n  In other words, what Madison was saying: It is better to take the \ntime to get it right the first time than to have to constantly go back \nand fix ill-conceived laws. That is what the Senate is composed to do \nunder our Constitution, to make sure we do not get sudden changes or \nbad legislation out of the other body.\n  In the fourth and final point, Madison explains that if a legislature \nis constantly churning out new laws, even if they are good ideas, it \ncauses chaos because no one knows what the law says from day to day. It \nchanges constantly, in other words.\n  To this point Madison says: ``A continual change even of good \nmeasures is inconsistent with every rule of prudence and every prospect \nof success.''\n  Madison also points out a problem caused by overactive legislating \nthat we tend to think is unique in modern times; that is, special \ninterest groups that are hired as lobbyists and lawyers. To quote \nMadison: ``Another effect of public instability is the unreasonable \nadvantage it gives to the sagacious, the enterprising, and the moneyed \nfew over the industrious and uniformed mass of the people.''\n  That is a criticism we still hear today.\n  Just to recap, the Senate was specifically written into our \nConstitution to solve certain problems; namely, but repetitively, to \nprevent an agenda that does not reflect that of the American people, to \nprevent legislation based upon short-term partisan passions, and to \npass fewer but better thought-out laws. Of course, starting in 2007, we \nhad a House and a Senate controlled by the same political party and \nintent on enacting the President's agenda, top of which was his health \ncare law. The deliberative process was cut short and the legislation \nwas rammed through the Senate over the objections of Senators \nrepresenting 40 percent of the States. The President's health care law \nis practically the poster child for what Madison called ``intemperate \nand pernicious resolutions,'' reflecting a partisan agenda that did not \nenjoy broad support among the American people when it was passed. You \nknow what. It enjoys less support today.\n  The fact that Congress didn't take the time to think through every \naspect of that important health care legislation and work out a \nconsensus that could attract broad support of the Senate has resulted \nin the need of a series of, as Madison said, ``repealing, explaining \nand amending laws.''\n  Of course, the President claimed for himself the authority to \nunilaterally suspend or amend parts of the law that aren't working \nrather than come back to Congress that under the Constitution is \nsupposed to be the legislative body. Of course, what the President is \ndoing now is not what the authors of the Constitution intended either. \nWe wouldn't be in this predicament, with a deeply flawed health care \nlaw, if the Senate had been allowed to function as it was intended.\n  Now with neither party today having 60 votes needed to steamroll \nMembers of the minority party, the Senate should go back to functioning \nas it was intended. Yet that hasn't happened. Instead we have seen an \nunprecedented abuse of Senate rules to block Senators from \nparticipating in the deliberative process. These abuses of Senate rules \nthreaten to fundamentally transform the Senate from the greatest \ndeliberative body in the world into a purely partisan rubberstamp for \nthe agenda of the majority and its leadership. If we allow that to \nhappen, we will see even more of the problems Madison warned about.\n  The Senate was intended to be a deliberative body and only functions \nproperly when deliberation is allowed. That means we must have debate \nand amendments.\n  I hear frequent complaints from Iowans about Congress passing huge \nbills without Members of Congress having the opportunity to understand \nall the provisions, much less the people they are supposed to represent \nhaving a chance to understand the bills and to weigh in on them. It is \nnow routine for cloture to be filed immediately upon bringing up a \nmatter for consideration. That is not the deliberative process or how \nthe Senate is supposed to operate.\n  Cloture was invented to allow the Senate to end consideration of a \nmatter after the preponderance of Senators had concluded it had \nreceived sufficient consideration. Even that part was a compromise. \nBefore cloture was invented, there was no way to end debate as long as \nat least one Senator thought a matter needed further consideration.\n  Cloture was introduced to balance the desire to get things done with \nthe principle that each Senator, as a representative of his or her \nState, has a right to participate fully in that legislative process. \nThe threshold was later adjusted down from two-thirds of Senators \nvoting to three-fifths of all Senators. That is the famous 60 votes we \nhave to have if we want to end debate. Each time this matter has been \nrevisited, the balance has tilted more in favor of speeding up the \nprocess at the expense of allowing Senators to fully represent the \npeople of their States.\n\n  At the beginning of the current Congress, the Senate passed changes \nto the Senate rules to shorten the amount of debate time after cloture \nis invoked for certain nominees and to expedite consideration of \nlegislation in some situations. These changes were agreed to in \nexchange for a promise--a real promise--that the so-called nuclear \noption would not be used.\n  Notwithstanding that commitment, just a short 10 months later, the \nnuclear option was used, setting a new precedent that debate on \nnominations can be cut off by a simple majority of Senators, ignoring \nthe plain text of the cloture rule that is still on the books.\n  At the end of the day, Members of this body agreed to extinguish \ncertain rights in exchange for the promise not\n\n[[Page S1565]]\n\nto use the nuclear option only to have additional rights stripped away \n10 months later by a simple majority vote. Taken together, those two \nepisodes represent a dramatic shift toward domination of the Senate by \none faction, contrary to Madison's stated intent.\n  I say all that by way of background, but that is history and the \nother side will have to learn to live with the ramifications of changes \nto the nomination process that they forced upon this body.\n  I would like to turn the focus now to the legislative process and \nwhat can be done to restore the Senate to the role envisioned by the \nauthors of the Constitution before it is too late and the idea that I \nhave and some of my colleagues have joined me in a rule change along \nthis line.\n  When it comes to legislating, we have gotten off track from how the \nSenate was designed, but we have an opportunity to restore the Senate \nas a deliberative body. That was an understanding at the beginning of \nthis Congress, that there would be some return to regular order. In \nexchange for rule changes that expedite the legislative process, the \nmajority leadership would turn to the longstanding tradition of an open \namendment process.\n  In other words, there was an understanding that the Senate would take \nits time to consider legislation and Senators from both sides would be \nfree to propose amendments and have them voted on. That understanding \nlasted until Republicans submitted amendments that some on the other \nside were nervous to have to take a position on. It is no secret the \nmajority leader has gone out of his way to keep Members of his caucus \nfrom having to take votes that may hurt them with the people back home.\n  The Senate rules provide that any Senator may offer an amendment to a \nbill being considered. Therefore, in order to shield Members from \nhaving to take tough votes, the majority leader now routinely moves to \nshut down all consideration of a bill before amendments are considered.\n  As I said at the beginning, maybe today isn't the time to give this \nspeech because we have great comity on the bills before the Senate, but \nwe still have a major problem.\n  Cloture is supposed to be used after the Senate has considered a \nmeasure for a period of time and a preponderance of the Senate think it \nhas deliberated enough. Cloture should not be used to prevent any \nmeaningful deliberation from taking place. The average number of \ncloture motions filed under each session of the Congress under this \nmajority leadership is more than double what it was in prior sessions \nof Congress under majority leaders of both parties going back to 1987. \nThis alone is an indication that cloture is being overused, even \nabused, by the majority.\n  The majority leader will tell you he is forced to file cloture \nbecause of Republican filibusters. He might have a point if--and that \nis a big if--if it was true that after extensive debate and plenty of \nopportunity to consider amendments Republicans were dragging out debate \npurely for the sake of delay. However, we can hardly claim that the \nSenate's deliberation has dragged on too long when it hasn't even begun \nconsideration of the matter in the first place.\n  We are now at the point where the overwhelming number of motions to \ncut off debate are made before debate has even started, much less than \nin response to a filibuster because, obviously, we have to have debate \nbefore we have a filibuster.\n  Let's look at a chart I have that was put together by the \nCongressional Research Service on cloture motions in relationship to \nlegislative business filed the same day a matter is brought before the \nSenate--in other words, before debate starts--because we have to have \ndebate before we have a filibuster.\n  I have color-coded each Congress based on which party controlled the \nSenate. You will notice that use of same-day cloture averages out to 29 \ntimes per Congress up until the 110th Congress when this majority \nleadership takes over. Then there is a huge jump to 98 same-day cloture \nmotions. That is more than three times the previous average. You will \nnotice a trend toward slightly more use of same-day clotures in the \nyears leading up to 2007 and, of course, that makes both parties \nguilty.\n  You can see an unprecedented use of same-day clotures starting when \nthis majority leadership took over. The trend has continued at more \nthan double the previous average in each Congress since this majority \nleadership took over.\n  There were 65 same-day cloture motions in the 111th Congress and 67 \nin the 112th Congress compared to 29 the last time Republicans \ncontrolled the Senate, which coincidentally is also the previous \naverage I have talked about.\n  The last line on the chart shows the total as of January, when we \nwere only halfway through the current Congress. At that time we were \nalready up to 30 same-day cloture motions. That is more than we saw for \nthe entire Congress the last time Republicans were in the majority. We \nare back to an unprecedented use of cloture to end deliberations before \ndeliberations have even begun, and that is clearly abusive and cannot \nbe justified.\n  Some people might argue that same-day cloture motions on the motion \nto proceed should not be counted because the motion to proceed can't be \namended. That is debatable, but I will point out that the last column \nshows same-day cloture filings excluding the motion to proceed, and the \ntrend is exactly the same.\n  What do we do about this abuse of cloture to end consideration of a \nbill before it has been considered? Today I am introducing the Stop \nCloture Abuse Resolution. That appropriately spells out the acronym \nSCAR because cloture abuse threatens to scar the body of the Senate. \nThe Stop Cloture Abuse Resolution will amend Senate rules to prohibit \nthe filing of cloture until at least 24 hours after the Senate has \nproceeded to the matter. That means you will have debate before you \nfile cloture. Debate could be a filibuster, but you have to have debate \nto have a filibuster. This reform will end, once and for all, the \npractice of attempting to shut down debate and amendments before the \ndebate has started.\n  It is important to keep in mind that when Senators are blocked from \nparticipating in the legislative process, the people they represent are \ndisenfranchised. By that I don't mean the citizens of the 45 States who \nelected Republicans. The citizens of States who elected Democratic \nSenators also expect their Senators to offer amendments and engage with \ntheir colleagues and different parties. Forcing a cloture vote before \nany deliberation prevents even Members of the majority party from \noffering amendments that may be important to the people they represent. \nVoters have a right to expect the people they elect to actually do the \nhard work of legislating, not just be a rubberstamp for the \nleadership's agenda.\n  Senators who go along with the tactics that disenfranchise their own \nconstituents should have to explain to those who voted them into office \nwhy they are not willing to be full-fledged Senators. The Senate is the \nworld's most deliberative body, and constituents rightfully expect \ntheir Senators to be able to vote. They should explain why their \nloyalty is to party leadership and not to the people of their State.\n  A Senator's job includes offering amendments. Being a Senator also \nmeans sometimes you have to take tough votes on other Senators' \namendments that reveal to your constituents where you stand on various \nissues. It is the job of Senators, quite plainly, to deliberate and to \nlegislate.\n  The Stop Cloture Abuse Resolution will make it clear that \ndeliberation is the rule, not disenfranchisement. It would establish \nthat a deliberative process is expected, and at least some deliberation \nmust occur before any attempt to silence the voices of Senators and by \nextension the voices of the people of their respective States.\n  This is just one reform idea I am proposing for the Senate to \nconsider as we work to restore the Senate as a deliberative body, and \nthat will be introduced today. It would only address, I have to admit, \npart of the problem. The Senate will also have to address the abuse of \nfilling the tree to block amendments.\n  The ability to block Senators from offering amendments is actually \nnot found in the Senate rules. Filling the tree is an abuse of Senate \nprecedents. In some ways that makes it the easier problem to address; \nwhereas, a cloture\n\n[[Page S1566]]\n\nabuse is an abuse of the Senate cloture rule. The practice of filling \nthe tree to block amendments can be eliminated simply by establishing a \nnew precedent.\n  As everyone remembers from the nuclear option, establishing a new \nprecedent is a simple process that only requires a majority vote. \nHowever, like the nuclear option which established a precedent that the \nSenate would ignore, the plain text of a rule is still on the books. \nEnding the ability of a majority leader to block amendments would \nsimply involve replacing the old precedent with a new precedent.\n  For now, the Stop Cloture Abuse Resolution--going by the acronym \nSCAR--would be a good start. It would eliminate the scar on the Senate. \nAdopting the Stop Cloture Abuse Resolution would send a strong message \nthat the Senate will once again deliberate over issues rather than \nramming through all of them without careful consideration.\n  This reform will reduce the urge to force legislation through the \nSenate based on a short-term partisan agenda and result in fewer but \nbetter laws just as James Madison and the other Framers of the \nConstitution intended. Amending the Senate rules should not be a last \nresort, and this move should not be necessary.\n  We have been told the bipartisan child care and development block \ngrant bill will be considered--and is being considered--under an open \namendment process. If that happens, and if that marks the beginning of \na return to regular order where all Senators are allowed to represent \ntheir States to the best of their ability once again, then perhaps this \nmove will not be necessary.\n  Given the record of the past three Congresses, I don't think anybody \nshould hold their breath on that happening.\n  It is a good day in the U.S. Senate that this legislation is being \nconsidered under the process the Senate was set up to perform--to \ndeliberate, offer amendments, and debate.\n  If a fully open amendment process is not permitted after all, and if \nthis rare instance of bipartisanship proves to be an exception to the \nrule, it will prove that the Senate is fundamentally broken and only \nsignificant reforms, such as the Stop Cloture Abuse Resolution, can \nrestore the Senate as the world's greatest deliberative body.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to talk about the \nMedicare Program, which of course, is a lifeline--a guarantee for 50 \nmillion older Americans. In particular what the Senate wants to do is \nmake sure that those older people have access to primary care doctors, \nnurse practitioners, specialists, and other providers in their local \ncommunities because they provide critically needed care to our seniors \nday in and day out.\n  Many of those seniors have no idea that by March 31--just a few weeks \nfrom now--Congress has to act on their behalf to preserve access to the \ncare that seniors depend on. Suffice it to say those providers would \nmuch rather be delivering the care than waiting for this Congress to \nact.\n\n  Now, fortunately, there is a roadmap for getting this done--getting \ngood care to seniors not just for a short period of time but, I say to \nmy colleagues, once and for all. And I wish to this afternoon urge my \ncolleagues to seize this opportunity.\n  Beginning my remarks, I declare I can take little credit for the \nopportunity before us. The path that got us here, that got us started \nin the effort to make the needed reforms to protect our seniors, is a \ndirect result of the leadership of my friend and colleague Senator \nOrrin Hatch. Just as Senator Hatch has done so many times over the \ncourse of an illustrious career, he was key to forging a bipartisan \nsolution to a challenging, longstanding problem.\n  So what I would like to do in the beginning is to recognize that \neffort by Senator Hatch; my predecessor as chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Baucus; House Ways and Means chairman Dave Camp; \nHouse Ways and Means Ranking Member Sander Levin; House Energy and \nCommerce chairman Fred Upton; and House Energy and Commerce Ranking \nMember Henry Waxman. The work they have been doing over the last few \nmonths is exceptional. In effect, they have given us the opportunity to \ntake this flawed system of setting a kind of Medicare budget known as \nSGR--sustainable growth rate--they have given us the opportunity to \nrepeal and replace this flawed system with one that I think is going to \nmake a huge difference in the days ahead by pushing up the goal of \ngood-quality affordable care and doing it in a bipartisan way. I hope \nthese colleagues will take it as a compliment that the SGR bill now \nbefore the Senate incorporates all of that good bipartisan work they \nhave been doing, along with the work that was done on the Senate \nFinance Committee.\n  I see our colleague from North Carolina, who has contributed mightily \nto that effort, as well as, of course, the Presiding Officer of the \nSenate Senator Brown, who has been such an eloquent spokesperson, \nparticularly for those without political power and political clout. I \nthank both of them for their efforts.\n  To be specific, the legislation I introduced last night incorporates \nwhat those six Members agreed to--the six\n\n[[Page S1567]]\n\nMembers I just named, the three Democrats and the three Republicans--in \nS. 2000. In effect, that legislation, along with the health extenders \npassed by the Senate Finance Committee in S. 1871, is essentially what \nwe have the opportunity to move in the days ahead. Every single item in \nthis bill has strong bipartisan support, and I hope we can all come \ntogether and with resounding bipartisan support get this bill passed \nbefore March 31.\n  There are a variety of reasons why Democrats and Republicans, in my \nview, can band together and repeal and replace what I have \ncharacterized as a flawed, really dysfunctional system we have today \nknown as the SGR, but before I go through the list of reasons, I wish \nto make clear to my colleagues--colleagues who know me--that I am \ninterested in sound, sensible policy and that we move in a bipartisan \nway--not politics, not message, but sound policy.\n  That is why I am here on the floor today. I have always tried to make \nit possible for both sides to secure their principles--principles that \nare important to them--and still allow us to go forward in a bipartisan \nand innovative fashion to get things done.\n  I will say to my colleagues, it is not possible any longer to just \nput one patch or another up and say we are going to fix the Medicare \nchallenge. It is not going to work.\n  For the last 10 years Congress has always blocked these cuts. So I \nsay it is time to stop pretending these upcoming cuts--fittingly \nscheduled for April Fools' Day--are any more real than the 16 times the \nCongress has intervened. What we ought to do, I say to my colleagues, \nis stop playing Medicare make believe. It is time to set aside a flawed \nformula that prevents the Congress from really moving ahead \nconstructively on Medicare and to start with a clean slate.\n  I thought the Wall Street Journal editors really summed it up very \nwell on February 19. In talking about the bipartisan bill I laud \ntonight, the editors of the Wall Street Journal said: ``Simply pass the \nbill as is and forgo the pretense of fake-paying for it.'' We need to \nthink about those words. The editors of the Wall Street Journal \nbasically said this is all a bunch of fakery because the cuts aren't \ngoing to be made, the savings aren't going to be realized, because we \nhave tried that route. So the Wall Street Journal said pass this good \nbipartisan bill.\n  If the Congress fails to fully repeal the flawed Medicare payment \nformula now, I believe there will be cuts to other providers--\nhospitals, home health care providers, drug companies, skilled nursing \nfacilities. Make no mistake about it. Those providers are going to be \nthe ones who pay for yet another patch. So a lot of this budget fakery \nisn't real, but the people who are going to pay for the patch are going \nto face very real cuts.\n  In total, the 16 bandaid patches have already cost $150 billion. That \nis the same cost as fully repealing and replacing the flawed SGR plus \ntaking care of the health extenders. Those cuts, as I have indicated, \nhave largely been paid for in the past by cuts to other providers. In \nthe last 2 years alone, the hospitals have been forced to produce \nnearly $30 billion to pay for the temporary patches.\n  Under the status quo, the SGR will always call for cuts that are too \nsteep for providers to bear and Congress will step in with yet another \npatch paid for by still more cuts to other providers. How can we make a \ncase for more of the same, especially when we have an opportunity to \nnot only repeal the flawed formula but also to enact reforms that \nfinally move Medicare away from the flawed fee-for-service approach \nthat rewards quantity instead of quality and value?\n  Second, I offered the Medicare SGR Repeal and Beneficiary Access \nImprovement Act of 2014 in order to eliminate the ongoing threat to our \nseniors and the providers who serve them. Under this legislation, which \nreflects the bipartisan, bicameral legislation Senator Hatch and \nSenator Baucus offered last month, physicians would receive annual \npayment increases of .5 percent for 5 years. The following 5 years \nphysicians would not receive automatic increases but, rather, would be \neligible for payment increases based on performance. Medicare would \ntransition to a new focus--on greater equality, value, and \naccountability.\n  This legislation would strengthen Medicare physician payments in a \nnumber of ways. It would reward the quality of care. It would improve \npayment accuracy. It would expand the coordination of care for patients \nwith chronic care needs. It would encourage participation in \nalternative models of payment.\n  The bill addresses other critical Medicare and Medicaid issues. They \nare known as health care extenders. With these extenders, it would be \npossible for the Congress on a bipartisan basis to ensure that low-\nincome seniors can have affordable Medicare premiums and guarantees \nthat beneficiaries will have access to the therapies they need.\n  Under the bill, rural beneficiaries will have the security of knowing \nthe hospitals and physicians will be there when they need them. I know \nrural health care, for my friend from North Carolina, my friend from \nIowa, and the Senator from Ohio, is a priority. If we pass this bill, \nwhich was put together by the bipartisan group in the House and Senate, \nwe give a big boost for rural health care and the services seniors \ndepend on under Medicare.\n  Finally, something I am especially proud of because Senator Grassley \nwas good enough to work with me for a number of years on it is this \nwould significantly expand Medicare transparency. This legislation \nwould open Medicare's treasure trove of payment data and patients would \nhave the information they need to make informed choices about their \ncare. Researchers and professionals will have the data needed to \ndevelop evidence-based methods. So this afternoon, in addition to \nthanking the colleagues I have already mentioned, I thank Senator \nGrassley for all of those years working with me. Senator Harkin knows \nSenator Grassley has been a strong advocate for transparency in health \ncare and other vital services, and we see his good work in this bill.\n  This bill is bipartisan. It doesn't cut providers or increase cost-\nsharing for seniors. I defer to my colleagues to decide if it is better \nto offset the costs of SGR repeal by reducing future war spending or \nunpaid for, but the bottom line is the same: We ought to act now. We \nshould act now and put this flawed formula known as the SGR, which has \nproduced Medicare migraines for frustrated providers and seniors alike, \nbehind us.\n  Every single thing in the bill I offer today has strong bipartisan \nsupport, and it represents a compromise.\n  I know this isn't an easy vote for colleagues on either side of the \naisle, but I submit that it sure means we will be able to accomplish \nwhat we were sent here to do--to find a way to do what is best for \nseniors and the doctors who care for them. With that clean slate--and I \nhave enjoyed talking to the Presiding Officer about this because I \nthink what this bill is all about is doing what is right for seniors, \ndoing what is right for the doctors, setting in place a plan for the \nfuture that ensures seniors are going to get better care that in many \ninstances will cost less. That is what I hope Senators will take home \nafter we break tomorrow for the work period.\n  This is a chance to do what is best for seniors, what is best for \ndoctors, and what is going to pay off for taxpayers in the long run.\n  Nobody wins with Medicare make believe. After these 16 patches, when \nwe have the Wall Street Journal editors joining with seniors and \nproviders and we have a bill that has strong bipartisan support, I \nthink this is the kind of measure Senators ought to flock to.\n  I will close by saying we all know the public is frustrated with a \nfair amount of what happens in the Congress, and there is a fair level \nof disappointment. The Senator from North Carolina and I were talking \nabout a variety of issues on this point this morning. But I look around \nthis Chamber and I see Senators who have spent a significant amount of \ntime in public life, and a number of colleagues who are on the floor, I \nam old enough to remember joining them in the other body before we came \nto the Senate, and we are here for a purpose. We are here to get things \ndone. On this Medicare issue, which suffice it to say has been one of \nthe most polarizing in the American public debate--in fact, I would \nventure to say that on the domestic side of the budget, there are few \nissues that have been\n\n[[Page S1568]]\n\nas divisive and polarizing as Medicare--this is an opportunity, \ncolleagues, to check the partisanship at the door, come together, and \nset in place a new system of paying providers under Medicare that is \ngoing to produce better quality at lower costs. We ought to support it \nin a bipartisan manner.\n\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal).

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss one of the most \nconcerning issues our country faces today, an issue that Chairman \nHarkin particularly has been outspoken on, and that is the growing \nretirement crisis.\n  A couple weeks ago I chaired in the Finance Committee the first \ncongressional hearing on the MyRA retirement plan for low- and middle-\nincome workers that President Obama proposed in his 2014 State of the \nUnion Address. We will explore some of the issues, especially the \nHarkin legislation, later. But I want to talk for a moment about that \nhearing.\n  We know for many Americans, the traditional three-legged retirement \nsystem--Social Security, defined pension benefit, and personal \nretirement savings--that three-legged stool is simply no longer \nworking. For many, two of those legs are gone, and the third leg--the \nSocial Security monthly payment for low-income workers--is, frankly, \nway too short.\n  We know that Social Security remains the safeguard of retirement \nsecurity for working-class families. But, as I said, it was never meant \nto be the only method of saving for retirement.\n  As we emerge from the greatest recession since the Great Depression, \nthe private retirement system is not working.\n  Over the last 30 years, the defined pension benefit has, for far too \nmany people, disappeared. The new system of tax incentives for 401(k)s \nand IRAs only works if you are middle income, typically, or wealthier. \nThe top fifth--the top quintile, if you will--of households hold three-\nquarters of all 401(k) and IRA assets. The average worker nearing \nretirement--believe this--has $12,000 in savings.\n  So the question our subcommittee asked was: What do we do?\n  One point of bipartisan agreement is that Social Security works. \nWitnesses from Vanguard to senior advocates agree on that point. We \nheard testimony from the left and from the right, from the private \nsector and from the Treasury Department. Everyone agreed that for low-\nincome workers, Social Security is the most important and the most \nreliable way to guarantee a secure retirement. But it is not enough.\n  An upper income worker, once receiving Social Security, may get as \nmuch as $2,000 or more a month in Social Security earned benefits, \nwhile a low-income worker, who is used to receiving $9 or $10 or $11 an \nhour or less--even though working as many as 25 or 30 years--may get \nless than $1,000 a month in Social Security. That is the only wealth, \nthat is the only income, so often, those in the bottom half have.\n  The only question, obviously, is whether the benefit is adequate. Too \noften it is not.\n  Two-thirds of low-income families are at risk of not having enough \nincome to maintain anything close to their standard of living in \nretirement. Expanding Social Security could be the difference between a \nmodest retirement--an earned modest retirement--and living in poverty.\n  The hearing discussed the administration's new MyRA accounts. \n``MyRA'' stands for ``my retirement account''--a play, obviously, on \nthe words of the IRA, the individual retirement account. It represents \na small but important first step. Access to tax preferenced retirement \naccounts must not be something workers receive when they cross the \nthreshold into the middle class but a tool that helps them start their \njourney into the middle class.\n  There is no easy fix to retirement savings. But in a system where we \nprimarily administer our programs to encourage private retirement \naccounts through the Tax Code, we need to make sure the incentives are \ngoing to the people who need them.\n  So what we are doing through the Tax Code, as Senator Cardin from \nMaryland, who has been a long-time advocate of stronger, better \nretirement security for seniors--and he attended our subcommittee \nhearing; he is a member of the Finance Committee--are the issues we \nneed to work on.\n  When President Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act, he said: \n``This law represents a cornerstone in a structure which is being \nbuilt, but is by no means complete.''\n  The same could be said, maybe even more so, for our retirement system \ntoday. That structure is still being built. It is up to this body to \nensure that it is built, that it does not collapse in the meantime, and \nthat we can bring more retirement security to far more Americans who \nhave worked their entire work lives.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 2818\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, we have had a very productive day on the \nchild care and development block grant bill, and we have processed a \nnumber of amendments, some by voice, some with record votes. All \nMembers have had the opportunity to come to the floor during the day \nand offer their amendments, and we continue to have amendments that are \neither filed or talked about. It is still the intent of Senator Harkin, \nSenator Alexander, Senator Mikulski, and myself that we finish this \nbill tomorrow afternoon. We see no reason why we can't do it with the \nlevel of cooperation all Members have shown.\n  Let me try to sketch out for my colleagues what our intent will be. \nWe intend hopefully to go to a period of morning business, a length to \nbe determined by the leaders, when we conclude our remarks. At some \npoint in the morning, probably 10:30, we would resume consideration of \namendments and we would process those amendments until shortly before \nlunch. It is our hope Members would take the opportunity to file those \namendments tonight so that our staffs can work with them to make sure \nas many amendments as possible can be adopted with the support of both \nsides of the aisle.\n  We certainly can't force everybody to do so, but I implore Members on \nboth sides of the aisle, file those amendments tonight, work with our \nstaffs.\n\n[[Page S1570]]\n\nThey will be here as late as they need to be. By 10:30 tomorrow morning \nwe should be able to move to amendments, have debate on those where \nthere is additional debate needed; hopefully, start any votes by 12:15 \nand finish the amendment process before both sides break for lunch. It \nwould be my hope we could come back right after lunch, with the leader \nagreements, and have passage on the child care and development block \ngrant bill.\n  Let me just say, Mr. President, that I want to thank Chairman Harkin, \nRanking Member Alexander and Senator Mikulski. I think we have gone \ninto this and we have tried to urge our colleagues, if they can make \nthis bill better, to come to the floor and to do that. I think we have \nseen, by the action of people who have done this in a responsible way, \nthat we have worked in a bipartisan way to make sure we could present \nto the Members of the Senate amendments that didn't cause a great deal \nof concern, and, in fact, they did improve the bill.\n  So I encourage my colleagues to file those amendments tonight, to be \nprepared to finish this bill before the middle of the afternoon \ntomorrow, and we can expect to have a successful passage of this bill.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. First, Mr. President, I concur in everything the Senator \nfrom North Carolina just said. This is a very good bill. It is a great \nbill. The Senator from North Carolina has put a lot into this bill over \nthe last couple of years, and we are close to seeing the finish line. \nSo I hope Senators and their staffs who may not be present but who are \nwatching will do just as the Senator suggested. If they have \namendments, get them over to the floor tonight during morning business; \nwe will take those up, our staffs can work those out, and, hopefully, \nwe will be on track to finish the bill tomorrow.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from North Carolina for all the hard work \nhe has put in over a long period of time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider \nthe Landrieu amendment No. 2818 be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nbipartisan Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2014. I thank \nSenator Mikulski for her great leadership, Senator Burr for his \nleadership, and Senators Harkin and Alexander. We have had a great \nafternoon.\n  We also had a number of people confirmed today, which I am very \npleased about, including the Ambassador to Canada. I think it is pretty \nimportant we have an ambassador to Canada because Canada is our biggest \ntrading partner. We haven't had one now for months, and this is a very \ngood outcome.\n  But back to the bill. It has been almost 20 years since the Senate \nlast reauthorized CCDBG. Since that time we have learned if we want \nstrong communities, a robust workforce, and students who are ahead of \nthe curve, we need to ensure that every child has access to high-\nquality childcare.\n  As the country's primary Federal childcare program, CCDBG provides \nmillions of families with the assistance they need to ensure working \nparents can keep their jobs or finish schooling knowing their children \nare safe and receiving quality care. We know that a child's early years \nare critical to building a strong foundation for their lives. Up to 90 \npercent of brain development happens before age 5. Just think about \nthat: 90 percent of brain development happens before age 5. That is why \nit is so important to invest in quality care and education. When we do, \nit pays off for the rest of us by giving us better informed citizens \nand a more productive workforce.\n  Investments in the Child Care and Development Block Grant Program \nalso give parents the option of affordable childcare. Research \nindicates that higher childcare costs have a negative impact on a \nmother's employment because women are more likely to leave their jobs \nwhen childcare costs are high. That can have a lasting negative impact \non families' finances and women's future earnings.\n  As the Senate chair of the Joint Economic Committee, I released a \nreport last year that looked at the critical role mothers play in the \nfinancial well-being of their families. My report found that lower \nincome families are especially dependent on the money earned by mothers \nwho work outside the home. In families in the lowest 10 percent of the \nincome distribution, mothers account for over half of family income. \nThe high price of childcare these days--it averages over $14,000 each \nyear for two children--means the child care and development block grant \nassistance makes a big difference between families rising into the \nmiddle class or falling further behind.\n  Working families across the country are counting on us to get this \ndone. Since the child care and development block grant was last \nreauthorized in 1996, families have seen the cost of childcare increase \nwhile access to quality care has become more difficult to find.\n  This bipartisan legislation would provide the opportunity for \nCongress to make critical improvements to the Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant Program to ensure that children are safe and \nhealthy in their childcare setting, that families have access to \nquality programs, and that States have a coordinated system of early \ncare and education for children from birth to age 13.\n  One of the primary updates in the 2014 reauthorization is the \nrequirement that all childcare providers receiving this assistance must \ngo through comprehensive background checks. It is unbelievable that \ncurrently only 13 States require comprehensive background checks for \nchildcare providers. We have had a number of incidents in our State \nwhere children have had tragic injuries and tragic ends because of the \nlack of background checks. As a former prosecutor, I saw firsthand how \nabuse harmed young children, tore families apart, and challenged local \nlaw enforcement agencies, our court system, and our social service and \nhealth care providers. Our kids deserve better. We need to do \neverything we can to make sure people caring for our kids undergo \ncomprehensive background checks before receiving child care and \ndevelopment block grants.\n  The bill also requires States to conduct regular health and safety \ninspections of the childcare settings so we can make sure kids are \nlearning and developing in safe environments.\n  The legislation cuts redtape by giving families more flexibility \naround enrollment procedures.\n  These changes will not only strengthen the program's integrity but \nalso improve transparency so that the 1.5 million children being served \nthrough this program every month get the best care possible.\n  Raising the next generation has always been a difficult job, and it \nhas never been more expensive. The future of our Nation rests on making \nsure parents have the support they need to give their children a strong \nstart.\n  I urge the Senate to reauthorize this bipartisan bill and ensure \nchildren and working families get the quality care and education they \nneed to thrive. It is the best investment we can make.\n  I see the Senator from North Carolina Mr. Burr just came in. I thank \nhim for his great work not only on this bill but also in allowing for \nthis amendment process, which I believe is very important for the \nfuture of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I wish to talk about two amendments I will \ncall up on S. 1086, the child care and development block grant bill. \nThe first one I will speak to is amendment No.\n\n[[Page S1571]]\n\n2834, which Senator Murkowski and I are offering in relation to tribal \nchildcare facilities.\n  As my colleagues know, I recently took over as chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Indian Affairs, and 2 weeks ago I held my first hearing. \nThis hearing focused on early childhood development and education in \nIndian Country. This hearing was timely, as some of the testimony the \ncommittee received related to the child care and development block \ngrant. At that hearing a childcare program director from the White \nEarth Nation--who is also the chair of the National Indian Child Care \nAssociation--testified about the needs of her program and the needs of \nall Indian childcare providers. One of the needs she highlighted was \nimproving the condition of tribal childcare facilities in Indian \nCountry.\n  According to the Administration for Children and Families, of the 260 \nIndian tribe or tribal organizations that receive CCDBG funds, only 14 \nof them constructed new tribal childcare facilities in the last 10 \nyears.\n  In an effort to improve and replace facilities, my amendment allows \ntribes more flexibility in the use of their grant funds. Renovation and \nconstruction of tribal facilities is already an allowable activity \nunder this legislation, but the law explicitly states that Indian \ntribes or tribal organizations cannot reduce services--even \ntemporarily--to improve or replace their facilities.\n  This amendment allows the Secretary to grant a waiver to an Indian \ntribe or tribal organization, permitting them to temporarily reduce \nservices if they can prove the outcome will improve capacity or improve \nservices as a result of the construction. It is a simple, commonsense \namendment that will improve the quality of life in Indian Country, and \nI urge its adoption when it comes up.\n  I will now speak to amendment No. 2835. Under current law, a parent \nwho suffers the tragedy of the death of a child has to rely on their \nemployer's compassion for time off to grieve. Many times this is not an \nissue. There are thousands of compassionate employers out there who \ngive parents the space they need. But not everyone is so fortunate. \nSome folks who just aren't ready to come back after a few days end up \nhaving to choose between returning to work while struggling with the \naftermath of their child's death or losing their job.\n  This amendment would fix the Family and Medical Leave Act to include \nthe death of a child as a trigger for benefits provided under the FMLA. \nThe FMLA currently allows parents to take time off to care for a child \nbattling a serious health issue. But children between the ages of 1 and \n14 are more than twice as likely to die suddenly from an accident than \nfrom cancer, flu, and pneumonia combined.\n  The FMLA protects parents who are caring for their children; it \nshould support parents who are grieving for their children as well. \nThis is a small amendment, but it will mean so much to parents who \nsuffer the unimaginable loss of a child. I urge my colleagues to stand \nfor compassion, and I urge adoption of this amendment when it is \nbrought up.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise somewhat reluctantly today to \nspeak about an intelligence committee matter.\n  Allegations in the past 24 hours have been discussed rampantly in the \nhalls of Congress and in the press. Based on press reports today, \nyesterday, and even last week, allegations have been made regarding the \nCentral Intelligence Agency's actions toward the committee, as well as \nstaff and Members' actions on the Senate intelligence committee toward \nthe CIA.\n  The reason I feel compelled to speak on this matter is the following: \nAlthough people speak as though we know all of the pertinent facts \nsurrounding this matter, the truth is we do not. The Republican \ncommittee members on the Senate intelligence committee and staff were \nnot involved in the underlying investigation of the detainee and \ninterrogation report. We do not know the actual facts concerning the \nCIA's alleged actions or all of the specific details about the actions \nby the committee staff regarding the draft of what is now referred to \nas the ``Panetta internal review document.''\n  Both parties involved have made allegations against one another and \nhave even speculated as to each other's actions, but there are still a \nlot of unanswered questions that must be addressed. No forensics have \nbeen run on the CIA computers--or, as my colleagues refer to them, \n``the SSCI computers''--at the CIA facility to know what actually \nhappened regarding the alleged CIA search or the circumstances under \nwhich the committee came into possession of the Panetta internal review \ndocument.\n  Given that both of these matters have now been referred to the \nDepartment of Justice, it may take us a while before any accurate \nfactual findings can be reached and a satisfactory resolution of these \nmatters can be achieved. It may even call for a special investigator to \nbe named to review the entire factual situation. Eventually, we will \nget to the bottom of this, but today I cannot make a statement that \nwill reflect what actually occurred and therefore what recommendations \nwe ought to make as we move forward.\n  Right now our committee members are conducting an internal assessment \nof the facts and circumstances involved in both of these matters. This \nwill be an ongoing process which should not be described or discussed \nin the public domain but, like all other intelligence committee \nmatters, should remain within the purview of the confines of the \nintelligence committee.\n  Today I simply wanted everyone to know where I stand on this matter \nand how we need to get to the ground truth of these very important \nmatters.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Casey are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, we know it is well past time--and that is \nan understatement--to take up the reauthorization of this important \nlegislation, the Child Care and Development Block Grant Program, which \nhas not been reauthorized since 1996. It is hard to comprehend that, \nbut that is true.\n  In the nearly two decades since, our understanding of early childhood \ndevelopment and the importance of high-quality childcare in early \nlearning has expanded dramatically. Investing in high-quality early \nlearning opportunities, such as childcare and prekindergarten, sets \nchildren on the path to success.\n  I like to say if children learn more now, they will earn more later, \nand that is why there is a direct nexus with the quality of the \nchildcare we provide. The quality of early learning connects directly \nwith our economic growth.\n  Our gross domestic product--our future economic growth and success as \na country--is substantially dependent on the quality of early learning \nand the quality of childcare. It is good we are focused in a bipartisan \nway on the childcare aspects of this challenge.\n  We must update the Federal standards that relate to childcare to \nensure that the Federal Government is supporting high-quality \nchildcare--not just any quality childcare--for low-income children.\n  The bill we are considering sets a new standard for childcare in \nAmerica. It makes sure Federal dollars are going to providers who are \ncommitted to providing childcare that meets certain criteria, such as \nhealth and safety standards.\n  Many of these changes reflect proposals I put forth in previous \nCongresses to improve the child care and development block grant. The \nStarting Early Starting Right Act was legislation I introduced.\n  I am encouraged we are able to reach consensus on many of the \nprovisions I supported in the past and that they are represented in \nthis bill. I, and I know many others, would have liked to have gone \nfurther to provide more of an investment both by way of dollars and\n\n[[Page S1572]]\n\nmore of an investment by way of quality, but these are significant \nchanges and we should all support them.\n  In terms of the increase in incentives that I would hope we can do at \na future date, I described them in this way: incentives for States to \ninvest in quality ratings and improvement systems. We know a lot of \nacronyms. This is QRIS, Quality Rating and Improvement Systems, which \nencourages childcare providers to make continuous improvements in the \ncare they provide and the facilities they use often through financial \nincentives, such as higher reimbursement rates, when a certain quality \nlevel is reached.\n  However, I still believe the bill we have in front of us represents a \nsubstantial and significant improvement over the current law. We owe \nour most vulnerable children nothing less.\n  For the first time we are requiring all States to develop a robust \nhealth and safety set of standards and to institute a consistent \nbackground check for childcare providers. We are requiring States to \nformally coordinate their early learning programs to improve service \ncoordination and delivery. We are allowing children who qualify for a \nsubsidy to receive 1 year of care before their eligibility is \nredetermined. This will help promote stability and continuity for the \nentire family and encourage the child to develop strong relationships \nwith his or her teachers and peers in childcare.\n  Finally, we are increasing the investment in quality from the 4-\npercent quality set-aside per year--currently required in law--to 10-\npercent within 5 years, including a separate set-aside for infants and \ntoddlers. Quality is a continuum and continual investment. It is not a \none-time purchase. It is something we need to support and sustain.\n  This bill is about investing in our children's future and supporting \nworking parents. I urge all of my colleagues to join us in supporting \nthe CCBDG reauthorization--a nice acronym for a long bill.\n  I mentioned earlier that if children get quality early care and \nlearning, they will learn more now and earn more later when they are in \nthe workforce. There is no question about that. All the studies \nindicate that. We know that. There is no disagreement about that.\n  We also have to recognize that there are so many families--somewhere \nin the millions--that have two parents working, and we know the stress \nand challenge that creates. In addition, we have just come through the \nworst economic downturn since the 1930s. Climbing out of that hole and \nhaving all of the economic pressures on these families, they are often \nalso heavily burdened or even crushed by the cost of childcare.\n  We have an opportunity with this legislation to move forward and make \nneeded changes on issues, such as health and safety standards and \nmaking sure we are setting aside more dollars for infants and toddlers.\n  There are a whole range of actions we are taking, but we still have a \nways to go to speak directly to the needs that working families have in \nterms of the cost of childcare and ensuring the kind of quality they \nhave a right to expect.\n  Finally, on a related topic, we need to make sure we are making a \nnational and substantial commitment to early learning. The President \nhas talked about this issue. People from both parties and CEOs tell us \nabout it all the time. We need to get together on these other issues \neven as we pass this bipartisan legislation.\n  I wish to commend the work of Senator Harkin and Ranking Member \nAlexander, who are working to get this done, and the good work over \nseveral years now done by Senator Mikulski and Senator Burr.\n  We need to get this done and then get to work on some of the \nchildcare and early learning challenges our country faces and families \nare often burdened with.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/12/senate-section/article/S1572-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. CASEY.

Mr. President, throughout this year, my home State will \ncelebrate the 150th anniversary of its path to Statehood, on October \n31, 1864.\n  Next week, while I will be home visiting my family and constituents, \nthe Battle Born State will celebrate the day that Congress passed and \nPresident Abraham Lincoln signed legislation paving the way for Nevada \nto become the 36th State. At that time Congress was in a rush to \nwelcome Nevada into the Union. It was during the Civil War; it was \nraging.\n  The only other State admitted to the Union during the war was West \nVirginia, which seceded from Virginia to remain part of the Union in \n1863.\n  Congress didn't want to wait until the next session to admit another \nnew State--a new State that could swing the Presidential election in \nLincoln's favor and provide crucial votes for the 13th Amendment, which \nabolished slavery. Nevadans had already rejected one proposed State \nconstitution, so there was no time to waste.\n  On March 21, 1864, in the waning hours of the 38th Congress, a law \nwas passed allowing Nevada to enter the Union whenever voters finally \npassed and President Lincoln approved a State constitution.\n  It wasn't during the normal course of business, but this wasn't the \nnormal course with the Civil War going on. Typically Congress would get \nthe final word on admission of a new State to the Union.\n  But these, as I have indicated, were certainly not normal times. Even \ntoday we acknowledge Nevada's unique path to Statehood on our State \nflag with the words: ``Battle Born.''\n  Throughout this year, we will celebrate Nevada's 150th birthday with \nevents in every corner of the State. From my hometown of Searchlight to \nVirginia City to Elko, there is a 150th anniversary event to match \nevery interest.\n  Nevada is a very large State. Area wide it is the seventh largest in \nthe country. It is a unique State with more mountains than any place \nother than Alaska. We have 314 separate mountain ranges. We have one \nmountain that is 14,000 feet high. We have 32 mountains over 11,000 \nfeet high. We have wide-ranging land, and we have some of the coldest \nplaces in the Nation and some of the hottest places in the Nation.\n  We have all kinds of wildlife. Theodore Roosevelt created an antelope \nrange that is large and sparsely populated. We have not only the \nantelope, we also have desert bighorn sheep. In Nevada we have mountain \ngoats; we have almost 3 million acres of wilderness. It is a very \nbeautiful State. It is more than the bright lights of Las Vegas, Reno, \nand Lake Tahoe--even though we are very proud of sharing the \nstewardship of Lake Tahoe with the State of California--as Mark Twain \nsaid: ``the fairest picture the whole earth affords.''\n  We will mark Nevada's second constitutional convention, the day \nNevada voters finally approved its constitution and the day, Halloween, \nOctober 31, 1864, that Lincoln proclaimed Nevada's Statehood. The 150th \nanniversary of our admission to the Union provides a wonderful \nopportunity to study Nevada's history. It is also the birthday of my \nyoung brother, so it is easy to remember--admission day, Halloween, and \nmy brother's birthday all occurred the same day.\n  It is also a chance to reflect on Nevada's unique pioneer spirit--a \nspirit that continues to make our State very special.\n  Mr. HELLER. Madam President, I rise to recognize the great State of \nNevada, as we celebrate 150 years of statehood. It is a remarkable \nopportunity to speak on the floor of this Chamber about this milestone, \ngiven the role the Congress played in the formation of the Silver \nState. The movement to make the Nevada Territory a State began within \nthe territory, but the first attempt to formulate a Constitution \nfailed.\n  Shortly after, the 38th Congress passed an enabling act for Nevada \nstatehood. Signed by President Abraham Lincoln on March 21, 1864, this \nbill\n\n[[Page S1573]]\n\nmade it possible for Nevada to eventually adopt a State constitution. \nLincoln proclaimed Nevada a State on October 31, 1864.\n  The guarantee of statehood was given to us by Abraham Lincoln, who, \nwithout assistance, would go on to pass the 13th amendment, win the \nCivil War, and heal our broken Nation.\n  Marking the 150th year of Nevada's statehood takes me back to Carson \nCity when I was just 4 years old. It was Nevada's centennial \ncelebration, the date was October 31, 1964. I remember being with my \nfamily, sitting on the lawn, listening to the Carson City Municipal \nBand lead the festivities at the State capitol.\n  During that same year, 1964, Lyndon Johnson was reelected over Barry \nGoldwater and would go on to declare a war on poverty. In 1964, race \nriots broke out in Harlem. Across the Nation, President Johnson signed \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964 into law. The 24th amendment to abolish \nthe use of poll taxes was ratified. In 1964, the Summer Olympics were \nheld in Tokyo, Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, which \nultimately allowed for increased military action in Vietnam. The James \nBond film ``Goldfinger'' began its run in the United States and \n``Bewitched'' premiered on television.\n  So much has changed in these past 50 years, but the character of \nNevada has not. From its first birthday to its 100th, to its 150th, \nNevada continues to be shaped by its people, people who are \nentrepreneurial, fiercely independent, and as diverse as our terrain. \nWe are molded by the grit, hard work, and pioneering spirit of \nindividuals determined to succeed.\n  The list of men and women who have molded our State is long. Where \nsome saw impossibility, a Nevada Senator by the name of Newlands saw \nopportunity. To this day, his legacy lives on in the hay, the cattle, \nand the very fields that were made possible by the waters he brought to \nthis desert.\n  Standing among our Nation's great, frozen in bronze, greeting \nvisitors to the Nation's Capitol is another Nevadan, Sarah Winnemucca. \nShe, similar to many Nevadans, challenged the status quo. She refused \nto accept the injustices brought on her Native American brothers and \nsisters.\n  Instead of fighting with a weapon, she fought with her pen. Through \nher words, the plight of our fellow Americans living on reservations \nwas heard.\n  Of course, in Nevada, Mark Twain was born. Samuel Clemens adopted the \nfamous pen name while covering the news for the Enterprise in Virginia \nCity. Twain wrote eloquently about Nevada, from the rough-and-tumble \nattitude of the Wild West to the beauty of Lake Tahoe, dubbing it \n``surely the fairest picture that the whole earth affords.'' Any \nvisitor to this pristine landscape would also agree.\n  More recently, I think of Paul Laxalt, the former Lieutenant \nGovernor, Governor, and U.S. Senator from Nevada. Among other things, \nhe was instrumental in preserving Lake Tahoe and establishing our \nState's first community colleges and our medical school; or former \nRepresentative Barbara Vucanovich, who will be recorded in the history \nbooks as the first woman to represent Nevada in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. This alone is a remarkable achievement, but the \nintegrity and determination with which she fulfilled her duties makes \nher achievement even grander.\n  Former State Senator Bill Raggio also comes to mind. He was a true \nstatesman and the longest serving member in the history of the Nevada \nState Senate. These individuals have left their mark, but it is the \npeople of Nevada who have forged the Silver State.\n  During the formation of our State's constitution, Nevadans demanded \nthat our State's mothers and sisters be heard. The women of Nevada were \ngranted the voice of a vote before the 19th Amendment was ratified by \nour Nation. We helped pioneer the vote for all.\n  During World War II, when our brave soldiers fought for peace and \nprosperity, Nevadans who were not able to fight abroad brought forth \nminerals such as magnesium from the ground. Magnesium, harvested near \nthe township of Henderson, was considered a miracle metal for the \nmunitions and airport parts which would help lead to us victory.\n  The residents of Boulder City built the Hoover Dam, a government \ninfrastructure project which holds back 26 million acre-feet of water. \nThe dam was completed early and under budget. With an expected 2,000-\nyear lifespan, the Hoover Dam supplies clean energy to the grid, water \nto thirsty cities across the Southwest, and protection to downstream \ncommunities.\n  Ever since we were borne into the battle to mend our broken Nation, \nNevadans have been willing and able. Although our population is small, \nour caliber is high. From all walks of life, brave Nevadans have heard \nand responded to the call to arms. At Naval Air Station Fallon, we host \nthe Navy's top gun school. The elite men and women of our Armed Forces \nwho train here push the limit, compete, and set the tone for global air \nsuperiority.\n  Welcoming tourists from across the globe, farming, mining, \nengineering, ranching, and serving in the Armed Forces, these are just \na few things we Nevadans do. And as our State motto goes, all of these \nare done ``all for our country.''\n  Recent times have been tough in Nevada, but our pioneer spirit lives \non. We continue to move forward. We have seen the booms and now, more \nthan most, we continue to feel the most recent bust. Like many in our \ngreat Nation, Nevadans have lost homes, livelihoods, and the promise of \na steady paycheck, but this will not deter us. Our State is battle \nborn. We will continue to fulfill our 150-year-old promise of being \nwilling and able to give all for our country.\n  I am a proud Nevadan, and as the son of a auto mechanic from Carson \nCity, it is a privilege to stand on this Senate floor to recognize our \nState's 150 years of Statehood.\n  Before I close, I thank Lieutenant Governor Brian Krolicki, chair of \nthe Nevada Sesquicentennial Commission, for the hard work he has put \ninto recognizing this important milestone. Over the course of this \nyear, the commission has planned and overseen many events and \nactivities, providing Nevadans an opportunity to reflect on where we \nhave been and where we are going.\n\n\n                                 Syria\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise tonight to talk about Syria and the \nhumanitarian crisis this conflict has created. This week we mark a very \ngrim anniversary: the third anniversary of the beginning of the \nconflict in Syria. So we are entering our fourth year.\n  There is much to cover and talk about. I will be brief tonight, but \nit is important that we don't forget what is happening to the Syrian \npeople and especially to the children in Syria.\n  Over the past 3 years the brutal Assad regime has unleashed a \ncampaign of unspeakable violence against its own citizens, with 9.5 \nmillion people now needing humanitarian assistance in Syria. Syria's \nneighbors are overflowing with 2.5 million refugees. This week Amnesty \nInternational and Save The Children released reports that underscore \nthe atrocities the Syrian people have suffered and continue to suffer. \nThese reports describe the regime's use of starvation tactics against \nits own citizens: Syrian children dying from preventable diseases and \nnewborns, newborn babies freezing to death in underequipped hospitals. \nUNICEF reported this week that Syria is now one of the most dangerous \nplaces on Earth to be a child.\n\n  These unspeakable horrors confirm my worst fear about the conflict: \nthat the most vulnerable and innocent are at the center of President \nAssad's siege against his own people.\n  I want to share the story of a 10-year-old Syrian boy when he \nrecounted his experience with the conflict, this 10-year-old boy in his \naccount from Save The Children's 2012 report entitled ``Untold \nAtrocities, The Stories of Syria's Children.'' Here is one of the \nstories in his own words:\n\n       When the shells started to fall I ran. I ran so fast. I ran \n     and I cried at the same time. When we were being bombed we \n     had nothing. No food, no water, no toys, nothing. There was \n     noway to buy food--the markets and shops were bombed out. \n     After that we came back home. To make our food last we ate \n     just once a day. My father went without food for days because \n     there wasn't enough. I remember watching him tie his stomach \n     with a rope so he would not feel hungry. One day men with \n     guns broke into our house. They pulled out our food, threw it \n     on the floor, stamped on it, so it would be too dirty to eat. \n     Then we had nothing at all.\n\n\n[[Page S1574]]\n\n\n  That is the recollection of a 10-year-old boy in Syria. And you go \nthrough the report, the catalog, really, of misery that was compiled by \nSave the Children from young boys and young girls of all different ages \nand every one of them has a tale of horror just as he outlined. Some \nare worse and more graphic than what I read.\n  This most recent report by Save the Children is entitled ``A \nDevastating Toll,'' and it describes the impact this conflict has had \non children in great detail.\n  I commend the report to my colleagues.\n  In an article in the New York Times, in this case by Nicholas \nKristof, he said, ``Syria is today the world capital of human \nsuffering.''\n  Anyone who knows the work done by Nicholas Kristof knows he has seen \na lot of places in the world where there is terrible misery and \nsuffering. So for him to say that is a substantial indication of how \nbad the conditions are in Syria. Of course, when he made that statement \nit was back in September, many months ago. As bad as it was then, it is \neven worse now.\n  So today I call on all Senators, both parties, and the international \ncommunity to support the efforts to bring this terrible chapter in \nSyrian history to a close. Peace talks could be a way to end the \nconflict. However, I am disappointed that the talks this past month did \nnot lead to any tangible progress. The Assad regime has refused to \nnegotiate in good faith.\n  Diplomacy is part of the solution, but what we need now is to change \nthe momentum on the ground. Peace talks and diplomacy are fine, but \nunless something changes on the ground, unless we can take some action \nor take a series of steps to affect what is happening on the ground, \nall the talks in the world will be to no avail.\n  The Assad regime and their supporters calculate that they can defeat \nthe opposition and remain in power. The United States should be working \nwith our international partners to tip the balance in favor of the \nopposition. If we do, not another round of talks will yield the same \nresult: No change.\n  The international community took a good step in ushering in the \npassage of U.N. Security Resolution 2139 on February 22. With U.S. \nleadership, Russia and China--which have obstructed other such \nresolutions--finally joined the international community in demanding an \nend to attacks on civilians and that the Syrian regime facilitate \nhumanitarian aid to the besieged areas.\n  U.N. Security Council Resolution 2129 also condemned detention of \njournalists. We do not talk enough about this issue. Both international \nand Syrian journalists have bravely gone into areas of Syria that many \nother noncombatants would not dare, and many have paid the ultimate \nprice. So far 60 journalists have reportedly been killed inside Syria. \nThese courageous individuals have given us a window into the \ndevastation inside of Syria.\n  I know myself from reading news reports or columns by journalists in \nthis country how much information we can glean from what is happening \ninside the country where very few people can go to get information. So \nwe need to focus on that aspect of the problem in the crisis as well.\n  But we shouldn't allow this crisis to continue worsening before our \neyes. We need to act. I have been working on a bipartisan basis to put \nlegislation and legislative support behind efforts to bring this \nconflict to an end.\n  In 2012 I worked with Senator Rubio to introduce S. Res. 370, which \ncalled for democratic change in Syria, and S. 3498, the Syrian \nHumanitarian Support and Democratic Transition Assistance Act of 2012. \nIn 2013 I traveled to Turkey where I met with opposition political and \nmilitary leaders to discuss the situation inside of Syria. They asked \nfor aid to help build the capacity of the political opposition as well \nas support to the military opposition in the form of communications \ngear, night vision goggles, and bulletproof vests.\n  A year ago Senator Rubio and I proudly introduced S. 617, Syria \nDemocratic Transition Act of 2013. This bill would, among other things, \nfirst increase U.S. assistance to victims of the conflict, both inside \nof Syria and outside of the country; No. 2, support a political \ntransition by authorizing bilateral assistance to build the capacity of \nthe moderate political opposition to prepare for a transition; No. 3, \nprovide nonlethal equipment to vetted elements of the armed opposition; \nand fourth, expand sanctions against the Central Bank of Syria and \ndesignated individuals, especially any foreign entities that continue \nto do business with the Assad regime.\n  After picking up 10 bipartisan cosponsors to our bill, we worked to \nensure that the important aspects of S. 617 was incorporated into \nanother bill, S. 960, the Syria Transition Support Act, which then \npassed the Foreign Relations Committee in a substantial bipartisan \nmanner last year, last summer.\n  I sent a letter to Secretary Kerry earlier this year urging him to \nresume nonlethal aid in order to help bolster the opposition before the \ntalks in Switzerland. I was pleased to see that aid resumed not long \nafter I sent the letter. We know Senators Kaine and Rubio are working \non many of the principles that I and others have been pushing for the \npast 3 years, reiterating the need for unfettered international aid for \nthose in need in Syria and the surrounding region, emphasizing the \nneutrality of medical professionals and aid providers working inside \nSyria. Their legislation would support civilians who have suffered \nduring this conflict, particularly women and children. I commend \nSenators Kaine and Rubio for their leadership on this resolution. I \nintend to support this resolution when it is introduced and I urge all \nmy colleagues to do the same.\n  I believe we can agree on a bipartisan basis that this kind of \nhorrific human suffering is both unconscionable and unacceptable, and \nwe have a national security interest in ending this conflict and \ncountering the influence of Iran and Hezbollah in the region. It is one \nof the reasons it is in our direct national security interests to make \nsure we play a substantial role in ending the conflict. Every day the \nconflict goes on the regime in Iran strengthens to export terrorism and \nall the trouble the regime imposes upon the region, and secondly, \nHezbollah and other extremist elements are empowered the longer the \nconflict goes.\n  We need to send a clear message from the Senate that we support \nefforts to bring Assad's tyrannical rule to an end and to respond to \nthis devastating humanitarian crisis which threatens to destabilize the \nregion and scar a generation of young Syrians.\n  When we talk about this, we are talking now about millions of \nchildren--by one estimate 5.5 million children--being adversely \nimpacted. Thousands--by one estimate more than 10,000--of those \nchildren have already been killed. And the ones who have not been \nkilled have seen the kinds of horrors no human being should ever see, \neven as adults. It would be very difficult to recover from some of the \nhorror and some of the trauma these children have seen. It will be with \nthem for the rest of their lives. We have an obligation to do \neverything we can to provide pathways to help them, but also to change \nthe dynamic on the battlefield so those children will never have to see \nthis kind of horror again.\n  Before I wrap up this segment of my remarks, I do want to note that \ndespite the challenge here, the dynamic on the ground that hasn't gone \nvery well, the opposition and the extremist elements within the \nopposition make it very difficult for us to be helpful even when our \ngovernment is trying.\n  The humanitarian crisis that I just outlined is substantial, and the \nrefugee issue in the region is substantial. Just imagine this: In \nLebanon alone there are almost 1 million refugees in a country that \ncannot handle that kind of number. In Jordan, the number is just below \n600,000. Most people think the number is a lot higher than that in \nJordan. Lebanon, as I said, is almost 1 million; Turkey is 600,000--\nthat number may be low, as well; more than 224,000, by estimates, in \nIraq; 134,000 in Egypt. These are the numbers of refugees in just those \nfive countries. Millions of people are being impacted, millions more \nwithin the country. If you subtract the refugees who have left the \ncountry and subtract the numbers I talked about with regard to \nchildren, just the adults within Syria who have been affected are in \nthe millions.\n  Despite all that horror I think it is important for us to point out \nthat our government has helped enormously. The Obama administration \ndeserves a lot of credit, commendation for what\n\n[[Page S1575]]\n\nthey have done already. They get criticized a lot, but we should \nhighlight some of the good things they have done. The humanitarian \nassistance provided by the administration, paid for by U.S. taxpayers, \nis substantial and should be noted. It is now more than $1.7 billion. \nNo country comes even close when it comes to the support our taxpayers \nand our government have provided. About half of that $1.7 billion has \nbeen to help within the country. By one USAID estimate, about $878 \nmillion is for help within Syria. The balance of that, something on the \norder of a little more than $850 million, of course, is helping \nrefugees in neighboring countries. So substantial help by the American \npeople should be noted. I think we need to figure out ways to do more. \nThere is probably not a lot of room for more dollars and humanitarian \naid, but we should consider that if we can. But there are lots of ways \nwe can help here without directly engaging any of our troops or any of \nour military might on the ground.\n  There are lots of ways to help and we urge the administration to keep \nfocus on a new and more substantial strategy, which I know they have \nbeen working on. They should consult with Congress and work with us as \nwe move forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/12/senate-section/article/S1575-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1575-S1576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DAVID KESSLER\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier this year, after 39 years of public \nservice, most recently as the National Zoo's keeper for the Small \nMammal House, David Kessler turned in his keys and turned toward \nretirement. He has dedicated two-thirds of his life to caring for the \nhowler monkeys, lemurs, and shrews living at the zoo.\n  In addition to feeding the animals and cleaning out their enclosures, \nKessler spent his days watching, closely observing any changes in \nappetite or behavior that might suggest something was amiss. He \nremembers the endless hours he spent with William, a gibbon, after \nWilliam's traumatizing experience at the hospital that left him afraid \nof humans and ostracized from his parents. Kessler holds on to a photo \nof William sleeping on his shoulder.\n  At the zoo, it wasn't just about Kessler caring for the animals; it \nwas about connecting with them. They kept him as much as he kept them. \nHe admits he wouldn't be the same person if it weren't for the animals. \nTheir connection has kept him in the moment and happy.\n  I was touched to read a moving profile of David's career and of his \nlast day in the Small Mammal House. His love for the small mammals for \nwhich he cared is evident. Health may have rushed his retirement, but \nby any measure his was a career spent in service to some of the most \ninteresting creatures visited at our Nation's zoo. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record this touching profile from the \nWashington Post of a career well worth celebrating.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, March 6, 2014]\n\n          National Zoo's Longest-Serving Keeper Bids Farewell\n\n                         (By Rachel Manteuffel)\n\n       On his last night as the longest-serving keeper at the \n     National Zoo, David S. Kessler checks and rechecks the locks \n     on the enclosures in the Small Mammal House. He collects his \n     farewell gifts and mementos and softly narrates to himself \n     what needs to be done. ``Okay, lights out here, good. Hi, \n     babies!'' he says to Reuben and Jolla, the howler monkey \n     couple. ``Aagh, g'night, sweetheart. Did I wake you up? I'm \n     sorry.'' He checks the seven timers on the lights, saying \n     ``timer'' aloud at each. He's not thinking, he says, about \n     how this January night is the last time after 39 years, two-\n     thirds of his life, at the zoo. Now Gus the rock hyrax--who \n     looks like a four-pound guinea pig but is more closely \n     related to the elephant--catches his attention in the dark. \n     It's as if the little guy knows something is up.\n       Considering the personal magnitude of the occasion, \n     everything is going fine as Kessler prepares to walk away \n     from the animals who he says rescued him, who might just have \n     saved his sanity.\n       ``Gus is sticking his head out--'' Kessler notes, then \n     stops. He sobs once, his knees buckle, and he drops face-down \n     on the floor of his House.\n       Earlier in the day, Kessler talked about his career. ``I \n     like to work with animals that nobody thinks about,'' he \n     said. Small mammals, it's true, are not headliners. Hey, \n     kids, let's go see the shrews! In the past few years, Kessler \n     has been lavishing his attention on the naked mole rat, an \n     animal that resembles a flaccid penis with buck teeth. He \n     always has a favorite weirdo. He has been the red panda guy, \n     the house shrew guy, the Prevost's squirrel guy and the \n     moonrat guy. Moonrats have no natural predators, Kessler says \n     with admiration and a little pride, because they smell so \n     bad.\n       There aren't a lot of jobs like zookeeper. Technically, \n     Kessler's job has been biologist, but the caretaking--the \n     keeping--is what he loves best.\n       ``It's the care of living things. To keep, that's a \n     beautiful thing. The longer you watch an animal or a person \n     just doing their thing, the more you feel connected to \n     them.''\n       A keeper feeds the animals and mucks out their enclosures, \n     but the real work is observation, watching their bodies and \n     behavior closely for subtle changes that mean something is \n     wrong. And figuring out how to fix it.\n       Take the lemurs, smallish primates with doglike faces, some \n     of the most social creatures in the Small Mammal House. \n     Cortes and Coronado are recent acquisitions--Kessler drove \n     them down from the Bronx Zoo in his Honda Civic--who are \n     being carefully phased in with Molly, who has been the sole \n     lemur at the Small Mammal House since her mate died. The \n     keepers noticed the new lemurs were keeping low to the \n     ground, un-lemurlike behavior. Lemurs are at home in \n     treetops, and the damp ground was irritating one of Cortes's \n     paws. Perhaps Molly was being territorial. They would wait \n     and see, maybe give Molly more attention. And keep watching.\n       Kessler and his colleagues would eventually determine Molly \n     wasn't behaving aggressively toward the other two lemurs. A \n     volunteer noticed it was the rock hyraxes antagonizing Cortes \n     and Coronado. The rock hyraxes were moved to a different \n     exhibit and, voila, the lemurs returned to the trees.\n       Lemurs are comparatively easy to read. You can spend less \n     than half an hour watching Molly and feel as if you almost \n     understand her thought process. You can become so absorbed \n     you forget who and what you are, and that you are watching. \n     It can become like reading a novel, the closest humans can \n     get to having someone else's consciousness for a change.\n       It took a year and a half in the reptile house, but \n     eventually Kessler could tell when something was wrong with a \n     snake.\n       He's about average height, and he has had a beard most of \n     his 59 years, but not now. He wears khakis and polos to work, \n     with big rubber boots, disposable gloves and face masks. \n     Primates can pass each other disease easily, he says. A \n     keeper's herpes cold sore can kill a gorilla.\n       In conversation, Kessler tosses out bits of philosophy, \n     science, novels, plays--knowledge you should have, if you had \n     time to read, and he acts as if you probably know them, too.\n       He knows each of the hundred-odd residents of the Small \n     Mammal House by their six-digit reference number. He has also \n     published or co-written about a dozen research papers. \n     Written three unpublished novels. He once went on a radio \n     show to compose sonnets on demand. He mentors high school \n     students and oversees their research projects. Every year \n     Kessler takes off work to see as many shows in the Capital \n     Fringe Festival as possible, since they often run past \n     midnight and his work would start at 6:30 a.m. He spends an \n     hour a day on the treadmill. He lives in Silver Spring and \n     has been married for 30 years--he still writes his wife, \n     Patricia, sonnets. He smiles when he happens upon a picture \n     of her unexpectedly. They have a grown son, Ben, who co-owns \n     an urban farming company in Charlottesville.\n       When friends asked, he officiated their 2006 wedding, \n     working with them to write a personalized service, complete \n     with sermon. Kessler took lessons from an actor friend on how \n     not to cry. He always cried at weddings but didn't want to \n     distract while performing one. He was asked to officiate \n     another wedding in Rockville, even though he was racing to \n     New Jersey and back to be with his dying father. His father \n     died. Kessler made the arrangements so his mother and sisters \n     wouldn't have to, then drove from New Jersey to the rehearsal \n     dinner that night. When another friend needed him to, he was \n     the one to officially identify her husband's body.\n       For a while he fronted a calypso-reggae band. He is \n     universally beloved among colleagues and friends--\n     suspiciously so, if you are a person suspicious of that sort \n     of thing.\n       Kessler's last ``Meet a Mammal'' demonstration for \n     zoogoers, on his last day at work, was attended by Linda \n     Hopkins, a zoo electrician who'd known him 11 years and \n     brought him a bottle of wine, and Susie Kane, who had never \n     met him, but she had heard he was leaving, and in 2005 he had \n     kindly answered her e-mailed question about building a naked \n     mole rat habitat for her dorm room.\n       In December, Scientific American declared the naked mole \n     rat Vertebrate of the Year. He is a happy man who's leaving \n     the job he loves.\n       He's retiring young because of his psoriatic arthritis. \n     It's much better these days----he gets injections of \n     monoclonal antibodies. But it is progressive. ``I only have \n     so much health left,'' he says, and zookeeping is physically \n     taxing. He wants to travel with his wife, and write.\n       A loved one once told him that he would probably be happier \n     as a hermit. He wasn't insulted.\n       ``I'm more comfortable by myself and with animals than I am \n     with people,'' he says. ``I\n\n[[Page S1576]]\n\n     don't feel like I fit around people.'' Around people, he is \n     giving a sort of performance. ``But an honest performance.'' \n     Sometimes he loves it, performing, fronting a band, \n     officiating at weddings. ``There's tension, but fun tension, \n     like scary movies. I like the attention and the tension.''\n       So ask to watch him work, ask him to ignore you, and it \n     doesn't work. That's a private part of him, reserved for \n     himself and the animals. He'll start offering you books or \n     telling you stories, and if you patiently sit around, \n     pretending to use a computer in his office until he forgets \n     you're there, he will not forget you're there. He will grow \n     slightly agitated and need some alone time with the lemurs \n     after you're gone.\n       His last day is a whirl of well-wishers, friends, leftover \n     food from the party the day before, paperwork, gifts, tears \n     and hugs. ``I don't like to be touched,'' he says to one \n     hugger, ``but being hugged is fine.''\n       He hadn't been assigned to do the lines that morning--the \n     shift that starts before sunrise, when the animals get their \n     breakfast and their enclosures are cleaned out. He had e-\n     mails to read, but people kept coming by for hugs and \n     predicting he'll be back. He says no, never coming back. He \n     seems to mean it.\n       Even friends who aren't physically present are distracting \n     him. ``Happy birthday to you,'' he sings into a friend's \n     voice mail, gargling the last line. ``Happy Jimmy Page's \n     birthday, happy your birthday, happy your aunt's birthday \n     yesterday.'' He attends to the needs of the humans for hours, \n     their need to say goodbye, to say they would miss him. He \n     almost always has a specific memory or thought for each, as \n     he thanks them and assures them he won't miss this place and, \n     after some time, they won't miss him.\n       He's proudest of his work with William the gibbon in 1978. \n     William was a juvenile living with his parents when he got \n     stuck in the enclosure and broke his arm. He was in the \n     hospital so long--so long in the company of humans--that his \n     parents rejected him when he got back. And because his \n     hospital experience was scary and painful, people now made \n     William fearful and angry. He was kept out of the exhibit for \n     a while, off by himself.\n       Kessler sat in his enclosure each day, doing nothing except \n     being nonthreatening. No mask, no gloves. Back then, this was \n     acceptable zookeeper behavior--interaction not initiated or \n     welcomed by the animal.\n       William would brachiate around in the farthest corner from \n     Kessler, swinging limb to limb, elaborately ignoring the 130-\n     pound human in the room. Over the course of a week, William \n     came closer and closer, until his feet would brush his \n     keeper's head as he swung by. Eventually he would put his \n     head on Kessler's sweatshirt and go to sleep. There's a \n     picture with William's arms around Kessler's head.\n       One thing he will miss from the zoo: watching the howler \n     monkeys eat. Jolla likes beets but not the squiggly end of \n     the taproot. She will pick it up, put it down, eat something \n     else, return as if to see if the bit she doesn't like is \n     still there. Maybe it got better! You can learn so much about \n     optimism from her, Kessler says. ``People tell me she's just \n     stupid,'' he says, shaking his head at that human stupidity.\n       Twelve years ago, Kessler walked with a cane, couldn't turn \n     his head and could sleep only an hour and a half at a time \n     because of his arthritis.\n       Thirty-six years ago he called his psychiatrist to say he \n     had everything ready to commit a tidy, no-fuss suicide, just \n     a hose and towels in a car exhaust pipe. His doctor had him \n     hospitalized for four days.\n       Then, at 27, he taught himself to be happy. ``You learn \n     from evolution, from animals. If you have a strategy that \n     doesn't work, change your strategy.''\n       His new strategy was to avoid introspection. Completely. \n     ``Working with animals made me start thinking about other \n     things more. And when I was able to start thinking about \n     other animals more, I was able to include humans in that \n     group.'' Understanding William the gibbon, for example, and \n     building his trust, was a big ``breakthrough with myself.''\n       ``The real change was Patricia,'' he says. ``But I probably \n     couldn't be with her if I hadn't been working with animals.''\n       According to dominant psychology and philosophy, \n     introspection is the key to living right. But Kessler's \n     unexamined life is the only kind he wants to live.\n       For obvious reasons, it's difficult for him to explain how \n     he stopped being introspective. Working with animals is one \n     way, but there were others. When he worked alone off-exhibit, \n     he narrated his novels in his head. He noticed that closing \n     certain doors in the building was musical, producing two \n     notes, a seventh interval: the first two notes of a song from \n     ``West Side Story\": ``Somewhere.''\n       Sometimes he needs to go alone to see if Molly wants a \n     belly rub. Lemurs and Reuben the howler are the only ones in \n     the Small Mammal House to much enjoy the touch of a human. \n     But lemurs are not pets. They did not evolve to be companions \n     for humans, to cheer us up or give us something to love. \n     Molly indicates if she wants a belly rub, not unlike a dog, \n     and a keeper may administer it, but the belly rub is entirely \n     for the animal. That's important to Kessler.\n       It turns out Molly wants a belly rub on Kessler's last day, \n     after he has finally gotten rid of all the people and sneaks \n     off to see her.\n       Afterward, he keeps putting off leaving, until his shift \n     stretches to 11 hours. And because the rock hyraxes have been \n     moved away from the lemurs they were scaring, here's Gus, too \n     present-focused to understand ``goodbye'' but seeming to say \n     goodbye, popping his head up, watching the keeper leave for \n     the last time, and the keeper--finished with crying, hugs and \n     goodbyes with people--goes down, face first.\n       Suzanne Hough, the volunteer coordinator, is leaving with \n     him, and she joins him on the floor. ``I'm sorry, I'm \n     sorry,'' he says. ``No. No, no, it's okay.''\n       After a moment, Hough speaks. ``The floor can be tricky \n     this time of night,'' she says, generously. She helps him up. \n     He's fine, as far as he lets anyone know.\n       Moments later he is calm again, and performing. ``Well, \n     that was a surprise!'' he says breezily. Hough and Kessler \n     walk out into the cold night.\n       Inside the House, the hundred-odd residents have no sense \n     that their time as keepers of David S. Kessler has come to an \n     end.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/12/senate-section/article/S1576-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1576-S1577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO KATHERINE PATERSON\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today to talk \nabout a treasured Vermont author, Katherine Paterson. Her award-winning \nprose has won alcolades near and far, but her writing has reached more \nthan just those who have read her published words. In 2004, she started \na letter exchange with an American soldier based in Afghanistan. Upon \nhis return, she helped him launch his writing career.\n  Trent Reedy of the Iowa Army National Guard was enthralled with \nPaterson's master work, ``Bridge to Terabithia,'' while deployed to \nFarah, Afghanistan. Reedy's wife Amanda sent him the book, and he loved \nit so much that he read it in one sitting and sent a thank you note to \nthe author.\n  Katherine's husband John, whom I knew as a gentle soul, sorted her \nmail and made sure that his wife saw the letter from Trent. A \ncorrespondence began between the two, and Trent finally revealed his \nintent to become a writer. Upon his return, Trent visited Katherine and \nJohn in Vermont and at Katherine's urging, and with her recommendation, \nstudied writing at the Vermont College of Fine Arts and later wrote his \nfirst novel, ``Words in the Dust.''\n  As someone who considers Katherine and her late husband to be special \nfriends, I was thrilled to read Sally Pollak's article in the \nBurlington Free Press, ``Soldier finds lifeline in letter exchange with \nVermont author.'' In fact I was so pleased, I called Katherine the day \nthe story was published.\n  In addition to being a Vermont treasure, Katherine is an acclaimed \nauthor whose stories will be read for generations. Marcelle and I have \nenjoyed them, our children have enjoyed them, and now our grandchildren \nenjoy her stories. Katherine's influence is also felt through the many \nwriters she has mentored, including Trent Reedy.\n  In honor of Katherine Paterson, I ask that Sally Pollak's story from \nthe February 23, 2014, edition of the Burlington Free Press be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, Feb. 23, 2014]\n\n     Soldier Finds Lifeline in Letter Exchange With Vermont Author\n\n                           (By Sally Pollak)\n\n       While serving in Afghanistan Trent Reedy wrote Katherine \n     Paterson to say thank you; the friendship that emerged \n     changed his life.\n       The truck pulled into the U.S. Army base in Farah, \n     Afghanistan, on another scorching desert day. This July, \n     2004, delivery promised exciting things: The cook was \n     expecting a load of steak. He had rustled up some potatoes to \n     serve with the meat.\n       The soldiers in the unit, housed in a stable with a well \n     that often ran dry, were eager for a real meal. They'd been \n     eating field rations called MREs, meals ready to eat. Yet \n     when the cook opened the coveted steak he almost vomited. The \n     meat had gone rancid en route, recalled Trent Reedy, a \n     soldier in the unit. The meal was scrapped.\n       The truck also carried the mail. In it was a package for \n     Reedy, sent by his wife in Iowa. She had mailed him a book by \n     Katherine Paterson, ``Bridge to Terabithia.''\n       Paterson, who lives in Barre, is an acclaimed novelist who \n     writes books for children and teenagers. She is a former \n     National Ambassador for Young People's Literature whose \n     honors include two National Book Awards and two Newbery \n     Medals, the first for ``Bridge to Terabithia,'' published in \n     1977.\n       Reedy's wife, Amanda, read ``Bridge to Terabithia'' in \n     sixth grade. She sent her husband the book after he mentioned \n     to her that the stories he was thinking about concerned young \n     people. Reedy had never read a Paterson book.\n       The day it arrived at the army base, he read ``Bridge to \n     Terabithia'' in one sitting. It\n\n[[Page S1577]]\n\n     would become a kind of lifeline for a frightened young man in \n     a faraway place with dreams of writing. Reedy read Paterson's \n     book in the place that would be the setting for his first \n     novel. ``Bridge to Terabithia'' was also the starting point \n     of a friendship between Reedy and Paterson.\n       ``It was amazing,'' Reedy said the other day by telephone \n     from his home in Spokane, Wash. ``I needed that reminder that \n     there was still hope and still beauty in the world. At that \n     time in my life there was none. There was nothing except guns \n     and fear. I was really not at all sure that I was ever going \n     to get out of that place.\n       ``This book gave me a little bit of beauty at that time, \n     and I needed it. Not the way I need a new app for my iPad. I \n     needed it to keep my soul alive.''\n\n\n                        Everything was different\n\n       Reedy, 35, was an English major at the University of Iowa \n     when he enlisted in the Iowa Army National Guard. Clinton was \n     president. Reedy never imagined he'd be deployed to fight in \n     a war. He had graduated from college and was working two \n     jobs: substitute teacher and monitoring a security camera at \n     a store.\n       Ten years ago, on a shift at his security job, Reedy got a \n     phone call from his sergeant.\n       ``Stampede,'' the commanding officer said, using the code \n     word that signaled the guard soldiers were activated for war, \n     Reedy said.\n       ``With one phone call, everything was different,'' he said.\n       After basic training at Fort Hood, Texas, Reedy was sent to \n     western Afghanistan. Paterson's book reached him about six \n     months after the word ``stampede'' altered his life. The day \n     ``Bridge to Terabithia'' arrived, Reedy had a rare break from \n     his three-part routine: the unit's mission (providing \n     security for reconstruction efforts), guard duty, sleep. He \n     read the book.\n       ``Bridge to Terabithia'' is about two friends--a boy and a \n     girl--who create an imaginary forest world where they play \n     together and share adventures. The world is shattered by an \n     accident: the girl drowns in the river the friends cross by \n     rope swing to get to Terabithia. Paterson wrote the book \n     after her son David's close friend was killed by lightning \n     when the children were eight.\n       After reading the book, even as he carried his loaded M16 \n     ``scanning my sector to make sure there weren't any hostiles \n     in the area,'' all he could think about was Paterson's novel.\n       ``I thought maybe I can keep going if I remember kids are \n     still having friendships,'' he said. ``And the adventures of \n     growing up.''\n       On Aug. 1, 2004, from Farah City, Afghanistan, Reedy wrote \n     Paterson a letter. He sent it through her publisher--unsure \n     if it would reach her. The letter begins with an apology that \n     he didn't type it. Reedy explains that he is writing from \n     Afghanistan, where he is on a mission ``in support of \n     Operation Enduring Freedom.''\n       He thanks Paterson for a book that ``mesmerized'' him.\n       ``You wrote an absolutely beautiful novel and I, like \n     Jessie Aarons, fell in love with Leslie Burke,'' Reedy wrote, \n     referring to characters in Paterson's book. `` . . . Maybe it \n     was because she was a spark of beauty in a land and a war \n     where beauty is of so little importance.''\n       In Vermont, where Paterson moved with her family 28 years \n     ago, Reedy's letter made its way to her Barre home. It \n     arrived in a batch of mail sent from her publisher. Paterson, \n     81, estimates she gets hundreds of letters a year, many from \n     students who are encouraged by their teachers to write.\n       (Paterson described a humorous note: ``You're the best \n     writer in the world,'' the student wrote. ``Sometime I'm \n     going to read one of your books.'')\n\n\n                          A writer on my hands\n\n       Paterson was married for 51 years to John Paterson, a \n     pastor who died in September. They raised four children \n     together, and have seven grandchildren. After John Paterson's \n     retirement in 1995 from the First Presbyterian Church in \n     Barre, he took up the practice of reading Katherine \n     Paterson's mail. Each year, he passed on to Katherine \n     Paterson a handful of letters among the hundreds he read. \n     John Paterson selected Reedy's letter and gave it to his \n     wife.\n       ``You just read it and weep,'' Katherine Paterson said. \n     ``And you think this poor, lonely kid out there, not knowing \n     what was going to happen to him.''\n       She was struck by another aspect of his letter: ``By the \n     time I finished that letter,'' Paterson said, ``I knew I had \n     a writer on my hands.''\n       The two became pen pals, a friendship whose beginnings \n     remain a source of happy amazement for Reedy.\n       ``I didn't need to hear back,'' Reedy said. ``I just wanted \n     to thank her for letting me keep going. And I thought she \n     should know that what she's doing is really important.''\n       Yet he received a response in October, 2004.\n       ``She talked about how special it feels for a reader to \n     appreciate this story she had written that seemed, at the \n     time of her writing it, to be almost too personal to share,'' \n     Reedy recalled.\n       The next month, on leave in Iowa, Reedy bought all the \n     Katherine Paterson books he could find and brought them back \n     to Afghanistan with him.\n       ``I read those and loved them,'' he said. ``There were some \n     Afghans who were learning English, and I passed along the \n     books to them and talked about how much I enjoyed her \n     books.''\n       What Reedy initially kept to himself in his correspondence \n     with Paterson was that he aspired to be a writer. He decided \n     to share this when it occurred to him he might not make it \n     home alive. But he never sent her any writing (apart from the \n     letters), mindful of imposing on her.\n       Reedy did seek Katherine Paterson's advice about graduate \n     writing programs, and she recommended Vermont College of Fine \n     Arts in Montpelier. Paterson is a trustee of the college, \n     whose low-residency programs include children's and adult \n     literature.\n       ``I said `impose,' '' Paterson recalled. `` `Plenty of \n     people impose on me that I don't like nearly as much as I \n     like you.' ''\n       Based on his letters, Paterson offered to write a letter of \n     recommendation for Reedy. He accepted only after a letter he \n     expected fell through, she said.\n       Reedy was accepted at Vermont College of Fine Arts, the \n     only MFA program he applied to. It was there that he wrote \n     the manuscript for his first novel, ``Words in the Dust.'' \n     The book, published by Arthur A. Levine Books, tells the \n     story of an Afghan girl and her family. It concerns the \n     girl's love for words; and her search for a connection to her \n     dead mother, and for beauty in a place where it's not so easy \n     to find that.\n       Reedy's story was inspired, in part, by a girl he met in \n     Afghanistan. Like the character in the novel he would write, \n     the child had a cleft lip. Soldiers in Reedy's unit pooled \n     their money to pay the girl's transportation to a hospital, \n     where a U.S. Army doctor performed surgery to repair her \n     face.\n       ``She faced this whole thing with this wonderful sort of \n     quiet courage, this incredible dignity,'' Reedy recalled. ``I \n     promised her that I would do whatever I could to tell her \n     story. She couldn't understand me, but that's what I told \n     her. In the army, we have to keep our promises, so you don't \n     make many. I think if I hadn't made that promise, I wouldn't \n     have been able to stick through to the end to write that \n     book.''\n       He was also encouraged by Katherine Paterson to continue \n     writing the book. Her support came amid concerns about cross-\n     cultural writing: a white man from Iowa writing a novel about \n     a disfigured girl in war-torn Afghanistan.\n       ``I asked her if this made any sense, and if she thought it \n     was a good idea to write this,'' Reedy said. ``And she said, \n     `Well, I think you should try.' And that was all the \n     permission I needed.''\n       Paterson, who was born in China, has written books set in \n     Japan and China. The notion that a writer can't write about a \n     foreign culture, its people and places, essentially says \n     imagination is worthless, she said.\n       ``Ideally, she could write her own story,'' Paterson said \n     of Reedy's protagonist. ``But she can't yet. And somebody \n     needs to tell it for her. And I do believe in the power of \n     imagination. Tolstoy can write about women very well, and he \n     has never been one.''\n\n\n                             To be a writer\n\n       Reedy's book, with an introduction by Katherine Paterson, \n     was published three years ago. He dedicated it to Paterson \n     and his father.\n       ``I loved the book,'' she said. ``And if my name was going \n     to call attention to it and my name was going to help promote \n     it, I'd write an introduction.''\n       In her introduction, Paterson wrote in part: ``I am \n     profoundly grateful for an introduction to a land and culture \n     that are foreign to me through this beautiful and often \n     heartbreaking tale of one strong and compassionate girl. She \n     will live on in my heart and, I feel sure, the heart of every \n     reader of this fine book.''\n       Before his first trip to Vermont, Reedy wrote once more to \n     Katherine Paterson. He said he'd be honored, should he be \n     accepted to Vermont College, to buy her a cup of coffee. \n     Sure, she said, but Paterson also had an idea: Why don't you \n     come and stay at our house the night before your residency \n     begins?\n       In July, 2006, Katherine Paterson ``and Mr. Paterson,'' to \n     use Reedy's words, picked him up at the airport in Burlington \n     and drove him to their Barre home.\n       He was very nervous about meeting Katherine Paterson, Reedy \n     said, expecting her to show up in an expensive car and drive \n     him to her rich mansion. But he found that Paterson, \n     ``arguably the most successful middle-school author who is \n     really around,'' drives a regular car and lives in a ``normal \n     house.''\n       The MFA program at Vermont College ``gave me my dream,'' \n     Reedy said. Yet Katherine Paterson taught him what it means \n     to be a writer.\n       ``Nobody has taught me more about how to be the kind of \n     writer I want to be than Katherine Paterson has,'' Reedy \n     said. ``No one has taught me more about how to live as a \n     writer. She has, I think, modeled the need for humility and \n     generosity.''\n       Once, feeling he didn't belong at Vermont College of Fine \n     Arts and that he was ``hopelessly outclassed,'' Reedy \n     conveyed this in a letter to Katherine Paterson. He wanted to \n     steal lines from Emily Dickinson and walk around campus \n     saying: ``I'm nobody. Who are you?''\n       Paterson wrote back that she, too, is nobody. If she ever \n     forgets that, she's in big trouble.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/12/senate-section/article/S1577-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1577-S1579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         VERMONT COFFEE COMPANY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Vermont is known for its small and large \nbusinesses alike. Vermonters take pride in\n\n[[Page S1578]]\n\nbuying locally, and as a result, businesses like the Vermont Coffee \nCompany have been able to expand and become forces in their respective \nindustries.\n  When Paul Ralston started the Vermont Coffee Company over 30 years \nago in the small town of Middlebury, VT, he did so based on the belief \nthat coffee creates community. Today, he continues his commitment to a \nhigh-quality farmer-friendly coffee blend by using only fair trade, \ncertified organic coffee beans from around the world.\n  Paul's passion for coffee has created an opportunity for him to forge \nhis own path to success, and he has expanded Vermont Coffee Company's \ndistribution to retail outlets throughout the Northeast and along the \nAtlantic coast. His business continues to expand, and his success is \njust one hallmark of the respected Vermont Brand. I congratulate his \nsuccess, and I ask that the text of an article appearing in the \nBurlington Free Press on February 20, 2014, about his success be \nprinted in for the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, Feb. 20, 2014]\n\n         Middlebury Coffee Roaster Still Growing After 30 Years\n\n                          (By Melissa Pasanen)\n\n       Middlebury, VT.--Vermont Coffee Company in Middlebury was \n     ahead of the curve when it started roasting organic, fair \n     trade beans 30 years ago. Its continued success is based on a \n     simple philosophy.\n       In the front hall of Vermont Coffee Company's offices and \n     production facility, dozens of photos of happy people, some \n     with coffee cups in hand, smile down from the wall.\n       In keeping with the company's longtime tagline--``Coffee \n     roasted for friends''--these are not just customers, founder-\n     owner Paul Ralston clarified on a recent tour: They are \n     friends.\n       ``Before there was Facebook,'' Ralston, 61, said. ``We had \n     our friends' wall.''\n       Ralston has always been a little ahead of the curve, since \n     his first foray into roasting coffee beans some 30 years ago \n     as a tiny bakery-based operation.\n       There have also been plenty of curves in the road he has \n     traveled since then, but this year Ralston expects Vermont \n     Coffee Company to purchase half a million pounds of green \n     coffee beans, which will be roasted in its recently doubled \n     15,000-square-foot facility and shipped to accounts ranging \n     from a small, highly regarded group of New York City coffee \n     shops to Costco.\n\n\n                             Coffee culture\n\n       It was during his ownership of Bristol Bakery from 1977 to \n     1983 that Ralston first stumbled upon the smoky and aromatic \n     process of coffee-roasting in Manhattan's Bowery neighborhood \n     while shopping for used bakery equipment. The smells conjured \n     up memories of the strong espresso his Italian grandmother \n     carefully brewed every Sunday when he was a child.\n       When he came back to Bristol, Ralston serendipitously found \n     a classic turn-of-the-20th-century roaster, installed it in \n     the bakery's front window and began roasting batches of green \n     coffee beans well before the trend of small, local coffee \n     roasters swept the country.\n       After selling the bakery, Ralston returned to school at \n     Burlington's Trinity College to study business administration \n     and planned to pay some of his tuition bills by running a \n     Church Street espresso cart. But Starbucks was just opening \n     its first Seattle coffeehouse and most people didn't know \n     what to make of his cart. ``It was a huge flop,'' he said \n     ruefully.\n       More than a decade went by, during which Ralston spent time \n     in the San Francisco Bay area working in nonprofit arts \n     management and appreciating the region's vibrant cafe culture \n     before he and his wife, Deb Gwinn, returned to Vermont where \n     he helped grow the cosmetics and skincare company Autumn Harp \n     to $6 million in annual sales. That led to a job with The \n     Body Shop in England where, he noted, ``There was a coffee \n     drought, so I drank tea.''\n\n\n                            Brown-bagging it\n\n       In 1997, Ralston and Gwinn returned again to Vermont and to \n     the antique Royal Roaster #4, which had been gathering dust \n     in their Bristol garage. ``I hooked it up in the garage and \n     started roasting and taking the coffee to gatherings for \n     feedback,'' Ralston said. As he developed his new business \n     idea over the next few years, he kept things simple, both by \n     design and by default.\n       Like back in the Bristol Bakery days, Vermont Coffee \n     Company used brown paper lunch bags to package the coffee and \n     a friend made a rubber stamp to label the bags. ``The brown \n     bag was the starting principal,'' Ralston said. ``When you \n     would get something fresh and from a local shop, there \n     wouldn't be a lot of packaging.''\n       ``We started with just dark and decaf,'' he said. ``What \n     else do you need?'' And the coffee was available only as \n     whole bean. ``We refuse to grind coffee. As soon as you grind \n     it you start the staling process,'' Ralston explained.\n       Ralston's approach was also influenced strongly by his \n     former boss, Body Shop founder, Anita Roddick, who he \n     described as ``a pioneer in trade, not aid,'' cultivating \n     mutually beneficial trade relationships with developing \n     countries and communities to help them become self-sufficient \n     rather than simply providing financial or other aid. When he \n     first told Roddick he was thinking of getting back into \n     coffee, he recalled that she said to him, ``Your coffee \n     should be 100 percent organic and 100 percent fair trade.'' \n     There wasn't a brand like that at the time, ``and it turned \n     out there was a good reason for that,'' Ralston said. \n     ``Everyone thought I was nuts. At the time, organic was just \n     gnarly vegetables.''\n\n\n                         Window of opportunity\n\n       Count Vermont coffee expert Dan Cox among those who thought \n     Ralston was a little nuts. Cox had been the first full-time \n     employee of what was then Green Mountain Coffee Roasters. He \n     worked there for a dozen years before he founded his own \n     Burlington-based coffee-testing business, Coffee Enterprises, \n     which does analysis for many major national coffee companies. \n     ``Paul came to me and said, I want to learn everything about \n     roasting,''' Cox recalled. ``He told me he wanted to be like \n     Peet's [a leading San Francisco Bay area coffee roaster], \n     which is like the Guinness of coffee. I said, This isn't the \n     Bay area. The East Coast is not into dark roast. Like with \n     Guinness, for every customer you turn on, you'll turn four \n     off.'''\n       In addition, Cox remembers Ralston outlining his ``folksy'' \n     marketing plan with the brown bags and emphasis on selling to \n     friends. ``I said, That's a little far-fetched, pal.' And he \n     said, That's all I've got.'''\n       Ralston spent six months learning how to evaluate green \n     coffee beans, blend, roast and control quality and despite \n     Cox's initial concerns, he carved out a niche and grew \n     steadily. ``He was still there in five years and then another \n     five,'' Cox said. ``He was very savvy, always asking for a \n     better way to do something . . . and he has stayed true to \n     his style. His packaging is still relatively unsophisticated \n     but it works for him. He makes a respectable coffee and a \n     pretty darn good decaf.''\n       A few other factors worked in Ralston's favor, Cox added: \n     ``Number one, he had a passion for it, and number two, nobody \n     really came right after him. He had a window of opportunity \n     that doesn't exist today.''\n\n\n                              Solid focus\n\n       As Cox noted, the competitive frame is very different today \n     with new micro-roasters popping up regularly, but Ralston has \n     stayed focused on his initial vision.\n       Since its official launch in 2001, Vermont Coffee Company \n     has expanded to retail outlets all over Vermont, as well as \n     New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Hampshire with \n     distribution growing at a healthy clip around the Northeast \n     and down the Atlantic coast. The company has about 23 \n     employees, about half of those full-time and many part-time \n     by choice, older and partly retired or younger with children. \n     ``Part of our business model is a flexible workforce,'' \n     Ralston explained.\n       Ralston, who is sole owner, would not share sales figures \n     but Vermont Coffee Company projects 20 percent growth in \n     2014. The flagship line of retail packaged whole beans \n     remains simple and straightforward in its descriptors: Dark, \n     Medium, Mild and Decaf. The down-to-earth brown bag packaging \n     remains, although it takes the form of a brown box for \n     Costco.\n       With the exception of one line from the Dominican Republic, \n     rather than emphasizing single-sourced coffees from specific \n     regions like many other small roasters, Vermont Coffee \n     Company has always led with its blends.\n       ``We are blenders. There's nothing magical about our \n     beans,'' said Ralston. ``The goal is to keep our blends \n     tasting the same, month to month, year to year.''\n       Vermont Coffee Company buys certified organic beans \n     following principles set by the International Fair Trade \n     Federation, Ralston said. The annual coffee harvest occurs at \n     different times in different climates and over a year beans \n     could be sourced from Ethiopia, Indonesia, Peru, Bolivia, \n     Guatemala and Nicaragua, among other countries.\n       The beans are stacked high in burlap bags in a large \n     storage room in Middlebury all tagged with their country, \n     producer, and lot number. As he demonstrated how the beans \n     are pulled for evaluation through a long hollow spiked tool \n     that can dig deep into each bag, Ralston explained how \n     different beans contribute to the overall blend. Coffee from \n     Guatemala, for example, he said, ``We call them our spice \n     beans. They add fruity and floral notes.''\n       The company's modest marketing budget still emphasizes \n     grassroots relationship-building (now via social media), \n     coffee sampling and offering loyal customers Vermont Coffee \n     Company merchandise such as t-shirts and mugs for returning \n     proof-of-purchases, which they do by weaving strips of brown \n     bags into quilts, folding them into origami and even, in one \n     case, using them to craft a collage of Johnny Cash drinking \n     coffee ? black, of course.\n       Another thing that has not changed, Ralston noted with a \n     smile: ``We always smell like coffee. When we go to the bank, \n     they know who we are . . . It's a sensory business. We're in \n     it for what it smells and tastes like.''\n\n\n                        Slow roast, slow growth\n\n       Changes have come gradually, many in the form of process \n     improvements such as the\n\n[[Page S1579]]\n\n     adoption of the Japanese production scheduling system, \n     Kanban; new pieces of equipment to mechanize jobs previously \n     done by hand like bag-folding; and increased roasting \n     capacity.\n       In the roasting room recently, a brand new, shiny stainless \n     steel roaster with capacity of 150 pounds was in the process \n     of being installed. It cost about $350,000 to purchase and \n     install and would double Vermont Coffee Company's roasting \n     capacity, Ralston said.\n       ``The thing that makes it big, bold coffee is how we roast \n     it,'' Ralston explained, pausing in front of one of the \n     company's two smaller roasters where a small circular window \n     gave a peek into the pre-roasted, dull grey-green beans while \n     the glossy dark brown, roasted beans swirled below. Vermont \n     Coffee Company roasts its beans about twice as long as many \n     other larger roasters, Ralston said. He believes the longer, \n     slower roast is key to building rounded flavors, similar to \n     slowly caramelized onions or the depth of a long-cooked Cajun \n     or Creole roux sauce base. ``It's a long, slow caramelizing \n     roast,'' he said, ``which results in coffee with more body \n     and sweeter, chocolate, caramel notes and a smoky tang and \n     lower acidity.''\n       With a similar careful approach, Ralston has planned and \n     budgeted for growth. Over his varied career, Ralston said, \n     ``I've made all the mistakes you can make.'' He has seen \n     firsthand, he said, that ``growth offers new ways to screw \n     up.''\n       ``We follow a model called bootstrapping,'' he said. ``We \n     use yesterday's cash flow to finance growth. We're not \n     extravagant.'' The company's credit line, he said, usually \n     has a zero balance. An additional challenge these past four \n     years has been Ralston's commitment to the Vermont \n     legislature to which he was elected in November of 2010. He \n     ran, he said, because ``I think there is a need for more \n     people with active business experience in the legislature.''\n       He feels good about what he has accomplished there, he \n     said, but it's been ``very hard'' balancing the four-month, \n     four-day-a-week commitment with running an actively growing \n     business. ``I think we would be further ahead if I hadn't \n     done it,'' he said.\n       Looking ahead 15 years, Ralston said with a smile, ``I hope \n     to still be grooving on coffee.'' He also hopes to be able to \n     spend more time ``at origin,'' in countries where coffee is \n     grown. ``It happens to be warmer than here,'' he added.\n       At home in Vermont, Ralston imagines a slightly bigger \n     office ``with a wood-burning stove, a couch and a bigger \n     coffee table where friends will come by to visit and sit to \n     have a coffee.''\n\n                     ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/12/senate-section/article/S1579-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO BOB KLEIN\n\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S1579, March 12, 2014, in the first column, the \nfollowing language appears: TRIBUTE TO BOB KLINE\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: TRIBUTE TO BOB \nKLEIN\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, on February 28, 2014, August Schaefer, \nbetter known as Gus, stepped down from his post as chief safety officer \nof Underwriters Laboratories, after dedicating 41 years to the company.\n  Underwriters Laboratories is an independent safety certification \norganization that tests products, conducts factory inspections, and \nwrites standards for safety. Gus has served in many leadership roles \nduring his time at UL, but in all capacities he has been dedicated to \npromoting public safety.\n  Under his leadership, UL launched the Firefighter Safety Research \nInstitute which works to provide first responders and firefighters with \nadditional information on burning buildings and the behavior of \nspecific materials in fires.\n  In 2012, Mr. Schaefer shared his expertise on the safety and \neffectiveness of flame retardant chemicals as he testified before the \nSenate Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General \nGovernment. His testimony on the effectiveness of flame retardant \nchemicals and furniture flammability standards was a significant \ncontribution to the hearing.\n  Mr. Schaefer also worked to have UL, as part of a partnership with \nDisney, bring safety education campaigns to children all over the world \nthrough the Safety Smart Ambassador Program. The program's video \ncampaign educates children on fire safety, personal safety, water \nsafety, health, environmental protection, and online safety.\n  UL, under his guidance, expanded its operations overseas. In response \nto a growing number of imports, UL has increased its presence in Asia, \nwhere it tests products intended for consumers in the United States. UL \nalso has expanded its safety outreach to India, establishing an annual \nRoad Safety Council where fire officials work to solve challenges in a \ndeveloping nation.\n  Mr. Schaefer's service in Illinois is felt well beyond product safety \nand testing. Under his leadership, UL established annual Living the \nMission Celebrations, which encourage UL staff to spend a day \nvolunteering in the community.\n  Gus Schaefer's leadership at UL has made the world a better--and \nsafer-- place. When we use products approved by Underwriters Labs, we \nthank Gus Schaefer. I thank him for his many years of service and wish \nhim the best in his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/12/senate-section/article/S1579-3", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1579-S1580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              NATIONAL YOUTH SYNTHETIC DRUG AWARENESS WEEK\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Klobuchar \nin cosponsoring a resolution designating the week of March 9, 2014, as \nNational Youth Synthetic Drug Awareness Week. The abuse of synthetic \ndrugs has grown rapidly in a very short amount of time. Calls into \npoison control centers concerning synthetic marijuana, also known as \n``K2,'' doubled between 2010 and 2011 and remained elevated throughout \n2012. Emergency room visits connected to synthetic marijuana use more \nthan doubled, to 28,000 visits, from 2010 to 2011. In addition, other \nsynthetic drugs commonly known as ``bath salts'' produced over 22,000 \nemergency room admissions.\n  The serious symptoms associated with synthetic drug use range from\n\n[[Page S1580]]\n\nrapid heart rate, psychosis, and agitation which may lead to suicide, \ncardiac arrest, or organ failure. In 2010, a constituent of mine named \nDavid Rozga committed suicide shortly after ingesting ``K2'' with his \nfriends. After smoking the drug, David became highly agitated. His \nfriends calmed him down, and he decided to go home. Not long afterward, \nhowever, he committed suicide. David's death was one of the first in \nthe United States attributed to synthetic drug use.\n  I worked with Senators Klobuchar, Schumer, and Feinstein, along with \nmany others, to place many of these terrible drugs on the list of \nSchedule I controlled substances. I am grateful that the Senate and the \nHouse worked together to pass the Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act \nof 2012. Our efforts were an important step in allowing the Drug \nEnforcement Administration to begin enforcement actions against those \nwho are poisoning our communities.\n  However, new synthetic drugs have emerged since the passage of that \nlaw. In fact, the Drug Enforcement Administration has moved to \nadministratively place an additional 17 chemical compounds on the list \nof schedule I narcotics in recent months. Included among these drugs is \na compound called 5F-PB-22, which was blamed for the deaths of three \nyoung Iowans last year. Moreover, in just the past few days, police in \nIowa have arrested six people and raided multiple stores in the Des \nMoines area for selling synthetic drugs. These tragic deaths and \narrests of those pushing these substances underscore the ongoing need \nto raise awareness of these deadly drugs.\n  The good news is that people, including in my home State of Iowa, are \nfighting back against the scourge of synthetic drugs. The Rozga family \nhas been active in sharing David's story. They have also started a Web \nsite, K2drugfacts.com, which creates a forum for other parents, \nfriends, and people who have survived terrifying experiences with \nsynthetic drugs to share their stories and spread the word that these \ndrugs are destructive. Other antidrug organizations and coalitions are \nraising public awareness in Iowa. For example, a local community group \nin Johnson County, Iowa called Iowans Against Synthetics has raised \nsynthetic drug awareness throughout that county.\n  The National Youth Synthetic Drug Awareness Week resolution \nencourages other individuals and organizations throughout the country \nto continue their efforts to raise awareness about the deadliness of \nthese drugs. I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nresolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/12/senate-section/article/S1580-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     CONGRATULATING CONNOR PERKINS\n\n Mr. HELLER.

Mr. President, I wish to honor the life of Thelma \nSayler.\n  Thelma Sayler was born in Lynch, NE, on September 3, 1924, to Mads \nand Ruth (Christensen) Nelson. In 1927, she moved with her parents and \nyounger sister, Donna Faye, in a Model T with the company of 24 \nchickens, to a one-room ``shack'' north of White River. Ten years later \nher father tore down an old house and hauled the lumber in the Model T, \nusing it to build a new house for the family. They moved into their new \nhouse just 1 day before Christmas, where Thelma had her own bedroom, \nwhich was a mansion to her.\n  Since there were no boys, the girls helped with farming, ranching, \nand chores around the house. Thelma liked to remember how she, her \nsister and mother, during the dirty thirties, used aprons to shoo away \nthe Mormon crickets to save their garden.\n  Thelma graduated from White River High School in 1942. After high \nschool, she traveled with her Aunt and Uncle to Oregon to work in the \nshipyards during the war. When traveling, she sat in the back of a \npickup on a chair. In 1949, Thelma, and her daughters Karen and Sharon, \nmoved back to White River. A couple years later they moved north to the \n``Old Rassy Place.''\n  In 1953, Thelma accepted a teaching job at the Cottonwood School that \nwas about 2 miles from their home. In 1954, she taught in Jones County. \nWhen she started teaching, she worked without certification for a \nnumber of years. She eventually started taking classes during the \nsummer through Black Hills State Teacher College, and earned her \nbachelor's degree in 1969. In 1971, Thelma and her family moved 10 \nmiles north of White River to the ``Teddy Fredericks Place,'' where she \nthen began teaching second grade in Murdo.\n  She taught in Murdo until retiring in 1987. Even after retirement, \nThelma continued her passion to educate, which included volunteering at \nthe school, substitute teaching, and even providing snacks for students \nand staff. Thelma was a lifelong member of the Cottonwood Ladies Aide \nand volunteered at the Mellette County Museum & Library, blood drives, \nand the Grand Stand Committee. She was also a long-time member of the \nUnited Methodist Church in Murdo.\n  Thelma Sayler passed away at the age of 89 on February 9, 2014, at \nher daughter's house in White River. She will be forever remembered for \nher love of teaching and for all that she has done for her community.\n  I was among Thelma Sayler's many students. She was a teacher in the \ntruest and best sense of the word, and I am forever grateful for her \ninvestment in me. She was patient and kind but tough when needed--and \nmost importantly, she was passionate about seeing kids learn and truly \ncommitted to her work. Like so many others who passed through her \nclassroom, I was blessed to have her as a teacher and later in life to \ncall her a friend.\n\n[[Page S1581]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/12/senate-section/article/S1581-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1581]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n REPORT OF THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO \n IRAN THAT WAS DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 12957 ON MARCH 15, 1995--PM \n                                   35\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date.

This marks the \nfirst time in a decade that Iran has agreed to and taken specific \nactions to halt its nuclear program and to roll it back in key \nrespects. In return for Iran's actions on its nuclear program, the \nP5+1, in coordination with the European Union, are taking actions to \nimplement the limited, temporary, and reversible sanctions relief \noutlined in the JPOA.\n  Nevertheless, certain actions and policies of the Government of Iran \nare contrary to the interests of the United States in the region and \ncontinue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national \nsecurity, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging complete \n     hydrologic separation of the Great Lakes and Mississippi \n     River basins, calling for the formation of a regional body to \n     negotiate terms of hydrologic separation, and urging Congress \n     and other entities to take interim steps to prevent Asian \n     carp movement into the Great Lakes; to the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 305\n\n       Whereas, The Great Lakes constitute one of the world's \n     greatest inland waterway systems. Recreational opportunities \n     on the lakes make Michigan and the region an attractive place \n     for businesses to locate. The Great Lakes support jobs across \n     a spectrum of industries that include manufacturing, tourism, \n     recreation, shipping--including freight transport and \n     warehousing--agriculture, science, engineering, utilities, \n     and mining. The protection of the Great Lakes is essential to \n     local and national economic growth; and\n       Whereas, The Great Lakes are central to Michigan's state \n     identity and economy with a $15 billion annual tourism \n     industry and more than 1 million licensed anglers \n     contributing $2 billion to the economy; and\n       Whereas, Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are one of the \n     foremost challenges facing the Great Lakes. Economic and \n     environmental damage from invasive species in the Great Lakes \n     basin is estimated at $5.7 billion per year, and commercial \n     and sport fishing in the Great Lakes basin have suffered \n     losses estimated at $4.5 billion; and\n       Whereas, Asian carp pose an imminent threat to the Great \n     Lakes ecosystem and economy. The leading front of the Asian \n     carp population has been confirmed 25 miles downstream of the \n     electric barriers located on the Chicago Sanitary and Ship \n     Canal, and monitoring has detected Asian carp DNA between the \n     electric barriers and Lake Michigan. Research by U.S. and \n     Canadian fishery experts shows that there is a significant \n     risk of Asian carp surviving, spreading, and establishing \n     populations in the Great Lakes, particularly in shallow, \n     near-shore areas like Green Bay, Saginaw Bay, Lake St. Clair, \n     and Western Lake Erie. Once established, they can reproduce \n     rapidly, consume large quantities of food, disrupt local \n     ecosystems, out-compete native fish species, and devastate \n     recreational fishing and boating opportunities. If \n     populations of Asian carp become established in the Great \n     Lakes, they will be difficult, if not impossible, to control \n     or eradicate, and thus, the federal government has recognized \n     Asian carp as ``the most acute [aquatic invasive species] \n     threat facing the Great Lakes today''; and\n       Whereas, A recent study conducted by the U.S. Army Corps of \n     Engineers and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service showed that \n     the electric barriers in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, \n     designed to prevent the spread of Asian carp and other \n     invasive fish, are not effective in stopping the movement of \n     all fish, especially small fish, and that barges can sweep \n     fish through the electric barrier; and\n       Whereas, The Restoring the Natural Divide report prepared \n     by the Great Lakes Commission and the Great Lakes and St. \n     Lawrence Cities Initiative in 2012 presented three \n     alternatives for hydrologically separating the Great Lakes \n     and Mississippi River basins. The report demonstrates that a \n     long-term solution to prevent AIS transfer--while maintaining \n     or enhancing water quality, flood control, and \n     transportation--is possible; and\n       Whereas, The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released the \n     Great Lakes and Mississippi River Interbasin Study (GLMRIS) \n     report presenting a range of eight options and technologies \n     to prevent AIS movement between the Great Lakes and \n     Mississippi River basins, including two alternatives for full \n     hydrologic separation. The GLMRIS report recognizes \n     hydrologic separation as the most effective way to keep Asian \n     carp out of the Great Lakes and mitigate flooding; and\n       Whereas, Complete hydrologic separation of the Great Lakes \n     and Mississippi River basins would be a project measured in \n     decades, not months or years. Asian carp pose a near \n     certainty of establishing populations in the Great Lakes \n     before the implementation of hydrologic separation from the \n     Mississippi River basin unless strong, strategic interim \n     measures are implemented; and\n       Whereas, While the long-term solution is developed and \n     implemented, priority in the near-term should be given to \n     effectively preventing the movement of Asian carp into the \n     Great Lakes from the Mississippi River basin through \n     technologies, waterway system improvements, technology \n     demonstrations, and continued aggressive management practices \n     leading to real reductions in populations. One-way or partial \n     separation to prevent fish from moving upstream may be \n     possible to achieve in the near-term without having to \n     address major flooding and water quality issues. A short-term \n     plan of action should include study and evaluation of the \n     impacts on shipping infrastructure to provide feasible \n     options for promoting new alternative long-term solutions: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we find that \n     complete hydrologic separation is the most effective long-\n     term solution for protecting the Great Lakes and Mississippi \n     River basins from aquatic invasive species (AIS) transfer and \n     urge its implementation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we memorialize the Congress of the United \n     States to call for immediate action on a suite of measures to \n     reduce the risk of Asian carp and other invasive species \n     passing through the Chicago Area Waterway System until \n     hydrologic separation can be completed, including:\n       1. Continued implementation of the Asian Carp Control \n     Strategy Framework and related efforts;\n       2. Continued support of extensive monitoring and control \n     efforts, including commercial fishing in the Chicago Area \n     Waterway System, led by the Illinois Department of Natural \n     Resources and its federal partners;\n       3. Design and engineering of modifications to the Brandon \n     Road lock and dam structure or other appropriate lock to \n     reduce the risk of one-way transfer into Lake Michigan, \n     including additional electric barriers at the entrance and \n     exit of the lock, use of carbon dioxide as a fish deterrent, \n     modifications of the gates on the dam, and other \n     technologies; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we urge the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to \n     implement physical separation immediately through lock \n     closure should Asian carp pose an imminent threat of passing \n     through the Brandon Road Lock; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we call upon commercial navigation \n     industries to identify practices to reduce the risk of AIS \n     transfer that can be instituted on an escalating pace \n     commensurate with the advance of Asian carp toward Lake \n     Michigan; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we urge the United States Department of \n     Transportation to study and evaluate the current and future \n     infrastructure needs in the affected region to ensure the \n     continued flow of commerce in and out of the region; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That we call for the assembly of a consensus-\n     building body of state and federal agencies, industries, \n     regional commissions, and nongovernmental organizations to \n     negotiate terms of hydrologic separation of\n\n[[Page S1584]]\n\n     the Great Lakes and Mississippi River basins even while \n     planning for interim measures are underway; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we request that Congress call upon the U.S. \n     Fish and Wildlife Service to provide a lead role in \n     accomplishing these goals and coordinating efforts of the \n     U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other federal agencies \n     through the Asian Carp Control Strategy Framework and the \n     national control plan for Asian carp; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, the members of the Michigan congressional \n     delegation, the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of \n     the Interior, the Commanding General of the U.S. Army Corps \n     of Engineers, the Commander of the U.S. Army Corps of \n     Engineers--Chicago District, and the Asian Carp Regional \n     Coordinating Committee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/12/senate-section/article/S1584-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. MENENDEZ, from the Committee on Foreign Relations, \n     without amendment:\n       S. 2124.

A bill to reauthorize the Yuma Crossing National Heritage \nArea; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am please to introduce legislation that \nwould reauthorize the Yuma Crossing National Heritage Area located in \nYuma, AZ. A companion bill is being introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by Congressman Raul Grijalva and Congressman Ed Pastor \nfrom Arizona.\n  The Yuma Crossing National Heritage Area is a unique success story in \nthe National Heritage Areas, NHA, system. It was first authorized in \n2000 under legislation sponsored by myself and former Senator Jon Kyl, \nP.L. 106-319. Yuma Crossing NHA has proven to be a central component in \na collaborative effort by local, tribal and federal partners to \ntransform the City of Yuma downtown riverfront area and restore \nriparian habitat along the banks of the Colorado River. Like many other \nNHAs, it was established as a means of encouraging historic \npreservation at a local level without assigning large federal resources \nfor the management of land as a National Park. The Yuma Crossing NHA \nmodel continues to involve a broad coalition of local businesses, \nfarmers, and the Quechan Tribe of the Fort Yuma Indian Reservation \namong others.\n  Yuma Crossing NHA was the first NHA to be established west of the \nMississippi River. Its purpose is to preserve and share the history of \nthe Yuma Crossing, which is a narrow granite outcropping on the \nColorado River that for centuries served as the only transportation \ngateway for those traveling west to California, including Spanish \nmissionaries, American pioneers, and gold rush prospectors. Prior to \nthe completion of the transcontinental railroad in the 1860's, if you \nwanted to trade or travel to California, you had to go through Yuma \nCrossing.\n  The NHA designation has enabled the City of Yuma to develop plans to \nleverage about $80 million in private investments, not Federal funding, \nfor the revitalization of downtown Yuma and the historic landmark. The \nYuma Crossing NHA also played a critical role in saving a former \nArizona State Park unit, the historic Yuma Quartermaster Depot, which \nhad closed and fallen into disrepair due to state budget cuts. \nMoreover, the Yuma Crossing NHA has led the way in a remarkable \nenvironmental project along the Colorado River known as the Yuma East \nWetlands project, which aims to remove 1,400 acres of non-native, \nwater-guzzling salt cedar thickets and re-vegetate the area with native \nwillows, cottonwood, and mesquite trees. The 400 acres completed thus \nfar has aided in the initial recovery of a number of endangered and \nmigratory bird species, including the Yuma clapper rail, the yellow-\nbilled cuckoo, and the southwestern willow flycatcher.\n  As a testament to its successes, the National Park Service has \ndowngraded the Yuma Crossing historic landmark from Threatened to Watch \nstatus. However, more work remains to be done. For example, the Yuma \nEast Wetlands project has secured a funding commitment from non-federal \nparties for the next fifty years. Because NHA's have an authorization \nperiod of 15 years, it's critical that Congress reauthorize the Yuma \nCrossing NHA before the end of Fiscal Year 2015 so that this effort \ncontinues uninterrupted. I understand there may be a need to offset the \nfederal spending that's authorized by this legislation, and I hope to \naddress this concern as the bill advances through the legislative \nprocess. I encourage my colleagues to support the passage of this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Reed, Ms. Hirono, Mr. Brown, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, Mr. Markey, Mr. Casey, Mr. Cardin, Mrs. Boxer, and \n        Mrs. Hagan):\n  S. 2115.

Mr. BENNET (for himself, Mr. Begich, Mr. Schatz, and Mr. \nUdall of Colorado) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by \nhim to the bill S. 1086, to reauthorize and improve the Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant Act of 1990, and for other purposes; which was \nordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 13. NATIVE AMERICAN INDIAN EDUCATION ACT.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Native \n     American Indian Education Act''.\n       (b) Findings and Purpose.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (A) Nontribal colleges that serve Native American Indian \n     students have a valuable supplemental role to that provided \n     by tribally controlled community colleges in making available \n     educational opportunities to Native American Indian students.\n       (B) Some 4-year colleges serve Native American Indian \n     students by providing tuition-free education, with the \n     support of the State in which the institutions are located, \n     as mandated by Federal statute, to hundreds of Native \n     American Indian students in fulfillment of a condition under \n     which the United States provided land and facilities for \n     colleges to a State or college.\n       (C) The value of the Native American Indian student tuition \n     waiver benefits contributed by these colleges and the States \n     that support them today far exceeds the value of the original \n     grant of land and facilities.\n       (D) The ongoing financial burden of meeting this Federal \n     mandate to provide tuition-free education to Native American \n     Indian students is no longer equitably shared among the \n     States and colleges because it does not distinguish between \n     Native American Indian students who are residents of the \n     State or of another State.\n       (E) In fiscal year 2012, the State of Colorado paid \n     approximately $13,000,000 in tuition fees to support the \n     education of Native American Indian students at Fort Lewis \n     College in Colorado. In the State of Minnesota, the \n     University of Minnesota waived $2,600,000 in tuition for \n     Native American Indian students in fiscal year 2012.\n       (F) Native American Indian student tuition waiver benefits \n     are now at risk of being\n\n[[Page S1594]]\n\n     terminated by severe budget constraints being experienced by \n     these colleges and the States which support them.\n       (2) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this section to ensure \n     that Federal funding is provided in order to relieve \n     constrained State education budgets and to support and \n     sustain the longstanding Federal mandate requiring colleges \n     and States to waive, in certain circumstances, tuition \n     charges for Native American Indian students admitted to an \n     undergraduate college program, including the waiver of \n     tuition charges for Native American Indian students who are \n     not residents of the State in which the college is located.\n       (c) State Relief From Federal Mandate.--Part A of title III \n     of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1057 et seq.) \n     is amended by inserting after section 319 the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 319A. STATE RELIEF FROM FEDERAL HIGHER EDUCATION \n                   MANDATE.\n\n       ``(a) Amount of Payment.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), for \n     fiscal year 2014 and each succeeding fiscal year, the \n     Secretary shall pay to any eligible college an amount equal \n     to the charges for tuition for such year for all Native \n     American Indian students who--\n       ``(A) are not residents of the State in which the college \n     is located; and\n       ``(B) are enrolled in the college for the academic year \n     ending before the beginning of such fiscal year.\n       ``(2) Eligible colleges.--For purposes of this section, an \n     eligible college is any institution of higher education \n     serving Native American Indian students that provides \n     tuition-free education as mandated by Federal statute, with \n     the support of the State in which it is located, to Native \n     American Indian students in fulfillment of a condition under \n     which the college or State received its original grant of \n     land and facilities from the United States.\n       ``(3) Limitation.--The amount paid to any eligible college \n     for each fiscal year under paragraph (1) may not exceed the \n     amount equal to the charges for tuition for all Native \n     American Indian students of that college who were not \n     residents of the State in which the college is located and \n     who were enrolled in the college for academic year 2012-2013.\n       ``(b) Treatment of Payment.--Any amounts received by an \n     eligible college under this section shall be treated as a \n     reimbursement from the State in which the college is located, \n     and shall be considered as provided in fulfillment of any \n     Federal mandate upon the State to admit Native American \n     Indian students free of charge of tuition.\n       ``(c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall \n     be construed to relieve any State from any mandate the State \n     may have under Federal law to reimburse a college for each \n     academic year--\n       ``(1) with respect to Native American Indian students \n     enrolled in the college who are not residents of the State in \n     which the college is located, any amount of charges for \n     tuition for such students for such academic year that exceeds \n     the amount received under this section for such academic \n     year; and\n       ``(2) with respect to Native American Indian students \n     enrolled in the college who are residents of the State in \n     which the college is located, an amount equal to the charges \n     for tuition for such students for such academic year.\n       ``(d) Definition of Native American Indian Students.--In \n     this section, the term `Native American Indian students' \n     includes reference to the term `Indian pupils' as that term \n     has been utilized in Federal statutes imposing a mandate upon \n     any college or State to provide tuition-free education to \n     Native American Indian students in fulfillment of a condition \n     under which the college or State received its original grant \n     of land and facilities from the United States.''.\n       (d) Offset.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, $15,000,000 in appropriated discretionary funds are \n     hereby rescinded, on a pro rata basis, by account, from all \n     available unobligated funds.\n       (2) Implementation.--The Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget shall determine and identify from which \n     appropriation accounts the rescission under paragraph (1) \n     shall apply and the amount of such rescission that shall \n     apply to each such account. Not later than 60 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget shall submit a report to the Secretary \n     of the Treasury and Congress of the accounts and amounts \n     determined and identified for rescission under the preceding \n     sentence.\n       (3) Exception.--This subsection shall not apply to the \n     unobligated funds of the Department of Defense, the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs, or the Department of \n     Education, or any unobligated funds available to the \n     Department of the Interior for the postsecondary education of \n     Native American Indian students.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/12/senate-section/article/S1594-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1594-S1595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      committee on armed services\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 365) deploring the violent repression \n     of peaceful demonstrators in Venezuela, calling for full \n     accountability for human rights violations taking place in \n     Venezuela, and supporting the right of the Venezuelan people \n     to the free and peaceful exercise of representative \n     democracy.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I would like to express my strong support \nfor S. Res. 365, a resolution I cosponsored deploring the violent \nrepression of peaceful demonstrators in Venezuela, calling for full \naccountability for human rights violations taking place in Venezuela, \nand supporting the right of the Venezuelan people to the free and \npeaceful exercise of representative democracy.\n  Since February 4, 2014, the Venezuelan people have taken to the \nstreets on a daily basis to express frustration with the country's high \ninflation, corruption, food shortages, lack of press freedoms, lack of \ndue process, violent crime, and other grievances. Addressing these \nlegitimate concerns is a basic function of a democratic government. \nInstead, we have seen a crackdown on protests through unlawful use of \nforce, a stifling of the media, and the detention of opposition \nleaders. Over 22 people have been killed, hundreds injured, and over \n1,000 people arrested during these protests.\n  The Venezuelan Government is an elected government and, as such, it \nshould act like a democratic government by immediately addressing the \ncore concerns of its people through meaningful dialogue, halting the \nuse of force, and providing a safe space for the Venezuelan people to \nexpress their views peacefully. Without a genuine, transparent \nconversation to address the central concerns raised by the protestors, \nVenezuela faces a bleak future.\n  Contrary to comments by the Venezuelan Government, this crisis is not \nabout the United States; it is about the Venezuelan people. But the \ncrisis does have implications for peace and security in the hemisphere \nand the broader international community. The United States always has \nstood and always will stand for basic freedoms, including freedom of \nspeech, freedom of assembly, and freedom of the press. We will not back \ndown on protecting and promoting these universal values, nor should the \ninternational community. It is incumbent upon neighboring countries and \nregional organizations to be vocal during this critical point, to take \na stand for universal human rights, and to expect the highest level of \nrespect for representative democracy from its hemispheric neighbor.\n  Today, we see tension and unrest around the world. Each situation is \nunique; however, the desire for fundamental human rights is universally \nrecognized. I call on my colleagues and nations around the world to \nstand up for these basic freedoms and support a path toward a stable, \npeaceful, and prosperous Venezuela.\n  Mr. CASEY.

I apologize to the Presiding Officer and all the staff, but \nI have been conducting for the last hour and a half or more a meeting \nin the classified room dealing with Ukraine. I am sorry I couldn't be \nhere, but I just couldn't because I had to conduct that meeting.\n  Mr. President, the senior Senator from Iowa is my friend, but I am \nquite disappointed in my friend the senior Senator from Iowa. This \nafternoon he delivered another one of his ``Alice in Wonderland'' \nspeeches. He has delivered a few of these, but the one today especially \nis a view of reality that only exists in fairy tales.\n  He complains that I file too many cloture motions. His complaint is \nlike that of an arsonist who complains about having to hear the sirens \nof too many fire engines.\n  The real reason I have had to file so many cloture motions is because \nRepublicans have engaged in a systematic pattern of obstruction--and \nnot last week, not last month, but this has been going on for 5 years. \nWe have come to see this as something of the pinnacle, the landmark, \nthe zenith of obstructionism led by my Republican colleagues.\n  I have now had to file cloture motions during the time I have been \nthe majority leader more than 500 times. Lyndon Johnson, who had the \njob for 6 years--I have had it a little longer than that--only had to \nface one filibuster. I have had to deal with 500.\n  I don't file cloture, as the Senator from Iowa would like folks to \nthink, in this fairy tale world he believes in, I guess, because I \nenjoy it. It is not something I enjoy. It takes a lot of my time, the \nstaff's time, the Senate's time, and the country's time. I don't like \nto do it. I file these motions because Republicans have made it clear \nthat we can't get a vote on anything without going to cloture, and that \nis basically true.\n  What is the solution of the Senator from Iowa to the problem? Listen \nto this. Now, this really is ``Alice in Wonderland.'' He proposes it \nshould take longer to file. He proposes it should take longer to file \ncloture. Now, that is some dreamland that I don't understand. He says \nthe solution to the problem of Republican obstructionism is to make \nobstruction easier.\n  We have on the Executive Calendar 140 nominations. We have \nAmbassadors--there is an Executive Calendar here someplace. The pages \nhave stripped all the desks of the calendars, but they are always \naround. The Republic of Mauritania, the Republic of Colombia--South \nAmerica is a continent that has been our friend for decades--we have \nmost all countries in Africa waiting to have Ambassadors appointed: \nZambia, Niger, Peru, Belize, Albania, Angola, Palau, Cameroon, Sierra \nLeone, Lesotho, Namibia, Tanzania, Morocco, Netherlands, Norway, \nHungary, Iceland, U.S. Human Rights Council.\n  I am not going to take more of the staff's time, but throughout this \nExecutive Calendar there are about 40 Ambassadors--40 Ambassadors--who \nare waiting to be confirmed and 35 or so judges. Do the math yourself. \nThat is 75 or 80 very important jobs they have stopped.\n  So my friend from Iowa is living in a dream world. I don't know where \nit exists, but it doesn't exist here in the Senate. And his solution is \nto give them more time? Can you imagine that. This is an ``Alice in \nWonderland'' speech from the Senator from Iowa, and he should have \nbetter use of his time than playing fairy tales in the Senate.\n  The obstruction led by Republican Senators from all over this country \nis an embarrassment to our country. It is preventing the people of this \ncountry from getting what they need.\n  Now, I know people around the country are not too worried about an \nAmbassador to some foreign country, but to our country it is important. \nOur foreign policy is important. Being able to get work done here \nlegislatively is important, and we have been stymied every step of the \nway.\n  I am sorry to say my friend has stepped over the line with his speech \nhere today about what a terrible thing has happened here, that we have \nfiled cloture 500 times. The record speaks for itself.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/12/senate-section/article/S1596-2", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, MARCH 13, 2014\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.
