Mr. President, today we are going to continue work on the \nDefense bill. It is really an important measure, and that is an \nunderstatement. It safeguards this Nation. It ensures our troops have \nthe resources and training they need. It provides for military families \nwho support our fighting men and women. This is a serious bill, and it \ndeserves serious debate--not to be bogged down by unrelated political \nissues.\n  For example, this legislation encompasses a lot of issues, including \na pay raise for members of our Armed Forces. It authorizes dozens of \nspecial pay rates and bonuses, such as bonus payments for \nservicemembers who see combat or who are stationed overseas.\n  This important legislation also includes robust and far-reaching \nprovisions to combat the scourge of sexual assault in the military, \nincluding changes that would ensure perpetrators are punished and \nvictims are protected. Senators Levin, Gillibrand, McCaskill, and \nothers have done exceptionally good work to confront this problem. As \nwe build on their work, there are additional amendments concerning \nmilitary sexual assault the Senate needs to consider.\n  The Senate must also consider amendments relating to the Guantanamo \nBay detention center. Everyone is aware that we cannot complete this \nbill until we vote on the sexual assault and Guantanamo provisions.\n  I know this bill has a lot of provisions people would like to change. \nFrankly, we won't be able to change a lot of it. The committee did \nreally good work in coming up with the bill. The two issues I have just \ntalked about, though, must have votes. I would accept the language in \nthe Defense bill as it relates to Guantanamo; I think it is a \nsignificant improvement. But my Republican colleagues want to have an \nopportunity to change that, and I understand that. That is why I said \nthat should be the first measure we vote on. I have said that more than \nonce, and I say it again.\n  The matter dealing with sexual assault is a controversial matter, and \nwe have to have a vote on that. We have to do that. That is why I said \nthat is the second most important issue we deal with in this bill.\n  Why couldn't we get these two important issues out of the way? I am \nspeaking only for myself. If we have votes on those two measures, I \nthink the bill would be ready to go to conference. I know people don't \nlike to hear that, but I think that is, in fact, the case.\n  The time, effort, and wisdom led by Senator Levin to come up with a \nbill, working with the new ranking member Senator Inhofe has been a \nlabor of love for both of them. But these two issues need to be \nresolved on the Senate floor. I ask that it be done.\n  I asked last night by unanimous consent to get these things done, but \nthere was objection from my Republican colleagues. So if we can't vote \neven on these amendments to these two crucial issues--and I know there \nare other issues, but no one can in any way disparage what I have just \nsaid, that these are two very important issues. Everyone, I think, \nagrees they have to be considered before we can complete the work on \nthis underlying legislation. So if we can't get these two votes done, \nhow are we going to address any of the other issues we need to work on?\n\n[[Page S8144]]\n\n  Maybe I shouldn't be optimistic, but I can be hopeful that we will be \nable to schedule votes on these amendments soon. In the meantime, \nSenators should not wait to debate these issues. Let's take just these \ntwo issues until we schedule votes on these amendments. Senators should \ncome to the floor to speak on the issues now. There is a limited time \nto complete this bill before the Thanksgiving holiday, and Senators \nshould use that time wisely to engage in meaningful debate.\n  I am totally aware of the number of Senators who wish to offer \namendments on other issues as well, both defense-related and otherwise. \nSo Senators should file their amendments, and I hope we can figure out \na way to have a robust amendment process. However, we cannot allow this \nimportant legislation to be sidetracked by debates on amendments \nunrelated to our Nation's defense.\n  Our Nation's defense is a relative term and some people have \ndifferent ideas as to what that should mean. But the United States has \npassed this bill for more than half a century. This is a sign of \nrespect for this institution and for the people this legislation \nrepresents--our Nation's Armed Forces. So let's give this bill the \nrespect it deserves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/19/senate-section/article/S8144-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, over the past few weeks, we have seen \nvivid, painful confirmation of the predictions that many of us made \nabout ObamaCare. Most notable among them, perhaps, was the President's \noften repeated promise: ``If you like your plan, you can keep it.'' \n``If you like your plan, you can keep it,'' he said. But we were always \ndoubtful that could possibly be true.\n  This was always what Democrats thought they had to tell the American \npeople in order to muscle ObamaCare into law. They knew it wouldn't \nwork otherwise. They knew the truth would not sell and, of course, that \nis all coming out now.\n  But we are also learning a lot of other very unsettling things about \nthis law, such as the fact that a lot of things that were working well \nin our health care system are now being thrown out for no good reason \nby the same people who brought us the ObamaCare Web site.\n  High-risk pools are a good example. About three dozen States set up \nthese kinds of pools to ensure Americans with serious medical \nconditions, such as those suffering from diabetes and heart disease, \nwould have a place to turn. High-risk pools have often proved \nsuccessful and popular among the communities they serve. They currently \nprovide insurance to hundreds of thousands of Americans, including \nthousands of Kentuckians, nearly all of them with preexisting \nconditions--the very people the law was supposed to help. These folks \nbenefit from this coverage and many want to keep it. Unfortunately, \nthat would no longer be possible under ObamaCare. Nearly all of them \nwill lose their coverage at the end of the year.\n  Just as millions of other Americans across the country, folks who \nlike the coverage they have in these high-risk pools--and remember, I \nam talking about some of the most vulnerable people in our society--are \nnow discovering they won't be able to keep it, either, despite what the \nPresident told us again and again. As it turns out, the folks who ran \nthis law through Congress think people in these high-risk pools belong \nin ObamaCare instead. They don't think it matters whether my \nconstituents want to get dumped into ObamaCare or not; they made that \ndecision for them.\n  A lot of folks in Kentucky don't think this is right and they are \nupset, and not just because they are losing their plan and all the \nhassle and complication that involves. For many of these folks, the \nplans they are being forced into have more limited hospital and doctor \nnetworks than the plans they currently have. As one State official \nrecently put it, ``If you're in the middle of chemotherapy, the last \nthing you want to do is switch oncologists.''\n  We seem to see these kinds of stories just about every day now. There \nis the North Carolina woman with a severe heart condition who said she \ndidn't know if her cardiologist and her procedures would be covered \nunder ObamaCare. Here is what she said: ``It's . . . the uncertainty \nthat gets to me.''\n  There is the breast cancer survivor and her husband who have been \npaying about $800 a month for premiums in a high-risk pool. After that \npolicy was canceled, they expected lower rates under ObamaCare. \nInstead, they found their premium and deductibles could actually be \ngoing up.\n  This is scary stuff. But these are the real-life consequences of \nObamaCare. This is no longer some theoretical policy discussion. I \nwould suggest that as we contemplate the future of this law, our \nDemocratic friends should start paying closer attention to stories such \nas these because it is not enough to have a messaging strategy and to \nplay the old Washington game by trying to weather the PR storm until \nfolks move on.\n  These stories we are hearing from our constituents are literally \nheartbreaking. This is not some hassle to move past. It is a problem to \nsolve. It is what we were sent here for, and it is what health care \nreform should be about--about helping folks, not hurting them.\n  We do not need to get past this news cycle, as some of the White \nHouse spinners seem to think. What we need to get past is a White House \nmentality that told us last week that passing a bill to codify the very \npromise the President made to sell the bill would gut ObamaCare. We \nneed to get past a mentality that caused the President to issue a veto \nthreat on a law that would let him keep his promise to the American \npeople about keeping the health care plans they have and like.\n  It is almost comical watching the contortions the administration is \nmaking trying to explain this fiasco away. Over the weekend we learned \nthrough a White House leak to the Washington Post that the President's \nnew definition of success for the ObamaCare Web site is four out of \nfive users making it through the checkout line--four out of five users \nmaking it through the checkout line. Who thinks that is acceptable? I \ncertainly do not, and I cannot think of anybody outside the White House \ncompound who will think that is acceptable either.\n  Frankly, if this is the President's way of restoring credibility on \nthis law, by leaking that the Web site will not even work for one out \nof five users just a few days after vowing it would soon be up and \nrunning like a top, well, he has some work to do. The bar for clarity, \nhonesty, and success under ObamaCare has sunk to new lows.\n  Look, if you are being treated for cancer and about to be dumped into \nObamaCare, the last thing you want to hear is that leaving one out of \nfive people behind is now considered an ObamaCare win. We are talking \nabout people's lives here. This kind of mindset--whether we are talking \nabout a Web site or anything else--is deeply worrying.\n  But then again this has always been the problem with blind faith in \nmassive government programs. It is the old idea that we should not let \nthe evidence get in the way of a good theory. That is the mindset the \nsupporters of this law are stuck in right now--just blindly adhering to \nthe hope that this program will work against all the evidence. It is \npretty distressing. It is going to have to change if we are going to \nget anywhere.\n\n[[Page S8145]]\n\n  The real question right now should be obvious: What is the \nadministration's plan to turn all this around? We know they have a \npress plan. What is the policy plan? What is the policy plan? Does the \nadministration have anything of substance to tell folks who are losing \ntheir plans? Does it have anything to tell folks in these high-risk \npools who could be losing their doctors? Does anyone over there know--\nanyone?\n  I have said this before and I will say it again: These are people's \nlives we are talking about. So it is time for a reality check. The \ndefenders of ObamaCare have a choice: Stand up for your constituents or \ndefend a law that is falling apart before our very eyes, a law that \nthreatens to drag down the quality and affordability of care for \nmillions--literally millions--of Americans who need it, including those \nmost in need.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/19/senate-section/article/S8145-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, later this morning the Senate is going to \nresume consideration of S. 1197, the National Defense Authorization Act \nfor Fiscal Year 2014. I will have a full statement to make on this \nlegislation later today. However, I would like to take just a moment to \ntalk to my colleagues about where we are on the bill and how we would \nlike to proceed.\n  Last night, the majority leader asked for unanimous consent to bring \nup side-by-side amendments on subjects that we know we need to debate \nand vote on--military detention at Guantanamo and sexual assault and \nmisconduct in the military. Each amendment and side-by-side was to be \nsubject to a 60-vote threshold. Unfortunately, there was an objection \nto this request. As a result of that objection, the majority leader \nfilled the amendment tree on our bill.\n  Now we are in a position where we are going to need the cooperation \nof all Senators to get this important bill passed, as we must, in the \nlimited time available to us before Thanksgiving week in order that we \nwill have time to go to conference, get a conference report, and bring \nthat conference report back to the House and Senate.\n  It remains our intention to bring up and vote on as many relevant \namendments to the bill as possible, and I know the Republican manager, \nranking member Senator Inhofe, shares this objective. Toward this end I \nexpect there will be further attempts later in the day to reach a \nunanimous consent agreement on the first amendments to be brought up, \nand that will be a repeated unanimous consent request that was offered \nlast night for those first two amendments.\n  It is also our intention to clear amendments, as we have always done \non this bill. I urge our colleagues, if you have amendments, to file \nthem, bring them to us, so we can try to clear them. The majority and \nminority staffs of the Armed Services Committee are working hard. We \nhope to have a first package of cleared amendments ready for \nconsideration later today, and we will continue to go through that \nprocess during the week.\n  Finishing this bill is going to be a very difficult task. We have \nmanaged to do it for the last 51 years, and I am confident, with the \ncooperation of all Senators, we will be able to do it again this year. \nWe must for the sake of our troops, their families, and our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/19/senate-section/article/S8145-5", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8145-S8151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SEXUAL ASSAULT IN THE MILITARY\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today we, of course, are beginning the \ndebate on the National Defense Authorization Act. Throughout the next \nhour, and throughout the rest of the day, you will see the women of the \nSenate take the floor, one, in support of our military but also to \nexpress their concern and their ideas on how to deal with sexual \nviolence in the military. You will see in the next hour our ideas--the \nfact that we have excellent ideas in the bill--and then we will have a \nrobust debate on how to even further enhance this process.\n  This is a compelling national problem. When you join the military and \nyou face the enemy, you should not have to fear the enemy within. No \nwoman should be a victim of rape by a fellow soldier or seaman or \ncorpsman. No man should face the same sexual attack and call it hazing. \nThere is no place in the U.S. military for violence against one member \nof the military by another.\n  I am pretty fed up. I am fed up with lip service and empty promises \nand zero tolerance policies and task force after task force after task \nforce. I am an old-timer in this institution. I have been here for 25 \nyears, and I have worked on this issue every year. Ever since I first \ncame here there has been some repugnant occurrence--from when I was a \nbrandnew Senator and I had to deal with a situation at the Naval \nAcademy where a female midshipman was chained to a urinal at the Naval \nAcademy and taunted for 3 hours by fellow midshipmen, until she was \nfreed by a visiting Air Force cadet, getting her out of handcuffs at \nher own Naval Academy. Then there was Tailhook. Then there were other \nkinds of incidents.\n  Statistics after statistics. There are 26,000 reasons why we are on \nthe floor today. Mr. President, 26,000 sexual assaults have occurred in \nour U.S. military this past year.\n  Then we look at the service academies training the future leaders--15 \nattacks at the Naval Academy, 15 attacks at West Point, and over 50 \nattacks at the U.S. Air Force Academy.\n  Now is the time to do something, to do something bold, to do \nsomething strong and something unequivocal, something victims can have \nconfidence in, where the accused can feel the process will be fair and \nwe restore the confidence in the U.S. military to stop this and to deal \nwith their own.\n  I am proud of the leadership taken by the women in the Senate and the \nwomen on the Armed Services Committee. There are now seven women on the \nArmed Services Committee--five Democrats and two Republicans. Wow, do \nthey work on a bipartisan basis with the leadership of the committee. \nWe appreciate the work of the fine men who have supported us in dealing \nwith this issue. We particularly thank Chairman Levin for his \nleadership, and we acknowledge the role of Senator Inhofe. By the way, \nall of the women of the Senate wish to express our sincere condolences \nto Senator Inhofe on the loss of his beloved son, Dr. Perry Inhofe.\n  This is not just a women-only fight. This is a fight to make sure our \nmilitary continues to be the best in the world and that when you serve, \nthere is an enemy outside that we will always face, but there is an \nenemy within that we need to now end.\n  We, the women of the Senate--all of us--agree on the goals. We want \nto be able to provide prosecutorial tools for punishment, we want to \nensure fairness in the process, and we want to make sure we get help to \nthe victims.\n  The National Defense Authorization Act has more than 30 reforms in it \nto accomplish that. Thirteen relate to prosecutorial reforms, 10 are \nreforms to improve victims' services, 2 reforms\n\n[[Page S8146]]\n\nare to improve training of first responders, and 5 also deal with \nvarious kinds of reporting.\n  I am so pleased that the bill works to prevent retaliation against \nsomeone who reports a crime. So if you feel you have been a victim of \nsexual assault you are not retaliated against by stepping forward, \nwhere you are then doubly victimized, both by the attack and then by \nthose who want to squelch the fact that you want to bring the attack to \nthe surface and to follow some kind of redress and to also get help.\n  It also eliminates the statute of limitations on courts-martial for \nsexual crimes. It requires a review of decisions by commanders not to \nprosecute and requires dishonorable discharge for anyone convicted of a \nsexual assault.\n  The bill ensures that every victim gets access to legal counsel and \nsupport. This is very important. It is important not only to me and the \nother women, but it is important to the person who would be injured. \nFirst responders must have training in sexual assault. There are others \nthat could be elaborated on.\n  Sexual assault in the military continues to rise. It is a problem, as \nI said. I am worried about the men and women every day, to be sure that \nthey are well trained and well protected.\n  Unfortunately, many of these acts of violence are unreported, \nunprosecuted, and unpunished. DOD's own annual report gives us a \npicture of why victims do not report these crimes. Fifty percent do not \nthink anything will be done, 43 percent believe they will not be \nbelieved, and 47 percent are afraid of retaliation.\n  The reforms in this bill deal with those fears and their concerns. We \nare ready to reform, revise, and standardize how the military deals \nwith these problems. These reforms will change the way the military \nthinks and how they act.\n  During the course of this whole process, we have met with victims and \nheard their stories, we have met with experts and advocates, we have \nmet with the military themselves. Now we are ready to give all \nconcerned in this a voice by using the Defense bill for a vehicle for \nserious and significant reform. We have been able to do this because we \nhave worked together on both sides of the aisle, working with the \nleadership of the committee--30 reforms that people can count on for \nfairness in the process for the accused but also help to those who feel \nthey have been victimized but to be sure they are not victimized by the \nvery system they count on.\n  I eagerly look forward to hearing from my senior Republican colleague \nSenator Collins.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. First, I wish to commend the senior Senator from \nMaryland, the dean of the women Senators, for organizing this debate \ntoday on an issue that concerns each of us; that is, the growing crisis \nof sexual assault in the military.\n  I first raised my concern over the military's inadequate response to \nthe growing crisis of sexual assault nearly 10 years ago. I remember it \nwell. It was a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee in \n2004, at which I expressed my growing alarm about the number of sexual \nassaults in the military and the inadequate response by the leaders of \nthe military to provide adequate care for the survivors and to ensure \nappropriate punishment for the perpetrators of these reprehensible \ncrimes.\n  In an exchange I had with GEN George Casey, I stated the military \nneeds to be much more responsive to reports of sexual assault, \nparticularly in the field, and to separate these women and, in some \ncases, the male victims, from their alleged attackers. The Department \nmust also vigorously prosecute offenders and hold commanders \naccountable for establishing zero tolerance policies.\n  To say that General Casey's response was disappointing would be an \nunderstatement. I am convinced that if the military had heeded the \nconcerns that I and others such as Senator Mikulski raised a decade \nago, this terrible problem would have been addressed much sooner, \nsaving many individuals from the trauma, the pain, and the injustice \nthey endured.\n  Back then, sadly, the attitude of the high-ranking officials who were \ntestifying at that 2004 hearing was dismissive, even though these \ncrimes never should have occurred in the first place, traumatized the \nsurvivors, and eroded the trust and discipline that are fundamental to \nevery military unit. Thankfully, the attitude I perceive amongst senior \nmilitary officers today is markedly different from the one I \nencountered 9 years ago. The work of translating the military's stated \npolicy of zero tolerance into reality, however, remains unfinished \nbusiness. Fostering a culture of zero tolerance so that the number of \nassaults is greatly diminished remains a goal, not reality. Ensuring \nthat survivors do not think twice about reporting an assault for fear \nof retaliation or damage to their careers is still not part of the \nmilitary culture.\n  In 2011, I joined our former colleague John Kerry in coauthoring the \nDefense STRONG Act as an initial step to address this crisis. \nProvisions of that bill were signed into law as part of the fiscal year \n2012 National Defense Authorization Act. They provide survivors of \nsexual assault the assistance of advocates with genuine \nconfidentiality. They provide guaranteed access to an attorney and \nexpedited consideration to be transferred far away from their \nassailant.\n  Earlier this year I introduced the Coast Guard STRONG Act to extend \nthese protections to Coast Guard members. I thank Chairman Levin, \nRanking Member Inhofe, and Senator McCaskill for their work to include \nthese provisions in this year's NDAA.\n  More than anything, survivors need to have the confidence that the \nlegal system in which they report a crime will produce a just and fair \nresult. Based upon data from the Department of Defense's most recent \nsexual assault prevention and response survey, that view is not held by \nenough servicemembers or survivors.\n  As a result, I have supported and introduced legislation with \nSenators Gillibrand and McCaskill aimed at reducing the barriers to \njustice that many survivors of sexual assault currently face in the \nmilitary.\n  I commend both Senator Gillibrand and Senator McCaskill for their \nextraordinary leadership and dedication to resolving this unacceptable \nproblem.\n  Let me also thank Chairman Levin and Ranking Member Inhofe for \nincorporating significant provisions from both bills into the NDAA.\n  In fact, there are more than 26 provisions specifically targeting \nsexual assault in the military in the bill that we are debating today. \nFor example--and there are many, but I wish to highlight one because it \nwas part of a bill Senator McCaskill and I introduced--the legislation \nmandates a dishonorable discharge or dismissal for any servicemember \nconvicted of sexual assault. This came from a bipartisan, bicameral \nbill, the BE SAFE Act, that I introduced with Senator McCaskill, \nCongresswoman Niki Tsongas, and Congressman Mike Turner earlier this \nyear.\n  In addition, the NDAA eliminates the ability of a convening authority \nto overturn a conviction by a jury post-trial for major offenses.\n  It permits a commander to relocate an alleged perpetrator of a sexual \nassault crime rather than relocating the survivor following an attack.\n  It eliminates certain factors, such as the alleged character of the \naccused, that a commander can consider in deciding how to dispose of an \noffense so that these decisions are based on evidence and the law.\n  Finally, the bill includes a provision I support that requires the \nmilitary to provide an attorney dedicated to the interests of survivors \nof sexual assaults who can provide legal advice and assistance when \nsurvivors need such assistance the most.\n  There are many other important provisions that are included in this \nbill. Our work will not be complete until the Pentagon has demonstrated \nthat it is fully enforcing its stated policy of zero tolerance for \nsexual assault.\n  There are strong views in the Pentagon and in Congress on how best to \naddress this issue beyond the 26 provisions in the bill before us. \nThere is much debate on what it means for the military's unique legal \nsystem.\n  One of the criticisms I have heard is that we should wait a few more \nmonths for the results of still more studies or\n\n[[Page S8147]]\n\nperhaps even wait a few more years to see if recently enacted \nprovisions have made a difference. I strongly disagree. How many more \nvictims are required to suffer before we take additional action? How \nmany more lives must be ruined before we act? Rather than waiting for \nthe results of yet more studies, we must debate proposals to increase \nthe confidence of survivors and increase prevention efforts now until \nwe have proved that the military has, indeed, fostered a culture of \nzero tolerance in which survivors are no longer concerned about \nretaliation from their peers or even their commanders.\n  This is why I have decided to support Senator Gillibrand's amendment \nto this bill. This was not an easy decision, as there are valid \narguments on both sides. Senator Gillibrand's amendment takes aim \nsquarely at the problem of victims failing to report sexual assault. In \nmy judgment, her amendment will encourage more victims to report sexual \nassaults, and that is absolutely critical.\n  There can be no question about the Senate's commitment to reducing \nthe instances of sexual assault in the military and to providing \nappropriate care for survivors. As we debate various proposals, we are \nunited by the need for the serious reforms that are included already in \nthis bill and that will enhance the military's response to sexual \nassault.\n  I wish to thank all of those on the Armed Services Committee, \nparticularly the two leaders, Senator McCaskill and Senator Gillibrand, \nfor their excellent work.\n  I am certain our work on the NDAA will make a real difference in \nreducing unnecessary suffering, injury, and injustice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank my colleagues Senator Collins and Senator \nMikulski for their leadership on this issue and for bringing this \nimportant discussion to the floor today.\n  I also thank Senator Murkowski, who I see in the Chamber as well, who \nhas been a leader. Also, I thank Senator McCaskill, who has been a \nleader in the Armed Services Committee with me.\n  This has been an issue that has brought people together. It has \nbrought people together for the right reasons. This is an issue that \nthe women of the Senate have really driven, but it is important to \nunderstand that this is not a woman's issue. The issue of ending sexual \nassaults in our military is an issue for everyone. This is an issue \nabout justice. This is an issue about fairness. This is about making \nsure that victims of crimes, both men and women, get the justice they \ndeserve, the support they deserve in our military, and that they \nunderstand and appreciate that we want them to have a climate in the \nmilitary where if they are a victim, they can come forward and receive \nthe support they need and that they deserve.\n  Finally, this is also about the character of our military. We are \nblessed to have the very best military in the world, but when there is \na plague of sexual assaults such as we have seen in our military, it \nundermines the very fabric of our military in terms of our readiness, \nin terms of our preparedness, and in terms of the cohesiveness of our \nunits.\n  This is why it is not only important that we address and support the \nvictims of these crimes, that we end sexual assault in our military, \nbut that we have a climate in our military that says: If you are a \ncommander and you do not stop sexual assaults, prevent sexual assaults, \nhave a climate in your unit that says zero tolerance, this is not going \nto happen; if a victim comes forward in your unit and you don't handle \nthis the right way, do the right thing, support victims, and ensure \nthat perpetrators are held accountable, you will be relieved from \ncommand.\n  That is the climate in which all of the reforms in this Defense \nauthorization are brought forward, where we work together across the \naisle with very strong provisions to support victims.\n  One of those provisions is a special victims counsel. Senator Patty \nMurray and I introduced a bill, stand-alone, to ensure, based upon a \npilot program in the Air Force, that victims of sexual assault will \nactually now have their own lawyer, someone to represent them and their \ninterests, to know that if they come forward there is someone looking \nout for them. That is one of the provisions contained in this Defense \nauthorization bill, to ensure that every victim will have someone who \nstands for them.\n  In addition to that is retaliation. We have now made retaliation \nagainst victims a crime under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. \nThis is to say to victims that if they come forward and for some reason \nare retaliated against, then whoever does that will be guilty of a \ncrime. This is sending the message to please come forward, we want to \nsupport you, and we want to be sure the perpetrators are held \naccountable.\n  In addition, I believe that if we want to solve this problem, the \nprovisions in this bill that people have worked together on are very \nstrong. I thank the chairman of the Armed Services Committee and the \nranking member for their work together.\n  We are going to pass in this Chamber unprecedented reforms that \nensure that the military understands this is not an issue anymore that \ncan be left in the closet. This is not an issue that can be quietly \nspoken of where victims feel they can't come forward. The reforms in \nthis bill are very tough. They support victims. They hold commanders \naccountable, and they make sure we do not see what we have seen in the \npast, things such as commanders overturning the verdicts. That will be \ndone under this bill. That is not allowed anymore if this bill passes \non the floor.\n  So I simply come to the floor today to say there is so much we have \nagreed upon that is going to address this issue in the military, and I \nthank all my colleagues on the floor today for their leadership. We \nwill not let this rest. The one thing I do know, for those of us who \nserve on the Armed Services Committee and those who are here in the \nChamber who do not serve on the Armed Services Committee but serve on \nother important committees, including the Appropriations Committee, \ndespite the unprecedented reforms I believe we are going to pass on a \nbipartisan basis to end sexual assault in the military and to ensure \nvictims are supported, we are not going to let this go. This is not \ngoing to be something where we pass these reforms and that is the end \nof the story. Every few months we are going to be asking: What have you \ndone to implement these reforms? Every few months we are going to be \nexpecting a report back to the Senate to ensure that what we all have \nintended to occur here--that is the right thing for victims of crime, \nthat is the right thing for our military--is getting done.\n  So while I am very proud of everything we have done and we will do \nwhen we pass the Defense authorization bill on a bipartisan basis to \nstand against sexual assault in our military, this is not the end of \nthe story. We will continue to pursue this to make sure that our \nmilitary understands they are accountable, that victims of crime \nunderstand that while in the military they will be supported, that we \nwill not let this go.\n  I thank the Chair and my colleagues for their leadership and \neverything they have done to support victims of crime and to end sexual \nassault in our military.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in \nhighlighting the epidemic of sexual assault in our Nation's armed \nservices, and I am glad to join many of my colleagues here--the \nSenators from Maine and New Hampshire and our leader, the Senator from \nMaryland--in making sure the voices of women are heard in this debate.\n  We know that in May 2013 the Defense Department released a report \nthat showed 26,000 incidents of unwanted sexual contact among \nservicemembers. That is an increase of 35 percent over 2 years.\n  In my State, Washingtonians are very proud of the incredible men and \nwomen who keep our country safe and defend us, and we are proud of the \n10 military installations across our State. There are more than 65,000 \nmen and women serving in military installations in the State of \nWashington--places such as Joint Base Lewis-McChord, the Puget Sound \nNaval Shipyard, Naval Station Everett, Naval Base Kitsap, Whidbey \nIsland Naval Air Station, Bangor Naval Submarine\n\n[[Page S8148]]\n\nBase, and Fairchild Air Force Base. So we took it seriously when there \nwere 116 reports of sexual assault across all of these installations in \nthe State of Washington in 2010. That number is too high, and that is \nonly the amount that is being reported. We know there may be many \nassaults that go unreported.\n  As my colleagues are saying, we need to do everything we can to \naddress this problem. I am pleased that Joint Base Lewis-McChord is \ndeveloping a sexual assault prevention program, and I urge my \ncolleagues in the Senate to act to address this epidemic problem. The \nmen and women of our Armed Forces are basically defending our country, \nso why are we leaving them unprotected while they serve?\n  I have cosponsored legislation authored by my colleague the senior \nSenator from Washington to provide special victims' counsel to victims \nof sexual assault. This will ensure that professionals trained in \ndealing with sexual assault are there to support the victims.\n  There may be differing opinions on how best to achieve the overall \ngoals of reducing sexual assault in the military, but I believe all my \ncolleagues can agree on one common goal: protecting the victims from \nfurther abuse. We need to put an end to an environment that allows \nsexual assault to occur and that lets the perpetrators go unpunished \nand discourages victims of sexual assault through fear and \nintimidation. Again, we may differ on how to best achieve that goal, \nbut we are all here to say the same thing: Enough is enough. We will \nnot tolerate sexual assault in the military and Armed Forces, and we \nowe it to our servicemembers to come together and act toward a solution \ntoday. That is why my colleagues are here--to emphasize this point in a \nway that speaks volumes about how this tragedy is affecting men and \nwomen in the armed services and the fact that this institution needs to \ncome together to address it.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank my friends, the good Senator \nfrom Maryland, the dean of the women in the Senate, and the Senator \nfrom Maine, who have organized this portion of the debate this morning. \nI acknowledge and thank the other women of the Senate who are here this \nmorning to speak on an issue we would all agree is something that must \nbe addressed and that for far too long has not seen the redress it \ncommands. So we stand together unified in an effort to truly make a \ndifference.\n  I acknowledge the good work particularly of Senators McCaskill and \nGillibrand, who have worked to raise the awareness of sexual assault in \nthe military. They have truly advanced the discussion to the point \nwhere for the first time in far too long we will make substantive, \nmeaningful headway when it comes to addressing sexual assault, sexual \nharassment, and what has been called or referred to as military sexual \ntrauma. Working together I think we do have that momentum, that push to \ntruly address these areas in a meaningful way.\n  When the Senate passes the National Defense Authorization Act for \n2014, it will be evident to all that we have sent a very strong message \non these issues--a very united message, clearly bipartisan.\n  It should be clear to all who have been following the debates--first \nin the Armed Services Committee and now here on the floor--there are \ndifferences of opinion within this body about how we address the \ncrisis. But there is no difference of opinion that we must address the \ncrisis. That means how to create a culture that prevents the kinds of \nincidents we are talking about from ever occurring; how we work to \nprotect the rights of victims; how to ensure that justice and \naccountability are achieved in an open and transparent fashion so that \nvictims know there is a system that works for them and so that our \nconstituents know and we here in Congress have that confidence again. \nRight now that confidence does not exist.\n  We recognize that there remain differences across the body in how to \nachieve the elimination of sexual assault, sexual harassment, and \nmilitary sexual trauma. I believe the amendment offered by our \ncolleague from New York Senator Gillibrand is the best medicine for a \ndifficult situation that has been allowed to languish for far too long.\n  This afternoon I intend to spend a little more time explaining why \nthe amendment of Senator Gillibrand, although it is strong medicine and \nit is disruptive of the status quo, is the right way to go. But my \npurpose this morning in joining with my female colleagues here in the \nSenate is not to argue for or against one amendment or another; it is \nto point out that the NDAA, as reported by the Armed Services \nCommittee, includes many provisions--so many provisions--that truly \nhave a positive impact going forward.\n  I would also point out that during the course of our debate on the \nNDAA, the Senate may consider other amendments that enjoy broad \nsupport. My colleague, the Senator from California Mrs. Boxer spoke \neloquently last night about her amendment that will protect victims' \nrights in article 32 proceedings. This amendment has drawn good, strong \nsupport from those who support the approach of Senator Gillibrand as \nwell as those who oppose it. I am proud to cosponsor the amendment of \nSenator Boxer. It is good legislation, and I hope we can come together \nto adopt it.\n  I have submitted amendment No. 2141. This ensures that cadets and \nmidshipmen at our Nation's service academies have access to special \nvictims' counsel and sexual assault nurse examiners. Another of my \namendments, No. 2143, requires reports from the heads of our service \nacademies on the services available to victims of military sexual \ntrauma. I would certainly hope these noncontroversial amendments can be \noffered and accepted at the appropriate time.\n  I think all of these ideas--those mentioned by my colleague from New \nHampshire, those addressed by my colleague from Maine and others--will \nall help to make a difference, but I think we recognize that this is \njust the beginning of solving the problem. The Congress of the United \nStates can encourage good behavior and can sanction bad behavior, but \nwhat we cannot do is legislate good culture.\n  Over the next few days we are going to hear a good many words about \nthe importance of the chain of command in maintaining good culture. \nSome will argue that our efforts to ensure bad behavior is sanctioned \nwill cause the chain of command to abandon this responsibility. I don't \naccept this proposition. Regardless of how we dispose of the amendment \nof Senator Gillibrand or the amendment of Senator McCaskill, it is the \nresponsibility of the chain of command to provide for good order and \ndiscipline and sound military culture always. This is a nondelegable \nduty of those who accept positions of leadership and responsibility \nwithin our Armed Forces.\n  Those who wear the uniform reflect the values of this country, and \nevery action they take must uphold those values. Sometimes, though, one \nhas to wonder, does the chain of command get it? To illustrate a point, \nI want to share a sad story. This is a story Senator Gillibrand and I \nshare.\n  The soldier's name was Danny Chen. He grew up in New York City's \nChinatown. He joined the Army, and he was assigned to Fort Wainwright \nin Fairbanks, AK. From there he was deployed to Afghanistan. He was \nfound dead in Afghanistan of what the Army described as ``an apparent \nself-inflicted gunshot wound.''\n  New York Magazine describes his experience in Afghanistan this way: A \ngroup of his superiors allegedly tormented Chen on an almost daily \nbasis over the course of about 6 weeks in Afghanistan. They singled him \nout. He was their only Chinese-American soldier. They spit racial slurs \nat him. They forced him to do sprints while carrying a sandbag. They \nordered him to crawl along gravel-covered ground while they flung rocks \nat him. One day, when his unit was assembling a tent, he was forced to \nwear a hard hat and shout out instructions to his fellow soldiers in \nChinese.\n  Danny Chen's story is not about sexual assault or sexual harassment, \nbut it is about harassment. It is about the kind of extreme behavior \nthat has no place--absolutely no place--in the Armed Forces of this \nworld's greatest democracy, just as sexual harassment and military \nsexual trauma have no place in our Armed Forces.\n\n[[Page S8149]]\n\n  This week we have the opportunity to send a strong statement to the \nchain of command that they need to clean up the culture. Never again \nshould we have to speak of a culture that allows harassment, assault, \nand trauma generated from within to fester within our military.\n  So I join with my colleagues this morning in unity for the victims \nand for a change--a change that will realign the reality that our \nservicemembers seem to face in the Armed Forces with the values of the \ngreatest democracy on Earth.\n  I thank the Chair and my colleagues, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the National \nDefense Authorization Act and how the Senate, and particularly the \nwomen of the Senate, are working to address the crisis of military \nsexual assault.\n  I thank Senators Mikulski and Collins for organizing and bringing us \ntogether this morning. I thank Senators Levin and Inhofe for their \nleadership, and I thank Senators McCaskill and Gillibrand for working \non this critical legislation over the course of the past year. Of \ncourse, I thank all of the women of the Senate. We have heard from many \nof them this morning and will hear from more because this is an \nincredible year--a year that I hope will be remembered as a decisive \none in the effort to eradicate military sexual assault once and for \nall.\n  We are all too well aware that sexual assault continues to plague our \nArmed Forces. We have all seen the horrifying numbers. In 2012, the \nDepartment of Defense received 3,374 reports of sexual assault in the \nmilitary. But by the DOD's own estimates, 26,000 incidents of unwanted \nsexual contact actually took place during that period. That means that \nonly 12.9 percent--a small fraction--of all incidents were actually \nreported. Of the 3,374 reported offenses in 2012, only 880 faced \ncommand action for sex crimes. Of those 880, 594 faced court-martial, \nand 302 of those courts-martial resulted in convictions.\n  So all in all, we have a situation in which 880 people faced any kind \nof discipline for a sex crime out of the universe of 26,000 potential \nincidents. That is only 3.4 percent of total of incidents in which \nsomeone was held accountable, and only 302 or 1.1 percent were actually \nconvicted of a crime. That is not a good set of numbers, and it sums up \nwhy this problem has been festering and why we need action this year.\n  But I think we also know that we are not all here because of the \nstatistics. We are here because of real people and because each and \nevery one of the numbers is a personal story of grief, and we know them \nall too well. Whether it was the sexual assault scandal last year at \nLackland Air Force Base in Texas where a dozen or more basic training \ninstructors were accused of sexually assaulting female trainees or the \nmore recent case at the air base in Italy, where an Air Force general \ndecided to reinstate a pilot, without explanation, despite the fact \nthat this pilot had been convicted of sexual assault charges in a \ncourt-martial by a jury of his peers.\n  I think of Kimberley Wellnitz from Mora, MN. She served with the \nMarines in Iraq. In 2005, she was handcuffed to a bed and assaulted by \na fellow Marine--her supervisor. She reported him. The end result? He \nwas demoted in rank.\n  It is clear we have so much more to do in addressing this problem. It \ndoesn't just hurt our men and women in uniform. It undermines the \nintegrity of our Armed Forces and the integrity of our country, and \nthat is why we can't let it continue.\n  I know everyone in the Senate--and none more than the women of the \nSenate--wants action to change this intolerable situation. And action \nis what we are going to get. This year's National Defense Authorization \nAct contains more than two dozen unprecedented reforms which will \nincrease reporting of these crimes, provide support to victims, and \nhelp rebuild trust in the military's handling of sexual assaults.\n  As a former prosecutor who ran an office of 400 people, I learned \nover time that the outcomes are incredibly important. But just as \nimportant is how people feel about how they are treated in the system. \nEvery year we did a survey of our victims of domestic abuse and of \nsexual assault, and one of the aspects that became clear over time: \nJust as important as how many months someone got in prison was whether \nor not the crime was explained to them, whether or not the process was \nexplained to the victims, and whether or not the outcome was explained. \nWe actually had people come back and say: I know this case had to be \ndropped; or I know you couldn't bring charges in this case, but I felt \nthat you treated me with respect, and I understood that my case would \nstill remain so that if another case came forward my record would be \nthere, my report would be there. If the facts were better or if there \nwas more evidence, you could go forward with it. That led me to get \ninvolved way before this past year in the issues of record retention in \nthe military on sexual assault reports.\n  When I first got involved, we learned the shocking fact that many \nbranches of the military were destroying the records sometimes in 1 \nyear, sometimes in 5 years. That is why Senator Olympia Snowe and I got \ntogether and proposed changes to that system. We actually changed it so \nrecords would be kept for decades. But the problem is that still in the \nlaw, despite two changes we have made over the years on this exact \nauthorization act, the victim actually has to sign something and say \nthey want the records retained. That would not happen in a civil court.\n  Current law only requires retention of restricted reports--and that \nis when a servicemember chooses not to take legal action--at the \nrequest of the affected servicemember. This might seem innocuous, but \nit is not. It is a loophole allowing for the continued destruction of \nrecords, making it harder for service men and women who have been \nsexually assaulted to get VA benefits for the assault or to seek \njustice in the future.\n  I did an event with a former marine whose case couldn't be brought. \nBecause she was a marine, the records at the time were kept for 5 \nyears. So when the perpetrator got out and raped two kids in \nCalifornia, that prosecutor in California was at least able to look at \nthe records. Whether he could use them or not is somewhat immaterial. \nIt simply helps to look at the records to know what happened and if \nthere was a similar modus operandi.\n  A servicemember who has been through an assault should not be forced \nto reach a far-reaching decision whether his or her report on such a \ncrime will be retained or not, as is what is happening right now. This \nbill gets rid of the double standard between restricted and \nunrestricted reports, ensuring all reports are stored in a secure and \nprivate manner for at least 50 years. It also contains a provision from \nmy bill requiring the disposition of substantiated sexual-related \noffenses be noted in personnel records. This will help ensure that \ncommanders are aware of potential repeat offenders. And it contains the \nlanguage from my Military Sexual Assault Prevention Act--and I thank \nSenator Murkowski for her support--which expresses the sense of the \nSenate that charges of rape, sexual assault or attempts to commit these \noffenses should be disposed of by court-martial rather than by \nnonjudicial punishment or administrative action. We want offenders to \nbe convicted and punished, not just given a slap on the wrist by \ncommanders or allowed to slink away without a discharge.\n  This year's NDAA also includes legislation which I introduced with \nSenator McCaskill to add sexual assault and related charges to the list \nof protected communications that can be investigated by the DOD \ninspector general. This is expanded whistleblower protection which will \nhelp ensure that servicemembers are able to report sexual assault \ncrimes without facing retaliation.\n  These are just a few of the provisions addressing sexual assault in \nthis bill. We also know this bill does so much focused on victims' \nrights and treating our victims with the respect that they deserve.\n  Our country is fortunate that we have so many selfless service men \nand women who volunteer to serve their country. When they raise their \nhands to serve, we take on the responsibility to provide them the means \nto accomplish their mission and to ensure they don't have to worry \nabout what is going on behind the front line. Sexual\n\n[[Page S8150]]\n\nassault in the military betrays that responsibility. If in the course \nof their service our service men and women experience an assault that \nour military failed to prevent, then we owe them the basic decency of \njustice.\n  I look forward to working on and passing this bill with my colleagues \nso that we can protect our servicemembers once and for all.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we are seeing something pretty historic, \nwith over half of the women of the Senate speaking on this issue. I \nknow the press isn't covering this, but I hope with C-SPAN they are.\n  This is a bipartisan effort, with 30 reforms we have agreed to, and \nit is very impressive that we are all here, speaking up with one voice, \nand an occasional difference in goals. I hope America is watching \nbecause this has never happened before.\n  I now turn to the Senator from Wisconsin for her remarks, then to the \nSenator from Missouri, and then to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise this morning to speak about this \nyear's national defense authorization legislation and the important \nreforms that are a part of the underlying bill to improve our \nmilitary's response to sexual assault within its ranks.\n  The men and women in our Armed Services serve with courage in defense \nof our freedom every single day. In my eyes their service needs to be \nrespected by taking decisive action to address the ongoing crisis--in \nfact, you can call it an epidemic--of sexual assault in the military. \nWe know the system is broken, and it is long past time we fix it.\n  I wish to share just one story from a remarkable and brave woman \nnamed Rachel who lives in LaCrosse, WI.\n  Rachel joined the Army in 2004. She was sexually assaulted that same \nyear while she was stationed at Fort Meade in Maryland for advanced \nindividual training. After reporting her assault to her commanding \nofficer, Rachel was interrogated for hours over numerous days and \nultimately forced to drop the charge. She was written up for \nfraternization, and her assailant was not charged with any crime.\n  As you can imagine, Rachel was deeply affected by the trauma of this \ncrime and continues to face struggles with post-traumatic stress \ndisorder. But Rachel is a survivor and a true inspiration. She has \nturned her pain and courage into a platform for advocacy and service to \nher community, working through her organization Survivors Empowered \nThrough Art to raise awareness about military sexual assault through \nthe power of art and storytelling.\n  Rachel's story is a reminder that she is not alone and that we must \ndo everything that we can to make sure that all victims of sexual \nassault have the support they deserve. That is why I am heartened by \nthe many important reforms included in the 2014 National Defense \nAuthorization Act and very grateful to the bipartisan coalition, in \nparticular of women Senators who have worked so diligently to make this \nchange happen. In particular, Senators Gillibrand and McCaskill have \nled the fight to make these improvements. Their efforts will make a \nreal difference in the lives of countless Americans by preventing \nsexual assault in the military and greatly improving our support to \nvictims.\n  However, I believe more must be done to help victims of sexual \nassault. That is why I am a proud cosponsor of Senator Gillibrand's \namendment, which would improve on these important reforms by removing \nthe prosecution of major crimes from the military chain of command. \nInstead, military prosecutors would determine whether to move a case \nforward, which would eliminate inherent bias and conflicts of interest \nwhich currently deter victims from reporting sexual assault crimes in \nthe first place.\n  I am also filing an amendment to ensure we are including ROTC \nprograms in our conversations about military sexual assault. Just like \nwe must ensure our new officers from service academies meet our highest \nstandards, we must do the same of those commissioned in ROTC programs \nacross America.\n  I think the important improvements in this year's Defense \nauthorization show the great promise of what can be achieved if we work \ntogether in a bipartisan way to get work done for the American people.\n  It is a tremendous privilege to be a public servant. It is a special \nprivilege to be the first woman elected from my State to the U.S. \nSenate. One of the best parts for me is that I get to be a woman in the \nSenate at a time when there are so many incredible other women in the \nSenate to work with, to learn from, and to look up to. I expressly \nthank my Senate colleagues who serve on the Armed Services Committee--\nSenators McCaskill, Hagan, Shaheen, Gillibrand, Hirono, Ayotte, and \nFischer. I thank them for their work in guiding this process through \ntheir committee in such an effective and bipartisan way. And my thanks \nof course goes as well to Senators Levin and Inhofe for their \nstewardship of these important provisions.\n  I thank Senators Mikulski and Collins for organizing today's floor \nspeeches. The cumulative total of those changes represents true \nprogress in eliminating the tragedy and scourge of sexual assault in \nour military. I once again thank my colleagues for their bipartisan \nwork.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaine). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I too thank my colleagues Senator \nMikulski and Senator Collins for making an effort today to highlight \nthe work that has been done on this important issue. I would be less \nthan candid if I did not say it has been frustrating to have one policy \ndifference dominate the discussion of this issue over the previous few \nweeks, without anyone even realizing the historic reforms that are \ncontained in this bill. So I welcome the opportunity to come with my \ncolleagues who may disagree on one policy issue but do not disagree on \nthe goal and are taking a moment to recognize the work that has been \nput into this bill by not just the women of the Armed Services \nCommittee but also the men of the Armed Services Committee.\n  After the hearings--and some of us have spent literally hundreds of \nhours pouring over trial transcripts, spending time visiting with \nprosecutors--I think we have fashioned historic and amazing changes \nthat are going to forever change the successful prosecution of rapists \nin our military and go further to protect victims.\n  I come to this issue with a great deal of experience. I think it is \nnot hyperbole or overstating it that I have stood in the courtroom \nprosecuting sexual predators more than any Member of the Senate. I have \nhandled hundreds and hundreds of cases and dozens and dozens of jury \ntrials. No one in this Chamber has intersected with victims of sexual \nassault more than I have. I do not think anyone has more of an \nunderstanding of the particularly complicated problems that these cases \npresent, especially when there is a ``consent'' defense.\n  Keep in mind that the vast majority of these cases in the military \nare consent offenses. You have two options in a sexual assault case. \nOne is ``it wasn't me,'' and the other is ``it was consensual \nactivity.'' It does not take someone much to understand the principle \nthat in this instance most of these cases are going to be consent \ndefenses.\n  Why do I emphasize that? I emphasize it because it is relevant. It is \nparticularly relevant to the reforms that we embrace in the underlying \nbill. The time period in which a victim decides she is going to come \nforward out of the shadows and hold her perpetrator accountable is \ninvariably very close in time to the time of report. It is how she is \ntreated at that juncture more than anything else, more than whether she \nhas been victimized in the military or whether she has been victimized \non the streets of your hometown--she is coming forward with the most \npersonally painful moment of her life. Keep in mind if you are coming \nforward with the most personally painful moment of your life how \ncomplicated that gets if you know the defense is going to be that you \nwanted it, that it is consensual, and then it is even more difficult.\n  That is why the vast majority of these crimes in our country are \nnever reported, ever. It doesn't matter whether we are talking military \nor civilian. So how can we, at that critical\n\n[[Page S8151]]\n\nmoment, make sure that victim gets the help and support she or he needs \nto do the unthinkable, and that is to lay herself or himself bare to \nthe public about what has happened. The way you do that is through the \nreforms my colleague Senator Murray stressed and that we have \nincorporated in this bill, and that is that every single victim gets \ntheir own lawyer.\n  I don't think many Members understand how extraordinary that is. That \nreform alone will make our military the most victim-friendly criminal \njustice system in the world. In no other criminal justice system \nanywhere--civilian, military, United States, our allies--does a victim \nget that kind of support. That is what is underlying in these reforms. \nWe already know it works because it has been a pilot program in the Air \nForce. Unlike those who say reporting will never go up unless we make \nanother policy change, reporting is spiking in our military, up 50 \npercent just this year. That is because the victims are getting the \nword, not only do you not have to report to the chain of command, you \nare going to begin to get the resources and help and knowledge you need \nto navigate the choppiest waters, emotionally and personally, you will \never encounter.\n  Not only have we done that in the underlying bill, we also have done \nother work such as stripping commanders of their ability to abuse this \nsystem by changing the outcome of a trial--very important.\n  Making the crime of retaliation a reality in the military--it should \nbe actionable in a criminal court within the military if you retaliate \nagainst a victim who reports. Now not only will the victim know that \nretaliation is a crime, not only will the unit know retaliation is a \ncrime, the victim has her own lawyer who can help press those charges \nif that occurs.\n  Think of the practical consequences of this reform. You go back into \nyour unit, you are retaliated against, you call your lawyer: You will \nnot believe what they did to me today. Your lawyer helps you bring \ncharges against those who might retaliate.\n  It requires automatic discharge from the military for rape or assault \nconvictions.\n  There will be other opportunities to debate the policy difference we \nhave about how these cases are handled in the military, but I cannot \nsay how grateful I am to the dean and to Senator Collins for doing this \ntoday. It is very important that we not lose sight that this is not \nabout a bumper sticker. It is not about one side versus the other. This \nis about doing the very best job we can on the policy so we can protect \nvictims, prosecute offenders, and get them the hell out of our \nmilitary. That is what this is about, and with every fiber of my being \nI believe we are going to accomplish that with the reforms we are \nembracing.\n  I will come back to the floor to talk more about the amendment I will \nbe offering on the floor to go even further with some of these reforms \nthat we think are necessary.\n  I am so grateful that my colleagues have taken a moment to recognize \nthe obvious; that what we have done is historic; that what we have done \nwe do in agreement; and what we have done is going to make a \ndifference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, how much time do we have under this \nmorning business agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time in morning business has currently \nexpired.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/19/senate-section/article/S8151-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8151-S8153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. We have two more speakers, Senators from Massachusetts \nand Washington State. I ask unanimous consent morning business be \nextended for these two for approximately 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield to the Senator from Washington State and the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland and the \nSenator from Maine for helping to bring so many of us to the floor \ntoday to talk about an issue that cuts across partisan lines and has \nplagued our Nation's military and has gone unaddressed for far too \nlong. Military sexual assault is an epidemic and it has rightly been \nidentified as such by the Pentagon. It is absolutely unconscionable \nthat a fellow servicemember, the person you rely on to have your back \nand to be there for you, would commit such a terrible crime. It is \nsimply appalling that they could commit such a personal violation of \ntheir brother or sister in uniform, but what is worse and what has made \nchange an absolute necessity is the prevalence of these crimes. Recent \nestimates tell us that 26,000 servicemembers are sexually assaulted \neach year and just over 3,000 of those assaults are reported. According \nto the Department of Veterans Affairs, about one in five female \nveterans treated by VA has suffered from military sexual assault; one \nin five. That is certainly not the act of a comrade. It is not in \nkeeping with the ethos of any of the services, and it can no longer be \ntolerated. That is why the women of the Senate have been united in \ncalling for action.\n  There has been made much of the fact that there are now 20 women in \nthe Senate, a historic number that I think we all agree can still grow. \nBut it is important to remember that the number alone should not be \nwhat is historic. Instead, it is what we do with our newfound strength \nto address the issues that are impacting women across the country.\n  With this bill, the first Defense authorization of this Congress, we \nare doing exactly that. We are taking historic action to help \nservicemembers access the resources they need to seek justice without \nfear. One way this bill will do just that, help protect our \nservicemembers and assist victims and punish criminals, is through the \ninclusion of a bill I introduced across party lines with Senator \nAyotte. Our bill, which is included in the base bill, creates a new \ncategory of legal advocates called special victims' counsels. They \nwould be responsible for advocating on behalf of the interests of the \nvictim. These special victims' counsels would advise the victim on the \nrange of legal issues they may face.\n  For example, when a young private first class is intimidated into not \nreporting a sexual assault by threatening her with unrelated legal \ncharges such as underage drinking, this new legal advocate would be \nthere to protect her and tell her the truth. Since January, the Air \nForce has provided these advocates to over 500 victims through an \ninnovative new pilot program. Ten months later, the results are \nspeaking for themselves. Ninety-two percent of victims are extremely \nsatisfied with the advice and support their SVC lent them through the \nmilitary judicial process, 98 percent would recommend other victims \nrequest these advocates, and 93 percent believed these advocates \neffectively fought on their behalf.\n  In describing their experience with an advocate, one victim shared \nthat:\n\n       Going through this was the hardest thing I ever had to do \n     in my life. Having a Special Victim Counsel helped \n     tremendously. . . . No words could describe how much I \n     appreciate having one of these advocates.\n\n  Through our bipartisan effort, the Defense authorization bill will \nalso enhance the responsibility and authority of DOD's sexual assault \nprevention and response office, known as the SAPRO. This improvement \nwill help provide better oversight of efforts to combat military sexual \nassault across the Armed Forces. SAPRO would also be required to \nregularly track and report on a range of MSA statistics, including \nassault rates and the number of cases brought to trial, and compliance \nwithin each of the individual services.\n  Some of the stat collection is already being done so this requirement \nis not going to be too burdensome, but it will give the office \nauthority to track and report to us on the extent of the problem.\n  I believe the great strength of our military is in the character and \ndedication of our men and women who wear that uniform. It is the \ncourage of these Americans who volunteer to serve our country that are \nthe Pentagon's greatest asset. I know it is said a lot but take a \nmoment to think about that. Our servicemembers volunteered to face \ndanger, put their lives on the line, and protect our country and all \nits people. When we think of those dangers, we think of IEDs and \nbattles with insurgents.\n\n[[Page S8152]]\n\n  We should not have to focus on the threats they encounter from their \nown fellow servicemembers, and we should never allow for a culture in \nwhich the fear of reporting a crime allows a problem such as this to \nfester year after year. These are dangers that can never be accepted \nand none of our courageous servicemembers should ever have to face \nthem.\n  Earlier this year I asked Navy Secretary Ray Mabus about the sexual \nassault epidemic, and I was glad he told me that ``concern'' was not a \nstrong enough word to describe how he feels about this problem. He said \nhe is angry about it. I know many of us in the Senate are angry as \nwell, particularly our female colleagues who have dedicated so much \ntime to this issue and share this feeling and want to put an end to \nthis epidemic.\n  I am hopeful we can work quickly to do right by our Nation's heroes. \nWhen our best and brightest put on a uniform and join the U.S. Armed \nForces, they do so with the understanding that they will sacrifice much \nin the name of defending our country and its people. But that sacrifice \nshould never have to come in the form of abuse from their fellow \nservicemembers.\n  I am proud the women in this Senate have taken this issue head on, \nand what should never be lost in the effort to enact the many changes \nthat have been proposed is that for too long this was an issue that was \nsimply swept under the rug. That is no longer the case thanks to \nbipartisan cooperation, the work of thousands of dedicated advocates, \nand the voices of countless victims who have bravely spoken.\n  We are poised to make a difference on an issue that women everywhere \nhave brought out of the shadows, and I am proud of the women who have \nworked so hard on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for \nefforts to stamp out sexual assault in our military, and I wish to \nbegin by thanking the Senator from Maryland and the Senator from Maine \nfor their extraordinary leadership in bringing us here to speak on this \nissue.\n  For over 20 years our military has said it has a zero tolerance \npolicy toward sexual violence. Government agencies have put out 20 \nreports examining the problem and suggesting potential solutions. Yet, \nshamefully, incidents of sexual assault involving our military \npersonnel continue at staggering rates.\n  Data from the Department of Defense indicates that thousands of men \nand women serving in the military are subject to these horrific \nexperiences every year. More than 20 percent of women serving in the \nmilitary have reported unwanted sexual contact at some point during the \ncourse of their military service.\n  Perhaps most shameful, about half of all female victims in a 2012 DOD \nsurvey indicated they did not report these crimes because they believed \nsuch reports would simply be ignored.\n  This is an outrageous situation. We have called on the military over \nand over to solve this problem, and they have failed. Simply once again \ncalling on the military to reform will be an exercise in futility. \nWorse, it will be a breach of trust with the men and women who are \nfuture victims of sexual predators lurking in the military.\n  These are important steps forward that we take today. There are a \nnumber of extremely strong provisions to address sexual assault \nincluded in this year's National Defense Authorization Act which will \nmove us in the right direction. These provisions are designed to crack \ndown on sexual assaults, to better protect and advocate for victims, \nand to change the climate within our military to one that ends this \ndespicable conduct.\n  The bill includes provisions to promote the prosecution of these \ncases by eliminating the statute of limitations on certain sexual \noffense cases and by limiting the ability of commanding officers to \nmodify court-martial findings in sexual offense cases.\n  The bill requires the provision of a special victims' counsel to \nprovide legal support for servicemembers who are victims of sexual \nviolence at the hands of other members of the military and take steps \nto limit the potential for victims to be mistreated by defense counsel.\n  There are other important steps forward in this bill. As the Senate \ndebates the Defense bill, we will consider additional provisions to \nprosecute and eliminate sexual assault. I support those efforts as \nwell.\n  The issue of sexual violence within our Armed Forces is very personal \nto me. All three of my brothers served in the military. My oldest \nbrother was career military and flew 288 combat missions in Vietnam. I \nknow the unbelievable sacrifices our military men and women make for \nthis country and the sacrifices their families make to support them.\n  Yet, in spite of those sacrifices, we as a nation have consistently \nrefused to take sufficient steps to ensure that our military men and \nwomen are protected from sexual violence on the job. Tolerance for \nsexual assaults demeans the sacrifices that millions of brave men and \nwomen have stepped forward to make on our behalf. We owe it to our \nservicemembers, and to their families, to change the culture in our \nmilitary that remains far too tolerant of this abuse. We owe it to our \nservicemembers, and to their families, to do everything in our power to \nstamp out these incidents.\n  No matter the outcome of this week's amendment votes, this year's \nDefense Authorization Act will make significant strides toward finally \nmaking the military's zero tolerance policy a reality.\n  I am proud to support these efforts, and I promise that so long as \nthese crimes continue to occur, so long as victims are fearful to come \nforward, so long as justice is denied to victims, we will be right back \nhere next year and the year after that and the year after that, doing \neverything we can to end sexual assault in the military.\n  The brave men and women serving in our Armed Forces have no intention \nof giving up on us, and we have no intention of giving up on them.\n  I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, with the outgoing statement by the \nSenator from Massachusetts, we have now concluded the time that the \nwomen of the Senate have taken, on a bipartisan basis, to speak out \nagainst sexual assault in the military and to speak for the 30 reforms \nwe have all agreed upon, on a bipartisan basis, that will enable \nprosecutorial reform, help to the victims, guarantee that there is \nfairness with the process, and make sure that if a victim comes \nforward, that victim will not be retaliated against or ignored, and for \nanyone who is accused, that person will get a fair process.\n  I am very proud of the way the seven women on the Armed Services \nCommittee took the lead on this issue and were then joined not only by \nthe rest of us but also social workers, advocates, former Attorneys \nGeneral. We could not have done it without the very good men on the \ncommittee, particularly the chairmanship of Senator Levin and the help \nof Senator Inhofe.\n  I note the Senator from Rhode Island Mr. Reed is on the floor. We \nwant to thank Senator Reed for his strong advocacy and advancement for \nwomen in the military and also these important reforms.\n  I would also like to add, as the dean of the women, that what we did \nthis morning was pretty historical. We have 10 women from the Senate \nacross the aisle speaking out on 30 reforms that were agreed to in the \nunderlying bill. This is what the American people wanted--Members of \nthe Senate working together with the chairman of the committee, \nlistening to victims, listening to experts, and listening to the \nmilitary.\n  Do you know what was disappointing. There was only one person in the \npress gallery. If we had been in conflict--and there will be \ndisagreements later on where there are differences in some policies, \nand that is OK with me. But we don't make press when we have actually \nworked together, and worked with such incredible diligence and \nexpertise among ourselves, to solve these egregious and historically \nintransigent problems.\n  I say to the press, you know you like conflict, you know you like \ncontroversy, and you particularly want to see it among the women. We \nhave a precedent where we have disagreed before on goals. When I led \nthe fight with Lilly Ledbetter, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison took me on \nwith nine\n\n[[Page S8153]]\n\namendments. We had a good debate and a good bill at the end of it.\n  Senator Murkowski, from the State of Alaska, has also disagreed with \nme on what should be the best approach on preventive health. We had \ndebates without personal conflict, and we then came up with some good \nideas.\n  I say today, when I listen to our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle--who again have great backgrounds--this is pretty historic.\n  If you are watching on C-SPAN, you saw history being made. There were \n10 of us--and there will be more later today--who actually agreed. We \nare trying to govern the way we were elected to govern. I am proud with \nwhat we are going to do with the reforms that are involved. I am proud \nof the way we have gone about it, and if we disagree on some matters \nhere and there, that is what debate, intellectual rigor, and civility \nwill be all about.\n  I will conclude this debate for now. Other women will be coming \nthroughout the day to speak, and we know we will be debating some other \nimportant policies as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/19/senate-section/article/S8153-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murphy).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I think everyone is aware that we have a \nlot of differences on both sides of the aisle. Quite frankly, I just \nhad a meeting with some of the House people. There are some problems \nright now. I am anxious for Chairman Levin to come back, perhaps after \nour conferences, and I will do the same thing, and hopefully we will be \nable to do it. I understand there has already been a statement made \nabout the Ayotte amendment on Guantanamo. She is ready to debate, and I \nthink Senator Levin has a side-by-side amendment he is ready to debate \nas well. So that, in my opinion, is about as far as we have come as far \nas progress. I will withhold any other comments I will make until the \nchair has made his comments, which will probably be after lunch.\n  By the way, I ask our Members to continue to file all amendments they \nhave in anticipation that we will, as we have in the past, ultimately \ncome to that conclusion, that we will have amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Senator Thune pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1724 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. THUNE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, we need to be moving forward with the \nDefense bill. It is very important. I am a member of Armed Services \nCommittee, and we had a good bipartisan vote out of committee to bring \nthe bill to the floor. Chairman Levin has been fair to us in committee, \nso we got a good committee process. But there are some disagreements \nover a number of issues that the full Senate needs to discuss and vote \non. They just should be able to do that.\n  We are drifting into a process that is absolutely contrary to the \nhistory of the Senate--the real concept of the U.S. Senate--where we \nbring matters up and vote on them. Just because it cleared our \ncommittee does not mean the full Senate does not get to vote on some of \nthese differing opinions.\n  I voted in the committee on a number of amendments that did not pass. \nWe had amendments up in committee that we decided not to vote on, and \nthe phrase was: Well, we will carry that to the floor. In other words, \nit will be brought up and the whole Senate will vote on it, not just \nthe committee. Maybe in the interim something could be worked out. But \nif not, it would go to the full Senate, and the full Senate would work \nits will, would have its debate and vote.\n  We are going days now with nothing happening, no amendments being \nvoted on. They could have already been voted on. So Senator Reid has \nfilled the tree, and that means he has complete control over the \nprocess. He has the ability to say we will not have a single amendment. \nIn fact, except for, I think, two, all he has agreed to in this process \nis to have maybe two amendments up, and that is unacceptable. Senator \nReid ought to know that. You cannot move the Defense bill of the United \nStates of America, spending $500 billion, and not have amendments and \nSenators actually offering suggestions on how to spend that money \nbetter and do better for America. What are we here for?\n  So I am really worried about this. I am afraid that this whole thing \ncould collapse over the failure of amendments to be offered. I look \nhere at a chart. Back, basically, when Republicans were in charge, we \nhad 27 amendments, 25 amendments, 13 amendments actually voted on. The \naverage number was 11.5 amendments voted on.\n  We already have well over 100 amendments filed. Over half of them, \ntwo-thirds of them, will eventually be withdrawn or the managers of the \nbill will agree to some form of that suggestion with different language \nand we would move on. But we should have already started on amendments, \nand we should recognize that a good Defense bill is going to require an \nopen process where we can actually discuss how to fix it and make it \nbetter.\n  In addition, we are facing, under the Budget Control Act and the \nsequester, some real financial challenges for the Department of Defense \nthat are historic. It is significant. We need to be able to talk about \nthat and work on that and try to figure out a way to strengthen the \nability of the Defense Department to function in a rational way and not \ndo unnecessary damage to them while they work to contain spending. That \nis a critical thing.\n  So I would say to Senator Reid, who has a tough job--there is no \ndoubt about that--Senator Reid, you should not attempt this dramatic \nreduction in the ability of the Senate to actually have amendments to a \nbill as large and as important as the Defense bill. You are \noverreaching, Senator Reid.\n  We cannot agree to that. The loyal opposition, the Republican \nopposition--I say, the bill that came out of committee was bipartisan, \noverwhelmingly bipartisan, with a big vote in the committee. But there \nare things that need to be voted on here, and we are not going to agree \nto a handful of amendments. So if you try to move forward with this \nbill without allowing at least a legitimate amendment process, you are \nnot going to go forward because we are not going to agree to go forward \nwhen you fill the tree and block amendments and have the power to deny \namendments of any significant degree on the floor of the Senate.\n  I am worried about that. I hope my friend, Senator Levin, and Senator\n\n[[Page S8154]]\n\nReed, who is here, and others, can talk with the majority leader and \nreason with him, and let's get on with the business of proceeding with \nthese amendments and some actual debate about the future of America's \ndefense posture because we do have challenges in the years to come--a \nlot different than we have had--and we need to reconfigure defense, and \nwe need to be asking ourselves honestly and in a bipartisan way, what \nwill we need to do in 15 years, what will we need to be doing in 2025.\n  I had the honor to be at the Reagan Library this weekend for a \nnational security conference dealing with what our defense structure \nshould be in 2025. Senator Levin, along with former Secretary of \nDefense Gates, was given the first award they give for patriotic \nservice. So our Armed Services chairman, let me note, was honored--our \nDemocratic chairman--was honored at the Ronald Reagan Library for his \ncommitment to national defense.\n  But I am just saying, ladies and gentlemen, in a bipartisan way we \nneed to be thinking about what our future defense policy should be. We \nneed to be thinking about how to move this bill. But it will not move, \nand I will not support going to a bill that does not allow this Senate \nto have a reasonable opportunity to have amendments.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I have come to the floor today to \nmoderate a colloquy between my colleagues for the next 20 minutes or so \nregarding a very important amendment that has been filed to the Defense \nauthorization bill we are considering. The colloquy will be between \nmyself, Senator Wicker, Senator Warren, Senator Cochran, Senator \nHoeven, Senator Nelson, and Senator Merkley. I ask unanimous consent \nthat we have the next 20 minutes to conduct the colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Flood Insurance\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I really appreciate the courtesies of \nthe manager of the bill on the floor, Senator Reed. I really appreciate \nhis courtesies because those of us who have come to the floor today to \nspeak about this issue are extremely concerned about this problem that \nhas presented itself based on a bill that was passed 2 years ago called \nBiggert-Waters. With all the best intentions, a bill was passed 2 years \nago to try to fix and reform and reauthorize the Nation's Flood \nInsurance Program, which is a very important program that allows \nmillions of people who live not just along the coast but along our \nrivers and bayous and streams--from coast to coast, inland and coastal \ncommunities--to live safely and to live affordably and to have flood \ninsurance they can count on. That was the intention of the bill, but \nsomething went awry through the passage of the bill, and the \nconsequences are devastating.\n  Now, as we look back 2 years, and we see how FEMA and some of these \nFederal agencies are implementing the law we passed, we have some very \nserious concerns not only about how they are implementing it, but about \nthe law itself.\n  So a group of us have come together to change that law so we can \nprovide opportunities for our families, for our individuals and our \nbusinesses, to be able to buy and keep the kind of flood insurance they \nneed to stay in business and to keep their communities intact.\n  In the last couple of weeks all we have heard about is health care \ninsurance, and that is important, and we have some things to fix and \nmove forward on, providing the country with a health care system they \ncan depend on, but we also have a real challenge in flood insurance and \naffordability to our communities.\n  In Louisiana alone we have 400,000 flood insurance policies. \nFlorida--I see my good friend, Senator Nelson from Florida, on the \nfloor. His State has the largest number of policies; followed by Texas, \nwith the second largest number; and, of course, Mississippi has quite a \nfew as well. Senator Wicker joins me on the floor.\n  I want to start by showing this map I have in the Chamber so everyone \nwho is following this debate--and there are literally millions of \npeople following this debate; not only homeowners, business owners, but \nbankers, realtors, developers, et cetera--because if we do not get this \nright, these communities where you see these dots on the map, which are \nshown in the Mardi Gras colors--purple, gold, and green--these dots \nrepresent communities that are being affected by this program that \nneeds to be changed and reformed.\n  These are flood maps that are being issued. Look how many there are \nin Oregon, Washington, California, Texas. What really surprised me--\nbecause I know the gulf coast well; that is the area, of course, that I \nrepresent, Louisiana; and I know Texas and Mississippi and Florida very \nwell--but the area that surprised me was Pennsylvania and Illinois and, \nof course, New York, New Jersey, and the east coast because of \nSuperstorm Sandy. But this is a national issue. It is not a Louisiana \nissue. It is not a gulf coast issue. It is a national issue.\n  You will notice that these flood maps are not just along the coast. \nSome people say to us who are working on this: Well, I am not concerned \nbecause I do not represent a coastal State. Well, heads up, everyone. \nEven if you do not represent a coastal State, you are having flood maps \nissued from North Dakota, South Dakota, interior States, Kansas, \nArkansas, et cetera, because you have rivers and flood zones.\n  If we do not change this bill in a significant way--what we are \nasking for in the Menendez-Isakson bill, which we are here offering as \nan amendment to the defense authorization bill--many of these \ncommunities will be devastated. That is because the Biggert-Waters bill \nhas mandated fairly steep and unsustainable and unaffordable--to the \nmiddle class--rate increases that will simply prevent people from being \nable to stay in their homes.\n  My friend Senator Wicker is following me in this colloquy. He wants \nto speak specifically about the hardships that some of our people are \nexperiencing as they are getting these notices about the rate \nincreases. I ask Senator Wicker, what is he hearing in Mississippi? \nCould the Senator elaborate a minute about the unintended consequences \nof Biggert-Waters and the increases that some of our people are seeing \nin their primary homes as well as their businesses.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Louisiana for \nasking that question.\n  What I am hearing from Mississippi, and what I think we are going to \nbe hearing from all across the United States of America, is that this \nis about to be a disaster for property owners in the United States of \nAmerica. So I join my colleagues today--and perhaps there will be \nothers besides the three of us on the floor--in saying we need to \naddress the very real problem of increases in flood insurance premiums, \nwhich will unfairly hurt homeowners and businesses in my home State of \nMississippi and across the United States of America.\n  I appreciate my colleague presenting the map to show that this is \nindeed a national problem and not just a regional or coastal problem. \nThe severe onset of unaffordable rates--unaffordable rates--could have \na devastating impact on the livelihood of homeowners and communities \nthroughout the Nation and on our economy. Moreover, they could \njeopardize the long-term solvency of the National Flood Insurance \nProgram, which covers some 5.6 million Americans.\n  There is no doubt that NFIP faces enormous challenges. The damages \nwrought by storms such as Katrina, Rita, and Sandy have left the NFIP \nin the red for nearly a decade, amounting to nearly $24 billion at the \nlast count.\n  In the early years of the NFIP, when bad storm years were roughly \noffset by light storm years, taxpayers effectively carried \npolicyholders through years because of the NFIP's authority to borrow \nfrom the Treasury. However, the catastrophic 2004-2005 hurricane \nseasons put the program more than $20 billion in debt and disproved the \nnotion that the finances would balance out over time.\n  The principles for NFIP reform are worthy goals. Premiums need to \nreflect risks more accurately, flood risks must be projected and mapped \nmore accurately, and the purchase of flood insurance needs to be \nencouraged and enforced in order to enlarge the risk pool.\n\n[[Page S8155]]\n\n  We cannot expect the NFIP to continue as a viable program without \naddressing the huge imbalance between premium revenue and payments for \nlosses. At the same time, Congress cannot sit by in the face of these \ndramatic unaffordable rate increases facing many Americans.\n  The manner in which these reforms are being implemented is alienating \nthe very people the program is intended to help. The new rates penalize \npeople who have followed the rules, while placing the heaviest burden \non those who are only now recovering from recent disasters.\n  In communities still recovering from recent Mississippi River \nflooding and in communities along the gulf coast, where the aftermath \nof Katrina still lingers, a financial burden of this magnitude could \nforce homeowners either to leave their property unprotected or to move \naway altogether.\n  Ensuring the long-term success of the NFIP means taking an honest \nlook at how the reforms Congress enacted last year are being \nimplemented and whether they are unfairly hurting citizens--and I \ncontend they are. Allowing rates to go from a few hundred dollars to \ntens of thousands of dollars is hardly a reasonable approach to reform.\n  Reform should not be unnecessarily painful, unfair, or \ncounterproductive to the goal of solvency. Premium increases that make \nthe coverage literally unaffordable could lead to a net loss in program \nrevenue. Nobody benefits from that. Nobody benefits, neither the \nhomeowner nor the taxpayer, when NFIP premium increases result in \nforeclosure.\n  I am concerned that NFIP may well have overestimated net revenue \nincreases. They may have underestimated the burden of the program going \nforward. That alone would be a good reason to delay the increases, if a \nlonger phase-in would result in a net increase in revenue to the \nprogram, as I suspect it would.\n  A delay would also allow time to study the effects of premium \nincreases and it would allow us, as policymakers, to look for less \nharmful approaches to reform. The Federal Emergency Management Agency \nshould be able to complete an affordability study and ensure that its \ntechnologies and methodologies accurately assess risk.\n  I thank my colleague from Louisiana and I thank my colleague from \nFlorida for joining us. I urge all of my colleagues to support action \nthat provides immediate relief to Americans facing these steep rate \nhikes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from Mississippi for his comments \nand engaging in this exchange on the floor this morning.\n  The Senator from Florida has been particularly concerned because \nFlorida has a very robust population as one of our largest States. I \nthink the Senator has over 2 million policies in Florida.\n  Through the Chair, I wish to ask what the Senator is hearing in \nFlorida about this situation.\n  Mr. NELSON. I thank the Senator from Louisiana for inquiring.\n  I can say that Federal flood insurance that is not affordable is not \nFederal flood insurance. To go from a position that one is paying rates \nat one level and all of a sudden go to a higher position, people are \ncompletely priced out of the market and all of the ancillary things \nthat go with it because people can't sell their homes. When one puts \nthat ripple effect through the entire economy, especially in a State \nsuch as mine that has more coastline than any State save for Alaska and \nwhere we have 40 percent of all the flood insurance policies.\n  I dealt with this, I would say to the Senator from Louisiana, because \nin my former life I was the elected insurance commissioner of Florida. \nFortunately, I had no jurisdiction over the Federal Flood Insurance \nProgram, but other insurance companies that offered it privately or \nsupplemented the Federal flood insurance we did have jurisdiction to \nregulate.\n  People cannot build a house--if they are going to a bank to get a \nmortgage--unless they have flood insurance. Now that the maps, as the \nSenator has pointed out, have been expanded showing there are a lot \nmore areas that are inundated by water, by flood, at times of the year, \nthen this becomes, for the engine of commerce, a critical component. \nOne can't be charging one price and suddenly say we are going to be \ncharging people four times as much.\n  Let us have a little common sense. A little common sense says we want \nFEMA to do an affordability study and, in the meantime, until we \nreceive that study, we want this put on hold. It does not say it is not \ngoing to go up in the future, but availability of insurance is directly \nproportional to the ability of people to pay for that insurance and to \ncontinue the American dream, which home ownership is.\n  I would ask if the Senator from Louisiana remembers how long we have \nbeen trying to get this going. To the great credit of the Senator from \nLouisiana, who has taken the lead, she saw the problem early before \npeople started complaining in my State and other States. They were \ncomplaining in the State of Louisiana. Senator Landrieu was on top of \nit. We have only been doing this for about 8 months. We have a vehicle \non the floor that is a must-pass vehicle. It is the Defense \nauthorization bill. We need to get this legislation amended onto it and \nhave it signed into law.\n  I thank the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from Florida.\n  The Senator is correct about urgency. As the Presiding Officer knows, \nin her own home State, we are hearing from people who are stuck \nliterally between a rock and a hard place because they can't get their \ninsurance renewed. They can't afford the premium increases.\n  If they were thinking about selling their home, their home basically \nhas become literally worthless, losing what equity they have--\ntemporarily we hope because we intend to fix this--because no one can \npurchase a home if the flood insurance went from $300 a year to $13,000 \nor $15,000 a year. It is affecting home ownership.\n  This is why I am proud to say--I see the Senator from Mississippi on \nthe floor.\n  I wish to say how grateful I am to the great coalition of Senators \nwho have come together, 24 Senators and 128 House Members. In addition, \nwe have the National Association of Realtors, the National Association \nof Home Builders, and the Independent Community Bankers of America.\n  I wish to ask the Senator from Mississippi, through the Chair, does \nthe Senator think we have a better chance of getting attention for our \nbill with the national strong support of the realtors, the \nhomebuilders, and the bankers?\n  What is the Senator hearing from them in his State of Mississippi?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. If the distinguished Senator would yield, I would be \npleased to respond.\n  It is a fact that the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act, \nwhich we are discussing, seeks to protect homeowners from increases in \nthe cost of flood insurance premiums until the administration reviews \nand reports to the Congress on the flood mapping technologies, \nmethodologies, and insurance affordability that are being issued under \nthe authority of existing laws.\n  One problem we are concerned about is that the program was supposed \nto protect taxpayer investments, communicate perceived flood risks to \nhomeowners, and encourage communities to protect themselves against \nflood risks.\n  The reform legislation enacted in 2012 made some positive changes in \nthe program. Today some of those changes are now working in opposition \nto the broader goals of reform; hence, the importance of this \nlegislation. These shortcomings existed in the law and they actually \nthreaten to weaken the National Flood Insurance Program.\n  The success of flood insurance is so important to many inland and \ncoastal States, such as mine and Louisiana, the State of the \ndistinguished Senator. Communities there continue to work to overcome \ndamages caused by the greatest natural disaster in our Nation's \nhistory, the effects of the Deepwater Horizon spill in 2010 and now \nskyrocketing flood insurance premiums.\n  Under the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act, the \nadministration would be required to provide assurances to Congress that \nit is using sound mapping methods to make flood insurance rate \ndeterminations. A study by the National Academy of Science produced in \nMarch of this year has called into question some of the engineering \npractices the government uses to determine rates.\n\n[[Page S8156]]\n\n  Before allowing unaffordable flood insurance rates to devalue private \nproperty and harm local communities and economies, we should be \nabsolutely sure the government's engineering practices and procedures \nare as sound as possible. It will be very difficult to rebuild \ncommunities or restore home equity once they are lost, so we had better \nget it right.\n  Our bill does not create new programs to address rising premiums. It \nsimply leaves in place some current practices so we can make sure the \nreproductive reforms we enacted last year will actually improve the \ncredibility of the program among communities and homeowners.\n  Our bill would not affect positive reforms related to expanding \nprogram participation or the phaseout of subsidized flood insurance \npremiums for vacation homes and homes that have a history of repeated \nflooding.\n  My principal purpose of coming to the floor was to thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana for her leadership as she \ncontinues to be our outfront person in dealing with some of the very \nchallenging facts and decisions that are coming from those who are \ntrying to improve the program at the Federal level but also at the \nState and local level, which is where the action is. I am pleased to \njoin her in this plea to the Senate.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the distinguished Senator from Mississippi. I \nappreciate his hard work as well as the staff. It has been a real team \neffort and without him we wouldn't be where we are today.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is scheduled next in this colloquy. \nShe has brought a particularly spectacular view, a different view, and \na much needed view from the east coast, not only in light of the \ndevastation from Hurricane Sandy but the ongoing challenges to that \nregion.\n  I wish to ask unanimous consent, as it is 12:30 p.m., when we were \nsupposed to end, if each of us takes 4 minutes in the order of Senator \nWarren, Senator Hoeven, and Senator Merkley, we could then recess for \nlunch as was required earlier.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. What is the Senator hearing at home from the people of \nMassachusetts about this, and how important does she think it is for us \nto have the support of the realtors and the homebuilders and other \nnational organizations that understand the dire consequences if we are \nnot able to get some of these fixes in place?\n  Ms. WARREN. I thank the Senator from Louisiana for the question, but \nmost of all I thank her for her energetic leadership on this issue; she \nwill help us find the right way forward.\n  I am here today because of what I am hearing from families in \nMassachusetts. I also thank the Senator from Mississippi. This is \nsomething that is hitting us all around the country--this change in the \nflood maps. So I am here today to support my colleagues' bipartisan \nefforts to help homeowners across the country who are getting hit with \nnewly revised flood maps and increased flood insurance premiums.\n  Families purchase flood insurance to prevent the loss of their homes \nduring a natural disaster, but now many of these same families fear \nthat the price of flood insurance could be just as devastating and \ncould actually cost them their homes.\n  I understand why Congress changed the national flood program to more \naccurately reflect the true costs and risks of flood damage, and I \nagree that over time we need to move to a more market-based system for \nsetting flood insurance rates, providing we adequately take into \naccount the affordability concerns for working families. But that is \nnot what is happening right now. These new maps and rate increases are \nhaving as big an impact as a big storm.\n  When FEMA released these flood maps earlier this year and last, they \nknew they were placing hundreds of thousands of homeowners into a flood \nzone for the very first time. Yet there was inadequate warning to \nhomeowners. Many have started receiving letters from their mortgage \ncompanies and are learning for the first time that they must now \npurchase flood insurance. We have heard about the costs--$500, $1,000 a \nmonth, even more. Most hard-working families and most seniors don't \nhave that kind of extra money on hand to spend on flood insurance \npremiums they never knew they needed.\n  One Massachusetts resident wrote to me and said:\n\n       I have owned my property for over 33 years. Twelve years \n     ago I built a house according to the codes at the time. \n     Recently, flood maps were redrawn, putting my home in a new \n     flood zone and out of compliance. The implementation of the \n     Biggert-Waters act is going to raise our flood insurance to \n     $10,000 or more per year. I follow the rules, and now the \n     rules are changing, leaving me few options to comply.\n\n  The Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act that I have \ncosponsored along with Senator Landrieu and so many others will provide \nrelief to this homeowner and to others who built to code and were later \nremapped into a higher risk area. This critical bill will delay rate \nincreases until FEMA completes affordability studies mandated by the \nBiggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act and until subsequent \naffordability guidelines are enacted.\n  There is a second problem with FEMA's actions. The reclassifications \nhave taken place in some areas without a careful and complete analysis, \nbut for those who believe they haven't been correctly classified, it is \na tough challenge to get their flood zone status changed.\n  I received another letter from a Massachusetts constituent who lives \nin Brockton. She was informed that her only way out of this mess was to \npay more than $1,000 for an engineer to come and conduct an elevation \nstudy of a nearby brook. Now, let's be clear. She had to spend this \nmoney even though the city of Brockton and the nearby Army Corps of \nEngineers have no record of the brook ever flooding. If her appeal is \nsuccessful, she is still out $1,000 due to FEMA's mistake.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. WARREN. Then I will just say I am pleased to join my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle in calling for this commonsense delay which \nwill give FEMA time to get this right. I thank Senator Landrieu for her \nleadership, and I thank Senators Menendez, Isakson, Cochran, and all \nthe cosponsors of this bill. Time is running out. We need to get this \ndone.\n  I yield back.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I thank the Senator so much.\n  Senator Hoeven has joined us, and he has been particularly forceful \non the issue of basements in a State that doesn't have an ocean \nanywhere around it but has some serious flooding challenges. I would \nhope the Senator would take a minute to explain to everyone what he has \nbeen telling us and how important this particular piece of this bill is \nfor the basement situation in his State.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I thank the good Senator from Louisiana. \nI am very pleased to join in this colloquy with my cosponsors of this \nvery important piece of legislation.\n  This is about affordability of home ownership. The American dream is \nabout home ownership. It always has been, and we want to make sure that \ncontinues. So it is about affordability, but it is also about getting \nit right.\n  Look, if we are going to reset flood insurance rates, we need to get \nit right. This affects people across this great Nation. It affects \ntheir ability to own and continue to own their own home. We need to \nmake sure, as we make this transition, which we are all working on--we \nare all working on it--that we get it right. So that is why we see this \nbipartisan legislation, and we urge our colleagues to join us in this \neffort. This is about home ownership, this is about affordability, and \nthis is about getting it right.\n  To the point the good Senator from Louisiana just made and as the \nChair knows well, in the great State of North Dakota we have the Red \nRiver Basin, the Cheyenne River Basin, we have the James River Basin, \nwe have the Missouri River Basin, the Devils Lake Basin, and more. So \nwe know flooding, and we have seen it from year to year.\n  There are a number of provisions in this bill which the Senator has \nalready identified which are critically important, and I will not \nrepeat those, but I wish to focus for a minute on the basement \nexemption.\n  Legislation to preserve the basement exemption was included in the \nHoeven-Heitkamp Flood Safe Basements Act, S. 1601. That has been \nincorporated\n\n[[Page S8157]]\n\ninto this bill. As sponsors, we appreciate that very much because this \nis a collaborative effort to get it right as we make this transition in \nflood insurance rates and make sure we protect the affordability on a \nfair basis as we move to financial viability for the long term for \nflood insurance rates.\n  When a homeowner has put the cost into making sure they have a flood-\nproof basement, if we don't take that into account in the insurance \nrates, we are penalizing them and we are charging them twice. It makes \nno sense. It makes no sense at all. That is why we have to have the \nbasement exemption continued in this legislation, and that is why its \nsponsors, on a bipartisan basis, are not only pursuing this as stand-\nalone legislation, but we are also introducing it as an amendment to \nthe Defense authorization bill or other legislation that can move, \nbecause we need to address it and we need to address it now.\n  As the Chair well knows, the mayor of a small community in northeast \nNorth Dakota, which has seen repeated flooding, contacted our \ncongressional delegation and said: Hey, look. What is going on with \nFEMA right now is they are changing these flood insurance rates, and we \nhave examples of homeowners who are going from less than $1,000 a year \nto more than $5,000 a year--a fivefold increase--and it is not a new \nhome. The home has been there a long time and it has never been \nflooded.\n  It has never been flooded, and they are going to go from less than \n$1,000 to $5,000 on a home that has been there for a long time and \nnever been flooded? That is not how this is supposed to work. That is \nnot how it is supposed to work, and that is why we need this \nlegislation.\n  Again, I thank the good Senator from Louisiana. All of the sponsors--\nand we have a great bipartisan group going already--urge our colleagues \nto join us, and we urge them to join us without delay. We seek a common \nobjective: We will adjust the flood insurance rates to make sure the \nprogram is viable for the long term, but we need to get it right, and \nthat is what this is all about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, we have all been extremely helpful, of \ncourse, as a team in bringing this issue forward and crafting a bill, \nbut literally we would not be here if it were not for the leadership of \nthe subcommittee chairman who has jurisdiction over this issue--if he \nhad not said yes when we asked him for a hearing in his committee to \nallow us to present the facts in hopes that we could find a way, as all \nof us have said, to make this program self-sustainable for the \ntaxpayers but helpful to the people who need it. These are twin goals, \nboth of which must be met or there won't be any program because no one \nwill be able to afford to be in it. I thank the Senator for getting to \nthat so quickly.\n  He is the last in our colloquy. Again, what is he hearing from home \nand can he give us, as chair of the subcommittee, some insight into how \nhe thinks this will affect real estate markets if we are not able to \nfix this.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank my colleague from Louisiana for her tireless \nefforts in this regard. We can tell from the commentaries that have \njust been put forward from the Senator from Massachusetts, the Senator \nfrom Mississippi, the Senator from North Dakota, of course our \ncolleague from Louisiana, and now representing Oregon, that these are \nfolks representing blue States and red States and all types of \ndifferent terrains, and they have the common purpose of addressing the \ndysfunction of the Biggert-Waters bill that was passed.\n  Just to give a small feeling for this, the Hay family from Eagle \nCreek, OR, wanted to sell their home. They had a nice young couple with \nsolid financials who wanted to buy it. It was all approved except for \nthe insurance policy. When the couple found out the insurance policy \nwould not be the $500 the current family has been paying but $5,000 a \nyear, the deal fell apart because for every $1,000 you pay in flood \ninsurance, the value of the home drops by $20,000. So not only is the \ncouple who wanted this home unable to buy it because of the home's \nvalue dropping, but the family who owned the home, who had equity in \nthe home, and who hoped to take these funds into retirement to be their \nnest egg, has lost that nest egg due to these outrageous additional \ncosts, these dramatic increases.\n  So the point of sale is one particular problem that has a big impact \non the real estate market, but we also have the situation of someone \nwho has a policy lapse. Maybe an individual thinks their mortgage \ncompany is paying the policy, the mortgage company thinks the owner is \npaying it, and it defaults for a few days. When everyone finds out no \none has paid the bill, suddenly that family might be going, in that \nsituation, from $500 to $5,000. Or perhaps the mortgage company has \nnever enforced the provision requiring flood insurance and now they \nhave checked their records--and they are checking their records because \nthey are now being charged a significant multithousand-dollar fine if \nthey do not check their records--and they find you should have flood \ninsurance under the law but you don't, so they contact you. Well, now \nyou are facing this unsubsidized rate as a new policy.\n  So we have all of this, and then layered on top of that is the fact \nthat across the Nation the flood zones are being remapped. So folks who \nwere outside of the 100 years and have been outside and have had their \nhomes for 15 years are suddenly getting notified that they are inside \nthe flood zone and required by their mortgage company to get a policy.\n  They may say: But wait, I looked at the map, and only the corner of \nmy property is in the flood zone and my house isn't.\n  Well, the mortgage company says: We are sorry. You have to get this, \nand you have to then prove you are not in the flood zone.\n  It may cost those homeowners thousands of dollars to get an elevation \nsurvey and be able to demonstrate they are outside the flood zone. The \nhomeowner carries this burden of proof.\n  So this is a big challenge, and we should recognize how uncertain and \nwhat an art form it is to establish these 100-year zones because a \ncompany comes in and does a model, and they say: Well, a 100-year flood \nwill look like this, and they will point out what tributary, what \nwatershed that contributes to the confluence of creeks is going to end \nup flooding that particular town.\n  Based on their model, the flood zone might look as though it is in \nthe eastern section of the town or the western section of the town, and \nso on and so forth, that uncertainty where just inches can change \nwhether you are inside a 100-year or outside a 100-year. Some of these \nareas are very flat. A few inches water rise can cover many additional \nsquare miles, and this can have a huge impact on our business \ndistricts, because what business wants to reinvest in a business \ndistrict when now they feel that any improvements they make are going \nto be in an area where no one else is going to want to buy their \ncompany because they are in a situation where they have unaffordable \nflood insurance.\n  This is why we have come together--Democrats and Republicans, States \nfrom the North, South, East, and West coming together--to say we must \nchange this situation which is creating so much unfairness and economic \ndamage. I am delighted, as the chair of the subcommittee, to be fully \nengaged in partnering this. A special thanks to my colleague, the \nSenator from Louisiana, who is doing such a fine job of championing \nthis issue.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Our time has come to an end. In conclusion, I thank the \nSenator from Oregon again, the subcommittee chair, for his leadership. \nI also particularly thank Senator Menendez and Senator Isakson, the two \nlead sponsors of this bill, who have come together to provide the \nleadership to move this bill forward. They will be looking for a \nvehicle. We filed it on this bill in the event we have an opportunity \nfor an amendment on the Defense bill. If not, we will be looking for \nthe next possible opportunity.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for her cosponsorship and her \nleadership for North Dakota.\n  This is a map of all the counties which have levees. I was surprised \nwhen I saw this map. I am very familiar with the levees in Louisiana. I \nhelped to build a lot of them. I am very familiar with the Mississippi \nRiver generally because we have so much commerce along the Mississippi. \nI am generally familiar with Missouri, Illinois, and Arkansas. But what \nreally\n\n[[Page S8158]]\n\nstood out for me was the levee systems in Montana, Arizona, and \nCalifornia. A lot of these are levees, dikes, and dams that are \ndifferent from the river levees that we see. But look at Pittsburgh, \nNew York, North Dakota, Montana, Washington. There is not a place in \nthis country--not on the coast, not on the interior--that doesn't have \na threat of flooding. Either a levee can break, a dam can break, a \nriver can overflow, or there can be flash flooding because of droughts. \nEven in Texas where there is a lot of flash flooding. So not only on \nthe coast, but inland as well, in Kansas.\n  The conclusion is this is a real challenge for our whole Nation. We \nhave a bill led by Senator Menendez and Senator Isakson that costs and \nscores zero. We have written this bill in a way that just postpones \nthese draconian rate increases so we can take a little more time to \nstudy it, do some modeling, and get it right. This bill was passed with \nvery good intentions, but prematurely, without the data we need to make \nsmart decisions for our communities. This is giving us time to get it \nright. There is zero cost the way this bill is structured.\n  Again, I appreciate the courtesies of our leader managing this bill \non the floor.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/19/senate-section/article/S8158-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I hope Members will now come down and \ndebate, particularly if we can start off again with the legislation on \nGuantanamo. There will be two amendments here. One will be an amendment \nby Senator Ayotte and the other one would be an amendment by myself, \nwith Senator McCain. It will be a Levin-McCain amendment. I hope those \nwho are interested in this subject particularly would come down between \nnow and then and we can perhaps even reach a vote on Guantanamo, the \ntwo amendments, side-by-side, even later this afternoon. That is the \ngoal. It is not part of the unanimous consent proposal, but that would \nbe a goal.\n  I know my friend from Oklahoma and I are able to work things out most \noften, and we will try to figure out a way to hopefully get to a vote \non two amendments which I think everybody agrees, not on the outcome of \nthe vote, but agrees need to be debated and resolved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, first of all, let me say I appreciate \nall the help the chairman has given us during the course of this very \ndifficult time. I also suggest we have gone through this same thing \nother years in the past.\n  One of the things is there are so many people demanding or wanting to \nhave a system where we could have more amendments. I encourage anyone \nwho has amendments to go ahead and send them to the floor. It doesn't \ndo any good to talk about them unless you have them down here and in \nfront of us. Then I hope the chairman and I could get together and we \ncould have, actually, more amendments. Those people who want to be \nheard on this, we have adopted this timing, so we encourage you to come \ndown and be heard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I thank my friend from Oklahoma because \nhe has said what needs to be said here, which is that we welcome \namendments being brought to the floor. We will do our best to try to \nclear those amendments, which means obviously consulting with not just \nthe sponsors but potential opponents to try to see if we can work \nthings out. On this bill we have always been able to work out \namendments, sometimes as many as 100. We need to have votes on this \nbill, but we also can clear amendments. We work together on a \nbipartisan basis to do that.\n  I join in his request that Senators who have amendments get them to \nus to see if we can possibly work them out. We simply must finish this \nbill this week. The timetable is such that if we are going to finish \nthis bill, as we have for 51 straight years, we have to get this bill \nto conference. That, in and of itself, will take a week. Then we have \nto bring the conference report back, if we can reach an agreement on \nit, to both Houses, and that will take as much as a week as well under \nthe rules, so we really need the cooperation of every Member of this \nbody.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I rise at this point to discuss Wicker \namendment No. 2185. This is an important amendment. I hope the \nleadership of this committee is paying attention. My amendment would \nprohibit foreign governments from constructing, on U.S. soil, satellite \npositioning and ground monitoring stations. I think many Americans were \nsurprised when, on November 16, the New York Times published an article \nby Michael Schmidt and Eric Schmitt entitled ``A Russian GPS Using U.S. \nSoil Stirs Spy Fears.''\n  I ask unanimous consent a copy of this article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 16, 2013]\n\n             A Russian GPS Using U.S. Soil Stirs Spy Fears\n\n                (By Michael S. Schmidt and Eric Schmitt)\n\n       Washington.--In the view of America's spy services, the \n     next potential threat from Russia may not come from a \n     nefarious cyberweapon or secrets gleaned from the files of \n     Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency \n     contractor now in Moscow.\n       Instead, this menace may come in the form of a seemingly \n     innocuous dome-topped antenna perched atop an electronics-\n     packed building surrounded by a security fence somewhere in \n     the United States.\n       In recent months, the Central Intelligence Agency and the \n     Pentagon have been quietly waging a campaign to stop the \n     State Department from allowing Roscosmos, the Russian space \n     agency, to build about half a dozen of these structures, \n     known as monitor stations, on United States soil, several \n     American officials said.\n       They fear that these structures could help Russia spy on \n     the United States and improve the precision of Russian \n     weaponry, the officials said. These monitor stations, the \n     Russians contend, would significantly improve the accuracy \n     and reliability of Moscow's version of the Global Positioning \n     System, the American satellite network that steers guided \n     missiles to their targets and thirsty smartphone users to the \n     nearest Starbucks.\n       ``They don't want to be reliant on the American system and \n     believe that their systems, like GPS, will spawn other \n     industries and applications,'' said a former senior official \n     in the State Department's Office of Space and Advanced \n     Technology. ``They feel as though they are losing a \n     technological edge to us in an important market. Look at \n     everything GPS has done on things like your phone and the \n     movement of planes and ships.''\n       The Russian effort is part of a larger global race by \n     several countries--including China and European Union \n     nations--to perfect their own global positioning systems and \n     challenge the dominance of the American GPS.\n       For the State Department, permitting Russia to build the \n     stations would help mend the Obama administration's \n     relationship with the government of President Vladimir V. \n     Putin, now at a nadir because of Moscow's granting asylum to \n     Mr. Snowden and its backing of President Bashar al-Assad of \n     Syria.\n       But the C.I.A. and other American spy agencies, as well as \n     the Pentagon, suspect that the monitor stations would give \n     the Russians a foothold on American territory that would \n     sharpen the accuracy of Moscow's satellite-steered weapons. \n     The stations, they believe, could also give the Russians an \n     opening to snoop on the United States within its borders.\n       The squabble is serious enough that administration \n     officials have delayed a final decision until the Russians \n     provide more information and until the American agencies sort \n     out their differences, State Department and White House \n     officials said.\n\n[[Page S8159]]\n\n       Russia's efforts have also stirred concerns on Capitol \n     Hill, where members of the intelligence and armed services \n     committees view Moscow's global positioning network--known as \n     Glonass, for Global Navigation Satellite System--with deep \n     suspicion and are demanding answers from the administration.\n       ``I would like to understand why the United States would be \n     interested in enabling a GPS competitor, like Russian \n     Glonass, when the world's reliance on GPS is a clear \n     advantage to the United States on multiple levels,'' said \n     Representative Mike D. Rogers, Republican of Alabama, the \n     chairman of a House Armed Services subcommittee.\n       Mr. Rogers last week asked the Pentagon to provide an \n     assessment of the proposal's impact on national security. The \n     request was made in a letter sent to Defense Secretary Chuck \n     Hagel, Secretary of State John Kerry and the director of \n     national intelligence, James R. Clapper, Jr.\n       The monitor stations have been a high priority of Mr. Putin \n     for several years as a means to improve Glonass not only to \n     benefit the Russian military and civilian sectors but also to \n     compete globally with GPS.\n       Earlier this year, Russia positioned a station in Brazil, \n     and agreements with Spain, Indonesia and Australia are \n     expected soon, according to Russian news reports. The United \n     States has stations around the world, but none in Russia.\n       Russian and American negotiators last met on April 25 to \n     weigh ``general requirements for possible Glonass monitoring \n     stations in U.S. territory and the scope of planned future \n     discussions,'' said a State Department spokeswoman, Marie \n     Harf, who said no final decision had been made.\n       Ms. Harf and other administration officials declined to \n     provide additional information. The C.I.A. declined to \n     comment.\n       The Russian government offered few details about the \n     program. In a statement, a spokesman for the Russian Embassy \n     in Washington, Yevgeniy Khorishko, said that the stations \n     were deployed ``only to ensure calibration and precision of \n     signals for the Glonass system.'' Mr. Khorishko referred all \n     questions to Roscosmos, which did not respond to a request \n     for comment last week.\n       Although the Cold War is long over, the Russians do not \n     want to rely on the American GPS infrastructure because they \n     remain suspicious of the United States' military \n     capabilities, security analysts say. That is why they have \n     insisted on pressing ahead with their own system despite the \n     high costs.\n       Accepting the dominance of GPS, Russians fear, would give \n     the United States some serious strategic advantages \n     militarily. In Russians' worst fears, analysts said, \n     Americans could potentially manipulate signals and send \n     erroneous information to Russian armed forces.\n       Monitor stations are essential to maintaining the accuracy \n     of a global positioning system, according to Bradford W. \n     Parkinson, a professor emeritus of aeronautics and \n     astronautics at Stanford University, who was the original \n     chief architect of GPS. As a satellite's orbit slowly \n     diverges from its earlier prediction, these small deviations \n     are measured by the reference stations on the ground and sent \n     to a central control station for updating, he said. That \n     prediction is sent to the satellite every 12 hours for \n     subsequent broadcast to users. Having monitor stations all \n     around the earth yields improved accuracy over having them \n     only in one hemisphere.\n       Washington and Moscow have been discussing for nearly a \n     decade how and when to cooperate on civilian satellite-based \n     navigation signals, particularly to ensure that the systems \n     do not interfere with each other. Indeed, many smartphones \n     and other consumer navigation systems sold in the United \n     States today use data from both countries' satellites.\n       In May 2012, Moscow requested that the United States allow \n     the ground-monitoring stations on American soil. American \n     technical and diplomatic officials have met several times to \n     discuss the issue and have asked Russian officials for more \n     information, said Ms. Harf, the State Department spokeswoman.\n       In the meantime, C.I.A. analysts reviewed the proposal and \n     concluded in a classified report this fall that allowing the \n     Russian monitor stations here would raise counterintelligence \n     and other security issues.\n       The State Department does not think that is a strong \n     argument, said an administration official. ``It doesn't see \n     them as a threat.''\n\n  Mr. WICKER. This article elaborates on a proposal under review by our \nown State Department to allow the Russian space agency to construct \nhalf a dozen satellite ground monitoring stations on U.S. soil. The \narticle describes these potential sites as ``seemingly innocuous, dome-\ntopped antenna perched atop an electronics-packed building surrounded \nby a security fence somewhere in the United States.'' Taken at face \nvalue, these Russian ground monitoring stations are supposed to improve \nthe accuracy and reliability of Russia's version of the global \npositioning system.\n  According to the Times article, the Obama administration is actively \nconsidering this request by Moscow in an attempt to reset once again \nthe administration's failed reset policy which the President once \nhailed as the beginning of better U.S.-Russian relations. We have every \nreason to be skeptical of Russia's intentions to utilize GPS monitoring \nstations on U.S. soil. Let me repeat this: GPS monitoring stations \ncontrolled by Russia on U.S. soil.\n  Time and again, President Putin has shown he is unwilling to \ncooperate with America. The list of grievances continues to grow. Let's \nnot forget that Russia has granted asylum to Edward Snowden, who is \ncharged with espionage and theft of U.S. government property after \nreleasing up to 200,000 classified documents to the press.\n  Let's not forget that Russia has defended the brutal regime of Syrian \nPresident Bashar al-Assad and helped perpetuate the dictator's grip on \npower with military aid.\n  Let's not forget that Russia, the same Russia that wants to put GPS \nstations on U.S. soil, has denied Russian orphans a chance at a better \nlife in the United States, with a ban on U.S. adoptions, ultimately \nvictimizing the most vulnerable, in a desperate attempt to distract the \nworld from Russia's human rights failings.\n  It is clear Russia's interests are not often aligned with those of \nthe United States. Accordingly, I am deeply concerned and people within \nthe intelligence community are deeply concerned and people within the \nDefense Department are deeply concerned about the Russian proposal to \nuse U.S. soil to strengthen Russia's GPS capabilities. These ground \nmonitoring stations could be used for the purpose of gathering \nintelligence. Even more troubling, these stations could actually \nimprove the accuracy of foreign missiles targeted at the United States.\n  Our national security and foreign policy apparatus is large and \nwidespread. I do not question anyone's patriotism or the intentions of \nthe State Department. But it is clear that there are other parts of the \nadministration that are very concerned about this.\n  This morning I had the opportunity to review a classified report by \nDOD. I encourage all Members of the Senate to review this classified \ndocument and, to me, I think it will reaffirm the need for increased \ntransparency on this very serious matter. Senators Lee, Fischer, and \nCornyn so far have joined me in filing an amendment to the Defense \nauthorization bill that would fully inform the American people about \nthe implications of the Russian proposal.\n  My amendment would prohibit the construction of GPS monitoring \nstations by any foreign government on U.S. soil until the Secretary of \nDefense and the Director of National Intelligence jointly certify to \nthe Congress that these stations do not have the capability to gather \nintelligence or improve foreign weapons systems. My amendment would \nalso require a report to Congress on the use of satellite positioning \nground monitoring stations by foreign governments.\n  This amendment is simple and straightforward, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support its inclusion in the Defense authorization bill. \nI encourage cosponsors from both sides of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, on behalf of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, we are pleased to bring S. 1197, the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, to the Senate floor. The Armed \nServices Committee approved the bill by a 23-3 vote on June 13, making \nthis the 52nd consecutive year our committee has reported the Defense \nAuthorization Act.\n  The strong bipartisan vote for this bill in the Armed Services \nCommittee continues the tradition of our committee, where our Members \nhave continued to come together to support the national defense and our \nmen and women in uniform. I thank Senator Inhofe for the major \ncontribution he has made to this process in his first year as the \nranking Republican on the committee.\n  This year's bill would authorize $625.1 billion for national defense \nprograms, the same amount as the President's budget request. Unless the \nCongress acts to modify or eliminate the sequestration required by the \nBudget Control Act, however, this amount will automatically be reduced \nby $50 billion, leaving the Department of Defense with far less than it \nneeds to meet the requirements of our national military strategy.\n\n[[Page S8160]]\n\n  U.S. forces are drawing down in Afghanistan and are no longer \ndeployed in Iraq. However, the real threats to our national security \nremain and our forces are deployed throughout the globe. Over the \ncourse of the last year, the civil war in Syria has become increasingly \ndestructive, North Korea has engaged in a series of provocative acts, \nIran has moved forward with its nuclear program, and Al Qaeda \naffiliates have continued to seek safe havens in Yemen, Somalia, North \nAfrica, and elsewhere.\n  It is particularly important that we do what we can to sustain the \ncompensation and quality of life our service men and women and their \nfamilies deserve as they face the hardships imposed by continuing \nmilitary operations around the world. Toward this end, our bill, No. 1, \nauthorizes a 1-percent across-the-board pay raise for all members of \nthe uniformed services, consistent with the President's request; it \nreauthorizes over 30 types of bonuses and special pays aimed at \nencouraging enlistment, reenlistment, and continued service by Active-\nDuty and Reserve component military personnel. It does not include \nDepartment of Defense proposals to establish or increase health care \nfees, deductibles, and copayments that would primarily affect working-\nage military retirees and their families. It authorizes $25 million in \nsupplemental impact aid to local educational agencies with military \ndependent children and $5 million in impact aid for schools with \nmilitary dependent children with severe disabilities, and provides \nfunding for the Department of Defense STARBASE Program. It enhances the \nDepartment of Defense programs to assist veterans in their transition \nto civilian life by improving access to credentialing programs for \ncivilian occupational specialties.\n  The bill also includes funding needed to provide our troops the \nequipment and support they need for ongoing combat, counterinsurgency, \nand stability operations around the world. For example, the bill funds \nthe President's request for $80.7 billion for overseas contingency \noperations. It authorizes $9.9 billion for U.S. special operations \ncommand, including both base budget funding and OCO funding. It \nauthorizes nearly $1 billion for counter-IED efforts, beginning to ramp \ndown expenditures in this area while ensuring that we make investments \nneeded to protect our forces from roadside bombs.\n  The bill fully funds the President's request for the Afghan Security \nForces Fund to train and equip the Afghan National Army and Afghan \npolice, growing their capabilities so we can complete the transition of \nsecurity responsibility as planned by the end of 2014.\n  It reauthorizes the use of DOD funds to support a program to \nreintegrate insurgent fighters into the Afghan forces and into \nAfghanistan. It authorizes the Secretary of Defense--upon a \ndetermination from the President that it is in the national security \ninterest of the United States--to use up to $150 million of amounts \nauthorized for the Coalition Support Fund account in fiscal years 2013 \nand 2014 to support the border security operations of the Jordanian \nArmed Forces, and it extends global train-and-equip authority, section \n1206, through 2018 to help build the capacity of foreign force partners \nto conduct counterterrorism and stability operations.\n  The bill before us addresses major issues that are of particular \nimportance to the Department of Defense, relative to the detention \nfacility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and the problem of sexual assault and \nmisconduct in the military.\n  As to Guantanamo, this bill would provide our military with needed \nflexibility to determine how long we need to detain individuals now \nheld in the Gitmo detention facility and where else we might hold them. \nFor a number of years now Congress has enacted legislation eliminating \nthis flexibility and requiring that we continue to hold all Gitmo \ndetainees regardless of costs and whether it is needed in our national \nsecurity interest. The existing legislation has made it more difficult \nto try detainees for their crimes and nearly impossible to return them \nto their home countries.\n  For example, even if we have a strong case that a detainee has \ncommitted crimes for which he could be indicted and convicted in a \nFederal court, the existing law makes it impossible to try him there. \nEven if we have determined that a detainee poses no ongoing security \nthreat to the United States, we cannot send them back to his home \ncountry unless the Secretary of Defense certifies to six stringent \nconditions. Even if the individual is likely to die without advanced \nmedical treatment, we cannot remove him from Gitmo for the purpose of \nreceiving such treatment.\n  As a result, the legislation we have on the books has reinforced the \nimpression held by many around the world that Guantanamo is a legal \nblack hole where we hold detainees without recourse. This perception \nhas been used by our enemies to recruit jihadists to attack us, and it \nhas made our friends less willing to cooperate with us in our efforts \nto fight terrorism around the world.\n  The Gitmo detention facility is not only a recruiting tool for our \nenemies, but it has become an obsolete white elephant that costs \nhundreds of millions of dollars a year. It can no longer be justified \nbased on the rationale for creating Gitmo in the first place.\n  One dozen years ago, the Bush administration started sending \ndetainees to Gitmo in large part out of a desire to avoid the \njurisdiction of the U.S. courts and ensure that detainees would have no \nlegal avenue to appeal their convictions. Whether one supported that \napproach, that argument all but disappeared in 2008 when the Supreme \nCourt ruled in the Boumediene case that Gitmo detainees would be \ntreated as being inside the United States for the purpose of habeas \ncorpus appeals.\n  Instead of recognizing that the Gitmo detention facility is no longer \nneeded, however, we have enacted legislation which makes it virtually \nimpossible to move detainees anywhere else, ensuring that the facility \nwill remain open whether it is needed for particular detainees or not. \nThe current law prohibits the transfer of any detainee to the United \nStates for detention under the law of armed conflict or trial before a \nmilitary commission or in civilian court and includes unduly burdensome \ncertification requirements that make it extremely difficult to transfer \ndetainees back to their home countries.\n  The basis for these legislative obstacles appears to be the fear that \nreturning Gitmo detainees to their home countries or transferring them \nto the United States would pose an unacceptable threat to our national \nsecurity. However, we have brought numerous terrorists to the United \nStates for trial and incarceration without adverse effect to our \nnational security.\n  In just the last 3 years, for example, we have brought three foreign \nterrorists into the United States for trial. The first is Abu Ghaith, \nOsama bin Laden's son-in-law, who has been convicted in Federal court \nand remains in Federal custody without incident. The second is Ahmed \nAbdulkadir Warsame, who pled guilty in Federal court and remains in \nFederal custody without incident. The third is Ahmed Ghailani, a Gitmo \ndetainee who was convicted in Federal court, received a life sentence, \nand remains in Federal custody without incident.\n  Moreover, our military has routinely detained individuals on the \nbattlefield in Afghanistan and then exercised the discretion to \ntransfer them to local jurisdiction or to release them. If we can trust \nour military to make these determinations on a day-to-day basis, we \nshould be able to trust them to make the same determinations at Gitmo.\n  The risk that any of these detainees could once again engage in \nactivities hostile to our interests around the world has been \nsubstantially reduced by the rigorous procedures our military has \ninstituted to review individual cases and ensure that appropriate \nprotections are in place before transferring any detainee back to his \nhome country.\n  These procedures have resulted in a dramatic decline in the so-called \nrecidivism rate over the last 5 years. While more than 160 Gitmo \ndetainees released by the Bush administration are known or suspected to \nhave engaged in activities hostile to our interest after their transfer \nor release, only 7 detainees released by the Obama administration--less \nthan 10 percent of the total--are known or suspected to have engaged in \nsuch activities.\n  This rigorous review process would be codified by the provision in \nour bill\n\n[[Page S8161]]\n\nwhich would require that the Secretary of Defense determine, prior to \ntransferring a Gitmo detainee, that the transfer is in our national \nsecurity interest and that actions have been taken to mitigate any \nrisks that the detainee could again engage in any activity that \nthreatens U.S. persons or interest.\n  It is time for us to move past the fear that our country somehow \nlacks the capacity to handle Gitmo detainees and allow our military to \naddress the transfer of detainees in a rational manner based on the \nfacts of each case.\n  As to sexual misconduct, this bill includes the most comprehensive \nlegislation targeting sexual misconduct and assault in the military \never considered by Congress. Our committee adopted more than two dozen \nseparate provisions and a host of historic, significant reforms \naddressing sexual assault and prevention. In particular, the bill makes \nit a crime under the Uniform Code of Military Justice to retaliate \nagainst a victim who reports a sexual assault, and it requires the DOD \nIG to review and investigate any allegation of such retaliation.\n  Our bill establishes the expectation that commanders will be relieved \nof their command if they fail to maintain a climate in which victims \ncan come forward without fear.\n  Our bill requires service Secretaries to provide a special victims' \ncounsel to provide legal advice and assistance to servicemembers who \nare victims of a sexual assault committed by a member of the Armed \nForces.\n\n  Our bill amends article 60 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice to \nlimit the authority of a commander to overturn a verdict for rape, \nsexual assault, forcible sodomy, and other serious offenses.\n  Our bill eliminates the element of the character of the accused from \nthe factors to be considered in deciding how to proceed with the case.\n  Our bill requires commanding officers to immediately refer any \nallegation of a sexual misconduct offense involving service members to \nthe appropriate investigative agency.\n  Our bill requires that the sentence for service members convicted of \nrape, sexual assault, forcible sodomy or an attempt to commit one of \nthose offenses, include, at a minimum, a dismissal or dishonorable \ndischarge.\n  Our bill requires that all substantiated complaints of sexual-related \noffenses be noted in the service record of the offender.\n  Our bill eliminates the 5-year statute of limitations on trial by \ncourt-martial for certain sexual-related offenses.\n  Our bill codifies a prohibition on military service by individuals \nconvicted of sexual offenses.\n  Some have argued we should also change the military justice system by \nremoving commanders from their current role in deciding what cases \nshould be prosecuted and instead place that authority in the hands of \nmilitary lawyers. However, the testimony before our committee showed \nthat commanders, far from being reluctant to prosecute sexual offenses, \nare more likely to prosecute those offenses than civilian or military \nlawyers.\n  Further, removing authority from commanding officers would distance \nthem from these cases and make them less accountable, making it more \ndifficult for them to take the steps needed to protect victims from \npeer pressure, ostracism, and retaliation. While taking authority away \nfrom the chain of command would indeed be a dramatic change, this \nchange would actually afford the victims of sexual assault less \nprotection and make it less likely that sexual assaults will be \nprosecuted than the current system.\n  For this reason, we adopted an alternative approach that will better \nprotect victims. Our approach is to require a commander who receives an \nallegation of sexual assault to either prosecute it or have it \nautomatically reviewed by his or her commander--almost a general or \nflag officer--and if a commander chooses not to prosecute against the \nadvice of legal counsel, the case receives automatic review by a \nservice Secretary. This approach will enable commanders to continue an \naggressive approach to prosecuting sexual offenses while ensuring \nagainst the unusual case in which a commander might decide not to \npursue a case that could be successfully prosecuted.\n  An important part of this problem is the underreporting and \ninadequate investigation of sexual assaults. There is still inadequate \nreports for victims of sexual assaults. There is also a problem with \nretaliation, ostracism, and peer pressure from victims. Underneath it \nall remains a culture that has taken inadequate steps to correct this \nsituation. In the end, getting this right will require sustained \nleadership by commanders who can be held accountable for conduct in \ntheir units. It is more difficult to hold someone accountable for \nfailure to act if we reduce his or her authority to act.\n  We want commanders fully engaged in the resolution of this problem \nand not divorced from it. Throughout our deliberations on this issue, \nwe were guided by a single goal: passing the strongest, most effective \nmeasures to combat sexual assault by holding perpetrators accountable \nand protecting and supporting victims. We believe our bill does that.\n  Our country relies on the men and women of our military and the \ncivilians who support them to keep us safe and to help us meet U.S. \nnational security objectives around the world. We expect them to put \ntheir lives on the line every day, and in return we tell them we will \nstand by them and their families, that we will provide them with the \nbest training, the best equipment, and the best support available to \nany military anywhere in the world.\n  As of today, we have roughly 1.4 million U.S. soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, and marines serving on Active Duty--with tens of thousands \nengaged in combat in Afghanistan and stationed in other regional \nhotspots around the globe.\n  While there are issues on which Members may disagree, we all know we \nmust provide our troops the support they need. Senate action on the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 will improve \nthe quality of life for our men and women in uniform and their \nfamilies. It will give them the tools they need to remain the most \neffective fighting force in the world, and most important of all, it \nwill send an important message that we as a nation stand behind them \nand appreciate their service.\n  I look forward to working with all of our colleagues to pass this \nvital legislation and again would urge all of our colleagues who have \namendments to bring them to our attention so we can try very hard to \nclear amendments which can get support on both sides of the aisle and \nwhich have no strong objection.\n  This has been a process which has worked for as many years as I have \nbeen here, and it is the only way we are going to be able to get a bill \npassed this week. Again, it is critically important that this bill pass \nthis week or else there seems to be very little hope we could actually \nget a bill to conference and back to both Houses.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 5 minutes, and that after I conclude my remarks, Senator Chambliss \nbe recognized, followed by Senator Ayotte.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I rise to highlight for Senators the \nimportant work of the Airland Subcommittee in the fiscal year 2014 \nNational Defense Authorization Act as reported by the Committee on \nArmed Services. I am very proud to be the chairman of the Airland \nSubcommittee and for the close working relationship I have with Senator \nWicker, the ranking member of the subcommittee.\n  The Airland Subcommittee has broad responsibilities for substantial \nparts of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force budgets. The \nAirland Subcommittee also has responsibility for National Guard and \nReserve equipment and readiness. As a former governor, I know firsthand \nhow effective the National Guard is, and they provide a great value for \nall Americans.\n  Throughout this process the goal of the Airland Subcommittee has been \nto promote and improve current and future readiness of our military, \nall while ensuring the most efficient and effective use of taxpayer \ndollars. This year the Airland Subcommittee has jurisdiction over $49 \nbillion of the Defense\n\n[[Page S8162]]\n\nDepartment's base and overseas contingency budget. This includes $37.1 \nbillion for procurement and $11.9 billion for research and development.\n  In this regard the Airland Subcommittee's recommendation fully \nsupports the Department's budget request for Overseas Contingency \nOperations and would support most of the major weapons and equipment \nprograms in the base as requested. However, sequestration presents many \nchallenges. We can no longer spend billions of dollars buying equipment \nthe military does not need or want. Just a few days ago, the chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of staff, General Dempsey, provided me with a list \nof programs the Department of Defense no longer needs and they want to \nretire.\n  This much is clear: We can no longer conduct business as usual. In \nfact, the Bowles-Simpson Commission recommended the Department of \nDefense and Congress establish a commission that would review major \nweapons programs unneeded by the Department. This is something we \nshould take a look at. I look forward to working with my colleagues on \nthis important issue, and the National Commission on the Structure of \nthe Air Force is already reviewing and will make recommendations on the \nretirements and divestiture of aircraft the military no longer needs.\n  In future subcommittee work I will be reviewing General Dempsey's \nlist and will be working with my colleagues on the programs the \nDepartment no longer needs.\n  Congress must debate this important issue so that we spend every \ndollar we have wisely and keep our military the strongest in the world.\n  I wish to compliment Senator Wicker again on how well we have worked \ntogether this year, and I thank Chairman Levin, Ranking Member Inhofe, \nand the wonderful committee staff who have worked so closely with my \nstaff and me on this bill.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, first of all, let me say to my friend \nfrom West Virginia--I happen to serve on that subcommittee and I was in \nthe hearing the other day when he asked a question of General Dempsey, \na very appropriate question. We thought a very strong answer was going \nto be given by Senator Dempsey to the question of the Senator from West \nVirginia regarding weapons systems and other expenditures that are \nmandated by Congress that the chiefs and other folks at the Pentagon \nhave said they don't need. As he and I were just discussing, we finally \ngot that letter yesterday, and it was somewhat of a very tepid response \nrather than the strong response we had hoped for.\n  In any event, the Senator from West Virginia, along with Senator \nCoburn and myself, are going to work together to develop a list of \nexpenditures that are either unwanted by the Pentagon that Congress has \nmandated or expenditures that ought to be spent in some other agency \nbut, unfortunately, are being charged to the Pentagon. So I look \nforward to working with the chairman on that issue, and I thank him and \nSenator Wicker for their leadership on the subcommittee.\n  I rise principally today in support of the Ayotte-Chambliss-Inhofe \namendment No. 2255, which would restore many of the legislative limits \nand requirements Congress has placed in recent years on the transfer of \nGuantanamo Bay detainees and prevent medical-related transfers to the \nUnited States. I believe these legislative safeguards are vital to our \nnational security and essential to good intelligence collection.\n  For several years now we have been debating the status of Guantanamo \nBay and the detainees who remain there. Time and time again, during the \ncourse of these debates, I have asked this administration to come up \nwith a viable, long-term detention and interrogation policy. Frankly, \nthey have failed to do so because of a stubborn commitment to a poorly \nthought out campaign promise to close Guantanamo.\n  The call to close Guantanamo may sound like a good campaign sound \nbite to some people but, frankly, in the real world of national \nsecurity it undermines good intelligence collection and increases the \nrisks that dangerous detainees will be back on the streets where they \ncan continue, as they have, to kill and harm Americans. These are not \nabstract theories; they are facts. The recidivism rate is nearly 29 \npercent and has been climbing steadily since detainees began being \nreleased from Guantanamo. This includes nearly 10 percent of detainees \nwho have returned to the fight after being transferred by the current \nadministration following the administration's extensive review of each \ndetainee.\n  Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula counts former Guantanamo detainees \nnot just among its members but among its leaders. A former Guantanamo \ndetainee is believed to have been involved in last year's Benghazi \nattacks that killed our ambassador and three other Americans.\n  The administration's stubborn refusal to add even one more terrorist \nto the Gitmo detainee population has forced the executive branch back \ninto the pre-9/11 mindset of treating terrorists as ordinary \ncriminals--a mindset we know doesn't work. A lot of people will come to \nthis floor on the other side of the aisle and say: Well, we have tried \nall of these terrorists in article III courts in the United States and \nit has worked. For the most part, they have been convicted, and they \nare now serving time. That is a fairly accurate statement. However, \nwhat they fail to say is that these article III trials of terrorists \nwho have been arrested inside the United States are nowhere near the \ncaliber of those who planned and carried out the attacks of 9/11 as \nwell as those who were captured on the battlefield seeking to kill and \nharm Americans and, in a lot of instances, did kill Americans and maim \nAmericans, and they are now housed at Guantanamo. That is a very, very \ndistinct difference, and those prisoners should not be treated the same \nas an ordinary common burglar is treated in an article III court here \nin the United States.\n  In response to criticisms of the approach that the mindset of 9/11 is \nbeing returned to, the administration now seems to favor interrogations \non board naval vessels. The end result, however, has been no different. \nAt the end of these brief interrogations, those individuals have been \ntransferred to Federal courts here in the United States where they are \nunlikely to provide any more intelligence information because they have \nbeen Mirandized and are now awaiting trial.\n  From the Christmas Day bomber to the Boston bomber to the East Africa \nembassies bomber, this preference for criminal prosecution at the \nexpense of intelligence collection has become the administration's \nstandard operating procedure. This is no way to defend our Nation, and \nit sends a message of weakness to terrorists and our allies alike.\n  This amendment Senator Ayotte, Senator Inhofe, and I are putting \nforward sends the right message to the American people. It ensures that \nour detention practices have clarity for the next year and that on a \npermanent basis no detainee will be transferred overseas unless there \nis a clear certification that the transfer is in the best interests of \nthe United States. This also sends a very clear message to the \nterrorists at Guantanamo Bay: You are not coming to the United States \nwhere you will have the advantage of article III courts.\n  This amendment includes five provisions.\n  No. 1, it imposes a 1-year ban on transfers to the United States of \nGuantanamo detainees, except in cases after the date of enactment where \nthe detainee is sent to Guantanamo for purposes of interrogation.\n  No. 2, it imposes a 1-year ban on transfers of detainees to Yemen--\nand I will speak more about that in a minute.\n  No. 3, it imposes a 1-year ban on building or modifying facilities \ninside the U.S. to house Guantanamo detainees.\n\n  No. 4, it makes permanent the certification requirements needed \nbefore any transfer of a detainee overseas.\n  Lastly, it strikes the provision in the bill that allows transfers of \ndetainees to the United States purely for medical care.\n  Let me address each provision very briefly. First, I have yet to hear \nwhy it is a good idea to bring Guantanamo detainees to the United \nStates. While the President made a promise to close Guantanamo, the \nAmerican people seem unified against bringing these detainees to the \nU.S. for any reason, and I believe we should listen to the American \npeople.\n\n[[Page S8163]]\n\n  It is clear that giving the Secretary of Defense the authority to \ndecide to bring detainees here for detention, trial, and incarceration \nwill have the same impact as Congress lifting the prohibition outright. \nBut the same issues we have been talking about for several years and \nthat GAO identified in its 2012 report on detention options inside of \nthe United States still exists. These include cost considerations, \nquestions about the legal status of the detainees, and concerns about \nprotecting the general public and personnel at these facilities or \nduring trial.\n  Let's look at who these 164 individuals are that remain at \nGuantanamo. We started out with about 860-something, as I recall, give \nor take a few. So we have already released both to other countries and, \nin some cases where we frankly made a mistake, individuals who should \nnot have been there, or it has been determined by the appropriate \nreviewing committees that these detainees were OK to be sent back to \ntheir country of origin or to some other host country that was willing \nto take them and supervise them or keep them in detention but to get \nthem out of Guantanamo. Now, the 164 who are remaining are the meanest, \nnastiest terrorists in the world, frankly. They are the ones nobody is \ngoing to want. So if nobody else wants them, why should we allow them \nto come to the United States?\n  These are the individuals who either planned and masterminded the \nattack on the United States on September 11, 2001, such as Khalid \nShaikh Mohammed, or they are individuals we picked up on the \nbattlefield who were actively engaged in fighting and killing \nAmericans, as well as engaged in building bombs that were intended to--\nand in a lot of instances did--explode and kill or injure Americans.\n  Some of these folks range from KSM to the USS Cole bomber who are \nawaiting trial and, frankly, should be tried at Guantanamo. In other \nwords, they are dangerous detainees who should not and cannot be sent, \nas I said, to any other country.\n  Many of us have been calling on the administration to send new \ndetainees to Guantanamo simply for interrogation. Detainees such as al-\nShabaab leader Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, East Africa Embassies bombing \nsuspect Abu Anas al-Libi, who was arrested in Libya recently, and \nsuspects in the Benghazi attacks all belong at Guantanamo where they \ncan be interrogated for a long time under the rules and articles of \nwar, without Miranda rights or criminal defense lawyers.\n  But this administration has consistently refused to even consider \nGuantanamo for interrogation of the meanest folks who still remain at \nlarge. It is off the table, as they tell us. Some have used the excuse \nthat it is off the table because of this restriction in previous \nDefense authorization acts. In other words, the administration could \nnot put any new detainees at Guantanamo for interrogation because they \ncould not send them to Federal court for trial.\n\n  If this administration had made any effort at all, even just once, \nover the past 4 years to interrogate detainees at Guantanamo rather \nthan holding them on a ship, this excuse would have much more merit. \nBut to make sure there are no excuses anymore, our amendment makes \nclear that detainees who are sent to Guantanamo specifically for the \npurposes of interrogation after the date of enactment may still be \ntransferred to the United States for trial in article III courts or \nbefore military tribunals. That means there is absolutely no need to \nhold another detainee on board a ship just to interrogate him. And \nthere is absolutely no excuse for not putting new detainees at \nGuantanamo Bay. This provision makes sense for the security of this \ncountry, and it makes sense for good intelligence collection.\n  The ban on transfers to Yemen is a very critical aspect of this \namendment. The amendment bans any detainee transfers to Yemen until \nDecember 31, 2014. It has been 4 years since the President imposed a \nmoratorium on transfers to Yemen from Guantanamo following the failed \nairplane bombing attempt on Christmas Day 2009 by Umar Farouk \nAbdulmutallab. At that time, Yemen was viewed as a hotspot for \nterrorists, especially with the rise of Al Qaeda in the Arabian \nPeninsula. Now, 4 years later, not much has really changed except for \nthe rising recidivism rate. We know that former detainees have rejoined \nAQAP both as leaders and as members. We know Yemen continues to \nstruggle with terrorist groups who are trying to make sure it remains \nan AQAP stronghold. And we know AQAP continues to look for ways, like \nthe 2009 failed Christmas Day bombing, to attack this country.\n  We have all seen the reports that the administration wants to \ntransfer detainees to Yemen and is working with the Yemeni Government \nto set up a detention or rehabilitation facility inside Yemen to house \nthese prisoners. We learned from the Saudi rehabilitation program that \nrehabilitating hardened terrorists simply does not always work. The \nrecidivism rate for the Saudi program is at least 20 percent. Many of \nthese detainees, such as AQAP leader Said al-Shihri, ended up in Yemen \nfighting as terrorists again. Yemen, as one senior administration \nofficial described it, is like the Wild West. It is the last place we \nshould send dangerous detainees. In other words, now is not the time to \nexperiment with our national security.\n  Our amendment ensures that no detainee can be sent to Yemen over the \nnext year. I recognize that there are Yemeni detainees who have been \ncleared for transfer, so we do not permanently prohibit those \ntransfers. But just because a detainee is eligible for transfer from \nGuantanamo does not mean he no longer poses any threat at all. We have \nto remember that the easiest transfers have already been done, and even \namong those easy transfers, over a quarter of them have been known to \nbe reengaged in the fight against Americans.\n  So our amendment imposes a reasonable time period on this \nprohibition: No transfers can occur until at least December 31, 2014. \nOver the next year we should have a better sense of how well the Yemeni \nGovernment is combating terrorists within its borders. Once we see \ntheir track record, we can decide whether it makes sense to send them \nany new detainees.\n  In the past, under the previous Government of Yemen, the detainees \nwho were transferred from Guantanamo to Yemen simply were allowed to \nwander around in Yemen with no supervision whatsoever, and I daresay \nthat we now do not have any idea where most of those detainees are \ninside of Yemen or, more significantly, whether they are still in \nYemen, whether they are reengaged in the fight, whether they are in \nSyria fighting on one side or the other, or what has gone on with those \ndetainees.\n  Al Qaeda and its affiliates look up to Guantanamo detainees. They \nhave immediate street credibility among terrorists, which makes it more \ntempting for them to rejoin the fight. We should not make it easier to \ntransfer detainees anywhere, much less places where there are confirmed \nrecidivists or a real threat from AQAP. The detainees, including many \nof the Yemenis, who remain at Guantanamo are among the worst offenders.\n  We should want all future transfers to be done wisely and fully in \nline with our national security interests. This amendment accomplishes \nthose objectives.\n  Third, this amendment continues the ban on building or modifying \nfacilities inside the United States to hold those detainees. It does \nnot prohibit any changes to the facilities at Guantanamo Bay, so those \nfacilities will continue to be state-of-the-art.\n  I understand that this administration wants to close Guantanamo and \nthat the Justice Department has already purchased the correctional \nfacility in Thomson, IL, to house them. But there is still overwhelming \nconsensus here in Congress and among the American people that \nGuantanamo detainees should never set foot inside the United States. We \nneed to listen to that consensus.\n  With that in mind, our amendment ensures that not one penny of \nAmerican taxpayer dollars will be spent on the Thomson facility or to \nbuild or modify any other facility inside the United States to house \nGuantanamo detainees. Our amendment applies not just to Defense \nDepartment funding but to all U.S. Government funds. That way, no other \nDepartment, including\n\n[[Page S8164]]\n\nthe Justice Department, can try to circumvent the will of the American \npeople and bring Guantanamo detainees to our homeland.\n  Many of us have been to Guantanamo. I have been there several times \nto see for myself how the detainees live and are treated. It is a \nfirst-rate prison facility. I have been to many prison facilities in my \nState as well as other parts of the country. It is one that would \nprobably make most inmates at prisons here inside the United States \nvery envious.\n  We should not forget that many of the detainees at Guantanamo are \nsome of the most dangerous terrorists in the world. If they cannot be \ntransferred to other countries, they do not belong in the United \nStates.\n  This amendment also makes permanent the certification requirements \nthat are needed before any detainee can be transferred outside of \nGuantanamo Bay. As I mentioned, the recidivism rate today is almost 29 \npercent and growing, so we should not make it easier to transfer \ndetainees anywhere, much less to places where there are recidivists or \nreal terrorist threats. The certification requirements and the ban on \ntransfer if there is a confirmed recidivist in a host country were \ndesigned to lessen the likelihood that detainees would reengage.\n  I understand that some people want Guantanamo closed, but eliminating \ncommonsense measures that are there to protect American citizens is not \nthe way to do it. These measures give Congress and the American people \nconfidence that the Defense Secretary has fully considered all aspects \nof the transfer, especially the host country's past record and current \ncapabilities.\n  As the rising recidivism rate tells us, even detainees who have been \ncleared for transfer--through a very rigorous process, I might add--can \nstill pose a threat. We have to remember that the easiest transfers \nhave already been done, and even among those over a quarter have \nreengaged. The detainees who remain are among the worst offenders. We \nshould want all future transfers to be done wisely and fully in line \nwith our national security interests.\n  I do not find persuasive the argument that these certification \nrequirements are so burdensome that detainees cannot be transferred. In \nfact, this year alone detainees have been transferred to Algeria, and \nwe continue to get notices of other proposed transfers.\n  Not every detainee needs to stay at Guantanamo Bay. I recognize that, \nas do the other authors of this amendment. But not one should be \nreleased until we are absolutely certain that everything is being done \nto prevent new terrorist activity on the part of those individuals who \nare, in fact, released. These certification requirements give us that \ncertainty. Making these requirements permanent is the only sure way to \nguarantee that each and every transfer is best for the national \nsecurity of the United States.\n  Finally, this amendment restores the status quo by striking section \n1032 in the bill, which allows the transfer of detainees into the \nUnited States for medical care. We need to remember that Guantanamo is \na first-class facility, operated by dedicated military personnel who \nput up with an awful lot from detainees. I remember the first time I \nwent to Guantanamo, they were housed in a facility that is not the \nfacility they are in today. It was much more of an open facility where \nthe guards simply would walk back and forth in very close range to the \nactual prisoners themselves. Those guards were subjected to being spit \nupon, having human waste thrown at them as well as food or anything the \ndetainees could get their hands on. Needless to say, it was not a very \nnice place to be.\n  But we need to remember also that Guantanamo possesses not only \nfirst-class medical facilities but also first-class judicial facilities \nfor the trial of these individuals. There is a state-of-the-art \ncourtroom down there, which is being virtually unused today, that ought \nto be used to try these individuals before a military tribunal.\n  Section 1032 seems to be a solution in search of a problem. \nGuantanamo Bay has the facilities from a medical standpoint and the \ndoctors within the military to treat these prisoners. And I am not \naware of any instance in which a detainee has died or suffered further \ninjury because of our inability to treat them at Guantanamo.\n  Aside from being unnecessary, this provision does not make good \npolicy. Over the past several years detainees at Guantanamo have waged \nrepeated hunger strikes in an effort to gain sympathy so the United \nStates will release them from prison. When inmates in our prisons here \nengage in such tactics, we do not reward them, but that is exactly what \nsection 1032 would do. If we give detainees the ability to be brought \nto the United States even for what is supposed to be temporary \ntreatment, that is a powerful incentive for a detainee to injure \nhimself or go on a hunger strike.\n  I am also concerned about how this provision would even be \nimplemented. It is unclear whether we will have to modify military \nhospitals so they can handle high-value terrorist detainees. At what \ncost and at what risk to the safety of others, including the towns in \nwhich these facilities are located?\n  I appreciate that the provision tries to limit the rights of \ndetainees when they are brought here, but we have been down this road \nbefore with habeas corpus rights. Once a detainee is physically inside \nthe United States, it becomes much more difficult to argue against any \nchange in immigration or legal status.\n  In my view, section 1032 is simply in this bill to further reduce the \npopulation at Guantanamo. This is not a goal I can support. Our \namendment keeps the status quo and keeps these terrorist detainees \nwhere they belong--at Guantanamo Bay.\n  It is time for this administration to provide real leadership on \ndetention and interrogation issues instead of trying to keep ill-\nconceived campaign promises that run contrary to the established facts \nand known threats to our national security. Keeping this country safe \ndemands real-time intelligence--the kind we have gotten in the past \nfrom interrogating detainees for long periods of time, including those \ndetainees at Guantanamo. It is time for us to end this dangerous \npractice of treating terrorists first and foremost like criminals who \ndeserve Miranda warnings, attorneys, and court appearances.\n  It is time for us to stop pretending that the detainees at Guantanamo \nare no different from common ordinary criminals. Our amendment ensures \nthat the balance remains on the side of our national security and good \nintelligence collection. It ensures that common sense, not politics, \nwill determine the future of Guantanamo detainees and the effectiveness \nof our intelligence collection.\n  I am pleased to turn to the Senator from New Hampshire, Senator \nAyotte, who has been such a champion on this issue. She and I have \nworked very closely, as well as any number of other national security \nissues, since she came to the Senate. She has been a tremendous asset. \nAs a former prosecutor, she understands how serious these individuals \nare from a criminal standpoint.\n  I commend her for the great work she has done, and I certainly look \nforward to hearing her comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I wish to thank my colleague from Georgia, who is the \nRepublican ranking member on the Senate Intelligence Committee. Senator \nChambliss has seen so much in terms of the real threats that we face \nfrom terrorists in this country. I appreciate his leadership on \nensuring that America remains safe and his leadership on this issue of \nensuring that the Guantanamo detainees are not released to get back in \nthe fight against us, to attack not only our soldiers but us and our \nallies.\n  I would start with the Defense authorization, as it stands, and even \nthe side-by-side offered by Chairman Levin, is a dramatic change from \ncurrent policy of where we are now with regard to Guantanamo and the \ntransfer of Guantanamo detainees internationally and to the United \nStates of America between last year's Defense authorization and this \nyear's Defense authorization.\n  What has changed? The only thing that has changed is the fact that \nthe reengagement rate of those who are suspected of having been \nreleased--who have been released from Guantanamo and are suspected or \nactually have reengaged in the fight against us--has increased, not \ndecreased.\n  Yet the status quo of where we stand now, if our amendment just \ndescribed\n\n[[Page S8165]]\n\nby Senator Chambliss is not adopted, amendment No. 2255--is that we \nwould weaken what is required to be certified from people who are \nreleased from Guantanamo.\n  In other words, the Defense authorization and the proposal offered by \nChairman Levin would weaken the national security requirements that are \ncurrently in place; the standards which we have to meet before someone \nis transferred from Guantanamo to another country, even though the \nreengagement rate has actually increased.\n  What else would it do? It would now allow the potential for \ntransferring Guantanamo detainees to the United States of America. This \nwould include Guantanamo detainees potentially such as Khalid Shaikh \nMohammed whom Senator Chambliss has referenced. He is the mastermind of \nSeptember 11. He is the key player behind the attacks on our country on \nSeptember 11, and so we are going to allow the potential that he could \nbe transferred to the United States of America.\n  In addition, there is allowance for a potential transfer to the \ncountry of Yemen. As Senator Chambliss has talked about, the country of \nYemen is the place where the head of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula \nis centered. Not only that, in Yemen, there have actually been \ninstances where we have seen prison breaks in Yemen. In fact, it is a \nvery destabilized place.\n  In June I asked the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff about \nYemen, and he assessed it to be the most dangerous. Al Qaeda in the \nArabian Peninsula, which is located in Yemen, is the most dangerous Al \nQaeda affiliate. Again, when we look at Yemen, there have been breaks \nfrom detention facilities there.\n  Senator Chambliss has described the 2009 Christmas Day Bomber who \nreceived his training in Yemen.\n  We have Guantanamo detainees who have actually been captured--whom we \nhave let out previously--captured, killed or spotted in Yemen. These \nincluded Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's former second in command, \nSaid al-Shihri and Ibrahim Suleiman al Rubaish, alleged to be one of Al \nQaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's main religious leaders. We have \ninstances where in Yemen there actually been have Al Qaeda terrorists, \nsome who have returned to the leadership of Al Qaeda after we released \nthem from Guantanamo and have gone back in.\n  I ask, why are we lifting the prohibition of transfers to Yemen when \nthere still is not a certification that can be made that they will not \nreengage and that Yemen even can detain these individuals or account \nfor them in a place which is the head of Al Qaeda in the Arabian \nPeninsula?\n  Where we are now is very important in terms of the protection of our \ncountry. As Senator Chambliss mentioned, the administration has been so \ncaught up in not wanting to transfer anyone into Guantanamo that we are \nleft with a situation where we are potentially losing valuable \nintelligence to protect our country.\n  I wish to speak about that. If we captured tomorrow the current head \nof Al Qaeda, Zawahiri, what would we do with him? Are we going to bring \nhim to the United States or should we bring him to a secure detention \nfacility at Guantanamo?\n  The legal questions that are raised by this in terms of if we bring \nhim to the United States, are we going to tell him you have the right \nto remain silent, even though he is the current head of Al Qaeda? \nShouldn't the first priority be to collect information to protect our \ncountry, to know what they are planning, to know what they are doing, \nto know what could happen next?\n  We now have the example that was given of Warsame, who was a \nterrorist captured overseas. Instead of being brought to Guantanamo, he \nwas put on a ship for approximately 60 days and then brought to the \nUnited States, where he was told you have the right to remain silent.\n  Worse, recently, there was the capture of a man named al-Libi, and \nal-Libi actually had been involved in the beginning--in fact, the \nDirector of the Federal Bureau of Investigation recently said before \nthe Homeland Security Committee that he was a founder of Al Qaeda with \nOsama bin Laden--and recaptured in Libya. Rather than bring him to \nGuantanamo Bay, he was put on a ship for only 1 week, 1 week.\n  Then he was transferred to New York City and read his Miranda rights. \nThis is someone who was alleged to have committed the bombing against \nthe embassies in Africa in 1998 and someone who has decades of \ninvolvement in Al Qaeda and who was only interrogated on a ship for 1 \nweek, rather than being brought to Guantanamo and fully interrogated to \nmake sure we maximize the gathering of intelligence to protect our \ncountry.\n  Now the administration wants to close Guantanamo. The alternative \noffered by Chairman Levin is that they should come up with a plan of \nwhere we would put these detainees in the United States of America.\n  The question is why have we had to wait this long, first, to even \nhave some information of what the plan would be and what to do. Second, \nwhy would we want the most dangerous terrorists in the world, some of \nthem, to come to the United States of America, when we have a secure \ndetention facility at Guantanamo? Why would we risk the legal questions \nthat will be raised if we bring them to the United States? Do we have \nto read them Miranda? If we capture Zawahiri and we have no Guantanamo \nto take him to, do we have to read him Miranda because he is in the \nUnited States of America and we can't gather intelligence to protect \nour country?\n  How much does it cost to make sure people are secure in the area \nwhere these terrorists are being brought? We don't even know where they \nwill be brought because the alternative amendment, all it says is that \nthey have to come up with a plan of where to put these terrorists \nrather than at Guantanamo. We don't know--the amendment does not \nprovide for us as Congress to approve this plan. It only says the \nSecretary of Defense has to come up with a plan, and then he may take \naction to transfer the detainees, allowing them to be transferred to \nthe United States of America.\n  Stay tuned if the Guantanamo detainees are coming to your \nneighborhood because we don't know. This is why it is important that \nthe prohibitions stay in place in the absence of any plan. Why should \nwe bring them to the United States of America, given the dangerous \nnature of who they are? Also, why wouldn't we want to have a secure \nfacility to ensure that we have a place to interrogate terrorists, to \nmake sure we can maximize the information and understand what they know \nto prevent attacks against our country. Otherwise, we will continue to \nhave a situation where terrorists such as al-Libi are only interrogated \nfor 1 week and then they are told you have the right to remain silent. \nNo terrorist should hear that right.\n  I wish to say that what this provision does is it puts back in place \nthe requirements that the administration has to meet a strong set of \ncriteria before they can transfer to third-party countries.\n  What was taken out? What was taken out, which is important, is the \nway they have weakened the requirements for transferring people, the \nrequirements the administration must meet before transferring from \nGuantanamo to third-party countries. They have taken out language that \nrequires the Secretary of Defense currently to certify that a country \nis not a state sponsor of terrorism or foreign terrorist organization.\n  Now there is no longer a requirement that we even have to certify \nthat. If our amendment is not passed and the alternative is passed, if \nthere is a country or an entity that is a state sponsor of terrorism or \na foreign terrorist organization, then they can transfer there.\n  They have also taken out the provision that would consider whether we \nhave previously transferred a detainee to the country and yet the \ndetainee has gone back into the fight, has reengaged. In other words, \nif we made a mistake in the past and transferred someone out of \nGuantanamo to a country such as Yemen, they weren't able to secure that \nindividual and that individual gets back into the fight, that was a \nconsideration they had to take into account before they could transfer \nto that country.\n  That is now being removed from the national security criteria, making \nit much weaker and easier to transfer to countries that are not only \npotential sponsors of terrorism but are also\n\n[[Page S8166]]\n\ncountries where we have already had a history of transferring detainees \nwho have gotten back in the fight against us and our soldiers. We have \nseen some of these detainees show up in places such as Afghanistan \nagainst our soldiers. We have seen these detainees attempt to attack us \nand our allies. We cannot risk weakening the provisions to say we are \ngoing to transfer them and take our risks that they can do that again.\n  We should keep the current law in place. The administration has been \nable to meet the current law. They have transferred six detainees under \nthe current provisions. They do not have an excuse to say that we can't \ntransfer anyone because they have already been able to transfer people.\n  I ask unanimous consent to ask my colleague, the Senator from \nGeorgia, a question about these provisions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I ask Senator Chambliss, if we eliminate Guantanamo--in \nother words, under this proposal they would be permitted to transfer \npeople to the United States of America or that new captures be brought \nto the United States of America instead of to a facility such as \nGuantanamo, what are the risks we face in terms of losing valuable \nintelligence that we need to protect our country?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. The very best tool we have been able to utilize from \nan intelligence-gathering standpoint is the information we gather from \nindividuals who were involved in the crime or involved in the planning \nof the crime. That is the case whether it is an ordinary burglary, bank \nrobbery or in the case that we are talking about today, the planning \nand the scheming of the carrying out of what happened on September 11, \nas well as terrorist activity prior to that, such as the USS Cole \nbombing and others, as well as terrorist activity against the United \nStates subsequent to September 11, as well as the detainees who are at \nGuantanamo today who were captured on the battlefield in Afghanistan.\n  We have gone through each one of the detainees who were involved in \nspecific incidents or who are battlefield-captured detainees and we \nhave been able to gather intelligence from them that we simply would \nnot have been able to get from anyone else. Many times what we have \nwhen we interrogate the detainees, we will know the answer to the \nquestion we are going to ask them. Sometimes it is information that was \ngleaned from detainee X, who was with detainee Y whom we are now \ninterrogating. By virtue of the fact that we know information that we \nhave already gleaned from detainee X, we can ask terrorist Y about it \nor detainee Y. And you are going to get not only verification of what \nthe first interrogated detainee tells you, but all of a sudden you are \ngoing to have an expanded story because this guy says, well, he knows \nthis, and that is the case, so I may as well go ahead and tell him the \nrest of this.\n\n  That is kind of the way the interrogation process goes. What has \nhappened at Guantanamo is that it has been there for a number of years \nnow. September 11 is now 12 years behind us, but we are still gathering \ninformation from detainees at Guantanamo who have been there from the \nvery first day it opened. We are gathering information on acts of \nviolence that have occurred, but more significantly on the makeup of Al \nQaeda, on who the members are, where they are located, where their \nheadquarters were versus where they think the headquarters might be. \nThere is such a valuable source of information to be gleaned from \nindividuals one on one in the interrogation process that we simply \ncan't get otherwise.\n  Let me refer a question to the Senator from New Hampshire. She was a \nprosecutor. She was the attorney general of New Hampshire and she \nprosecuted any number of criminal cases over the years as attorney \ngeneral, including some very violent cases. She is familiar with the \ncriminal process, obviously. She is familiar with individuals who have \nbeen convicted of crimes, and who, in some instances, were let out of \njail when their time was up or whatever and those individuals reengaged \nin criminal activity, much like what we are seeing at Guantanamo today. \nThe Senator and I have both talked about the recidivism rate being very \nhigh.\n  What is the Senator's opinion, as a long-time prosecutor, relative to \nthese 164 individuals who remain at Guantanamo Bay today with regard to \nwhat she thinks is the possibility or the probability of their \nreengaging in the fight because of their long-term detention at \nGuantanamo?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I would say we have to go from the evidence we have \nbefore us, where we have a 29-percent reengagement rate. And let's face \nit. The easier decisions were made first, in terms of who should be \nreleased. Now we have some very hardcore individuals who are there. We \nalready have a 29-percent reengagement rate of them getting back in the \nfight against us as terrorists, and so we face a grave risk of some of \nthe most hardened individuals if we transfer them or we lessen the \nstandard for transfer, which is what this is doing. It is taking away \nthe issues I talked about--the consideration of countries we have \nalready transferred to but people have gotten back in it--and making it \neasier to transfer and weaker in terms of the national security \nrequirements that have to be met, and I am worried they will get back \nin and then harm us and our interests because we already have a history \nof that.\n  I want to ask the Senator from Georgia an additional question. Some \nhave cited the cost issue as the reason we should close Guantanamo. But \nto the Senator's knowledge, has anyone done the cost estimate of all \nthe considerations that would have to be taken into account in the \nUnited States and also the security interests of the people of this \ncountry of transferring these terrorists to the United States?\n  Finally, I would also say there are risks we face in losing \nintelligence if they have to be Mirandized, and things such as that. \nThat is a huge cost in terms of protecting our country, is it not?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Well, it certainly is. I think the Senator and I need \nto be very clear with our colleagues here as well as the American \npublic. When it comes to the cost of detaining terrorists who carried \nout the horrific attacks of September 11, I think the American people \nare well prepared to use their taxpayer dollars to house guys such as \nKhalid Shaikh Mohammed, who has admitted to planning the September 11 \nattacks. If we house him in a prison here inside the United States and \nhe gets Mirandized, I am sure the first thing he is going to do is to \nget a lawyer. The Senator and I are both lawyers, and we would be \nfoolish not to tell our client to hush up, don't talk anymore. And that \nis exactly what he would do.\n  So the cost of detaining individuals who ripped this country apart on \nSeptember 11, 2001, is not a consideration, in my mind, from the \nstandpoint of whether we should house those folks for the rest of their \nlives.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. If we were to lose, for example, valuable intelligence, \nif we were to get Zawahiri tomorrow, or if we had captured Osama bin \nLaden instead of killing him, and were able to interrogate him, that is \na value that cannot be placed on that in terms of preventing future \nattacks and understanding how Al Qaeda is planning things in order to \nprevent future harm to Americans; isn't that right?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Absolutely. No question about it. And if you do bring \nthem to the United States, I guarantee that is the last bit of \ninterrogation of any of those individuals that we will ever see.\n  The Senator mentioned bin Laden. I remember at a hearing in the \nSenate Armed Services Committee where the issue of bin Laden came up \nduring a presentation by the current administration's Secretary of \nDefense. I asked the question with regard to Guantanamo Bay, and said: \nIf you captured bin Laden tomorrow, what would you do with him? And to \nhis credit, the Secretary of Defense looked me straight in the eye and \nsaid: Gee, Senator, I guess we would have to send him to Guantanamo. \nAnd he was right. There is nowhere in America where bin Laden would \nhave been welcomed in the county jail or some Federal institution. I \ndon't think there is any question about that. The 164 who are there \ntoday, in my mind, fit in that same category. Some of these individuals \nhave never said one word to an interrogator since they have been there. \nSome\n\n[[Page S8167]]\n\nof them--most of them, in fact--have been very open, and we still are \ngathering intelligence from them. But if we transfer them to the United \nStates, that is the last we will hear from them.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I have been listening to the discussion. I agree \nwholeheartedly with everything that has been said. The amendment we are \ngoing to be voting on is part of three different amendments. I had one \nof them, as do my two colleagues. One thing that hasn't been said is \nthe part I put in where I constructed a provision to prohibit \ntransferring of detainees for emergency medical treatment, which is \njust another way of getting them there.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The other thing is, when you transfer someone here for \nincarceration purposes, is it not true these are not criminals, these \nare terrorists, and what terrorists do for a living is train other \npeople to be terrorists? To commingle them in our prison system is \nsomething that would be of great danger to this country. That is \nsomething my colleagues would agree is one of the major reasons we want \nto keep them from the United States.\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I would agree with Ranking Member Inhofe, and I want to \nthank him for his leadership. Absolutely, these are not common \ncriminals. These are not people who have robbed a bank. These are \npeople who have attacked our country and who seek to get other people \nto attack our country. That is the reason why we wouldn't want to \nmingle them with criminals or bring them to the United States so they \ncan be told they have the right to remain silent. We have to protect \nour country by knowing what they know.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Parliamentary inquiry: The Chair has said the time on our \nside has expired. Of course, I know----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I know the chairman wants to use some time here too.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of his remarks, if all \ntime has not been consumed, I be given a few minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I understand the situation is as follows: \nthat the time between now and 4 o'clock is under majority control, and \nthen between 4 o'clock and 5 o'clock we have not resolved that issue as \nto who would control time; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So there may be more time available between 4 o'clock and \n5 o'clock.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Would the Senator repeat that?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Under the existing UC, the time between now and 4 o'clock \nis under the control of the majority, because the minority has used \ntheir time. At 4 o'clock, we have to enter into another UC--or we can \ndo it now--deciding what the situation will be for the hour between 4 \no'clock and the time of the vote.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the provisions in this bill \nrelating to the Guantanamo detention facility, or Gitmo, and oppose the \namendment to strike those provisions and to reinstate existing \nrestrictions on the transfer of Gitmo detainees.\n  Gitmo is expensive, inefficient, damaging to U.S. international \nstanding, harmful to our allies' ability to cooperate with us, and \nserves as a recruiting tool for extremists. It is not needed to secure \npeople who should be detained and should be tried. There are other \nplaces for detention and for trial in front of a military tribunal. We \ndon't need Gitmo to stay open at a huge expense in order to do that.\n  The bill before us makes long overdue fixes to our ability to \ntransfer detainees out of Gitmo, provide our military with needed \nflexibility to determine how long we need to detain individuals now \nheld at the Guantanamo facility, and where we should hold them.\n  For a number of years now, Congress has enacted legislation \neliminating that flexibility and requiring we continue to hold all \nGitmo detainees at Guantanamo whether or not it is in our national \nsecurity interests to do so. The current law establishes an absolute \nban on bringing any Gitmo detainee to the United States for any \npurpose, including detention, trial, incarceration, or even medical \ntreatment. And it replaces the best judgment of our military and \nintelligence experts on the risk posed by an additional Gitmo detainee \nwith a cumbersome checklist of requirements that must be certified \nbefore any detainee may be transferred overseas.\n  The current law makes it more difficult to try detainees for their \ncrimes and nearly impossible to return them to their home countries. \nFor example, even if we have a strong case that a detainee has \ncommitted crimes for which he could be indicted, convicted in Federal \nCourt, the current law makes it impossible to try him. This is true \neven in cases where similar charges are not available before a military \ncommission, making it impossible to try the detainee at Guantanamo. And \nit is true even in cases where the security risks in bringing the \ndetainee to the United States would be nonexistent.\n  In 2010, the Guantanamo Detainee Review Task Force recommended 44 \nGitmo detainees for possible prosecution. As a result in significant \npart of the legislated restrictions on transferring detainees to the \nUnited States for trial, however, we have had only 4 of the 44 plea \nbargains and no other successful prosecutions of those detainees.\n  Similarly, even if we have determined that a detainee poses no \nongoing security threat to the United States, we cannot send them back \nto their home country unless the Secretary of Defense certifies to six \nconditions addressing issues such as the country's control over its own \nterritory and its detention facilities and so forth. And even if the \nindividual is likely to die without advanced medical treatment, we \ncannot remove him from Gitmo for the purpose of receiving such \ntreatment.\n  In 2010, the Guantanamo Detainee Review Task Force conducted a \nrigorous interagency review and determined that more than half of the \nGitmo population, including 84 of the 164 detainees currently at Gitmo, \ncould be safely transferred overseas without posing a significant \nsecurity threat. However, only two Gitmo detainees have actually been \ntransferred using the certification provision since it was enacted at \nthe end of 2010.\n  Under the current law, even if a detainee has been convicted or pled \nguilty and served his sentence, even if he has cooperated with us and \nprovided us with useful intelligence, even if he has renounced all ties \nto Al Qaeda or the Taliban, even if he has been determined to no longer \npose a threat to our national security, it is still extremely difficult \nto transfer or release a Gitmo detainee. That is why we still have \ndetainees sitting in Guantanamo who have been cleared for transfer or \nrelease on multiple occasions by two different administrations over a \nperiod of almost a decade.\n  The current law has reinforced, as a result, the impression held by \nmany around the world that Guantanamo is a legal black hole where we \nhold detainees without recourse. This perception has been used by our \nenemies to recruit jihadists to attack us, and it has made our friends \nless willing to cooperate with us in our efforts to fight terrorism \naround the world. For this reason, many of our top national security \nleaders spanning the Bush and Obama administrations have repeatedly \ntold us of the harm that Gitmo causes to our national security.\n  First, with respect to transfers of Gitmo detainees overseas to their \nhome countries or other countries, the bill would streamline the \nonerous certification procedures imposed by Congress and restore the \nability of our military leaders to exercise their best judgment in \ndetermining whether detainees could be transferred abroad consistent \nwith our national security. This provision would enable the Department \nof Defense to handle Gitmo detainees in the same way that it has \nhandled other detainees in the course\n\n[[Page S8168]]\n\nof the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan--by making case-by-case \ndeterminations whether it is in our national security interest to \ncontinue holding an individual.\n  Second, with respect to transfers of Gitmo detainees into the United \nStates, the bill would reverse the one-size-fits-all ban that Congress \nhas imposed on such transfers and permit case-by-case determinations of \nwhether it is in our national security interest to transfer Gitmo \ndetainees into custody inside the United States for detention and \ntrial. This provision would restore our Nation's ability to use a key \ntool in the fight against the terrorist threat. That tool is \nprosecution of Gitmo detainees in Federal courts.\n  I have offered a side-by-side amendment with Senator McCain which \nrequires the administration to develop a comprehensive plan and submit \nit to Congress before it could transfer any detainees to the United \nStates under this provision. This plan would include a case-by-case \ndetermination of each individual held at Guantanamo where the \nindividual is intended to be held, including the specific facility or \nfacilities inside the United States that would be used and the \nestimated costs of any modification that may be needed at those \nfacilities.\n  The side-by-side amendment would also clarify that Gitmo detainees \nwould not gain any additional legal rights as a result of their \ntransfer to the United States for detention and trial. In particular, \ndetainees who are transferred to the United States would not gain any \nadditional rights; would not be permitted to be released inside the \nUnited States; would not lose their status as unprivileged enemy \nbelligerents eligible for detention and trial under the law of war; and \nwould not gain any additional right to challenge his or her detention \nbeyond the right to habeas corpus--which they already have at \nGuantanamo, as the Supreme Court has decided.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Feinstein be \nadded as a cosponsor to our side-by-side amendment, the Levin-McCain \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Guantanamo continues to be a damaging reminder of a failed \nU.S. strategy that sought to put captured terrorists beyond the reach \nof the law and the U.S. courts. A dozen years ago the Bush \nadministration started sending detainees to Gitmo in large part out of \na desire to avoid the jurisdiction of the United States courts and \nensure that detainees would have no legal avenue to appeal their \nconvictions. Now, whether or not one supported that approach, that \nargument ended in 2008, when the Supreme Court ruled in the Boumediene \ncase that Gitmo detainees would be treated as being inside the United \nStates for the purpose of habeas corpus appeals.\n  Instead of recognizing the problems with maintaining the Gitmo \nfacility--the problems of extreme costs, and that it adds no additional \nsecurity to what exists if these people are brought to the United \nStates for military trial, as being held as prisoners under the laws of \nwar, or for Federal court trial, even though all of that is still \npossible inside the United States--we have enacted legislation which \nmakes it virtually impossible to move detainees anywhere else, ensuring \nthat the facility is going to remain open whether we need it or not.\n  The result is that we are stuck with an expensive facility. And make \nno mistake, the costs of the Guantanamo detention facility are \nexorbitant. The Department of Defense has put the costs associated with \nGitmo at over $400 million a year. That is more than $2.5 million per \ndetainee. If we had any additional security as a result, it would be \nworth it. But we don't need Gitmo for additional security. These \ndetainees can be held in the United States. They can be held for trial, \nthey can be held according to the rule of law, and they can be held \nunder the military as military detainees.\n  Now, $2.5 million per detainee is, by some estimates, 35 times the \nannual cost of housing a prisoner at a supermax security prison inside \nthe United States. That does not include the more than $200 million in \nadditional military construction requests that the Department believes \nit needs to spend to keep Guantanamo running in the coming years. I \nrepeat: If this added to our security, it would be worth it. But it \ndoesn't. We can bring these same people to the United States to be held \nas prisoners of war the way we did Italians and others during World War \nII. I had hundreds in my home State. If we added to our security by \nkeeping Guantanamo open instead of just having a place which is used as \na training ground and used as an argument for Jihad--but we can keep \nthese people in the United States just as safely as Guantanamo in \nmaximum security prisons or under the military jurisdiction with the \nsame amount of security for the people of the United States at far less \ncost.\n  We are all facing sequestration. It is undermining the readiness of \nour Armed Forces, requires risky reductions in force structure, and \nmakes it likely we are going to have to cancel or severely curtail \nvital modernization programs. We cannot afford to spend $500 million a \nyear on a program that doesn't make us more safe.\n  The basis for the legislative obstacles to moving detainees out of \nGuantanamo appears to be the fear that returning Gitmo detainees to \ntheir home countries or transferring them to the United States would \npose an unacceptable threat to our national security. But history has \nshown that we bring numerous terrorists to the United States for trial \nor incarceration. It has had no adverse effect on our national \nsecurity. These prosecutions have resulted in hundreds of convictions \non terrorism-related charges without apparent adverse effect to our \nnational security. As the Attorney General wrote to Judiciary Committee \nChairman Leahy last week, terrorist prosecutions in Federal courts have \nbeen ``an essential element of our counterterrorism efforts'' and ``a \npowerful tool of proven effectiveness.''\n  In the last 3 years, we have brought three foreign terrorists into \nthe United States for trial. We brought Abu Ghaith, Osama bin Laden's \nson-in-law, who has been convicted in Federal court and remains in \nFederal custody without incident. The second is Ahmed Warsame, who pled \nguilty in Federal court and remains in Federal custody without \nincident. The third is Ahmed Ghailani, who was convicted in Federal \ncourt, received a life sentence, and remains in Federal custody without \nincident. Again, there have been hundreds of convictions in this \ncountry of persons connected to terrorism in Federal courts.\n  Our military has routinely detained individuals on the battlefield in \nAfghanistan and then exercised their discretion to transfer them to \nlocal jurisdiction or to release them. If we can trust our military to \nmake these determinations on a day-to-day basis for detainees in \nAfghanistan, we should be able to trust our military to make the same \ndetermination for detainees at Gitmo.\n  The rigorous review process which is codified by our bill's \nprovisions requires the Secretary of Defense to determine, prior to \ntransferring a Gitmo detainee, that the transfer is in our national \nsecurity interest and that actions have been taken to mitigate any risk \nthat the detainee could again engage in any activity that threatens \nUnited States persons or interests.\n  The provisions in this bill will get us past our fear that we cannot \nsecurely handle Gitmo detainees in this country. It would allow the \nSecretary of Defense to authorize Gitmo transfers to the United States \nfor detention and trial if doing so is in the United States' security \ninterests. This bill will restore the President's ability to choose the \nmost effective tool--whether that is military commissions or Federal \ncourts--to bring these Gitmo detainees to justice.\n  In conclusion, I urge our colleagues to support the Guantanamo \nprovisions in the bill, vote for the Levin-McCain-Feinstein side-by-\nside amendment, and oppose the effort to reinstate the \ncounterproductive and costly restrictions in current law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my understanding that at 4:00 there \nmight be a unanimous consent which will lead us to a vote at 5:00. Is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair has no knowledge about a vote at \n5:00.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n\n[[Page S8169]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield the time between now and 4:00 to \nthe Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it seems we are going to have an \nopportunity a little later on to discuss this tonight. In the capacity \nof the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, I have to say \nthat I can't imagine having a chairman with whom I cooperate and agree \nwith on almost every issue like Chairman Levin. I really appreciate the \nwork we have done together. We both recognize this is the most \nimportant piece of legislation each year, and we both recognize that, \nfor 51 consecutive years, we have had this legislation. Nothing has \ncome up to obstruct it. We also realize Republicans would prefer to \nhave more opportunities to have amendments, and Chairman Levin has been \nvery helpful in helping us to get that.\n  The area on which I don't agree is in the area of Gitmo and how it \nshould be used. Every time I go to Gitmo, I shake my head and I say: \nWhy in the world would we not use this resource? We don't have another \nresource like it. We heard the Senator from Georgia make the statement \nthat he asked the chairman: If we don't have Gitmo to send these \npeople, where are we going to send them? I believe it was Secretary of \nDefense Panetta who said: We don't know. There is not another place. We \nhave used it successfully since 1904.\n  I often have said, and said yesterday, that we don't have many good \ndeals in government. This is one that is. Since 1904, our rent on that \nterritory has been $4,000 a year. I don't think anyone can come up with \na better deal, and besides Castro doesn't collect it about half the \ntime.\n  It is argued that we can use it for interrogation. The information we \nreceived which led to Osama bin Laden's demise was received from \ninterrogation which took place at Gitmo.\n  When we talk about the treatment of people, the one thing that I \ndiscover every time I go down there is one of the chief problems they \nhave in Gitmo is obesity because they are eating better than they have \never eaten at any other time in their lives. A primary care provider is \nthere for every 450 detainees. They have never had that kind of \ntreatment at any other time in their lives. The detainees receive age-\nappropriate colon cancer screening, TB screening, annual dental \nprocedures, physical therapy, and all these things.\n  The idea that we would not be able to bring them to the United States \nfor some more serious personal care I can't buy because we have the \nU.S. Naval Hospital at Guantanamo Bay. I have been there. They have \napproximately 250 personnel there who support the base's population of \nover 6,000.\n  When I look at this and I think of the options they have and this \nobsession the President seems to have to bring these terrorists into \nthe United States, I have to share this one story. I know there is \ngoing to be a request here in just a moment. I can remember back 4\\1/2\\ \nyears ago when this President first came in office--I am going from \nmemory now--he had 17 places in the United States where he could put \nthese terrorists. One happened to be in my State of Oklahoma, Fort \nSill. He went down to look at the facility. The major who was in charge \nof it told me she had several tours of duty at Guantanamo. She said: Go \nback and tell those people in Washington we do not need to be spreading \nthese terrorists throughout the continental United States when we have \nthat great facility. She said she had been there twice and it is state-\nof-the-art.\n  I have a great fear, and that is that once we get a different \nadministration here that realizes the value of Guantanamo Bay, it will \nbe too late to go back and get it again. That is the reason we have \nbeen holding on to it with white knuckles.\n  The amendment we are going to be voting on in another hour or so, \nwhenever it is set in, is going to be an amendment that will allow us \nto continue to use what I consider to be one of the most valuable \nassets we have in the system.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am going to make a unanimous consent \nproposal which I understand has been cleared.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending motion to recommit be \nwithdrawn; that the pending Levin amendment, No. 2123, be set aside for \nSenator Ayotte or designee to offer amendment No. 2255 relative to \nGuantanamo; that the amendment be subject to a relevant side-by-side \namendment, which is No. 2175, from Senators Levin, McCain, and \nFeinstein; that no second-degree amendments be in order to either of \nthese Guantanamo amendments; that each of these amendments be subject \nto a 60-affirmative-vote threshold; that the time until 5 p.m. be \nequally divided between the two leaders or their designees; that at 5 \np.m. the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Ayotte amendment No. \n2255; that upon disposition of the Ayotte amendment, the Senate proceed \nto vote in relation to the Levin-McCain-Feinstein amendment No. 2175; \nand that there be 2 minutes equally divided in between the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I was going to say the time between now and 5 o'clock is \nequally divided, as I understand it, between the Senator from Oklahoma \nand myself.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2255\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. On behalf of Senator Ayotte, myself, and others, I call \nup amendment No. 2255 and ask the clerk to report by number.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe], for Ms. Ayotte, for \n     herself, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Inhofe, Mrs. Fischer, Mr. Enzi, \n     and Mr. Rubio, proposes an amendment numbered 2255.\n\n  The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof amendments.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2175\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2175.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I understand we have a Senator on the way. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum unless someone else wishes to be recognized. I ask \nthat the time on the quorum call be equally divided unless someone else \nseeks to be recognized at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, during this pause, if someone comes down \nto talk about the two amendments that will be voted on at 5 o'clock, I \nwill be happy to defer to them. But I think it is important that we \nunderstand we are finally making some headway in getting into this \nDefense authorization bill. It seems as if every year for 51 years now \nwe have been able to get it through. While other bills become \ncontroversial, get to a point where they cannot go any further, that \ndoes not happen with the Defense authorization bill. It is one that has \nto take place.\n  As the Republican ranking member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, let me say, as I have said before, I thank my friend and \ncolleague the chairman Carl Levin for his leadership in marking up this \nbill. It has always been difficult. In most cases we agree with each \nother. We happen to be looking at an amendment now where we disagree. \nBut I always consider the NDAA bill as the most important piece of \nlegislation in Congress every year. It contains authorizations that \nsupport our men and women serving in harm's way, all the way in \nAfghanistan and around the world. It supports the training of our \nservicemembers and maintenance and modernization of their equipment. It \nauthorizes research and development; that is, R efforts that will \nensure that we maintain technological superiority over our enemies and \ncan defeat the threats of tomorrow. Most important, it provides for the \npay and benefits for the brave men and women who have made their \nsacrifices and are putting their lives at risk for our benefit. \nHowever, it is important to note this year--and this has not happened \nbefore, in my memory--the bill provides all of these vitally important \nefforts only as the reduced spending levels would allow.\n  In an era increasingly defined by bipartisan gridlock, the NDAA is \none of the rare occasions where Members of both parties can come \ntogether. This enduring commitment was exemplified again this year by \nthe overwhelming bipartisan support we had for the bill that came out \nof our committee--bipartisan support. We want, of course, to have that \nsame bipartisan support here on the floor. Hopefully we will be able to \nget this done by the end of this week.\n  Consideration of this year's NDAA comes at a time in our national \nsecurity when we face more volatile and dangerous times than we ever \nhave in the history of this country. Chaos and violence are on the rise \nin the Middle East and north Africa. Al Qaeda is growing and \nestablishing new safe havens from which to plan and launch attacks \nagainst the United States. We have rogue nations, such as Iran and \nNorth Korea. It is not the way it was in the old days--I have often \nsaid the good old days--of the Cold War where we had an enemy and that \nenemy was predictable. We knew that enemy.\n  Remember, we used to have this thing called mutual assured \ndestruction. That meant something then, but it doesn't mean anything \nnow because our potential enemies out there want to be destroyed. They \nhave a different mentality than they used to.\n  Iran and North Korea are developing their nuclear capability and \ndelivery systems. Our intelligence has told us that Iran will have a \nweapon and a delivery system. All the way back in 2007 they said they \nwould have it by 2015. That is a year and a half from right now. I tell \nthe Chair that they are going to have that capability. The threats are \nmuch more serious to us now.\n  When I say this is the first time we have faced the crisis we are \nfacing now, it is not just because the enemy is out there. I am talking \nabout an enemy who will have the capability of sending a weapon over \nand delivering it to the United States, but at the same time over the \nlast 5 years of this administration the military has already endured a\n\n[[Page S8171]]\n\n$487 billion cut. That is $487 billion out of the defense budget. That \nis before sequestration.\n  Now we have sequestration--an outcome once thought to be so \negregious, I can remember that as recently as less than a year ago, we \nthought: We are not going to have this. After $487 billion being pulled \nout of the military, we cannot also have sequestration, which will be \nthe $\\1/2\\ trillion that will come out in the next period of time. So \nwe didn't think it would happen, but it did happen.\n  We are now into what, our seventh or eighth month of sequestration. \nIn total, our military men and women stand to endure over a $1 trillion \nslash from their budget. These cuts are forcing a dramatic decline in \nmilitary readiness and capabilities.\n  I talked to General Odierno yesterday. He is Chief of Staff of the \nArmy. He recently said that his forces are at the--I am going to quote \nnow--``lowest readiness levels I have seen within our Army since I've \nbeen serving for the last 37 years'' and that only two brigades are \nready for combat. That is our U.S. Army. We have never had that \nconfession made. It is a level of desperation where they are willing to \ncome out and talk of it. We cannot sustain another $\\1/2\\ trillion in \ncuts.\n  Admiral Greenert, Chief of Naval Operations, said that ``because of \nfiscal limitations and the situation we're in, we don't have another \nstrike group trained and ready to respond on short notice in case of \nemergencies. We're tapped out.'' That is the CNO of the Navy.\n  Our top military leaders now warn of being unable to protect \nAmerica's interests around the world. Keep in mind, Admiral Winnefeld \nis the No. 2 person in line. He is the Vice Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff. Admiral Winnefeld, who has been there nearly 40 years, \nstated earlier this year that ``there could be, for the first time in \nmy career, instances where we may be asked to respond to a crisis and \nwe will have to say we cannot.''\n\n  General Dempsey, the No. 1 guy, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, has warned that continued national security cuts will ``severely \nlimit our ability to implement our defense strategy. It will put the \nnation at greater risk of coercion, and it will break faith with men \nand women in uniform.''\n  This is why I am so troubled by the disastrous path we are on. In the \nface of mounting threats to America, we are crippling the very people \nwho are vital to our security--the men and women in uniform.\n  To be clear, our military was facing readiness shortfalls even before \nsequestration took effect. Nearly 12 years of sustained combat \noperations have really worn down our forces and their equipment. In \norder to meet the spending caps mandated by sequestration, the military \nservices are being forced to starve the accounts necessary to repair \nand reset their forces.\n  Rather than rebuilding the ability of our military to defend the \ncountry, we are digging ourselves deeper into a hole. The longer we \nallow military readiness and capabilities to decline, the more money \nand time it will take to rebuild.\n  We already know this is the case based on what happened in fiscal \nyear 2013. For example, General Welsh, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, \nsaid that because of the first round of sequestration cuts he was \n``forced to ground 33 squadrons''--he's talking about fighter \nsquadrons--``including 13 combat-coded squadrons and an additional \nseven squadrons were reduced to basic `takeoff and land' training. It \nwill now cost a minimum of 10 percent more flying hours to fully \nretrain the grounded squadrons . . . '' What he is saying is that when \nit was mandated that he take down 33 squadrons--which happened around \nApril--then in July, 3 months later, they said, you can start working \nthe squadrons again--he is saying that it costs more to retrain and \nbring these people back up in these proficiencies than it saved during \nthat 3-month period of time.\n  He specifically said that it will now cost a minimum of 10 percent \nmore flying hours to fully retrain the grounded squadrons than it would \nhave to simply keep them trained all along. We heard that from several \nother top people as well.\n  I talked to General Amos yesterday. He is with the Marine Corps. He \nsaid he has approximately $800 million in critical military \nconstruction funding that they will be unable to execute under \nsequestration--assuming they go through with sequestration. By the way, \nI have not given up on stopping the military sequestration that is \ndamaging our ability to defend ourselves.\n  General Amos said that the military construction funding will be \nunable to execute under sequestration and will need to be deferred. \nFurther, it will cost over $6.5 billion to buy back orders of the V-\n22s, joint strike fighters, Hughes, and Cobras. Those are four \nplatforms we would have to bring back at the additional cost of $6.5 \nbillion that we otherwise would not have spent.\n  On Monday Admiral Greenert told me that under the current budget \nenvironment he will be forced to defer much-needed ship maintenance, \ncosting a 15- to 20-percent increase in total costs.\n  In other words, the things they are doing now to meet these line-by-\nline mandates of reductions are not saving money but costing money. \nUnder sequestration, we will lose one Virginia-class submarine, one \nlittoral combat ship, one afloat forward staging base, development of \nan Ohio-class replacement submarine program. They will all be delayed, \nwhich again will result in an increased price.\n  So not only is sequestration gutting our military capabilities, it \nends up costing American taxpayers more than it will save. We are \nfalling victim to the misguided belief that as the wars of today wind \ndown, we can afford to gut investments in our Nation's defenses. It is \nirresponsible and makes America less safe.\n  I remember going through the same thing back in the 1990s when the \nchant at that time was the cold war is over, so we no longer need that \nstrong of a defense. We heard it from both sides, and now we are going \nthrough the same thing. History reminds us we cannot dictate when and \nwhere the next conflict is going to arise. Instead, if we allow the \ncontinued dismantling of our military, we will be less safe and less \nprepared to defend our country. If our military men and women are \ncalled upon, their ability to accomplish the mission will be \nundermined, and tragically, more will lose their lives unnecessarily.\n  We had the top military people in our Armed Services Committee, and I \nasked them about this issue. They talked about the loss of readiness--\nrisk equals lives. When you take on more risks, you lose more American \nlives.\n  General Amos, Commandant of the Marine Corps, testified that if he is \ntasked to respond to a contingency in the current budget environment:\n\n       We would have fewer forces, arriving less trained, arriving \n     later to the fight. This would delay the build-up of combat \n     power, allow the enemy more time to build up their defenses, \n     and likely prolong combat operations altogether. This is a \n     formula for more U.S. casualties.\n\n  Such an outcome would be immoral and a dereliction of duty. If we \nexpect the men and women in our military to go in harm's way to protect \nAmerica, we have an obligation to provide them with the training, \ntechnology, and capabilities that is required to decisively overwhelm \nany adversary at any time and return safely to home and their loved \nones.\n  I can remember when they used to use a different term than they use \ntoday. Today they call it nature of military operations. It used to be \ndefending America on how many fronts. Since World War II, there were \nalways two fronts, and now we are down to where it would be hard to do \nit on one front, and that is why this bill is so important and why \nprotecting the readiness of our military men and women remains my top \npriority. However, something has to be done to mitigate any devastating \nimpact of readiness, so we must find long-term solutions. Every day \nthat goes by without action will only increase the damage.\n  I do have an amendment that would phase sequester in a way that would \nallow our senior military leaders to enact reforms without \ndisproportionately degrading our military so we can continue to train \nand prepare our military women and men.\n  My good friend the Senator from Alabama and I are joining forces. We \nhave an amendment that is going to allow some degree of latitude and \nflexibility.\n\n[[Page S8172]]\n\nSo while we are living under the same budget constraints we are under \ntoday, they can make some decisions where it is not just an online \nreduction. I have just finished talking about how much more that will \nend up costing us.\n  I see now we have someone else who has come to the floor to be heard. \nI want to repeat how much I appreciate the chairman of the committee \nCarl Levin for his cooperation with our side. He is trying to get this \nto become a reality and get this bill passed hopefully this week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the senior Senator \nfrom California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to support the Levin-McCain \namendment, and I have added my name as a cosponsor. I would also like \nto speak in support of provisions authored by Chairman Levin that are \nin this year's National Defense Authorization Act, which provides more \nflexibility that the President and Secretary of Defense need in order \nto move detainees from Guantanamo.\n  I strongly support the Levin-McCain-Feinstein amendment. Here is what \nit would do: It would clarify that Guantanamo detainees transferred to \nthe United States for law of war detention do not have any additional \nrights or benefits such as the right to claim asylum. So it limits it.\n  It would clarify that Gitmo detainees transferred to the United \nStates may not be released from law of war detention into the United \nStates.\n  Finally, it would require a detailed plan to be submitted to Congress \non how to close Guantanamo, including the specific facilities intended \nto be used to hold detainees inside the United States.\n  I have heard Senator McCain talk about this, request it, and I \nbelieve it is a very valid need.\n  It has been 12 years since the attacks of 9/11 and the United States \ninvasion of Afghanistan. In the ensuing years 779 people were brought \nto Guantanamo without charge, and for many of them, simply for being at \nthe wrong place at the wrong time. Most of the 164 left have been held \nfor more than 10 years. Those transferred to Guantanamo from CIA \ncustody in black sites have been there now for 7 years. Unfortunately, \nwe still have not figured out a way to close Guantanamo.\n  President George W. Bush called for it to be closed. So did former \nSecretaries of State Condoleezza Rice and Collin Powell, as well as \nformer Secretaries of Defense Bob Gates and Leon Panetta, among others.\n  In fact, here is what President Bush wrote on pages 179 and 180 of \nhis memoir Decision Points:\n\n       . . . there are things I wish had come out differently. I \n     am frustrated that the military tribunals moved so slowly. \n     Even after the Military Commissions Act was passed, another \n     lawsuit delayed the process again. By the time I left office, \n     we held only two trials. The difficulty of conducting trials \n     made it harder to meet a goal I had set in my second term: \n     closing the prison at Guantanamo in a responsible way. While \n     I believe opening Guantanamo after 9/11 was necessary, the \n     detention facility had become a propaganda tool for our \n     enemies and a distraction for our allies.\n\n  While I would like to go much further and close the facility \nimmediately, the provisions in this bill will ease the transfer \nrestrictions so that detainees can be held in other countries or tried, \nconvicted, and put in a proper maximum security facility in the United \nStates.\n  There are three categories of detainees left at Guantanamo:\n  First, 46 detainees will continue to be held on preventive detention, \nmeaning they are being held under international law until the end of \nhostilities--whenever that may be. It could be years; it could be \ndecades.\n  Second, 34 detainees have been slated for prosecution, and of those \nthree detainees have already been convicted in a military commission \nand are still serving their time at Guantanamo. But most of these 34 \ndetainees have not even been charged, and there is no indication when \nthey will be.\n  The final category is the largest--84 of the 164 detainees currently \nat Guantanamo were cleared for transfer by a 2010--that's 3 years ago--\ninteragency process carried out by our national security and \nintelligence agencies. But current law needlessly complicates efforts \nto transfer those 84 men.\n\n  President Bush transferred over 530 detainees from Guantanamo during \nhis time in office and, unfortunately, many went on to commit terrorist \nacts because there were no individual assessments done on each \ndetainee. But these individual assessments have been carried out by the \nObama administration.\n  Despite his commitment to close Guantanamo, President Obama has been \nable to transfer only 67 detainees during his first term, and only two \nrecommended for transfer have been successfully sent home under the \nburdensome procedures now in place. More are on the way, but this is an \nunacceptable delay because the government cleared these detainees for \ntransfer years ago.\n  Sections 1031, 1032, and 1033 of this bill will give the President \nmore flexibility to transfer these detainees out of Guantanamo. It is \nlong overdue. I thank the chairman, who is sitting in front of me, and \nthe ranking member for these provisions. But even under these \nprovisions, the Secretary of Defense would still have to certify that \nthe transfer is in our Nation's security interests and that appropriate \nsteps have been taken to address the risk of recidivism. Congress would \nhave to continue to be notified of such transfers.\n  In March of this year, Lt. Gen. John F. Kelly, the head of the U.S. \nSouthern Command which has military responsibility for Guantanamo, \ntestified to Congress about the massive hunger strikes that were going \non at the time and said the detainees were devastated at the lack of \ntransfers and the government's failure to execute plans to close it as \nthe President has promised.\n  In June of this year, I traveled to Guantanamo with Senator McCain \nand the President's Chief of Staff to see this devastation for myself. \nOn our trip, we saw the process that is used to retain the detainees as \nthey are forced from their cells and brought in to be force fed. We did \nnot see a detainee being force fed, but we saw the tube that is forced \nup their nose and down their throat into their stomach. It is coated \nwith olive oil or Lanacane, if necessary, and it is done daily. We saw \nthe restraints--at the legs, the arms, and the head where detainees are \nheld--not too different from the image of a death row convict in an \nelectric chair.\n  I said at the time and I will say it again today, the military and \ncivilian personnel at work on Guantanamo are carrying out their duties \nwith dedication, skill, and honor. My opposition to continued detention \nat Guantanamo is not an indictment against them; it is with a failed \nand bankrupt policy, including here in Congress, and now is the time to \nchange it.\n  Another thing that struck me is the enormous costs we are sinking \ninto this isolated facility each year. Detention operations at \nGuantanamo now total approximately $5 billion since the facility opened \nin January of 2002. According to the most recent estimates provided by \nthe Department of Defense, the total cost for fiscal year 2013 is \nestimated to be $454.1 million, which equals approximately $2.8 million \nper detainee. That works out to be more than 35 times the cost to hold \nthe prisoner in a supermax facility in Florence, CO. This supermax \nfacility currently houses a number of Al Qaeda terrorists, including \nZacarias Moussaoui, Shoe Bomber Richard Reid, and the would-be \nChristmas Day Bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab.\n  In this era of sequestration and furloughs, how can we justify \nspending approximately $2.8 million per Guantanamo detainee?\n  Now, even with near unanimous support across the current and past \nadministration to close the structure, some appear to question whether \nthere still is a national security need to shutter the facility. I \nbelieve it is clear that Guantanamo is still a symbol that motivates \nour enemies and draws more and more young Muslims to fight against the \nUnited States.\n  This is not just my determination but also the finding of our \nintelligence community. Last week, Director of National Intelligence \nJames Clapper wrote to the Senate Intelligence Committee noting his \nsupport for the closure of Guantanamo in which he offered the following \nexamples of how Al\n\n[[Page S8173]]\n\nQaeda and its affiliates continue to reference Guantanamo in \nfurtherance of their global jihadist goals.\n  Al Qaeda leader Ayman Zawahiri, in an audio statement in July of this \nyear, cited the detention without trial of Gitmo prisoners as one \nindication of American hypocrisy and indiscriminate persecution of \ninnocent Muslims. An article about the Boston Marathon bombings, in the \nmost recent edition of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's ``Inspire'' \nmagazine--this is kind of a diabolical magazine that Al Qaeda puts out \nand this is one published in June--highlighted the ongoing detention of \nprisoners at Gitmo as one of the purported justifications of terrorist \nattacks such as 9/11 and the Boston Marathon bombings.\n  Here is what the article said:\n\n       If we note down all that has been and is still being \n     carried out by America against Muslim nations, we will run \n     out of pages. . . . There is also the secret prisons and \n     black sites file, we could not miss out Guantanamo Bay \n     detention camp. The American Nation should have a good grasp \n     of all of these and other historic facts so that they can \n     comprehend the background and the context of the Boston \n     Marathon operation, Detroit, September 11 and other \n     operations which are barely a wave of anger; vengeance.\n\n  Furthermore, Guantanamo is referenced 20 times in the previous 10 \nissues of ``Inspire'' magazine.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter from \nthe DNI dated November 12, 2013.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Director of National Intelligence\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Saxby Chambliss,\n     Vice Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Chairman and Vice Chairman Chambliss: As the \n     Senate considers provisions of the FY14 National Defense \n     Authorization bill that would lift Guantanamo detainee \n     transfer restrictions. I would like to provide the \n     Intelligence Community's views of the national security \n     implications in maintaining the Guantanamo Bay detention \n     facility (GTMO).\n       Al-Qa'ida, its affiliates, and its allies this year \n     continued to reference the detention and purported \n     mistreatment of the detainees at GTMO in furtherance of their \n     global jihadist narratives. The references to GTMO by al-\n     Qa'ida and affiliated organizations include:\n       Al-Qa'ida leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in an audio statement in \n     July 2013 citing the detention without trial of GTMO \n     prisoners as one indication of American hypocrisy and \n     indiscriminate persecution of innocent Muslims and calling \n     for all al-Qa'ida prisoners at GTMO to be released.\n       An article about the Boston marathon bombings in the most \n     recent edition of AQAP's Inspire magazine in June \n     highlighting the ongoing detention of prisoners at GTMO as \n     one of the purported justifications to engage in jihad.\n       As these examples illustrate, closing the Guantanamo Bay \n     detention facility would deprive al-Qa'ida leaders of the \n     ability to use alleged ongoing mistreatment of detainees to \n     further their global jihadist narrative. In an effort to \n     disrupt the narrative used by terrorists, I support the \n     President's priority of closing the detention facility.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 James R. Clapper.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I just visited the 9/11 memorial this \npast Saturday and was extraordinarily moved by that memorial. It is an \namazing place. It really brings to one's heart the gravity of what that \nsituation was. We then went down to the museum and I saw exactly where \nthe plane went through the steel superstructure and the staircase where \nhundreds of our people fled with smoke following them down those \nstairs. We must prevent another 9/11.\n  I note there is a letter from certain members of the September 11th \nFamilies for Peaceful Tomorrows that has been sent to us in favor of \nthis bill and the detainee transfer provisions in the bill. I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter from the \nSeptember 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Peaceful Tomorrows,\n\n                                  New York, NY, November 18, 2013.\n       Dear Senator: We are writing to ask you to support the \n     Guantanamo detainee transfer provisions included in the \n     National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year \n     2014, as reported out of the Senate Armed Services Committee \n     (SASC). We are all family members of those killed in the\n     9/11/2001 terrorist attacks. Since that tragic event, we have \n     worked together as members of September 11th Families for \n     Peaceful Tomorrows [http://www.peacefultomorrows.orgl for \n     long-lasting solutions to the violence that claimed our loved \n     ones' lives.\n       In recent years, Guantanamo prison and the on-going \n     Military Commission hearings for the 9/11 suspects at \n     Guantanamo have been a particular focus of our concern and \n     action. We believe closing Guantanamo is good human rights \n     policy and good national security policy. The Guantanamo \n     provisions in the Senate NDAA provide the necessary \n     flexibility to execute that policy responsibly. We urge your \n     support of the Guantanamo provisions in the Senate NDAA and \n     urge you to vote ``no'' on any amendments that would further \n     restrict transfers.\n       When Peaceful Tomorrows first organized, we committed to \n     working together to promote U.S. foreign policy that places a \n     priority on internationally-recognized principles of human \n     rights and to calling attention to threats to human rights \n     that might result from U.S. responses to 9/11. Guantanamo has \n     become a stain on our national reputation. Today, it is \n     simply no longer sustainable--ethically, strategically, or \n     financially.\n       We are keenly aware of the continuing injustice of holding \n     the 164 prisoners now at Guantanamo prison without trial for \n     these many years. These prisoners have been denied the \n     justice which Americans take pride in as a source of national \n     strength. At the same time, our 9/11 family members continue \n     to be denied justice by the seemingly imperceptible progress \n     of trying those prisoners under the current military \n     commissions. We advocate the immediate release of those who \n     have been cleared for release, and the transfer of the \n     remaining prisoners to be tried in US federal courts, which \n     have successfully tried and convicted scores of terrorists in \n     the past decade.\n       More than half of the Guantanamo detainees have long been \n     cleared for transfer by our own national security and \n     intelligence agencies. Current law has needlessly complicated \n     moving these cleared detainees. This law must be revised. The \n     SASC foreign transfer provisions will do that while ensuring \n     that any risks are far outweighed by the dangers of \n     continuing the status quo. Major General Paul Eaton (Ret.) \n     has cautioned that unless we institute change, Guantanamo \n     will serve as ``a recruiting tool of the first order'' for \n     those who wish us harm, while damaging cooperation with our \n     allies on counterterrorism that will result in lost \n     intelligence opportunities. Worse yet is the effect it has \n     had on Americans, corrupting their faith in American values \n     that has taken centuries to build.\n       To continue to spend nearly $2.7 million per detainee, per \n     year makes no sense at a time when Congress is wrestling with \n     deep budget cuts. We can institute an intelligent, factor-\n     based system that will allow the Secretary of Defense to \n     explain to Congress whether a transfer is in America's \n     national security interests, and the steps that will be taken \n     to mitigate any risk of a detainee engaging in terrorist \n     activities after release.\n       In his May speech at the National Defense University, \n     President Obama recommitted his administration to closing \n     Guantanamo. Since that time, the administration has appointed \n     envoys at the Departments of Defense and State to oversee the \n     closure of Guantanamo. This is absolutely the right thing to \n     do now, but Congress must also do its part.\n       The Guantanamo provisions in the Senate NDAA clarify and \n     modify the President's authority to transfer detainees to \n     foreign countries and provide important additional \n     flexibility to close Guantanamo responsibly. They replace a \n     cumbersome certification and waiver regime with sensible, \n     factor-based standards designed to minimize risks. They lift \n     the ban on transfers to the United States for criminal \n     prosecution, which is critical now that we see how federal \n     criminal courts offer a more experienced and less costly way \n     to try terrorism suspects than the flawed, costly, \n     inefficient, and perhaps unconstitutional, military \n     commissions system at Guantanamo Bay. The experiment of the \n     military commissions of the 21st century has proven \n     inadequate to its promises of justice, transparency, fairness \n     and speed.\n       It is more than twelve years after the heinous attacks in \n     which our loved ones died. During that time some of our \n     fellow 9/11 family members have died waiting to see justice \n     done. Enough is enough! It is time for the U.S. to \n     demonstrate its commitment to the rule of law by moving \n     detainees cleared for release out of Guantanamo, by making \n     federal trials for those who are accused of terrorist crimes \n     possible, and by taking steps to close the Guantanamo \n     facilities that have earned the U.S. the enmity of the world. \n     We exhort you to pass the NDAA without transfer restrictions \n     on Guantanamo prisoners, and help to bring this horrible \n     chapter to a close in our lifetimes.\n       Our relatives died on 9/11; they would never have wanted \n     the U.S. to compromise its principles in their names, nor do \n     we.\n           Sincerely,\n                                     The Members of September 11th\n                                  Families for Peaceful Tomorrows.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, by the end of President Obama's term \nin office, some detainees will have been held at Guantanamo without \ncharge or trial for 15 years--15 years. We need to change this outcome, \nand we can do so\n\n[[Page S8174]]\n\nwith no threat to our Nation's security.\n  For one detainee, Ibrahim Idris, his physical and mental problems at \nGuantanamo have gone on for so long that the government decided to \nfinally drop its opposition to his legal argument that he is far too \nsick to stay locked up. There are others at Guantanamo who are \ndesperate and in need of medical treatment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, if I may finish this paragraph.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the time \nof the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the chairman.\n  That is why section 32 of this Defense bill will allow the Department \nof Defense to temporarily transfer Guantanamo detainees to the United \nStates for emergency or critical medical treatment. No one is talking \nabout releasing these detainees into the United States. The section is \nabout providing medical care to people in our custody.\n  The other Guantanamo provisions in this year's defense bill clarify \nand improve the existing authority to transfer detainees out of \nGuantanamo, to other nations, responsibly. Specifically, Section 1031 \nreplaces a cumbersome six-part certification requirement and partial \nwaiver regime in current law with a more sensible, factor-based \nstandard designed to mitigate any risks, but allow transfers to foreign \ncountries and into the U.S. for criminal prosecution.\n  Let me be clear about this last point: Al Qaeda terrorists should be \ntransferred to the U.S. for prosecution in Federal criminal courts \nbecause for some of them, Federal criminal court is the only option \nleft besides indefinite detention or release.\n  I regret to say this, but the military commission system at \nGuantanamo has failed. Although the issue is being appealed, under \ncurrent law, the military commission system cannot be used to prosecute \nthe terrorists at Gitmo for the crimes of material support and \nconspiracy, which are two crimes commonly charged in federal criminal \ncourt. That restriction has complicated the efforts of the military \nprosecutors to convict terrorists.\n  Don't we want the chance to bring these terrorists to justice instead \nof releasing them or holding them forever without charge? Wasn't the \nreason we passed these criminal penalties into law so that they could \nbe used against terrorists such as those Al Qaeda members who conspired \nagainst the United States, or aided the terrorists involved in the \nattacks of September 11?\n  Now that we have been able to observe the different iterations of the \nmilitary commission system over the years, it is clear that it does not \nprovide swift justice for either the detainees or the victims who want \nto see these accused terrorists brought to justice. Consider the \nfollowing information about the military commission system.\n  Military commission prosecutions have led to short sentences and zero \ndeath penalty convictions.\n  Three of seven individuals convicted in military commissions are \nalready out of prison living freely in their home countries of Yemen, \nAustralia, and Sudan. A fourth detainee who was convicted could be \nreleased from Guantanamo later this year, a fifth is serving his \nsentence in Canada, and a sixth now has his case on appeal.\n  Military Commissions at Guantanamo have cost the U.S. $600 million \nsince 2007. That's $600 million to prosecute seven people.\n  By comparison, Federal criminal courts offer a more experienced and \nless constitutionally risky venue. There have been 533 terrorism-\nrelated convictions in Federal criminal courts since 9/11.\n  The President should have the option to add some of the detainees \ncurrently at Guantanamo to that conviction list. Section 1033 of this \nyear's defense authorization bill will allow the Secretary of Defense \nto transfer Gitmo detainees to the U.S. for detention and trial if the \nSecretary of Defense determines that, No. 1, doing so is in the U.S. \nnational security interest, and No. 2, that public safety issues have \nbeen addressed.\n  Allowing detainees to be brought to the U.S. and charged in Federal \ncourt will work to put an end to the delay of justice and the extreme \ncost of the experimental justice system at Guantanamo Bay. It is the \nquickest and best way to ensure detainees will answer for their \nterrorist crimes and serve out long prison sentences.\n  For those relatively few detainees who can't be tried but instead \nhave been slated for continued detention until the end of hostilities, \nbringing them to the United States presents a more cost-effective and \nless controversial option. Facilities in the United States are up to \nthe task. I don't believe there is any more risk of a Guantanamo \ndetainee escaping from a maximum security facility than there is from a \nprisoner getting out of Supermax. It has never been done.\n  I know transferring Guantanamo detainees out of the facility where \nthey have been for 10 or more years is not politically popular. These \nare not easy decisions, but we have to consider the alternatives.\n  Do we want 84 detainees who have been cleared for transfer to other \ncountries to languish in our prison any longer? Again, ``cleared for \ntransfer,'' doesn't mean these detainees will automatically go free. \n``Cleared for transfer'' means they could still be detained by foreign \ngovernments after they are transferred.\n  Do we want detainees who could be prosecuted quickly and serve long \nprison sentences to avoid being brought to justice any longer?\n  Isn't it time to close Guantanamo once and for all? I believe \nGuantanamo is, has been, and always will be a dark spot on our history, \nso the sooner we get rid of it, the better.\n  I support the Guantanamo language included in this bill by Chairman \nLevin and ask my colleagues to support the Levin-McCain Amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nColorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I thank the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  Mr. President, I rise, as the Senator from California did, in support \nof a tough, adaptable, and smart national security policy. What do I \nmean by that? In this case, that means we ought to support provisions \nthat provide the Department of Defense and the President with the \nflexibility necessary to transfer certain detainees from the detention \nfacility at Guantanamo to face justice in other venues. In that \ncontext, I am proud to join Chairman Levin and Senator McCain and \nSenator Feinstein in sponsoring this important bipartisan amendment. \nFor a number of reasons, I strongly believe its passage would \nstrengthen our national security and is in the best interests of our \ncountry.\n  I am joined in that assessment by the Director of National \nIntelligence, the Secretary of Defense, and many other senior national \nsecurity leaders, including at least 38 retired generals and admirals \nwho helped to prosecute the war against Islamic extremists.\n  This amendment does not close Guantanamo. It doesn't require the \nrelease of detainees into the United States or force the transfer of \nsuspected terrorists to foreign countries. This amendment simply \nprovides the administration with the flexibility to bring justice to \nGitmo detainees in the most effective, efficient means possible.\n  The fact is that civilian courts have convicted over 400 suspected \nterrorists since 2001. The conviction rate for terrorist suspects in \narticle III courts; that is, civilian courts, is nearly 90 percent. \nDuring the same period, a grand total of seven detainees at Guantanamo \nhave been convicted by military commissions, and of those seven, two \nconvictions were overturned.\n  There are circumstances in which military commissions are \nappropriate. I would agree with some of my colleagues that there are \ndetainees held at Guantanamo who should face trial in a military \ncommission. But the fact is that in many cases the civilian court \nsystem is faster, it is more efficient and more effective at bringing \nterrorists to justice than military commissions. So why would we \nhandcuff ourselves and limit our options to bring accused terrorists to \njustice?\n\n[[Page S8175]]\n\n  Our enemy already knows we are tough. We have pursued them all over \nthe globe. We have eliminated their leaders and we have killed or \ncaptured many of their followers. But we can be tough and we can be \nsmart at the same time. Handcuffing our military and Justice Department \nin their efforts to bring our enemies to justice is simply shortsighted \nand counterproductive. Doing so only impedes justice, erodes the image \nof the United States, and serves as a recruiting tool for a new \ngeneration of terrorists.\n  According to the Defense Department, we are spending about $450 \nmillion a year to keep Gitmo open. And the DOD is going to need \nhundreds of millions more for upgrades and repairs if the facility \nstays open. That situation is unsustainable, especially at a time of \nsequestration and rising budget deficits. Without action by Congress, \nthose costs will continue to climb as detainees get older and sicker, \nand our moral standing will suffer the longer we hold people without \ntrial.\n  Based on evidence, I have faith in our justice system to secure \nconvictions in terrorist cases. We have a system of justice second to \nnone and prisons that already hold some of the most dangerous criminals \nin the world. There is no question that these individuals who have been \nconvicted and sentenced will be detained for the rest of their lives \nwith no risk to our citizens.\n  We have proven it time and time again. As a member of the Armed \nServices and Intelligence Committees, I receive frequent briefings and \nreports on our counterterrorism efforts around the world. I know this: \nI know this amendment will let us continue to prove it again and again \nin the future.\n  In sum, the Levin-McCain-Feinstein-Udall amendment benefits our \nnational security and should be passed by the Senate without delay.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 4 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that I be able to yield an \nadditional 5 minutes above the 4\\1/2\\ minutes to Senator Durbin. I \nunderstand if that means there is less time left than allotted to the \nother side, I would ask unanimous consent that additional time be used \nat 5 o'clock and the vote would then occur a few minutes after 5.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I do not object, but specifically we have \na request by the prime author of this amendment to be under \nconsideration at 5 o'clock to have 5 minutes. So I assume the thrust of \nthe Senator's UC request is to give her 5 minutes, even if it happens \nto fall starting at 5 o'clock.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is the Senator from New Hampshire available at 5 minutes \nto 5? If that is true, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to \nmodify that previous UC request to provide 10 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Illinois and the last 5 minutes to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first, let me thank my colleague and \nfriend from the State of Oklahoma for yielding time and the Senator \nfrom Michigan for manufacturing this close so both sides will be heard \nas we come to this important vote.\n  For 11 years now--for 11 years--I have been coming to the Senate \nfloor giving speeches about closing Guantanamo. This is my 66th speech \ncalling for the closure of Guantanamo. This year I held a hearing in \nthe Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and \nHuman Rights. I brought in military experts, and I asked them: Do we \nneed Guantanamo? Here is what they said. In fact, here is what we heard \nfrom Retired MG Paul Eaton, who served for 30 years in the Army and was \nthe commanding general of the Coalition Military Assistance Training \nTeam in Iraq. He said:\n\n       Guantanamo is a terrorist creating institution and is a \n     direct facilitator in filling out the ranks of Al Qaeda and \n     other terror organizations that would attack the U.S. or our \n     interests.\n\n  General Eaton said:\n\n       Guantanamo, in military terms, is a recruitment tool of the \n     first order.\n\n  Then I went down to the Southern Command in Miami, FL, and I met with \nthe generals there who have the responsibility of running Guantanamo. \nWhen I asked them about Guantanamo, there was a sadness that came over \nthe conversation, and they talked about how difficult it was--with \nabout 160 or 165 detainees remaining down there--how difficult and how \nexpensive it was for them to maintain that facility. They accepted it. \nIt was part of their responsibility being in our military. But they \nbasically said to me: When is Congress going to accept its \nresponsibility?\n  The Levin-McCain amendment before us accepts our responsibility.\n  Let's get down to the bottom line. Whether you think these terrorists \nshould be at Guantanamo or not in Guantanamo, let's talk about \nsomething very basic and very simple. How much does it cost for us to \nkeep in prison one person in Guantanamo for 1 year? It is $2.7 \nmillion--$2.7 million per prisoner per year.\n  How much does it cost the Federal taxpayers to take the most \ndangerous, blood-thirsty, deadly individual we convict in our criminal \ncourts and put them in the Florence supermax facility in Colorado, \nwhere no prisoner has ever escaped? Mr. President, $70,000 a year.\n  What are we trying to prove? Are we trying to prove in Guantanamo how \nmuch money we can spend--let me add waste--on a facility that is \ntotally unnecessary?\n  I asked the Director of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons a very basic \nquestion: If we sent the most dangerous terrorist at Guantanamo to \nFlorence, CO, what is the likelihood that person would escape? He said: \nZero. They do not escape from our supermax facilities.\n  So we are not keeping America safe by wasting--wasting--$450 million \na year in Guantanamo. We know that roughly half of those who are being \nheld at Guantanamo should be released. They are not going to be tried \nfor a crime at this point. They should be released. What the Levin-\nMcCain amendment does is to set up an orderly, thoughtful, sensible way \nfor the transfer of these prisoners.\n  Why do we keep this Guantanamo open? What is the point? It is as if \nsome lobbyist has us enthralled that we have to keep Guantanamo open. \nIt is not about national security anymore. It is not about the cost of \nincarceration anymore. It is about something else that I cannot even \ndefine.\n  So what we need to do is to take those remaining in Guantanamo who \ncan be charged, charge them, try them, incarcerate them. Those who are \ngoing to be a danger to the United States should never see the light of \nday. But why would we continue to waste $2.7 million per year per \nprisoner to keep Guantanamo open?\n  Throughout its history, Guantanamo has had a checkered past. It is \npart of Cuba. We send the Cuban Government each year a rental check for \nthe Guantanamo facility. They never cash it. They may tear them up. \nThey do maintain the minefield between Guantanamo and the rest of the \nIsland of Cuba to make sure there is no travel between the two, not \nthat anyone would try. That is it. We maintain this facility because in \nthe earliest days of our fight against terrorism after 9/11, there were \nlegal counsels in the White House, such as John Yoo, who said that \nGuantanamo Bay was the ``legal equivalent of outer space.'' We could \nput people there. They will have no rights and no one will ever know. \nHow wrong he was.\n  Guantanamo has become such a sad symbol that it is time for it to be \nclosed, and it is time for us to do it in a thoughtful, sensible, \nhonorable way, as every great nation should. To maintain Guantanamo for \nsome bragging right that I cannot even describe on the floor is simply \nunacceptable.\n  I am going to be opposing the amendment that is offered by the \nSenator from New Hampshire and supporting the Levin-McCain bipartisan \namendment, which I think deals with this issue in a thoughtful and \nreasonable way.\n  Do you want to keep America safe? Take those prisoners, those \nconvicted terrorists, and put them in a supermax facility. If you say \nto yourself, oh, we don't put known terrorists and convicted terrorists \nin our Federal prison system, how wrong you are. They are all over our \nFederal prison system. We have convicted terrorists who are \nincarcerated in Marion, IL. Drive down\n\n[[Page S8176]]\n\nto southern Illinois and no one even knows it because they will never \nsee the light of day--never.\n  So in terms of safety in America, we know how to keep America safe. \nWe also know when we are wasting money. At this point in time, we are \nwasting money with this Guantanamo facility.\n  Let's transfer those for detention and trial into the appropriate \nplaces and have them tried successfully. I think we have had perhaps \nsix or seven tried by military commissions--only six or seven--since 9/\n11, and two of those were reversed. Most of them go into our court \nsystem. Even when they read them Miranda rights, it does not stop the \nconvictions. The convictions come through regularly because our people \nknow how to convict those who would threaten the United States and make \nit dangerous.\n  It is worth taking a moment to recall the history of Guantanamo Bay.\n  After 9/11, the Bush administration decided to set aside the Geneva \nConventions, which have served us well in past conflicts, and set up an \noffshore prison in Guantanamo in order to evade the requirements of our \nConstitution.\n  General Colin Powell, who was then the Secretary of State, objected. \nHe said disregarding our treaty obligations, ``will undermine the \nprotections of the law of war for our own troops . . . It will \nundermine public support among critical allies, making military \ncooperation more difficult to sustain.''\n  At the hearing that I held in the Constitution Subcommittee, we \nreceived testimony from Retired MG Michael Lehnert, who served in the \nMarine Corps for 37 years. General Lehnert led the first Joint Task \nForce Guantanamo, which established the detention facility in 2002. \nGeneral Lehnert testified that he tried to comply with the Geneva \nConventions, but he was rebuked by civilian political appointees in the \nBush administration. General Lehnert testified:\n\n       ``We squandered the good will of the world after we were \n     attacked by our actions in Guantanamo. . . . Our decision to \n     keep Guantanamo open has actually helped our enemies because \n     it validated every negative perception of the United States. \n     . . . To argue that we cannot transfer detainees to a secure \n     facility in the United States because it would be a threat to \n     public security is ludicrous.\n\n  Instead of taking the advice of General Powell and General Lehnert, \nDefense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld approved the use of abusive \ninterrogation techniques at Guantanamo.\n  Guantanamo became an international embarrassment, and the Supreme \nCourt repeatedly struck down the Bush administration's detention \npolicies.\n  Let's be clear, conditions at Guantanamo Bay have improved \ndramatically since the detainee abuses of the previous administration.\n  But we cannot continue the indefinite detention of dozens of \ndetainees in an offshore island prison. Gen. Paul Eaton said it well \nwhen he testified to my subcommittee:\n\n       Guantanamo cannot be buffed enough to shine again after the \n     sins of the past. . . . Guantanamo's reputation for torture \n     and lack of due process of law cannot be rectified.\n\n  Every day, the soldiers and sailors serving at Guantanamo Bay are \ndoing a magnificent job under difficult circumstances.\n  But these fine young men and women are being asked to carry out an \nunsustainable policy of indefinite detention because we--their \npolitical leaders--have failed to close Guantanamo prison.\n  The President's authority has been limited by Congress. We have \nenacted restrictions on detainee transfers that make it nearly \nimpossible to close the facility.\n  During his two terms in office, Congress never once restricted \nPresident Bush's authority to transfer Guantanamo detainees.\n  Congress did not start micromanaging the Commander in Chief's \nauthority to transfer detainees until 2009, after President Obama took \noffice.\n  The Obama administration believes that Congress should completely \nlift the restrictions on the President's authority to close Guantanamo \ndetention facility. I agree.\n  But I will support the Levin-McCain amendment, which is a \nconstructive step in the right direction. The Levin-McCain amendment \nwould give the President more flexibility to move forward with closing \nGuantanamo, while still imposing significant restrictions on the \nadministration's authority to transfer detainees.\n  Under the Levin-McCain amendment, the Secretary of Defense may \ntransfer a Guantanamo detainee to the United States, but only for the \npurpose of detention, trial, and incarceration. The Secretary of \nDefense must ``determine that the transfer is in the national security \ninterest of the United States.'' And he must ensure that appropriate \nsteps have been taken to eliminate any risk to public safety while the \ndetainee is in the United States. The McCain-Levin amendment also \nspecifically prohibits any detainee who is transferred to the U.S. for \ndetention or trial from applying for asylum or from being released into \nthe United States.\n  Before the administration would be permitted to transfer any \ndetainees to the U.S., they would have to produce a detailed report on \nthe plans for each and every detainee who is currently held at \nGuantanamo Bay.\n  The Defense Authorization Act also would allow the Secretary of \nDefense to temporarily transfer a detainee to a military medical \nfacility in the United States, if the detainee needs critical, \nemergency care in order to prevent death or an imminent significant \ninjury.\n  The Secretary of Defense would only be authorized to make such \ntransfers if the required medical care cannot be provided at Guantanamo \nBay ``without incurring excessive and unreasonable costs.''\n  Moreover, the Defense Department would have complete responsibility \nfor the custody and control of any detainee during their transfer and \ntemporary hospitalization at a military medical facility.\n  Detainees receiving temporary emergency medical care would not remain \nin the United States. The bill specifically requires that they be \nreturned to Guantanamo as soon as they are medically cleared to travel.\n  Under the Defense authorization bill, the administration could only \ntransfer detainees to foreign countries in limited circumstances. \nSpecifically, first, the Secretary of Defense must determine that it is \nin the national security interest of the United States to transfer a \nparticular detainee to a given country. Second, the Secretary of \nDefense must determine that sufficient steps have been taken that will \nsubstantially mitigate the risk of recidivism.\n  But that is not all. The bill requires the Secretary to consider six \nfactors when determining whether a transfer is in the national security \ninterest of the United States, including: No. 1, actions taken by the \nUnited States or the host country to reduce the risk of recidivism; No. \n2, the host country's control over any facility where the detainee may \nbe held; No. 3, an assessment of the capacity and willingness of the \nhost country to meet its assurances to help mitigate recidivism; and \nNo. 4, the detainee's cooperation with U.S. intelligence and law \nenforcement forces.\n  These provisions would ensure that--before any detainee is \ntransferred to a foreign country--the administration would conduct a \nthorough review of all relevant factors, with a primary focus on \npreserving our national security.\n  In contrast to the McCain-Levin amendment, the Ayotte amendment would \ncontinue and expand the existing detainee transfer restrictions, which \nwould micromanage the Commander in Chief's national security decisions \nand make it impossible to close Guantanamo.\n  It is time to move forward with shutting down Guantanamo prison. We \ncan transfer most of the detainees to foreign countries. And we can \nbring the others to the United States for detention and trial.\n  Look at the track record. Since 9/11, nearly 500 terrorists have been \ntried and convicted in Federal courts and are now being safely held in \nFederal prisons. And no one has ever escaped from a Federal supermax \nprison or a military prison.\n  In contrast, only six individuals have been convicted by military \ncommissions, and two of these convictions have been overturned by the \ncourts. And today, nearly 12 years after the 9/11 attacks, the \narchitects of the 9/11 attacks are still awaiting trial at Guantanamo.\n\n[[Page S8177]]\n\n  During his confirmation hearing, I discussed this with FBI Director \nJim Comey, who was Deputy Attorney General in the Bush administration. \nMr. Comey told me:\n\n       We have about a 20-year track record in handling \n     particularly Al Qaeda cases in federal courts. . . the \n     federal courts and federal prosecutors are effective at \n     accomplishing two goals in every one of these situations: \n     getting information and incapacitating the terrorists.\n\n  I have heard some of my Republican colleagues argue that we cannot \nclose Guantanamo because of the risk that some detainees may engage in \nterrorist activities.\n  The irony is that due to steps taken by President Obama, recidivism \nrates for the detainees transferred during the Obama administration are \nfar lower than they were during the Bush administration.\n  Only 4.2 percent of former detainees transferred since January 22, \n2009, when President Obama took office, are confirmed recidivists. In \ncontrast, 18.2 percent of the detainees released during the Bush \nadministration are confirmed recidivists.\n  That is because the Obama administration put in place a strict \nprocess for detainee transfers. According to the Director of National \nIntelligence, of the 174 former detainees who are confirmed or \nsuspected recidivists, only 7 have been transferred during the Obama \nadministration.\n  No one is suggesting that closing Guantanamo is risk free or that no \ndetainees will ever engage in terrorist activities if they are \ntransferred.\n  But our national security and military leaders have concluded that \nthe risk of keeping Guantanamo open far outweighs the risk of closing \nit because the facility continues to harm our alliances and serve as a \nrecruitment tool for terrorists.\n  And before any detainees are transferred, they are extensively \nscreened, steps are taken to mitigate any risks, and then detainees are \nmonitored after they are transferred. Detainees who pose a risk that \ncannot be mitigated will not be transferred.\n  Detainees who pose a risk that cannot be mitigated will not be \ntransferred. And if a former detainee does return to terrorism, he will \nlikely meet the fate of Said al-Shihri, No. 2 official in Al Qaeda in \nthe Arabian Peninsula, who was recently killed in a drone strike.\n  I stand with Gen. Colin Powell, Gen. Paul Eaton, Gen. Michael Lehnert \nand countless other national security and military leaders.\n  It is time to end this sad chapter of our history. Eleven years is \nfar too long. We need to close Guantanamo.\n  I thank Senator Levin and Senator McCain for bringing this issue \nbefore us. We can no longer ignore it. We cannot afford to ignore it. \nAs General Eaton says, we cannot afford to keep this recruiting tool \nopen for Al Qaeda. We cannot afford to continue to tell American \ntaxpayers they need to pay $2.7 million a year for every prisoner in \nGuantanamo. Transfer them to a supermax prison for $70,000. America \nwill be just as safe. It will have money in the bank to use to fight \nterrorism in more effective ways.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Levin-McCain amendment and oppose \nthe Ayotte amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I rise in support of amendment No. 2255. \nLet me just say what we cannot afford. What we cannot afford is to read \nterrorists Miranda rights and tell them they have the right to remain \nsilent.\n  Why can't we afford that? Because if we lose the opportunity to \ngather valuable information to protect our Nation, then we cannot \nprevent future attacks against the country.\n  Here is the problem we face. Here, shown in this picture I have in \nthe Chamber, is the current head of Al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri. If we \ncapture him tomorrow, I ask my colleagues this: Do you want to send him \nto a secure detention facility where he can be fully interrogated under \nthe laws of war and held there in detention under law of war authority \nor do you want to send him to a prison in the United States where we \ncannot know--the legal questions are many--where there is a real risk \nthat he will not be able to be held in law of war detention and will be \ntold you have the right to remain silent, and we will lose \nopportunities to gather intelligence to protect our country.\n  My colleague from Illinois talked about the worst criminals whom we \nput in prison. I am a former murder prosecutor, and I put some of the \nworst murderers in prison. There is a difference. We are not dealing \nwith criminals; we are dealing with terrorists. The priority has to be \nto gather information and protect our country. If we catch Zawahiri \ntomorrow, bring him to a prison near you, give him a lawyer, tell him \nhe has the right to remain silent, those legal questions are not dealt \nwith if we adopt the alternative amendment that allows the \nadministration to transfer people such as Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the \nmastermind of 9/11, to the United States.\n  What do we do with future captures, such as Zawahiri? How do we \nensure we can gather information? By the way, that is priceless. If we \ncan stop a terrorist attack by interrogating someone--the price we can \nsave for America, we cannot put a number on that.\n  If you believe, with a rising reengagement rate of 29 percent--which \nis higher than last year in terms of people we have had at Guantanamo, \nwe have let go but have gotten back in the fight against us--that we \nshould weaken the standards this administration has to meet to transfer \npeople from Guantanamo to third-party countries, then that is \nessentially what is done in the Defense authorization.\n  My amendment will restore existing law to ensure that there are \nstrong national security waivers the administration must meet before \nthey transfer prisoners to countries where they are getting back in the \nfight against us, where they are getting out and getting back in the \nfight, including against our troops.\n  So this is a fundamental question. We cannot afford right now, with \nwhat is happening around the world, to close the one secure detention \nfacility we have, and it is clear we can conduct law of war detentions \nthere. We still remain in a fight against terrorists. We cannot treat \nthem like common criminals. That is what is at stake.\n  If you believe this man shown in this picture should come to a prison \nnear you, that is not what I have heard from my constituents or the \nAmerican people. That is why my amendment will prohibit the transfer of \nthe mastermind of 9/11 to U.S. soil and keep him in Guantanamo, a top-\nrate detention facility that keeps terrorists, as opposed to common \ncriminals, secure.\n  Finally, I would say, as we look at the prohibition on Yemen, my \namendment, which is also cosponsored by the ranking member of the \nIntelligence Committee and many other Members in this Chamber, would \nprevent transfers to the country of Yemen. Without my amendment, the \nadministration could transfer terrorists to Yemen. What does that mean? \nYemen is where Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is centered. We have \nactually had terrorists who have been released from Guantanamo and gone \nback into Al Qaeda leadership and been found in Yemen and there have \nbeen prison breaks in Yemen. Yet if my amendment is not adopted to \nprohibit transfers to Yemen, the administration can transfer detainees \nfrom Guantanamo to countries such as Yemen, and the security \nrequirements are weakened.\n  The world is not a safer place from last year to this year, \nunfortunately. The reengagement rate of Guantanamo prisoners has \nincreased from last year to this year.\n  Why are we weakening the national security provisions? Let's keep \nexisting law in place. Why do we want to send Khalid Shaikh Mohammed to \nthe United States of America when we have a secure facility at \nGuantanamo? Why do we want to take any risk that if we are blessed \nenough to have our men and women in uniform--who do a fantastic job--\ncapture Zawahiri tomorrow, that he may have to be told ``you have the \nright to remain silent'' because there are legal ambiguities when he is \nbrought to this country, as opposed to law-of-war detention and \ninterrogation in Guantanamo? This is what is at stake.\n  We cannot afford to think we are no longer fighting a war against \nterrorists. We cannot afford to treat people like him as common \ncriminals. As much as I believe in our criminal justice system, it was \nnot created to gather intelligence, which is what we need\n\n[[Page S8178]]\n\nto do to make sure America remains safe.\n  I ask my colleagues to support amendment No. 2255, which is \ncosponsored also by Senator Chambliss, the ranking Republican on the \nIntelligence Committee; Senator Inhofe, the ranking Republican on the \nArmed Services Committee; as well as Senator Fischer, Senator Rubio, \nand Senator Barrasso.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nletters from Secretary Hagel, Secretary Kerry, Attorney General Holder, \nand the Director of National Intelligence, James R. Clapper.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Secretary of Defense\n\n                                     Washington, DC, Nov 19, 2013.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write regarding the President's goal \n     of closing the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility and to note \n     the importance of lifting the restrictions on detainee \n     transfers that prevent us from achieving that goal. These \n     restrictions make it difficult to transfer detainees and to \n     close Guantanamo. They are also unnecessary. Before \n     transferring a detainee, this Administration will always \n     ensure the receiving country commits to taking necessary \n     measures to ensure that the detainee's threat is mitigated \n     and the detainee will not be mistreated.\n       As you know, I recently appointed Mr. Paul Lewis as the \n     Department's Special Envoy for Guantanamo transfers. Special \n     Envoy Lewis will work closely with the State Department's \n     Special Envoy, Mr. Cliff Sloan, to meet with foreign \n     governments and negotiate these assurances. Eliminating or \n     easing the congressionally mandated transfer restrictions \n     would help facilitate our ongoing efforts to transfer \n     detainees once those assurances have been obtained.\n       The President's proposal to transfer some individuals to \n     the United States for detention or trial, where appropriate, \n     would also help facilitate our efforts to close the facility \n     at Guantanamo, potentially saving U.S. taxpayers millions of \n     dollars each year.\n       As always, the Department is prepared to provide additional \n     briefings on the closing of the Guantanamo Bay Detention \n     Facility. A similar letter has been sent to the other \n     congressional defense committees.\n       Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n     Chuck Hagel.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       The Secretary of State,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 13, 2013.\n     Hon. Robert Menendez,\n     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The continued operation of the \n     Guantanamo Bay detention facility undermines U.S. national \n     security and foreign policy interests. I seek your support \n     for the provisions in the Senate Fiscal Year 2014 National, \n     Defense Authorization Act that would provide flexibility for \n     detainee transfers and strike unmanageable provisions that \n     currently hinder our efforts to close the facility.\n       The continued operation of the Guantanamo facility damages \n     U.S. diplomatic relations and our standing in the world. It \n     undermines America's indispensable leadership on human rights \n     and other critical foreign policy and national security \n     matters. In particular, the Guantanamo detention facility \n     consistently impedes joint counterterrorism efforts with \n     friends and allies. Provisions in the Senate bill would \n     provide an effective, yet judicious, transfer authority which \n     would provide critical support and flexibility in ongoing \n     negotiations with foreign governments on repatriation and \n     resettlement issues.\n       With increasing fiscal challenges, we must bear in mind \n     that, aside from its incalculable diplomatic costs, detention \n     operations at Guantanamo cost U.S. taxpayers more than $2.7 \n     million per detainee each year--far more than our super \n     maximum security prisons that safely and securely hold the \n     most dangerous inmates in the world, including convicted \n     terrorists. As both detainees and facilities age, these costs \n     will sharply increase.\n       I hope I can count on your support for the Guantanamo \n     provisions in the Senate Defense Authorization bill to \n     provide us the flexibility we need to close the Guantanamo \n     Bay detention facility. Until this flexibility is restored, \n     our efforts to close the facility are hampered and our \n     national security and foreign policy interests continue to be \n     impeded.\n           Sincerely,\n     John F. Kerry.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    Office of the Attorney General\n                                 Washington, DC, November 14 2013.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: As the \n     Senate prepares to consider the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for FY2014, I write to reiterate the \n     longstanding objections of the Department of Justice to any \n     provisions that would continue to restrict the transfer of \n     detainees from Guantanamo, limit the ability of the Executive \n     Branch to determine when and where to prosecute terrorist \n     suspects, and otherwise prevent the President from taking \n     steps to bring about the orderly closure of the facility. \n     Such restrictions encroach on the ability of the Executive \n     Branch to make foreign policy and national security decisions \n     and would, in certain circumstances, violate separation of \n     powers principles.\n       The unwarranted restrictions on the Executive branch's \n     authority to transfer detainees to a foreign country should \n     be eliminated. Detainees were designated for transfer based \n     on an interagency consensus after a thorough review of all \n     available information. Restricting the ability of the \n     Executive Branch to implement appropriate transfers weakens \n     our national security by wasting resources, damaging our \n     relationships with key allies, and strengthening our enemies.\n       I also continue to object strongly to the restrictions on \n     transferring Guantanamo detainees to the United States for \n     any purpose. The prosecution of terrorists in Federal court \n     has long been an essential element of our counterterrorism \n     efforts and has been a powerful tool of proven effectiveness. \n     Since 9/11, hundreds of convictions have been obtained on \n     terrorism or terrorism-related charges in our Federal courts, \n     including the convictions of over 165 defendants since 2009. \n     The effectiveness of this system was underscored again on \n     October 24, 2013 when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \n     Second Circuit affirmed the conviction and life sentence of \n     Ahmed Ghailani, who was transferred from Guantanamo and then \n     convicted in federal district court of conspiracy in \n     connection with his role in the 1998 East Africa embassy \n     bombings. There is no justification for prohibiting the \n     Federal prosecution of Guantanamo detainees in appropriate \n     cases. As you are aware, the viability of conspiracy and \n     material support prosecutions in military commissions is \n     unresolved in light of adverse D.C. Circuit decisions that \n     currently are under review by the full court. Particularly in \n     view of these rulings, Congress should restore the option to \n     prosecute detainees in Federal court in circumstances where \n     the Executive Branch determines that a Federal prosecution is \n     the surest way to protect our national security. Our federal \n     prisons are fully capable of housing Guantanamo detainees \n     safely, securely, and humanely, just as they have done for \n     the hundreds of defendants serving sentences for terrorism-\n     related offenses since September 11, 2001.\n       If we are to safeguard the American people, we must be in a \n     position to employ every lawful instrument of national \n     power--including both courts and military commissions--to \n     ensure that terrorists are brought to justice and can no \n     longer threaten American lives. Moreover, if we are to \n     protect our national security and advance our foreign policy \n     objectives, the President must have the ability to transfer \n     detainees when doing so serves our national interests. I urge \n     you to reject any legislative proposals that would compromise \n     our ability to carry out that solemn responsibility.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                               Eric H. Holder, Jr.\n     Attorney General.\n                                  ____\n\n                                 Director of National Intelligence\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Saxby Chambliss,\n     Vice Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Chairman and Vice Chairman Chambliss: As the \n     Senate considers provisions of the FY14 National Defense \n     Authorization bill that would lift Guantanamo detainee \n     transfer restrictions, I would like to provide the \n     Intelligence Community's views of the national security \n     implications in maintaining the Guantanamo Bay detention \n     facility (GTMO).\n       Al-Qa'ida, its affiliates, and its allies this year \n     continued to reference the detention and purported \n     mistreatment of the detainees at GTMO in furtherance of their \n     global jihadist narratives. The references to GTMO by al-\n     Qa'ida and affiliated organizations include:\n       Al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in an audio statement in \n     July 2013 citing the detention without trial of GTMO \n     prisoners as one indication of American hypocrisy and \n     indiscriminate persecution of innocent Muslims and calling \n     for all al-Qa'ida prisoners at GTMO to be released.\n       An article about the Boston marathon bombings in the most \n     recent edition of AQAP's Inspire magazine in June \n     highlighting the ongoing detention of prisoners at GTMO as \n     one of the purported justifications to engage in jihad.\n       As these examples illustrate, closing the Guantanamo Bay \n     detention facility would deprive al-Qa'ida leaders of the \n     ability to use alleged ongoing mistreatment of detainees to \n     further their global jihadist narrative. In an effort to \n     disrupt the narrative used by terrorists, I support the \n     President's priority of closing the detention facility.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 James R.

Madam President, this amendment is a Levin-McCain-\nFeinstein-Udall amendment. It clarifies that Gitmo detainees would not \ngain any additional legal rights as a result of their transfer to the \nUnited States for detention. Any Gitmo detainee who is transferred to \nthe United States gains no additional legal rights. They also are not \npermitted to be released inside the United States. They do not lose \ntheir status as unprivileged enemy belligerents eligible for detention \nand trial under the law of war. If they are transferred to the United \nStates, they gain no additional right to challenge their detention \nbeyond the habeas corpus that has been affirmed by the Supreme Court.\n  I would hope this could be broadly supported.\n  Senator McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I have a letter from 38 retired flag and \ngeneral officers of the U.S. military, and I quote from their letter:\n\n       As retired flag and general officers, we believe it is \n     imperative for Congress to address Guantanamo now. We have \n     always believed that our detention policies should adhere to \n     the rule of law, and that we as a Nation are more secure when \n     we do. Guantanamo is a betrayal of American values. The \n     prison is a symbol of torture and justice delayed. More than \n     a decade after it opened, Guantanamo remains a recruiting \n     poster for terrorists which makes us all less safe.\n\n  I would also point out for my colleagues that Guantanamo has cost \nmore than $400 million in the last two fiscal years, and the Department \nof Defense estimates that is $2.7 million per detainee per year.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter from \nwhich I just quoted.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                November 13, 2013.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: As retired flag and general officers, \n     we believe it is imperative for Congress to address \n     Guantanamo now. We have always believed that our detention \n     policies should adhere to the rule of law, and that we as a \n     nation are more secure when we do. Guantanamo is a betrayal \n     of American values. The prison is a symbol of torture and \n     justice delayed. More than a decade after it opened, \n     Guantanamo remains a recruiting poster for terrorists which \n     makes us all less safe. As the United States ends the war in \n     Afghanistan in 2014, the government must find a lawful \n     disposition for all detainees captured as part of that war. \n     Spending $2.7 million per detainee annually at Guantanamo, \n     when a comparable facility in the United States costs \n     taxpayers only $34,000-$78,000, is fiscally irresponsible, \n     especially as our military must make significant budget cuts \n     under sequestration.\n       The Senate National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) as \n     reported out of the Senate Armed Services Committee would \n     provide a meaningful step towards responsibly closing \n     Guantanamo. It authorizes the transfer of detainees cleared \n     for transfer by the U.S. intelligence and defense agencies \n     for purposes of resettlement or repatriation, and it permits \n     transfers to the U.S. for purposes of prosecution, \n     incarceration and medical treatment. We support these \n     provisions, and oppose any efforts to impose more stringent \n     restrictions on the transfer of detainees out of Guantanamo.\n           Sincerely,\n         General Joseph P.

The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I urge my colleagues to vote against \namendment No. 2175. If you want to bring the 164 Gitmo detainees to the \nUnited States, that is what this amendment will allow the \nadministration to do. The plan they are going to submit requires no \ncongressional oversight, no approval, and though the chairman said they \nwill not get any additional legal rights, he does not answer the \nquestion what about constitutional rights if they are brought to our \nsoil. Will they have to be told they have the right to remain silent?\n  If we catch Zawahiri, the current head of Al Qaeda, tomorrow, will he \nhave to be read Miranda rights? Because that is what is happening when \nwe bring them to U.S. soil now. That is the real question.\n  That is not required to be answered by their plan the administration \nwants sent, and we have no oversight over that plan. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote no on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 15 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. There are no additional rights for people brought to \nmilitary detention in the United States than they have in Guantanamo. \nNothing changes. There are no more Miranda rights here than in \nGuantanamo. If\n\n[[Page S8180]]\n\nthey are in military detention, they are in military detention wherever \nit is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Under the previous order, the question occurs on the Levin-McCain \namendment No. 2175.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order requiring 60 votes \nfor the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is rejected.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I am going to announce a consent \nagreement, and I will read through it in just a minute. It seems to me \nthis debate we had today was extremely important. As I said last night, \none of the issues in this bill is Guantanamo. I felt it was \nappropriate--even though I agree with the language in the bill--that \nthe Republicans have an opportunity to see if they could change it. \nThat is what this was all about this afternoon.\n  On the sexual assault issue, there is language in the bill that \nSenator Gillibrand and others want to change. Senator Levin and \nespecially Senator McCaskill have come up with a side-by-side, just \nlike we had today, and that deserves a full debate. That is an issue \nwhich has been in all the papers over the last several months.\n  The Senate deserves and the American public deserves this debate. I \nhope we can get this done.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nLevin amendment No. 2123 be set aside for Senator Gillibrand or \ndesignee to offer amendment No. 2099 relative to sexual assault; that \nthe amendment be subject to a relevant side-by-side amendment from \nSenators McCaskill and Ayotte, amendment No. 2170; that no second-\ndegree amendments be in order to either of the sexual assault \namendments; that each of these amendments be subject to a 60-\naffirmative-vote threshold; that when the Senate resumes consideration \nof the bill on Wednesday, November 20, the time until 5 p.m. be equally \ndivided between the proponents and opponents of the Gillibrand \namendments; that at 5 p.m. the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to \nthe Gillibrand amendment No. 2099; that upon disposition of the \nGillibrand amendment, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the \nMcCaskill-Ayotte amendment No. 2170; that there be 2 minutes equally \ndivided in between the votes; and that no motions to recommit be in \norder during the consideration of the sexual assault amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, reserving the right to object, will the \nSenator amend his request and add the following language: following the \ndisposition of the McCaskill-Ayotte amendment, all pending amendments \nbe withdrawn and the Republican manager or his designee be recognized \nto offer the next amendment in order, followed by an amendment offered \nby the majority side, and that the two sides continue offering \namendments in alternating fashion until all amendments are disposed of.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the leader so modify his request?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, with the deepest respect to my friend the \nsenior Senator from Oklahoma, we are not in a position to have a bunch \nof amendments on this bill. It took us weeks to get the drug \ncompounding bill done--weeks, plural. What we should do is get this \nvery contentious amendment out of the way and move on to other \namendments. There is no reason why we can't agree on going from one \namendment to another amendment. Everyone has to understand that this is \nnot going to be an open amendment process. It is not going to \nhappen. We have tried that. Remember? People said, we haven't done \nanything on energy for 5 years. That pretty well says it all. But we \nsaid, OK, what we are going to do is work on something that is \nbipartisan in nature led by Senator Shaheen. Senator Portman was \nheavily involved. We never got off first base. We never even got headed \ntoward first base. So we can't do that.\n\n  There is going to have to be a change of atmosphere around here where \nwe agree to do legislation. We talk about remembering the good old days \nwhen we had unlimited amendments. I remember those too. I also remember \nthe good old days where the majority would have a few amendments, the \nminority would have a number of amendments, and we would move forward \nand pass legislation. But no one is willing to do that anymore. We are, \nbut they are not.\n  So I know how well-intentioned my friend is, but that was then and \nthis is now. I object. I don't accept his modification to my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you very much.\n\n\n               Motion to Recommit With Amendment No. 2305\n\n  Mr. REID. I have a motion to recommit S. 1197 with instructions at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] moves to recommit the \n     bill to the Committee on Armed Services with instructions to \n     report back forthwith with the following amendment No. 2305.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n       This Act shall become effective 3 days after enactment.\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays on that motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2306\n\n  Mr. REID. I have an amendment to the instructions at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. REID] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2306 to the instructions on the motion to recommit.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In the amendment, strike ``3 days'' and insert ``2 days.''\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2307 to Amendment No. 2306\n\n  Mr. REID. I am so sorry. I have a second-degree amendment at the desk \nthat I totally forgot about.\n\n[[Page S8181]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. REID] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2307 to amendment No. 2306.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In the amendment, strike ``2 days'' and insert ``1 day.''\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, what I hope we can do tomorrow, as we did \ntoday--I know people feel strongly about this sexual assault issue--is \npeople will come and talk about that. It is so important. We were able \nto do that today on this amendment we had, and by the time 5 o'clock \ncame, there had been a full discussion of the amendment. No one was \ncrying for more time. So I hope in the morning people who feel strongly \nabout this issue will come and talk about it. We did have some people \nwho came and talked about this issue and that was important. So there \nare very strong feelings about this amendment. It is a difficult issue. \nIt is sexual assault in the military.

Madam President, I wish to address another round of \nattacks that have been spearheaded by Big Oil against America's \nbiofuels producers.\n  As its market share for Big Oil dips, Big Oil is doubling down to \nswat down its perennial pinata. This time around, petroleum producers \nand food conglomerates are using environmental groups as political \ncover to gain traction on efforts to pull the plug on the renewable \nfuel standard that we often refer to as RFS.\n  This is a ridiculously transparent and very much self-serving assault \nby these special-interest groups. Their relentless campaign to \ndiscredit ethanol undermines America's longstanding efforts to \ndiversify its energy landscape, fuel the economy, and, most \nimportantly, strengthen our national security.\n  The predictable efforts to smear ethanol's reputation ignore the \nrenewable fuel's valuable contribution to clean energy, rural \ndevelopment, job creation, and U.S. energy independence. The latest \nround of misguided untruths disregards the plain truth. The plain truth \nis ethanol is renewable, it is sustainable, it is a clean-burning fuel, \nand all this helps run the Nation's transportation fleet with less \npollution and less imported oil.\n  Let me remind my colleagues, most of that imported oil comes from \ncountries that hate us and use our money to potentially kill Americans. \nYet critics continue to hide behind distortions that claim ethanol is \nbad for the environment, and those distortions I wish to discuss.\n  I wish to separate fact from fiction regarding ethanol's impact on \nthe environment. Critics say farmers are putting fragile land into \nproduction to cash in on higher corn prices at the expense of soil \nerosion and clean water.\n  That argument is not good under any respects. It may have been better \nlast year and the year before when corn was $7, but corn is about $4 a \nbushel now--hardly making ends meet. They point out that 5 million \nConservation Reserve Program acres are no longer enrolled in the \nconservation program since 2008. They want to pin the blame on ethanol. \nBut the facts are, first of all, fewer acres enrolled in CRP has more \nto do with Federal belt-tightening, meaning spending less money here in \nCongress, than land stewardship decisions made by corn farmers.\n  The 2008 farm bill had a lot to do with it. That farm bill built upon \nother stewardship incentives for American farmers and ranchers \nadministered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, including the \nEnvironmental Quality Incentives Program, wetland restoration, and \nwildlife habitat programs. So land put into these programs under the \n2008 farm bill takes land out of crop production, but it is not the \nethanol industry that has done it. It is Federal policy.\n  For instance, a Wetlands Reserve Program in 2012 had a record-\nbreaking enrollment of 2.65 million acres. The Wetlands Reserve Program \nlands cannot be farmed for 30 years, so they aren't going to be raising \ncorn on that land to produce ethanol.\n  According to the Environmental Protection Agency, no new grassland \nhas been converted to cropland since 2005. Farmers must make marketing, \nplanting, and stewardship decisions that keep their operations \nfinancially sound and productive from crop year to crop year.\n  Even more importantly, these decisions must be environmentally \nsustainable for the long haul, both from the standpoint of the farmer's \neconomic well-being as well as meeting certain laws that require that.\n  So let me be clear: Farmers simply can't afford to not take \nscrupulous care of the land that sustains their livelihoods.\n  Fertilizer use is on the decline. Compare application per bushel in \n1980 versus 2010: Nitrogen is down 43 percent, phosphate is down 58 \npercent, and potash is down 64 percent.\n  Ethanol burns cleaner than gasoline. According to the Oregon National \nLaboratory, corn ethanol reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 34 percent \ncompared to gasoline. If the oil industry wants to talk about the \nenvironment, we should not forget--and I will remind them and the \npeople behind this move--about the 1989 Exxon Valdez oilspill or the \n2010 Deepwater Horizon oilspills in the Mexican gulf. Critics also say \nthat the renewable fuel standard is driving more acres into corn \nproduction. Well, the fact is, if facts mean anything, the RFS is \ndriving significant investment in higher yielding, drought-resistant \nseed technology that very much enhances production per acre. This is a \nwin-win scenario, to cultivate good-paying jobs, mostly in rural \nAmerica, and to harvest better yields on less land.\n  The total cropland planted to corn in the United States is \ndecreasing. Let's compare this year's crop year when U.S. farmers \nplanted 97 million acres of corn--97 million corn acres. In the 1930s, \nfarmers planted 103 million acres of corn. Farmers have increased corn \nharvests through higher yields, not more acres.\n  Critics contend the Nation's corn crop is diverted for fuel use at \nthe expense of feed for livestock and higher prices at the grocery \nstore. But what are the facts? In reality, one-third of the corn \nprocessed to make ethanol reenters the marketplace as high-value animal \nfeed called dried distillers grain. Livestock feed remains the largest \nend user of corn.\n  I get so darn tired of hearing people from Big Oil or these \nenvironmental groups or these big supermarket conglomerates say that 40 \npercent of the corn produced goes into ethanol when they don't give \ncredit for the 18 pounds of every 56-pound bushel of corn, 18 pounds, \nor one-third of it, is used for animal feed. So when coproducts such as \nthe dried distillers grain are factored in, then ethanol consumes only \nabout 27 percent of the whole corn grain by volume. Livestock feed uses \n50 percent.\n  Critics have also pursued the false accusation that the increased \nproduction of biofuels increases grocery prices. Again, nothing could \nbe further from the truth. The facts are that the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture Secretary has said farmers receive about 14 cents of every \nfood dollar spent in the grocery stores, and the farmers share of a $4 \nbox of corn flakes is only 10 cents.\n  So what is at stake when a coalition of special interests tag-teams \nto pull\n\n[[Page S8182]]\n\nthe rug out from underneath the Nation's ethanol policy? Well, there is \na lot at stake. Unfortunately, these flawed attacks on ethanol and \nnext-generation biofuels undermine America's effort to move forward \nwith an aggressive, diversified energy policy that takes into account \nglobal demand, geopolitics, and U.S. economic growth.\n  It has resulted in an EPA that has wholeheartedly adopted this false \nnarrative promoted by Big Oil and Big Oil allies. On Friday, then, the \nEPA released its proposed rule for the required volumes under the \nrenewable fuel standard for next year. The EPA in this proposal chose \nto reduce the overall biofuels mandate. Rather than increase the amount \nof biofuel to be blended as the law requires, the EPA has chosen to \nwaive the mandate and suggest that we use less homegrown renewable \nbiofuel in our fuel supply; hence, more dependence upon foreign sources \nof energy.\n  It is terribly disappointing that the U.S. biofuels industry is now \nunder attack from President Obama's EPA. This action, which was \nvigorously pursued by Big Oil, is a slap in the face of our domestic \nenergy producers. Who would have believed that Big Oil found an ally in \nPresident Obama's EPA since he has been such a defender of biofuels and \nall green energy.\n  Who would have expected the Obama EPA to be more harmful to our \ndomestic biofuels effort than President Bush ever was? President Bush \nwas demagoged as an oil man from Texas. But he never undermined \nbiofuels to the extent that this proposal from this EPA would.\n  In making this announcement, the EPA said the challenges to supplying \nmore ethanol to the market are too great because of the so-called blend \nwall. The fact is the blend wall is a creation of Big Oil. The primary \nreason ethanol is not blended at levels higher than 10 percent today is \nbecause Big Oil has stood in the way.\n  Congress knew in 2007 that the RFS, renewable fuel standard, would \nrequire biofuels to be blended at levels higher than 10 percent. But \nthe petroleum companies fought that every step of the way, going back 4 \nor 5 years, and finally last Friday they were successful.\n  Friday's announcement, by the way, by EPA rewarded them for their \ntemper tantrums. The EPA's proposal puts Big Oil in charge of how we \nimplement the renewable fuel standard. It has rewarded Big Oil for its \nintransigence.\n  While EPA says its intention is to put the RFS Program on a \nmanageable trajectory that will support continued growth, I want to \ntell you the exact opposite is true. This proposal is a step back, not \na step forward. It undercuts all segments of biofuel--including \nbiodiesel, ethanol, and the advanced biofuels that go by the name of \ncellulosic ethanol.\n  While this administration claims to have an energy strategy of ``all \nof the above,'' this decision by EPA proves it is in favor of ``none of \nthe above.'' Ironically, biofuel producers now know what it is like for \ntraditional energy producers with a bureaucracy that impedes domestic \nenergy production at every turn.\n  I find this decision baffling. I hope President Obama will see the \nharmful impacts of the EPA proposal and fix this mistake during the 60-\nday period EPA must take to consider opinions on this issue.\n  So there are 60 days to turn this around. I hope we can do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/19/senate-section/article/S8182-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                PATENT TRANSPARENCY AND IMPROVEMENTS ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the American patent system has long been \nthe envy of the world. Two years ago, Congress took important action to \nupdate and modernize this system for the 21st century by passing the \nLeahy-Smith America Invents Act. The Leahy-Smith act has made key \nimprovements to the patent system, strengthening it for the long term. \nUnfortunately, there are bad actors who are misusing the system by \nunfairly targeting small businesses and others with lawsuits that are \noften based on low-quality patents. That is why I joined on Monday with \nSenator Lee, Senator Whitehouse, and Senator Klobuchar to introduce \nlegislation that will build upon the success of the Leahy-Smith act and \ncurb abuses by so-called patent trolls.\n  The Patent Transparency and Improvements Act will take important \nsteps to rein in the most egregious abuses of the patent system. It \nwill improve transparency of patent ownership so that trolls cannot \nhide behind shell corporations and obscure the true owner of the \npatents that are being asserted. It will help customers who are sued \nsimply for using a product that they purchased by allowing the case \nagainst them to be stayed while the product's manufacturer litigates \nthe suit. The Patent Transparency and Improvements Act will also take \nsteps to crack down on abuses of demand letters that are all too often \nsent to small businesses simply to extort monetary settlements.\n  When small businesses in Vermont are threatened with lawsuits simply \nfor using document scanners in their offices or offering wi-fi service \nto their customers, we can all agree that the patent system is not \nbeing used as intended. I thank Senator Lee and our cosponsors for \njoining me in this important effort and applaud Chairman Goodlatte for \nthe work he is doing in the House to address this problem. I look \nforward to working with all members of the Judiciary Committee, as well \nas with the House, to pass bipartisan and bicameral legislation that \nwill crack down on these abuses while at the same time preserving the \nparts of the patent system that have made it the greatest in the world \nand an engine for job creation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/19/senate-section/article/S8182-2", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ATTACK ON PRO-BUSQUEDA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, on November 15, according to information \nI have received, three armed men attacked the offices of the Asociacion \nPro-Busqueda de Ninas y Ninos Desaparecidos in El Salvador, dousing \ncomputers, archives, and confidential documents with gasoline and then \nlighting them on fire.\n  For Senators who may not be aware, Pro-Busqueda is a small \norganization devoted to locating Salvadorans who, as children during \nthe civil war, were forcibly taken from their parents, some of whom \nwere killed by Salvadoran military officers, and either ``adopted'' by \nthose officers or sold to other families including foreigners. Pro-\nBusqueda works to support the Salvadoran birth parents who lost their \nchildren to these forced adoptions, and uses DNA technology to help \nfamily members find each other. Years ago, a member of my staff visited \nPro-Busqueda's office in San Salvador, met the courageous staff and \nobserved the research they were doing.\n  This deplorable attack on Pro-Busqueda followed the abrupt decision \nby San Salvador's Archdiocese to close Tutela Legal, the highly \nrespected human rights office of the Roman Catholic Church which played \nan indispensable role in investigating and documenting violations of \nhuman rights during the war, including the assassination of Archbishop \nRomero. The office collected key testimony and other documentary \nevidence, and there is more of that work to be done.\n  The attack on Pro-Busqueda also followed the welcome but \ncontroversial decision by the Salvadoran Supreme Court to accept a case \nchallenging the Amnesty Law, which has provided immunity from \nprosecution to former Salvadoran military officers implicated in \natrocities during the war.\n  I join those who have expressed condolences to the staff of Pro-\nBusqueda, and urge the Salvadoran Government to conduct a thorough \ninvestigation and to punish those responsible. It is tragic that two \ndecades after the signing of the peace accords that ended the war, \nattempts to determine the fate of kidnapped children elicits this kind \nof hateful, violent response. It illustrates how much remains to be \ndone to fulfill the promise of the accords and overcome the painful and \ndivisive legacy of that war.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/19/senate-section/article/S8182-3", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8182-S8183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                80TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UKRAINIAN FAMINE\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, this year we commemorate the 80th \nanniversary of the Holodomor, the genocidal Ukrainian Famine of 1932-\n1933. Eighty years ago, an engineered famine in Soviet-dominated \nUkraine and bordering ethnically-Ukrainian territory resulted in the \nhorrific deaths of millions of innocent men, women, and children.\n\n[[Page S8183]]\n\n  I visited the Holodomor monument in central Kyiv, a poignant reminder \nof the suffering perpetrated by Soviet dictator Stalin's deliberate and \ninhumane policy to suppress the Ukrainian people and destroy their \nhuman, cultural, and political rights. Requisition brigades, acting on \nStalin's orders to fulfill impossibly high grain quotas, took away the \nlast scraps of food from starving families and children. Eyewitness \naccounts describing the despair of the starving are almost \nunfathomable. Millions of rural Ukrainians slowly starved--an \nexcruciatingly painful form of death--amid some of the world's most \nfertile farmland, while stockpiles of expropriated grain rotted by the \nton, often nearby. Meanwhile, Ukraine's borders were sealed to prevent \nthe starving from leaving to less-affected areas. International offers \nof help were rejected, with Stalin's henchmen denying a famine was \ntaking place. At the same time, Soviet grain was being exported to the \nWest.\n  The final report of the congressionally created Commission on the \nUkraine Famine concluded in 1988 that ``Joseph Stalin and those around \nhim committed genocide against Ukrainians in 1932-33.'' No less than \nRafael Lemkin, the Polish-Jewish-American lawyer who coined the term \n``genocide'' and was instrumental in the adoption of the 1948 U.N. \nGenocide Convention, described the ``destruction of the Ukrainian \nnation'' as the ``classic example of Soviet genocide.''\n  We must never forget the victims of the Holodomor or those of other \nrepublics in the Soviet Union, notably Kazakhstan, that witnessed \ncruel, mass starvation as a result of Stalin's barbarism, and we must \nredouble our efforts to protect human rights and democracy, ensuring \nthat 20th-century genocides such as the Holocaust, Armenians in the \nOttoman Empire, Ukraine, Bosnia, Cambodia, and Rwanda become impossible \nto imagine in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/19/senate-section/article/S8183-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8183-S8184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SESQUICENTENNIAL OF THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, 150 years ago today, President Abraham \nLincoln gave one of the greatest speeches not just in U.S. history but \nin human history. In under 3 minutes and using just 10 sentences, \nPresident Lincoln spanned the past, present, and future of the American \nexperiment and spoke to the aspirations, rights, and responsibilities \nnot just of Americans but of humankind.\n  It is astounding for us to realize that President Lincoln was invited \nto the dedication of the Nation's first national military cemetery \nalmost as an afterthought. The event was organized around the schedule \nof former Harvard president Edward Everett, who was thought to be one \nof the Nation's greatest orators of the time.\n  Everett was the featured speaker and, in the custom of that era, \naddressed the crowd for over 2 hours. President Lincoln, who had been \ninvited to say ``a few appropriate words,'' followed Everett.\n  President Lincoln wrote for the ear; he recited words and phrases as \nhe committed them to paper. When he gave speeches, he spoke \ndeliberately. His great speeches, including the Gettysburg Address, \nwere as much theological in nature as they were political arguments.\n\n       Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on \n     this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and \n     dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\n\n  President Lincoln borrowed a method of referring to time from the \nPsalms of the King James Bible, Psalm 90:10. It seems idiosyncratic to \nour ears today, but his listeners would have immediately grasped that \nhe was going back not to 1789, when the first Congress convened in New \nYork City and George Washington was inaugurated as our Nation's first \nPresident. He was not going back to 1788 when the Constitution was \nratified or back to 1787 when the Constitutional Convention met. He was \ngoing back 87 years, to 1776 and the Declaration of Independence, \nciting the proclamation of our Founding Fathers who were from the North \nand South alike--of the universal truth ``that all men are created \nequal.''\n  In the very next sentence, President Lincoln pivoted to the present \nand proceeded to explain the purpose of the Civil War: to determine \nwhether the United States of America or any other nation ``conceived in \nliberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created \nequal'' could succeed and last:\n\n       Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether \n     that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can \n     long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. \n     We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final \n     resting place for those who here gave their lives that that \n     nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that \n     we should do this.\n\n  And then President Lincoln, with characteristic humility, paid homage \nto those who had fought and died at Gettysburg before pivoting again, \nto the future and to laying out the responsibilities of his and future \ngenerations of Americans:\n\n       But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot \n     consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, \n     living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far \n     above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little \n     note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never \n     forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, \n     to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who \n     fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for \n     us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before \n     us--that from these honored dead we take increased devotion \n     to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of \n     devotion--that we here highly resolve that these dead shall \n     not have died in vain--that this nation, under God, shall \n     have a new birth of freedom--and that government of the \n     people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from \n     the earth.\n\n  As historian Ronald C. White, Jr., has written, ``Lincoln was \nfinished. He had not spoken the word `I' even once. It was as if \nLincoln disappeared so Americans could focus unhindered upon his \ntranscendent truths.'' Those ``transcendent truths'' are apparent to us \ntoday but things weren't so clear 150 years ago, in the midst of the \nhorrific brutality and death of the Civil War. On November 20, 1863, \nthe New York Times reported that President Lincoln's address was \ninterrupted by applause five times and followed by sustained applause, \nbut historian Shelby Foote said that the reaction to the speech was \ndelayed and ``barely polite.'' On November 23, 1863, the Chicago \nTimes--an anti-Lincoln paper--editorialized that President Lincoln's \naddress ``was an offensive exhibition of boorishness and vulgarity'' \nand ``a perversion of history so flagrant that the most extended \ncharity cannot regard it as otherwise than willful.''\n  Initially, President Lincoln believed that the Civil War was being \nfought simply to preserve the Union. But his thinking evolved to the \npoint where the war was about the abolition of slavery. It became the \ntesting ground of whether the United States of America--or any other \nnation dedicated to human liberty and equality--could endure.\n  There is a popular legend that President Lincoln jotted down a few \nnotes on his way to Gettysburg or that he spoke extemporaneously. That \nisn't true. He prepared the speech beforehand and there was one \nimprovisation only: He added the words ``under God.'' As White noted, \n`` `Under God' pointed backward and forward: back to `this nation,' \nwhich drew its breath from both political and religious sources, but \nalso forward to a `new birth.' Lincoln had come to see the Civil War as \na ritual of purification. The old Union had to die . . . Death became a \ntransition to a new Union and a new humanity.''\n  And so President Lincoln--in theological as well as constitutional \nlanguage--laid out for his listeners, for us, and for our grandchildren \n``the unfinished work'' and ``the great task remaining'': namely, to \npromote ``a new birth of freedom.'' As the American poet Archibald \nMacLeish wrote, ``There are those who will say that the liberation of \nhumanity, the freedom of man and mind, is nothing but a dream. They are \nright. It is the American dream.'' We Americans are singularly \nfortunate and privileged to hail from the first Nation in history \n``conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men \nare created equal.'' It is our solemn responsibility not only to \nprotect and expand freedom here but to promote and nurture it abroad so \nthat ``government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall \nnot perish from the earth.''\n\n[[Page S8184]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/19/senate-section/article/S8184-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO REVEREND THEODORE JUDSON JEMISON\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, today I wish to ask my colleagues to \njoin me in recognizing one of Louisiana's courageous civil rights \nleaders, the Reverend Theodore Judson ``T.J.'' Jemison, who passed on \nNovember 15, 2013, at the age of 95 in Baton Rouge, LA. Reverend \nJemison, the youngest of six children, was born in Selma, AL in 1918.\n  Reverend Jemison attended Alabama State College for his undergraduate \ndegree and received a master's of divinity degree from Virginia Union \nUniversity. He became a heroic leader in the civil rights movement, \nserved as pastor of Mount Zion First Baptist Church for nearly a half \ncentury, and was president of the National Baptist Convention for 12 \nyears.\n  Reverend Jemison orchestrated the Baton Rouge bus boycott of 1953--a \nmodel that would later be adopted by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in \nMontgomery, AL. Reverend Jemison actively pressured the Baton Rouge \nCity Council to ensure equal treatment for African-American passengers \nwho were barred from seating in areas designated White-only. Through \nthis work Reverend Jemison helped expand the civil rights to many of \nthe citizens of Louisiana.\n  Reverend Jemison served as president of the National Baptist \nConvention, the largest Black Baptist organization in the United \nStates, from 1982-1994. As the organization's president, Reverend \nJemison worked to promote the principles of the social gospel. He also \noversaw the construction of the Baptist World Center in Nashville, TN. \nReverend Jemison worked tirelessly to fight for equality, education, \nand opportunity not only for African Americans in Louisiana but across \nthe country as well.\n  Reverend Jemison was a true inspiration to all that had the great \nprivilege to know him. I am grateful and honored to have known him. My \ndeepest condolences go out to his family and all of those whose lives \nhe touched. My deepest condolences go out to his family and all of \nthose whose lives he touched.

It is one of the oldest universities in the \nUnited States, founded in 1740 by Benjamin Franklin who later went out \non to found the Nation's first hospital, Pennsylvania Hospital. From \nits inception the university was a leader in medical care and research \nwhich culminated in the creation of the Nation's first school of \nmedicine in 1765 and then the first teaching hospital, the Hospital of \nthe University of Pennsylvania in 1874. Today, the Perelman School of \nMedicine at the University of Pennsylvania is ranked in the top 5 best \nmedical schools in the country and the hospital is ranked in the top 15 \nbest hospitals.\n  With the growing diagnoses of cancer throughout the world, in 1973 a \ndedicated team of specialists established a center that would bring \ntogether all cancer research at the university, which one year later \nwas designated a comprehensive cancer center by National Cancer \nInstitute, NCI, one of only 41 in the country. In 2002, the center \nchanged its name to the Abramson Cancer Center after the generous \ndonation from Leonard and Madlyn Abramson. This gift allowed the center \nto conduct innovative cancer research and improve the quality of care \nfor patients.\n  The Abramson Cancer Center is composed of 318 faculty members from 37 \ndepartments and 8 schools within the University of Pennsylvania. In \n2010, the NCI described the quality of care at the center as \n``exceptional.'' One of the reasons the Abramson Cancer Center is \nranked among the top 15 cancer centers in the country is because of its \noutstanding faculty collaboration. Healthcare professionals including \nmedical and radiation oncologists, counselors, dieticians, and \nrehabilitation specialists work together to ensure that patients \nreceive the most comprehensive care possible.\n  Having the Madlyn and Leonard Abramson Family Cancer Research \nInstitute as a part of the university research facilities ensures that \nthe transition between the laboratory and the clinical care setting is \nexpedited. This guarantees that patients are able to receive the \ncutting-edge treatment and prevention options they need.\n  Since its establishment, the Abramson Cancer Center has been \nessential in the fight to cure cancer. The center works to achieve this \nthrough extensive research, innovative clinical trials and exceptional \ncancer care.\n  I am proud that the Abramson Cancer Center is located in the great \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania and wish to congratulate and recognize \nthem on their 40th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/19/senate-section/article/S8184-3", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/19/senate-section/article/S8184-4", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/19/senate-section/article/S8184-5", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:16 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hanrahan, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nhas agreed to the following concurrent resolution, without amendment:\n\n       S.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. THUNE (for himself, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Inhofe, \n        Mr. Vitter, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Johnson of Wisconsin, Mr. Barrasso, \n        Mr. Scott, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Boozman, and Mr. \n        Roberts):\n  S. 1724. A bill to provide that the reinsurance fee for the \ntransitional reinsurance program under the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act be applied equally to all health insurance issuers \nand group health plans; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I come to the floor to discuss again how \nObamaCare is negatively impacting American families.\n  NBC News is reporting that 5 million Americans have received \ncancellation notices from health insurers. In my home State of South \nDakota, the Sioux Falls Argus Leader is reporting that nearly 3,000 \npeople have lost the plan they had. Yet this administration is merely \npursuing political bandaids for the problem created by the President's \nhealth care law. The President is trying to fix this problem of \ncanceled plans, but his solution is a politically motivated bandaid in \nresponse to pressure from Members of his own party who are nervous \nabout the next election. The unfortunate reality of his bandaid is that \nit won't work.\n  Instead of taking responsibility for his failed policies and broken \npromises, he is changing his mind about how he wants his law to work at \nthe eleventh hour. He is kicking the can to State insurance regulators \nto determine whether, in 48 days--which is from the date of his \nannouncement on Thursday--they can reverse a train wreck that has been \nbarreling down the tracks for nearly 4 years.\n  The President's health care law told the entire country that \ncompliance with the President's law must occur on January 1, 2014. In \nresponse, industry and State regulators complied. Now, after \nrelentlessly pushing a law that is fundamentally flawed, the President \nis changing his mind. He is expecting the State insurance commissioners \nto bail him out, to allow Americans to keep the plans they were \npromised they could keep.\n  Since passage of his health care law, the President has continued to \ntout his law and has continued to make promises to the American people \nthat he knowingly cannot keep. While I agree that Americans should be \nable to keep the plans they have and like, this eleventh-hour attempt \nat a fix is an indication that the underpinnings of this law are \nirreversibly flawed.\n  The administration is now trying to live up to a promise it made \ndespite the fact that they knew the promise wasn't true. In fact, the \nPresident repeated and reiterated that promise as recently as September \n26 despite the fact that the administration knew it wasn't true. In \n2010 the administration knew that up to 93 million Americans in the \nprivate market were in danger of losing their current health care plan. \nBut the deeper problem with the President's fix is that it is merely a \nbandaid. By this time next year Americans will be in this exact same \nsituation all over again.\n  The President is not focused on finding a good permanent solution but \na good political solution. Putting this bandaid on the problem now may \nget him and his party past next year's elections. He seems more \ninterested in preserving that power than creating real solutions to the \nunderlying issues. In fact, the President is so concerned about the \npolitics of his actions that he is considering yet again a way to bail \nout his union friends. As part of the health care law, unions agree to \npay a tax to help pay for the cost of expanding coverage. This tax, \nknown as the reinsurance tax, is scheduled to be paid by self-insured \nplans, including plans administered by unions and many of the largest \nbusinesses in America. But the unions are unhappy that they have to pay \nmoney into a fund to help fund a benefit for someone other than their \ndues-paying members. They took their complaints to the administration, \nand, buried in a regulation issued last month, the administration \nannounced they intend to exempt unions from paying this tax.\n  Yesterday the Wall Street Journal editorial page articulated exactly \nwhy the unions should not be exempt from this tax. The editorial, \ncalled ``ObamaCare's Union Favor,'' argues that ``the unions ought to \nconsider this tax a civic obligation in solidarity with the (uninsured) \nworking folk they claim to support.'' It further states that ``there's \nno conceivable rationale--other than politics--for releasing union-only \nplans from a tax.'' As the editorial pointed out, exempting unions from \nthis tax will only mean increased taxes on nonunionized Americans in \nself-insured plans since the tax is structured in a way that it must \nraise a total of $25 billion and isn't structured as a straight \npercentage like most taxes.\n  Granting this political deal to unions is why I am introducing the \nUnion Tax Fairness Act. This bill would ensure that unions live up to \nthe commitments they made when they put their political weight behind \nthe health care law. It is political deals such as this that highlight \nhow this law is failing the average American.\n  This reinsurance fee exemption isn't the only backroom deal the \nadministration is trying to grant unions. Earlier this fall the \nadministration tried to find a way to provide ObamaCare subsidies to \nineligible union employees. I introduced a bill called the Union \nBailout Prevention Act which was aimed at ensuring the administration \ncould not make that special deal either.\n  It is clear that this President--President Obama--is trying to fix \nproblems in his health care law by making decisions and exemptions \nbased on favors to his political allies.\n  Democrats are on the run from the law they once championed. They \nrecognize this law is sagging under its own weight. Last week there \nwere 39 House Democrats who voted against the Obama administration by \nsupporting the Upton bill that provides a better solution to allowing \nAmericans to keep plans they like than what the President proposed. \nEven former President Bill Clinton said President Obama should keep his \nword when it comes to allowing Americans to keep the plans they have \nand like. In this Chamber, several Senate Democrats are running for the \nexits and looking for a legislative escape hatch of their own.\n  Unfortunately, the solutions proposed by this administration to fix \nproblems in the health care law are only temporary solutions. Their \nsolutions to problems are either temporary delays--as they did with the \nemployer mandate and the 1-year extension of 2013 plans--or political \nfavors to their friends and allies. Instead, this administration should \nagree to delay this entire law for all Americans.\n  Americans are deeply skeptical of the Affordable Care Act. According \nto last week's Gallup poll, 55 percent of Americans now disapprove of \nthe health care law. There is a more recent poll this morning in which \nABC News and the Washington Post have that number at 57 percent \ndisapproving.\n  The time to act is now to ensure Americans can keep the plans they \nhave and like. This ``fix'' won't prevent Americans from losing their \ncoverage, facing sticker shock and premium increases, or losing their \ndoctors. This law is fundamentally broken, and we need to start over \nand enact real reforms that decrease costs and improve access to care.\n  As do so many of us in this Chamber, I hear on a daily basis from my \nconstituents in South Dakota about the very real impact this is having \non middle-income Americans. This is an email I received last week:\n\n       My wife just received our health care insurance policy \n     renewals for 2014 and we are in shock!\n       Our monthly premiums increased from $400 per month to \n     $1,000, or over $7,000 more per year. My wife age 59 and me \n     age 60 now receive maternity benefits and some other very \n     limited coverage. We lost our prescription drug co-pay and \n     doctor visits co-pay. These expenses will now be included in \n     our $6,300 deductible. I will have no option for any subsidy \n     to offset these increases in premiums.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Please, please push for a reversal of this horrible health \n     care plan.\n\n[[Page S8190]]\n\n       My wife and I are physically ill after receiving this \n     letter from our insurance carrier. Again, the government is \n     destroying our lives and we need you to stop this madness.\n\n  This is just one example of many that I have heard from my State of \nSouth Dakota and many that my colleagues here in the Senate are hearing \nfrom all across this country. It is clear this program, this health \ninsurance law, is not ready for prime time. It is time for us to take a \ntimeout and to go back to the drawing board and construct a plan, an \ninsurance program for this country, legislation that will help reduce \nthe costs for working-class Americans, give them access to better \nquality of care, and allow them to keep the doctor they choose, which \nis very much in jeopardy as well as a result of this takeover, \nliterally, of one-sixth of our economy.\n  There is a better way, as I think countless--millions--Americans are \nfinding out through canceled coverages, sticker shock from skyrocketing \npremiums, and the new knowledge that they may not be able to keep not \nonly their health insurance plan but also the doctors they like. This \nis a grim reality for way too many Americans, and it is time for us to \nstep forward and do something about it.\n  The President's proposal is a bandaid. It is a political solution. It \nis not a permanent solution; it is temporary. We need long-term fixes \nput in place that will address the health care concerns people have. \nThe way to do that isn't to have the Federal Government literally \nassume control of one-sixth of the American economy and all the \ndecisionmaking that takes out of the hands of ordinary, middle-class \nfamilies--people across this country who are working hard to take care \nof their families.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Blunt, Mr. Warner, \n        Mr. Wicker, and Mr. Brown):\n  S. 1728.

A bill to reform the regulatory process to ensure that small \nbusinesses are free to compete and to create jobs, to clear unnecessary \nregulatory burdens, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Clearing \nUnnecessary Regulatory Burdens Act of 2013, or the ``CURB Act.'' This \nlegislation is designed to help relieve the onerous regulatory burden \non our Nation's job creators.\n  When I ask employers in Maine what we need to do to help them add \njobs, they tell me that Washington must reduce the cost and complexity \nof the regulations imposed on them. And this is not just a concern \nvoiced by Maine businesses. Earlier this year, a Gallup poll of small \nbusiness owners found that the vast majority are not hiring new workers \nright now, and more than half pointed to government regulations as one \nof the reasons why. The National Federation of Independent Business \nfound the same when it polled its members last year.\n  No business owner I know questions the legitimate role of regulation \nin protecting the health, safety, and well-being of employees and the \npublic. But the public is not well-served by regulations that bury \nsmall businesses under a mountain of paperwork, driving up costs \nunnecessarily, and impeding growth and job creation. Proper regulation \nshould be as efficient and simple as possible. At the very least, the \nbenefits of a regulation should exceed its costs.\n  Unfortunately, the burden of Federal regulations continues to grow. \nRight now, Federal agencies are at work on nearly 2,500 new rules, at \nleast 229 of which affect small businesses. One hundred thirty-nine are \nmajor rules, costing more than $100 million each. These rules will go \non top of a pile of regulations now measured in the millions of pages.\n  Year-by-year, this pile of pages gets ever deeper. In the 1970s, the \nFederal Register, the compilation of Federal regulations, added some \n450,000 pages. In the first decade of the 21st Century, more than \n730,000 pages were added--a rate of 73,000 pages per year. The pace \ncontinues to accelerate. On average since 2010, the Federal Government \nhas added more than 80,000 pages to the Federal Register each year. \nThis cannot continue.\n  We are not in the fifth year of an economic ``recovery'' that has \nproduced tepid economic growth and stubbornly high unemployment. The \nred-tape that is strangling our job creators is one of the chief \nreasons our economy has not fully recovered, and why millions of \nAmericans still cannot find jobs. If we want to get our economy moving \nagain and get Americans back to work, we must get serious about \nstreamlining and reforming our regulatory system.\n  The CURB Act is designed to do that by requiring Federal agencies to \ntake into account the impacts to small businesses and job growth before \nimposing new rules and regulations. It does this in four ways: first, \nby requiring Federal agencies to analyze the indirect costs of \nregulations, such as the impact on job creation, the cost of energy, \nand consumer prices; second, by requiring agencies to follow ``good \nguidance'' practices; third, by helping small businesses avoid \nunnecessary penalties for first-time, non-harmful paperwork violations; \nand fourth, by implementing reforms to the Regulatory Flexibility Act \nproposed by our former colleague, Senator Olympia Snowe. Let me explain \neach of these provisions in further detail.\n  First, as a general rule, Federal agencies are not required by \nstatute to analyze the indirect costs regulations can have on the \npublic, such as higher energy costs, higher prices, and the impact on \njob creation. However, Executive Order 12866, issued by President \nClinton in 1993, obligates agencies to provide the Office of \nInformation and Regulatory Affairs, OIRA, with an assessment of the \nindirect costs of proposed regulations. The CURB Act would essentially \ncodify this provision of President Clinton's Executive Order.\n  Second, our bill obligates Federal agencies to comply with public \nnotice\n\n[[Page S8193]]\n\nand comment requirements and prohibits them from circumventing these \nrequirements by issuing unofficial rules as ``guidance documents.'' Let \nme explain why this is necessary:\n  After President Clinton issued Executive Order 12866, Federal \nagencies found it easier to issue so-called ``guidance documents,'' \nrather than formal rules. Although these guidance documents are merely \nan agency's interpretation of how the public can comply with a \nparticular rule, and are not enforceable in court, as a practical \nmatter they operate as if they are legally binding. Thus, they have \nbeen used by agencies to circumvent OIRA regulatory review and public \nnotice and comment requirements.\n  In 2007, OMB issued a Bulletin which contained a provision closing \nthis loophole by imposing ``Good Guidance Practices'' on Federal \nagencies. This requires agencies to provide public notice and comment \nfor significant guidance documents. The CURB Act would essentially \ncodify this OMB Bulletin.\n  Third, the CURB Act helps out the ``little guy'' trying to navigate \nour incredibly complex and burdensome regulatory environment. So many \nsmall businesses do not have a lot of capital on hand. When a small \nbusiness inadvertently runs afoul of a Federal regulation for the first \ntime, that first penalty could sink the business and the jobs it \nsupports. The CURB Act directs agencies to search their files to \ndetermine whether a small business is facing a paperwork violation for \nthe first time, and to offer to waive the penalty for that violation if \nno harm has come of it. It simply does not make sense to me to punish \nsmall businesses the first time they accidently fail to comply with \npaperwork requirements, so long as no harm comes from that failure.\n  Fourth, as I mentioned, my bill also includes reforms to the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act, RFA. These reforms would build on the RFA \nby expanding its requirements to include guidance documents and \nindirect costs, in a manner consistent with what I have already \ndescribed. In addition, the reforms to the RFA would allow small \nbusinesses to challenge burdensome rules when they are proposed, \ninstead of when the rules have become final, which is often too late.\n  Finally, these proposed reforms would put teeth into the RFA's \nrequirement that agencies review their rules for possible savings at \nleast once a decade. The bill directs each agency's Inspector General \nto notify the head of the agency if a rule has not been reviewed in the \ntime required. Once this notification is received, the agency has 6 \nmonths to conduct the required review. If it fails to do so, the bill \ndirects the IG to notify Congress, triggering the recission of one \npercent of the offending agency's personnel budget unless Congress \nintervenes.\n  Before I close, I want to note that many Members of this body, on \nboth sides of the aisle, have offered serious regulatory reform \nproposals for our consideration in recent years. Indeed, even the \nPresident's own ``Jobs Council''--before it was disbanded--stressed the \nneed for regulatory reform, and put forward ideas consistent with many \nof the proposals I and other Members of this body have submitted as \nlegislation. Last session, the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee, under the leadership of then- Chairman Lieberman and \nmyself, held a series of hearings on regulatory reform. But the Senate \nas a whole did not act on these proposals last session, or dedicate any \ntime whatsoever to their consideration. I am hopeful this session will \nbe different, and room will be made on the Senate's agenda to consider \nregulatory reform. As we do so, I would ask my colleagues to consider \nthe approach I have proposed in the CURB Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Burr, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Harkin, \n        and Mr. Kirk):\n  S. 1736.

Res. 299\n\n       Whereas the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee \n     (referred to in this preamble as the ``JDC''), the leading \n     Jewish humanitarian assistance organization in the world, \n     provides economic relief to communities facing hardship and \n     builds the foundation for self-sustaining Jewish community \n     life;\n       Whereas when the JDC was founded in 1914, the organization \n     initiated relief projects in communities primarily in Eastern \n     Europe and the Middle East, and, as of November 2013, the JDC \n     works in 70 countries worldwide and touches more than \n     1,000,000 lives each year;\n       Whereas the JDC has pioneered high-impact programs that \n     provide access to education, health care, food, shelter, and \n     assistance with job training and placement for governments \n     and other organizations to utilize;\n       Whereas the JDC has developed and implemented initiatives \n     in Israeli society aimed at meeting the needs of the most \n     disadvantaged citizens in the State of Israel, including \n     children and youth at risk, the chronically unemployed \n     (including ultra-Orthodox Jews, people with disabilities, and \n     Israeli Arabs), and the elderly;\n       Whereas the JDC received the Israel Prize in 2007 for its \n     lifetime achievements and special contributions to society \n     and the State of Israel for developing innovative, scalable \n     solutions to meet the needs of the most disadvantaged \n     citizens in the State of Israel;\n       Whereas the JDC has helped transform the lives of women and \n     girls throughout the world, through initiatives that provide \n     access to health care and education to girls, encouraging \n     them to overcome gender barriers, receive an education, and \n     become community leaders;\n       Whereas the JDC is engaging many young individuals in the \n     United States to participate in rescue, renewal, and \n     revitalization work through service and volunteer programs \n     around the world;\n       Whereas the JDC and the United States Government have a \n     historic and enduring relationship that has evolved from \n     cooperating in life-saving work in Europe through the \n     American Relief Administration following World War I and the \n     War Refugee Board during World War II to the more recent \n     partnerships between the JDC and the Department of \n     Agriculture, the Department of State, and the United States \n     Agency for International Development;\n       Whereas the JDC mobilizes its expert professionals and \n     network of local, United States, Israeli, and global \n     partners, including the Jewish Coalition for Disaster Relief, \n     to provide immediate relief and long-term assistance in the \n     aftermath of natural disasters, such as by providing \n     emergency supplies and medical assistance following the \n     earthquake and tsunami in Japan in 2011 and the earthquake in \n     Haiti in 2010; and\n       Whereas the JDC creates programs and solutions that benefit \n     the neediest populations in communities around the world and \n     confronts the most difficult challenges, such as natural \n     disasters, extreme poverty, political instability, and \n     genocide: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes and celebrates the 100th anniversary of the \n     founding of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee; \n     and\n       (2) commends the American Jewish Joint Distribution \n     Committee on its valuable work around the world and wishes \n     the organization success in its future efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/19/senate-section/article/S8197-2", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8197-S8198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 300--TO AUTHORIZE THE PRODUCTION OF RECORDS BY THE \n PERMANENT SUBCOMMITTEE ON INVESTIGATIONS OF THE COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND \n                   SECURITY AND GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. McConnell) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 301\n\n       Whereas more than 5,000,000 individuals in the United \n     States live with Alzheimer's disease, and, based on current \n     projections, as many as 16,000,000 individuals in the United \n     States will have Alzheimer's disease by 2050;\n       Whereas 1 in every 9 individuals in the United States over \n     the age of 65 lives with Alzheimer's disease;\n       Whereas another individual in the United States develops \n     Alzheimer's disease every 68 seconds, and, by 2050, another \n     individual in the United States will develop the disease \n     every 33 seconds;\n       Whereas, in 2013, an estimated 450,000 people in the United \n     States will die from Alzheimer's disease, making it the \n     sixth-leading cause of death in the United States;\n       Whereas, between 2000 and 2010, deaths attributed to \n     Alzheimer's disease increased by 68 percent;\n       Whereas Alzheimer's disease is devastating physically, \n     emotionally, and financially;\n       Whereas Alzheimer's disease creates an enormous financial \n     strain on the health care system, families, and Federal and \n     State budgets;\n       Whereas, according to an independent study supported by the \n     National Institutes of Health, Alzheimer's disease is already \n     the costliest disease in the United States and is expected to \n     become even more costly in the future;\n       Whereas, in 2013, the total direct cost of caring for \n     individuals in the United States with Alzheimer's disease is \n     estimated to be $203,000,000,000, including $107,000,000,000 \n     in costs to Medicare and $35,000,000,000 to Medicaid;\n       Whereas, if nothing is done to change the trajectory of the \n     disease, the total direct cost of caring for individuals in \n     the United States with Alzheimer's disease is expected to \n     rise to $1,200,000,000,000 by 2050;\n       Whereas the average cost to Medicare for beneficiaries with \n     Alzheimer's disease is 3 times higher than for those without \n     the condition;\n       Whereas a Federal commitment to fighting Alzheimer's \n     disease can lower costs and improve health outcomes for \n     people living with the disease today and in the future;\n       Whereas, by making Alzheimer's disease a national priority, \n     we can replicate the successes that have been achieved in \n     fighting other diseases;\n       Whereas leadership from the Federal Government has helped \n     lower the number of deaths from other major diseases and \n     health problems such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, heart disease, and \n     stroke;\n       Whereas, in 2010, Congress unanimously passed the National \n     Alzheimer's Project Act;\n       Whereas the National Alzheimer's Project Act requires the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services to create and annually \n     update a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease;\n       Whereas the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease \n     establishes goals and action steps to combat the disease in \n     the areas of research, care, support, and public awareness; \n     and\n       Whereas the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease \n     has resulted in some notable accomplishments, including the \n     creation of a blueprint for Alzheimer's research by the \n     National Institutes of Health: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes that additional focus, research, and \n     resources are needed to overcome Alzheimer's disease;\n       (2) acknowledges the impact that Alzheimer's disease has on \n     individuals with the disease, their caregivers and loved \n     ones, and the United States as a whole; and\n       (3) supports the goals and implementation of the National \n     Alzheimer's Project Act and the National Plan to Address \n     Alzheimer's Disease.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we all know someone who has been affected \nby Alzheimer's disease or someone else who has.\n  Everyone has occasional memory lapses, and it's normal to forget \nnames of an acquaintance or forget where you put your keys.\n  But Alzheimer's is so much more than just memory loss.\n  It is a debilitating disease that only gets worse as it progresses.\n  People living with the disease often forget conversations, \nappointments, and eventually forget the names of close friends and may \nno longer recognize their spouse or their children.\n  They struggle to recall the words to identify objects, and eventually \nlose the ability to read and write.\n  Alzheimer's makes everyday activities like keeping track of bills and \ncooking a meal extremely challenging and frustrating.\n  Although the disease develops differently for every individual, it \neventually leads to loss of memory, thinking and reasoning skills.\n  This year, approximately 450,000 people in the United States will die \nfrom Alzheimer's disease.\n  Currently, more than 5 million Americans are living with the disease, \nincluding 210,000 people in Illinois.\n  But with a new person being diagnosed with Alzheimer's every 68 \nseconds, the number of people with Alzheimer's will rise to 16 million \nby 2050.\n  If nothing is done to change the trajectory of the disease, more \npeople and families will suffer and federal spending linked to the \ndisease will soar.\n  In 2013, the cost of caring for those with Alzheimer's disease will \ntotal an estimated $203 billion for Medicaid and Medicare.\n  If we stay on this path, the total cost of caring for individuals \nwith Alzheimer's disease is expected to rise to 1.2 trillion by 2050--\nan increase of more than 500 percent.\n  But this is a problem that we can solve.\n  In 2010, Congress recognized the need for additional resources and \nresearch to overcome Alzheimer's disease and unanimously passed the \nNational Alzheimer's Project Act.\n  The National Alzheimer's Project Act created a national strategic \nplan, which establishes goals and action steps to combat the disease in \nthe areas of research, care, support, and public awareness.\n  The plan has already resulted in some notable achievements.\n  In 2012, the National Institutes of Health dedicated an additional \n$50 million for Alzheimer's research.\n  The Health Resources and Services Administration invested $2 million \nto improve the quality of care for people with Alzheimer's.\n  But more needs to be done and the success of the National Alzheimer's \nPlan requires continued federal investments for biomedical research and \nresources for people with Alzheimer's.\n  President Obama's fiscal year 2014 budget proposed $100 million in \nnew NIH funding for Alzheimer's research.\n  The Senate Labor, Health, and Human Services appropriations bill \nwhich passed the Appropriations Committee adds $84 million to the NIH's \nNational Institute of Aging for Alzheimer's research.\n  The bill also provides $40 million for the new Brain Initiative, \nwhich will help us better understand the brain and Alzheimer's.\n  These federal investments to fight Alzheimer's disease can lower \ncosts and improve health outcomes for people living with the disease.\n  People like Janet Dever.\n  Janet Dever, 73 years old, was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease \nfive years ago.\n  She does her best to not dwell on the negatives or sink into \ndepression.\n  But she says that the hardest part of the disease is watching her \nfamily and friends suffer along with her.\n  The part of the disease that upsets her the most is that many people \ndon't know how to interact with her anymore, so they have stayed away.\n  But Janet and her husband Bill aren't giving up. And we shouldn't \ngive up either.\n  To reinforce the initial steps toward greater investment in finding \nanswers,\n\n[[Page S8199]]\n\nI am submitting this resolution, along with Senators Collins, Mikulski, \nTim Johnson, Menendez, Wicker, Moran, and Markey, supporting the goals \nand implementation of the National Alzheimer's Project Act and the \nNational Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.\n  But to achieve these goals, the Plan needs federal funding to be \nfully implemented.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this Resolution and reinforce our \nnational commitment to turning around the seeming inevitability of this \nterrible brain disease.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure investments \nare made in Alzheimer's research and to make the goal of preventing and \neffectively treating Alzheimer's disease by 2050 a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/19/senate-section/article/S8199-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8199-S8202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2148.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Audit the Pentagon Act of \n     2013''.\n\n     SEC. 1602. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Section 9 of Article I of the Constitution of the \n     United States requires all agencies of the Federal \n     Government, including the Department of Defense, to publish \n     ``a regular statement and account of the receipts and \n     expenditures of all public money''.\n       (2) Section 3515 of title 31, United States Code, requires \n     the agencies of the Federal Government, including the \n     Department of Defense, to present auditable financial \n     statements beginning not later than March 1, 1997. The \n     Department has not complied with this law.\n       (3) The Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of \n     1996 (31 U.S.C. 3512 note) requires financial systems \n     acquired by the Federal Government, including the Department \n     of Defense, to be able to provide information to leaders to \n     manage and control the cost of Government. The Department has \n     not complied with this law.\n\n[[Page S8205]]\n\n       (4) The financial management of the Department of Defense \n     has been on the ``High-Risk'' list of the Government \n     Accountability Office, which means that the Department is not \n     consistently able to ``control costs; ensure basic \n     accountability; anticipate future costs and claims on the \n     budget; measure performance; maintain funds control; [and] \n     prevent and detect fraud, waste, and abuse''.\n       (5) The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2002 (Public Law 107-107) requires the Secretary of Defense \n     to report to Congress annually on the reliability of the \n     financial statements of the Department of Defense, to \n     minimize resources spent on producing unreliable financial \n     statements, and to use resources saved to improve financial \n     management policies, procedures, and internal controls.\n       (6) In 2005, the Department of Defense created a Financial \n     Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Plan, overseen by a \n     directorate within the office of the Under Secretary of \n     Defense (Comptroller), to improve Department business \n     processes with the goal of producing timely, reliable, and \n     accurate financial information that could generate an audit-\n     ready annual financial statement. In December 2005, that \n     directorate, known as the FIAR Directorate, issued the first \n     of a series of semiannual reports on the status of the \n     Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness Plan.\n       (7) The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2010 (Public Law 111-84) requires regular status reports on \n     the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness Plan described \n     in paragraph (6), and codified as a statutory requirement the \n     goal of the Plan in ensuring that Department of Defense \n     financial statements are validated as ready for audit not \n     later than September 30, 2017. In addition, the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (Public Law \n     112-239) requires that the statement of budgetary resources \n     of the Department of Defense be validated as ready for audit \n     by not later than September 30, 2014.\n       (8) At a September 2010 hearing of the Senate, the \n     Government Accountability Office stated that past \n     expenditures by the Department of Defense of $5,800,000,000 \n     to improve financial information, and billions of dollars \n     more of anticipated expenditures on new information \n     technology systems for that purpose, may not suffice to \n     achieve full audit readiness of the financial statement of \n     the Department.

And \n     the United States strongly believes that Afghanistan cannot \n     succeed unless it gives opportunity to its women. . .And we \n     think that a failure to provide that protection not only will \n     make reconciliation impossible to achieve, but also would \n     make Afghanistan's long-term development impossible to \n     achieve.''\n       (2) As stated in the Department of Defense's July 2013 1230 \n     Report on Progress Toward Security and Stability in \n     Afghanistan (in this section, the ``1230 Report''), the \n     United States Government ``recognizes that promoting security \n     for Afghan women and girls must remain a top foreign policy \n     priority''. The November 2013 1230 Report also highlights \n     this priority and further states, ``A major focus of DoD and \n     others working to improve the conditions of women in \n     Afghanistan is now to maintain the gains made in the last \n     twelve years after the ISAF mission ends.''\n       (3) According to the United Nations Assistance Mission in \n     Afghanistan (UNAMA) Mid-Year Report 2013: Protection of \n     Civilians in Armed Conflict, the conflict ``increasingly \n     harmed women and children. In the first six months of 2013, \n     conflict related violence killed 106 women and injured 241 \n     (347 casualties), a 61 percent increase from the same period \n     in 2012.''\n       (4) Women still face significant barriers to full \n     participation in the Afghan National Army (ANA) and Afghan \n     National Police (ANP), including a discriminatory or hostile \n     work environment. As stated in the July and November 1230 \n     Report, other barriers include ``family-related issues. . \n     .lack of challenging assignments upon graduation, accounts of \n     sexual harassment and violence, and difficulties concerning \n     separate housing and bathing facilities'' for female \n     personnel.\n       (5) According to the November 1230 Report, female \n     recruitment and retention rates for the Afghan National \n     Security Forces fell short of the Ministry of Defense (MoD) \n     and Ministry of the Interior (MoI) female recruitment goals \n     of 10 percent of the ANA and AAF and 5,000 for the ANP. In \n     regards to women serving in the ANP, the November 1230 report \n     also states, ``Low female recruitment is due in part to the \n     MoI's passive female recruitment efforts, which has no \n     specific female recruitment strategy or plan.'' At the time \n     of the November 1230 Report, only 1,557 women were serving in \n     the ANP (847 officers and NCOs and 710 patrolmen). This \n     represents an increase of 36 women from the last reporting \n     period.\n       (6) According to the Special Inspector General for Afghan \n     Reconstruction (SIGAR) October 2013 report, despite more \n     women showing an interest in joining the security forces, \n     only 0.3 percent of ANA and AAF and 1 percent of police in \n     Afghanistan are women. According to the November 1230 Report, \n     ``The MOD has failed to capitalize on this interest and \n     organize the necessary initial training, such as Female \n     Officer Candidate and NCO courses. ISAF advisors continue to \n     mentor the MOD to reduce their emphasis on ethnic balancing \n     in order to accelerate ANA gender integration.''\n\n[[Page S8212]]\n\n       (7) According to the International Crisis Group, there are \n     not enough female police officers to staff all provincial \n     Family Response Units (FRUs). United Nations Assistance \n     Mission in Afghanistan and the Office of the High \n     Commissioner for Refugees found that ``in the absence of \n     Family Response Units or visible women police officers, women \n     victims almost never approach police stations willingly, \n     fearing they will be arrested, their reputations stained or \n     worse''.\n       (8) Fair, free, and inclusive presidential elections in \n     Afghanistan in April 2014 will be critical for the country's \n     future security and stability. Afghan women in particular are \n     often prevented from meaningful participation in the \n     electoral process due to the threat of violence, security \n     environment, the scarcity of female poll workers, and lack of \n     awareness of women's political rights and opportunities, \n     according to the Free and Fair Election Foundation of \n     Afghanistan.\n       (9) According to the Independent Election Commission of \n     Afghanistan, Afghanistan needs 12,000 female police officers \n     to search women at polling stations. The Afghan National \n     Police has about 1,570 women for this duty. According to the \n     United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), without female \n     searchers at polling stations, security threats will increase \n     as men can dress in burkhas attempting to enter the female \n     areas of the polling station while concealing firearms, \n     knives, or explosives.\n       (10) According to the July 1230 Report, ``U.S. Embassy \n     engagement on security preparations for the 2014 election \n     with the MoI and Independent Elections Commission has focused \n     on the need for increased temporary female security \n     personnel, which would provide an environment where women can \n     access polling stations while also ensuring the safety and \n     security of the polling stations, and highlighting the role \n     women can play in ensuring security overall.''\n       (11) According to the November 1230 Report, ``The lack of \n     female ANSF for both routine security operations and the 2014 \n     Afghan elections makes the ANSF gender gap an operational and \n     political risk for the Government of the Islamic Republic of \n     Afghanistan (GIRoA).'' Further, the November 1230 Report \n     highlights the significant risk to the credibility of the \n     April 2014 elections and to the ANSF, stating, ``Failure to \n     recruit more women could deter female voter turnout, harming \n     the legitimacy of the ANSF and those elected to office in \n     2014.''\n       (b) The Sense of Congress On Promotion of Security of \n     Afghan Women.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States Government should regularly press the \n     Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan to commit \n     to the meaningful inclusion of women in any peace process and \n     to ensure that women's concerns are fully reflected in \n     relevant negotiations; and\n       (2) the United States Government and the Government of \n     Afghanistan should ``reaffirm the role of Afghan civil \n     society, particularly women's organizations, in advocating \n     for and supporting human rights, good governance, and \n     sustainable social, economic, and democratic development of \n     Afghanistan through a sustained dialogue'', as agreed to \n     during the meeting between the International Community and \n     the Government of Afghanistan on the Tokyo Mutual \n     Accountability Framework (TMAF) in July 2013.\n       (c) Strategy To Promote Security of Afghan Women.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Defense shall support the \n     efforts of the Government of Afghanistan to ensure the \n     security of Afghan women and girls during and after the \n     security transition process through implementation of an \n     Afghan-led strategy to increase awareness and responsiveness \n     among Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police \n     personnel regarding the unique challenges women confront when \n     serving in those forces.\n       (2) Training.--The Secretary of Defense, working with the \n     International Security Force (ISAF) and NATO Training \n     Mission-Afghanistan (NTM-A), should encourage the Government \n     of Afghanistan to include in the strategy developed under \n     paragraph (1) the following elements:\n       (A) An evaluation of the effectiveness of existing training \n     for Afghan National Security Forces on this issue.\n       (B) A plan to increase the number of female security \n     officers, including those serving in Family Response Units, \n     specifically trained to address cases of gender-based \n     violence.\n       (C) A plan to address the development of accountability \n     mechanisms for ANA and ANP personnel who violate codes of \n     conduct related to the human rights of women and girls.\n       (3) Enrollment and treatment.--The Secretary of Defense, in \n     cooperation with the Afghan Ministries of Defense and \n     Interior, shall assist the Government of Afghanistan in \n     including as part of the strategy developed under paragraph \n     (1) the development and implementation of a strategy to \n     increase the number of female members of the ANA and ANP and \n     to ensure their equal treatment, including the following \n     actions:\n       (A) Submission of status reports to the Secretary of \n     Defense, not later than 120 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, on the plans of the MOD and MOI for \n     the recruitment and retention of female officers, non-\n     commissioned officers, and soldiers, including efforts to--\n       (i) provide appropriate equipment for female security and \n     police forces;\n       (ii) modify facilities to allow for female participation \n     within the security and police forces;\n       (iii) training to include literacy training for women \n     recruits and gender awareness training for male counterparts; \n     and\n       (iv) a review of the number of women in the ANP and \n     realistic deadlines to increase the number of female officers \n     by 2014.\n       (B) The allocation of not less than $15,000,000 from the \n     Afghan Security Forces Fund to be available for the \n     recruitment, retention, and support of women in the ANSF.\n       (4) Staffing at polling stations.--The Secretary of Defense \n     shall assist the Afghan MOD and MOI in increasing the number \n     of women staffing polling stations during the April 2014 \n     elections in Afghanistan, including--\n       (A) assistance in the development of a recruitment and \n     training program for female searchers and security officers \n     to staff voting stations during the April 2014 elections by \n     not later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act;\n       (B) assistance in the implementation of the program \n     described in subparagraph (A), including working with the \n     Ministry of Interior to ensure that female ANP officers are \n     assigned to provide security for polling stations;

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON IRANIAN NUCLEAR PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Diplomats from the Islamic Republic of Iran, the \n     European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, \n     Germany, France, China, and Russia continue to discuss the \n     Government of Iran's illicit nuclear weapons program.\n       (2) President of Iran Hasan Rouhani has in the past bragged \n     about his success in buying time for Iran to make nuclear \n     advances.\n       (3) Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, who retains \n     control over Iran's nuclear program, recently claimed that \n     Iran did not desire nuclear weapons but said that if Iran \n     ``intended to possess nuclear weapons, no power could stop \n     us''.\n       (4) The Government of Iran continues to expand Iran's \n     nuclear and missile programs in violation of multiple United \n     Nations Security Council resolutions.\n       (5) The Government of Iran has a decades-long track record \n     of cheating on and violating commitments regarding its \n     nuclear program and has used more than 10 years of diplomatic \n     negotiations to buy more time to expand its nuclear weapons \n     program.\n       (6) Iran remains the world's number one exporter of \n     terrorism and as recently as 2011 was plotting to assassinate \n     a foreign official on United States soil.\n       (7) Over the last three decades, the Government of Iran and \n     its terrorist proxies have been responsible for the deaths of \n     Americans.\n       (8) The Government of Iran and its terrorist proxies \n     continue to provide military and financial support to the \n     regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, aiding his regime's mass \n     killing of civilians.\n       (9) The Government of Iran continues to sow instability in \n     its region and to threaten its neighbors, including United \n     States allies such as Israel.\n       (10) The Government of Iran denies its people their \n     fundamental freedoms, including freedom of the press, freedom \n     of assembly, freedom of religion, and freedom of conscience.\n       (11) International and United States sanctions imposed on \n     Iran have assisted in bringing Iran to the negotiating table.\n       (12) Other countries, such as North Korea, have used \n     diplomatic talks regarding their nuclear programs to allow \n     time for the development of nuclear weapons.\n       (13) Based on the Government of Iran's stockpile of low \n     enriched uranium and its plan to continue installing advanced \n     centrifuges, the Government of Iran could agree to suspend \n     all enrichment above 3.5 percent and still be in a position \n     to produce weapons-grade uranium without detection by the \n     middle of next year.\n       (14) If the Government of Iran starts up its heavy water \n     reactor in Arak, it could establish an alternate pathway to a \n     nuclear weapon, producing enough plutonium each year for one \n     or two nuclear weapons.\n       (15) Nineteen other nations currently access peaceful \n     nuclear energy without any enrichment or reprocessing \n     activities on their soil.\n       (16) The Government of Iran could likewise achieve access \n     to peaceful nuclear energy without enrichment or reprocessing \n     activities on its own soil.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) it shall be the policy of the United States that the \n     Government of Iran will not be allowed to develop a nuclear \n     weapon and that all instruments of United States power and \n     influence remain on the table to prevent this outcome;\n       (2) the Government of Iran does not have an absolute or \n     inherent right to enrichment and reprocessing technologies \n     under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, \n     done at Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, and \n     entered into force\n\n[[Page S8219]]\n\n     March 5, 1970 (commonly known as the ``Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty'');\n       (3) relief of sanctions related to Iran's nuclear program \n     imposed upon Iran by the United States should only be \n     provided once Iran has completely abandoned its nuclear \n     weapons program, including any enrichment or reprocessing \n     capability, and has provided complete transparency to the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency regarding its work on \n     weaponization of a nuclear device; and\n       (4) until the Government of Iran has taken the actions set \n     forth in paragraph (3), Congress should move to pass a new \n     round of additional sanctions without delay.\n       (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed as an authorization for the use of force or \n     declaration of war.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2190.

records.\n       (v) Records management for access and eligibility \n     determinations.\n       (B) Elimination or reduction, where possible, of the use of \n     databases and information sources that cannot be accessed and \n     processed automatically electronically, or modification of \n     such databases and information sources, if appropriate and \n     cost-effective, to enable electronic access and processing \n     within and between agencies.\n       (C) Access and analysis of government, publically \n     available, and commercial data sources, including social \n     media, that provide independent information pertinent to \n     adjudication guidelines to improve quality and timeliness, \n     and reduce costs, of investigations and reinvestigations.\n       (D)

pertinent to adjudication guidelines and \n     eligibility determinations.\n       (E) Standardization of forms used for routine reporting \n     required of cleared personnel (such as travel, foreign \n     contacts, and financial disclosures) and use of continuous \n     monitoring technology to access databases containing such \n     reportable information to independently obtain and analyze \n     reportable data and events.\n       (F) Establishment of an authoritative central repository of \n     personnel security information that is accessible \n     electronically at multiple levels of classification and \n     eliminates technical barriers to rapid access to information \n     necessary for eligibility determinations and reciprocal \n     recognition thereof.\n       (G) Elimination or reduction of the scope of, or alteration \n     of the schedule for, periodic reinvestigations of cleared \n     personnel, when such action is appropriate in light of the \n     information provided by continuous monitoring or evaluation \n     technology.\n       (H) Electronic integration of personnel security processes \n     and information systems with insider threat detection and \n     monitoring systems, and pertinent law enforcement, \n     counterintelligence and intelligence information, for threat \n     detection and correlation.\n       (I) Determination of the net value of implementing phased \n     investigative approaches designed to reach an adjudicative \n     decision sooner than is currently achievable by truncating \n     investigations based on thresholds where no derogatory \n     information or clearly unacceptably derogatory information is \n     obtained through initial background checks.\n       (d) Reciprocity of Clearances.--The Secretary of Defense \n     and the Director of National Intelligence shall jointly \n     ensure that the transition of personnel security clearances \n     between and among Department of Defense

reciprocity of personnel security \n     clearances among positions requiring personnel holding \n     secret, top secret, or sensitive compartmented information \n     clearances (the latter with a counterintelligence polygraph \n     examination), to the maximum extent feasible consistent with \n     national security requirements.\n       (2) By permitting personnel, when feasible and consistent \n     with national security requirements, to begin work in \n     positions requiring additional security requirements, such as \n     a full-scope polygraph examination, pending satisfaction of \n     such additional requirements.\n       (e) Benchmarks.--For purposes of carrying out the \n     requirements of this section, the Secretary of Defense and \n     the Director of National Intelligence shall jointly \n     determine, by not later than 180 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the following:\n       (1) The current level of mobility and

government and the \n     private sector.\n       (2) The costs due to lost productivity in inefficiencies in \n     such transitions arising from personnel security clearance \n     matters.\n       (f) Comptroller General Review.--\n       (1) Review required.--Not later than 150 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of \n     the United States shall carry out a review of the personnel \n     security process.\n       (2) Objective of review.--The objective of the review \n     required by paragraph (1) shall be to identify the following:\n       (A) Differences between the metrics used by the Department \n     of Defense and other departments and agencies that grant \n     security clearances in granting reciprocity for security \n     clearances, and the manner in which such differences can be \n     harmonized.\n       (B) The extent to which existing Federal Investigative \n     Standards are relevant, complete, and sufficient for guiding \n     agencies and individual investigators as they conduct their \n     security clearance background investigations.\n       (C) The processes agencies have implemented to ensure \n     quality in the security clearance background investigation \n     process.\n       (D) The extent to which agencies have developed and \n     implemented outcome-focused performance measures to track the \n     quality of security clearance investigations and any insights \n     from these measures.\n       (E) The processes agencies have implemented for resolving \n     incomplete or subpar investigations, and the actions taken \n     against government employees and contractor personnel who \n     have demonstrated a consistent failure to abide by quality \n     assurance measures.\n       (3) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall submit \n     to the appropriate committees of Congress a report on the \n     results of the review required by paragraph (1).\n       (g) Task Force on Records Access for Security Clearance \n     Background Investigations.--\n       (1) Establishment.--The Suitability and Security Clearance \n     Performance Accountability Council, as established by \n     Executive Order No. 13467, shall convene a task force to \n     examine the different policies and procedures

UNITED STATES-ISRAEL MISSILE DEFENSE COOPERATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The State of Israel remains under the threat of \n     continuing attack from missiles, rockets, and mortars fired \n     at Israel by militants from terrorist organizations on its \n     southern border and by Hezbollah on its northern border, \n     which have killed and wounded many innocent Israeli \n     civilians. Israel also faces significant ballistic missile \n     threats from Iran and Syria.\n       (2) The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2008 (Public Law 110-181) expressed the sense of Congress \n     that the United States should have an active program of \n     ballistic missile defense cooperation with Israel, and should \n     take steps to improve the coordination, interoperability, and \n     integration of United States and Israeli missile defense \n     capabilities, and to enhance the capability of both nations \n     to defend against ballistic missile threats present in the \n     Middle East region.\n       (3) The United States-Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation \n     Act of 2012 (22 U.S.C. 8601 et seq.) states the policy of the \n     United States to support the inherent right of Israel to \n     self-defense and expresses the sense of Congress that the \n     United States Government should provide the Government of \n     Israel such support as may be necessary to increase \n     development and production of joint missile defense systems, \n     particularly such systems that defend against the urgent \n     threat posed to Israel and United States forces in the \n     region.\n       (4) It is central to the national security interests of the \n     United States to support Israel's ability to defend itself \n     against missiles and rockets, including through joint \n     cooperation on the Arrow Weapon System (with Arrow-2 and \n     Arrow-3 interceptors) and the David's Sling Weapons System, \n     along with continued support for the Iron Dome short-range \n     rocket defense system.\n       (5) The Arrow Weapon System, deployed with the Arrow-2 \n     interceptor jointly developed by Israel and the United \n     States, has been operational since 2000 and defends Israel \n     against medium-range ballistic missiles.\n       (6) The Arrow-3 interceptor, being jointly developed by the \n     United States and Israel, is designed to intercept ballistic \n     missiles with nuclear or chemical warheads at high altitude. \n     The Arrow-3 interceptor completed a successful fly-out test \n     in February 2013.\n       (7) The David's Sling Weapon System, being jointly \n     developed by the United States and Israel, is designed to \n     intercept short-range ballistic missiles, medium-range and \n     long-range rockets, and cruise missiles.

COMPREHENSIVE ALASKA INSTALLATION ENERGY REPORT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to a 2012 Total Energy Cost Analysis \n     conducted by the Alaska Command Energy Steering Group, there \n     exists a significant disparity between the costs of power at \n     all military installations in Alaska.\n       (2) Military installations differ in energy sources and \n     operating entities by utilizing both public and private means \n     and methods of operation: three interior installations, Clear \n     Air Force Station, Eielson Air Force Base, and Fort \n     Wainwright use coal cogeneration heat and electric plants; \n     fuel oil heat and commercial electric power is used to power \n     Fort Greely; and natural gas heat and commercial electric \n     power is used at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson.\n       (3) Electricity infrastructure in Alaska differs from other \n     States because most consumers in Alaska are not \n     interconnected to large grids through transmission and \n     distribution lines.\n       (4) Alaska has more fossil and renewable energy resources \n     than any other State.\n       (5) Alaska has the potential for long-term sustainable \n     energy production through development of its natural gas, \n     coal, oil, hydropower, tidal, geothermal and wind resources \n     to meet the energy needs of the State and beyond.\n       (6) Renewable energy, when combined with advanced micro-\n     grid and storage technologies, can significantly reduce the \n     energy costs at military installations.\n       (7) The Department of the Air Force has successfully \n     partnered with the municipality of Anchorage and a local \n     utility company on a renewable energy project converting \n     methane gas into fuel useable for a military installation.\n       (8) Over the past three years, the Department of the Air \n     Force has invested over $25,000,000 in renewable energy \n     projects at Alaska military installations.\n       (9) The Department of Defense prepares an Annual Energy \n     Management Report in accordance with section 2925 of title \n     10, United States Code.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) energy security is critical to United States national \n     security;\n       (2) cost-saving opportunities exist at Alaska military \n     installations if energy efficiency solutions are sought after \n     and implemented;\n       (3) evaluating energy efficiency measures at Alaska \n     military installations is essential in order to determine \n     enduring cost-effective energy production and consumption \n     solutions and ensure mission effectiveness; and\n       (4) a comprehensive and detailed study of energy efficiency \n     options at military installations in the state of Alaska is \n     needed due to its complex and challenging geography, distance \n     from the lower 48 states, resource availability, and lack of \n     energy infrastructure.\n       (c) Report.--\n       (1) Report required.--Not later than 180 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Deputy Under Secretary \n     of Defense for Installations and Environment, in conjunction \n     with the Service Assistant Secretaries responsible for \n     Installations and Environment for the military services, \n     shall submit a report to the congressional defense committees \n     detailing the current cost and sources of energy at each \n     military installation in Alaska, and viable and feasible \n     options for achieving energy efficiency and cost savings at \n     Alaska military installations.\n       (2) Elements.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall \n     include the following elements:\n       (A) A comprehensive, installation specific assessment of \n     feasible and mission appropriate energy initiatives \n     supporting energy production and consumption at military \n     installations.\n       (B) An assessment of current sources of energy in Alaska \n     and potential future sources that are technologically \n     feasible, cost effective, and mission appropriate.\n       (C) A comprehensive implementation strategy to include \n     required investment for feasible energy efficiency options \n     determined to be the most beneficial and cost effective where \n     appropriate and consistent with department priorities.\n       (D) An explanation on how military services are working \n     collaboratively in order to leverage lessons learned on \n     potential energy efficiency solutions.\n       (E) An assessment of State and local partnership \n     opportunities that would achieve efficiency and cost savings, \n     and any legislative authorities required to carry out such \n     partnerships or agreements.\n       (3) Utilization of other efforts.--In preparing the report \n     required under paragraph (1), the Under Secretary shall take \n     into consideration completed and ongoing efforts by agencies \n     of the Federal Government to analyze and develop energy \n     efficient solutions in the state of Alaska, including the \n     Department of Defense information available in the Annual \n     Energy Management Report.\n       (4) Coordination with state and local and other entities.--\n     In preparing the report required under paragraph (1), the \n     Under Secretary is encouraged to work in conjunction and \n     coordinate with the State of Alaska, local communities, and \n     other Federal departments and agencies.\n       (d) Definitions.--In this section, the term ``Alaska \n     military installation'' includes Clear Air Force Station, \n     Eielson Air Force Base, Fort Wainwright, Joint Base \n     Elmendorf-Richardson, Fort Greely, and Eareckson Air Station.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2257.

UNITED STATES-ISRAEL MISSILE DEFENSE COOPERATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The State of Israel remains under the threat of \n     continuing attack from missiles, rockets, and mortars fired \n     at Israel by militants from terrorist organizations on its \n     southern border and by Hezbollah on its northern border, \n     which have killed and wounded many innocent Israeli \n     civilians. Israel also faces significant ballistic missile \n     threats from Iran and Syria.\n       (2) The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2008 (Public Law 110-181) expressed the sense of Congress \n     that the United States should have an active program of \n     ballistic missile defense cooperation with Israel, and should \n     take steps to improve the coordination, interoperability, and \n     integration of United States and Israeli missile defense \n     capabilities, and to enhance the capability of both nations \n     to defend against ballistic missile threats present in the \n     Middle East region.\n       (3) The United States-Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation \n     Act of 2012 (22 U.S.C. 8601 et seq.) states the policy of the \n     United States to support the inherent right of Israel to \n     self-defense and expresses the sense of Congress that the \n     United States Government should provide the Government of \n     Israel such support as may be necessary to increase \n     development and production of joint missile defense systems, \n     particularly such systems that defend against the urgent \n     threat posed to Israel and United States forces in the \n     region.\n       (4) It is central to the national security interests of the \n     United States to support Israel's ability to defend itself \n     against missiles and rockets, including through joint \n     cooperation on the Arrow Weapon System (with Arrow-2 and \n     Arrow-3 interceptors) and the David's Sling Weapons System, \n     along with continued support for the Iron Dome short-range \n     rocket defense system.\n       (5) The Arrow Weapon System, deployed with the Arrow-2 \n     interceptor jointly developed by Israel and the United \n     States, has been operational since 2000 and defends Israel \n     against medium-range ballistic missiles.\n       (6) The Arrow-3 interceptor, being jointly developed by the \n     United States and Israel, is designed to intercept ballistic \n     missiles with nuclear or chemical warheads at high altitude. \n     The Arrow-3 interceptor completed a successful fly-out test \n     in February 2013.\n       (7) The David's Sling Weapon System, being jointly \n     developed by the United States and Israel, is designed to \n     intercept short-range ballistic missiles, medium-range and \n     long-range rockets, and cruise missiles. The David's Sling \n     Weapon System successfully intercepted an inert medium-range \n     rocket target in a November 2012 test.\n       (8) The Israeli Defense Forces report that, during \n     Operation Pillar of Defense in November 2012, the Iron Dome \n     short-range rocket defense system achieved a success rate of \n     about 85 percent against rockets bound for\n\n[[Page S8260]]\n\n     Israeli population centers and infrastructure, thus averting \n     large-scale casualties in Israel and enhancing Israel's \n     operational flexibility during the conflict.\n       (9) Continued missile defense cooperation between the \n     United States and Israel will further develop and enhance the \n     missile defense capability, and thus the security, of both \n     the United States and Israel.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--\n       (1) reaffirms its commitment to the security of our \n     strategic partner Israel;\n       (2) supports maintenance of an active program of ballistic \n     missile defense cooperation with Israel;\n       (3) supports efforts to enhance the capability of both the \n     United States and Israel to defend against ballistic missile \n     threats present in the Middle East region; and\n       (4) urges the Department of Defense to take all appropriate \n     steps as may be necessary to improve the coordination, \n     interoperability, and integration of United States and \n     Israeli missile defense capabilities.\n       (c) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than one year after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall \n     submit to the congressional defense committees a report on \n     the status of missile defense cooperation between the United \n     States and Israel.\n       (2) Elements.--The report under this subsection shall \n     include the following:\n       (A) A description of the current program of ballistic \n     missile defense cooperation between the United States and \n     Israel, including its objectives and results to date.\n       (B) A description of the actions taken within the previous \n     year to improve the coordination, interoperability, and \n     integration of the missile defense capabilities of the United \n     States and Israel.\n       (C) A description of the actions planned to be taken by the \n     Government of the United States and the Government Israel \n     over the next year to improve the coordination, \n     interoperability, and integration of their missile defense \n     capabilities.\n       (D) A description of the joint efforts of the United States \n     and Israel to develop ballistic missile defense technologies \n     and capabilities.\n       (E) A description of the joint missile defense exercises \n     and training that have been conducted by the United States \n     and Israel, and the lessons learned from those exercises.\n       (F) A description of the cooperation by the United States \n     and Israel in sharing ballistic missile threat assessments.\n       (G) Any other matters the Secretary considers appropriate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2284.

PROHIBITION RELATING TO TOBACCO PRODUCTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Tobacco use by military personnel has two major \n     economic effects on the Department of Defense, the cost of \n     health care for military personnel (active-duty, retired, and \n     dependents), and the cost of lost productivity.\n       (2) The Department of Defense spends over $1,600,000,000 a \n     year on tobacco-related medical care, increased \n     hospitalization, and lost days of work (according to \n     Department of Defense figures for 2008).\n       (3) Over the next 10 years, the net present value of \n     preventable smoking-attributable health-care expenditures is \n     $19,685,000,000 for the entire population of veterans, an \n     average of $21,444 for each current veteran smoker.\n       (4) The cost of treating individuals for tobacco-related \n     diseases in the TRICARE system is estimated to be over \n     $500,000,000 per year (or 4 percent of the total TRICARE \n     budget) for medical care and $346,000,000 in lost \n     productivity. These expenses are primarily for care of \n     individuals who had cardiovascular disease or respiratory \n     problems. Other tobacco related costs included treatment of \n     cancer, cerebrovascular diseases, and newborn health \n     complications.\n       (5) In 2008, the Department of Veterans Affairs spent over \n     $5,000,000,000 to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary \n     disease. More than 80 percent of chronic obstructive \n     pulmonary disease is attributed to smoking.\n       (6) The Department of Veterans Affairs spent an additional \n     1,300,000,000 in 2008 on arteriosclerosis, another smoking-\n     related disease.\n       (7) Tobacco use has been implicated in higher dropout rates \n     during and after basic training, poorer visual acuity, and a \n     higher rate of absenteeism in active-duty military personnel \n     in addition to a multitude of health problems.\n       (8) Military retirees and their dependents incur greater \n     tobacco-related health costs than do active-duty members of \n     the military or their dependents.\n       (9) Over 9,200 hospital-bed days for active-duty personnel \n     were attributed to tobacco-related diseases, or about 10 \n     percent of the total Department of Defense hospital-bed days \n     and 1.5 percent of all active-duty hospital-bed days (Helyer \n     et al., 1998).\n       (10) Tobacco-related medical costs amounted to $20,000,000 \n     in a 1997 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study of \n     smoking in active-duty Air Force personnel, or 6 percent of \n     total Air Force medical system expenditures (2000).\n       (11) A 2007 study (Dall et al) calculated that moderate to \n     heavy smoking was associated with greater absenteeism in the \n     TRICARE Prime enrolled population, 356,000 full time \n     equivalent days were lost per year, and 30,000 full time \n     equivalent days were lost as a result of below-normal work \n     performance.\n       (12) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has \n     determined the following mortality rates :\n       (A) Cigarette smoking is associated with about one of every \n     five deaths in the United States each year.\n       (B) Cigarette smoking is associated with more than 440,000 \n     deaths annually (including deaths from secondhand smoke).\n       (C) Life expectancy for smokers is at least 10 years \n     shorter than for nonsmokers.\n       (b) Prohibition.--The Secretary of Defense shall promulgate \n     regulations to prohibit the sale of discounted tobacco \n     products in any commissary store or exchange store under the \n     commissary system and the exchange system operated under \n     chapter 147 of title 10, United States Code.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2293.

FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS; STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Government of Iran continues to expand the nuclear \n     and missile programs of Iran in violation of multiple United \n     Nations Security Council resolutions.\n       (2) The Government of Iran has a decades-long track record \n     of cheating on and violating commitments regarding the \n     nuclear program of Iran and has used more than 10 years of \n     diplomatic negotiations to allow more time to expand its \n     nuclear weapons program.\n       (3) Iran remains the number one exporter of terrorism in \n     the world and as recently as 2011 was plotting to assassinate \n     a foreign official in the United States.\n       (4) Over the last 30 years, the Government of Iran and its \n     terrorist proxies have been responsible for the deaths of \n     citizens of the United States.\n       (5) The Government of Iran and its terrorist proxies \n     continue to provide military and financial support to the \n     regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, aiding that regime in the \n     mass killing of the people of Syria.\n       (6) The Government of Iran continues to sow instability in \n     the Middle East and threaten its neighbors, including allies \n     of the United States such as Israel.\n       (7) The Government of Iran denies its people fundamental \n     freedoms, including freedom of the press, freedom of \n     assembly, freedom of religion, and freedom of conscience.\n       (8) Sanctions imposed with respect to Iran by the United \n     States and the international community have assisted in \n     bringing Iran to the negotiating table, but other countries, \n     such as North Korea, have used diplomatic talks regarding \n     their nuclear programs to allow time for the development of \n     nuclear weapons.\n       (9) President Hasan Rouhani of Iran has in the past bragged \n     about his success in buying time for Iran to make nuclear \n     advances.\n       (10) Based on the stockpile of low enriched uranium held by \n     the Government of Iran and its plan to continue installing \n     advanced centrifuges, the Government of Iran could agree to \n     suspend all enrichment of uranium to greater than 3.5 percent \n     and still be in a position to produce weapons-grade uranium \n     without detection by the middle of 2014.\n       (11) If the Government of Iran commences the operation of \n     its heavy water reactor in Arak, it could establish an \n     alternate pathway to a nuclear weapon, producing enough \n     plutonium each year for one or 2 nuclear weapons.\n\n[[Page S8264]]\n\n       (12) As of the date of the enactment of this Act, 19 \n     countries access nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without \n     conducting any enrichment or reprocessing activities within \n     that country.\n       (13) The Government of Iran could likewise access nuclear \n     energy for peaceful purposes without conducting any \n     enrichment or reprocessing activities within Iran.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Government of Iran must not be allowed to develop \n     nuclear weapons capabilities;\n       (2) all instruments of power and influence of the United \n     States should remain on the table to prevent the Government \n     of Iran from developing nuclear weapons capabilities;\n       (3) the Government of Iran does not have an absolute or \n     inherent right to enrichment and reprocessing capabilities \n     and technologies under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \n     Nuclear Weapons, done at Washington, London, and Moscow July \n     1, 1968, and entered into force March 5, 1970 (commonly known \n     as the ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty'');\n       (4) any interim agreement with Iran regarding its nuclear \n     program must require that Iran comply with all United Nations \n     Security Council resolutions concerning the nuclear program \n     of Iran, including by--\n       (A) suspending enrichment at all facilities;\n       (B) suspending construction of a heavy water nuclear \n     reactor in Arak; and\n       (C) ceasing all work related to nuclear weaponization and \n     providing full transparency with respect to the cessation of \n     that work;\n       (5) given the decades-long history of deception by the \n     Government of Iran with respect to the nuclear program of \n     Iran, and violations by that government of its obligations \n     under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, \n     any final agreement with Iran regarding its nuclear program \n     must--\n       (A) prevent that government from possessing any enrichment \n     or reprocessing capabilities;\n       (B) provide for the continuous monitoring of the nuclear \n     program of Iran under a strict verification regime, including \n     inspections at any time or place;\n       (C) result in Iran surrendering its supply of enriched \n     material to the International Atomic Energy Agency;\n       (D) prevent any operation of the reactor in Arak; and\n       (E) require that Iran sign and abide by the Protocol \n     Additional to the Agreement Between Iran and the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency for the Application of \n     Safeguards in Connection with the Treaty on the Non-\n     Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at Vienna December 18, \n     2003 (commonly referred to as the ``Additional Protocol'');\n       (6) a violation by Iran of any interim or final agreement \n     with respect to the nuclear program of Iran should result in \n     the immediate imposition of comprehensive economic sanctions, \n     including on all petroleum-related exports and additional \n     restrictions on financial and commercial activity by Iran; \n     and\n       (7) if the Government of Israel is compelled to take \n     military action against Iran in self-defense, the Government \n     of the United States should provide diplomatic, military, and \n     economic support to the Government of Israel in its defense \n     of its territory, people, and existence.\n       (c) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United \n     States--\n       (1) to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and \n     material related to nuclear weapons because of the \n     significant negative impact of that proliferation, \n     particularly to countries that do not possess nuclear \n     weapons, including Iran, on the national security and \n     economic interests of the United States and other countries;\n       (2) to ensure that the proliferation of nuclear weapons and \n     material related to nuclear weapons be strictly restricted;\n       (3) to ensure that countries that do not possess nuclear \n     weapons, including Iran, do not obtain nuclear weapons;\n       (4) to take such actions as may be necessary to implement \n     the policy described in paragraph (3);\n       (5) to ensure that Iran ceases all domestic uranium \n     enrichment and reprocessing technology development, \n     installation, and operation;\n       (6) to ensure that Iran ceases all plutonium-related \n     activities and dismantles all plutonium-related facilities; \n     and\n       (7) that any negotiated agreement with the Government of \n     Iran regarding its nuclear program, whether interim or \n     otherwise, must--\n       (A) include clear, measurable, and verifiable requirements \n     for the Government of Iran to substantially and effectively \n     terminate any activities that may be related to the \n     development of a nuclear weapons capability before any \n     existing sanctions or other measures with respect to Iran are \n     modified, whether temporarily or otherwise; and\n       (B) because of the significant impact of such an agreement \n     on the national security and economic interests of the United \n     States, including the impact on commerce, trade, and \n     sanctions policy, be submitted to Congress and be subject to \n     a congressional resolution of disapproval.\n\n     SEC. 1242.

development of a multi-year investment plan \n     that determines where gaps in services exist or are projected \n     and develops an appropriate solution to meet those gaps.\n       (7) According

CONSOLIDATED AND COORDINATED FEDERAL GOVERNMENT \n                   INTERNET PORTAL TO CONNECT CURRENT AND FORMER \n                   MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES WITH EMPLOYERS \n                   SEEKING EMPLOYEES WITH SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE \n                   DEVELOPED THROUGH MILITARY SERVICE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Although significant progress has been made, \n     unemployment among veterans remains stubbornly high.\n       (2) The unemployment rate among younger veterans, ages 18 \n     to 24, remains well above the national average.\n       (3) This problem impacts the Department of Defense budget. \n     Over the past 10 years, the Federal Government has expended \n     more than $9,600,000,000 on unemployment compensation \n     benefits for former members of the Armed Forces.\n       (4) The Department makes significant investments in members \n     of the Armed Forces including specialized technical training \n     in skills that are easily transferrable to civilian career \n     fields.\n\n[[Page S8278]]\n\n       (5) Beyond specific technical training, veterans gain \n     unique leadership, organizational, and other skills that make \n     them valued employees in the private sector.\n       (6) Government agencies, private sector entities, and \n     nonprofit organizations are responding to the issue of \n     unemployment among veterans.\n       (7) There are now so many programs to assist veterans in \n     finding employment, many within the Government, that veterans \n     may not know where to seek assistance in finding employment. \n     While these programs are well intentioned, many are \n     duplicative in nature, and compete for scarce resources.\n       (8) The Department of Labor, the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs, the Department Defense, and the Office of Personnel \n     Management are currently working to consolidate the veterans \n     employment initiatives of the Government into a single, \n     consolidated Internet portal with the goal of connecting \n     veterans who are seeking employment with employers who want \n     to employ them.\n       (9) The consolidated portal will prevent Federal Government \n     agencies from competing with each other to accomplish the \n     same goal, and will save the Federal Government money while \n     providing a comprehensive, coordinated tool for employers and \n     veterans seeking employment.\n       (10) The Federal Government can accomplish this by \n     leveraging the best practices of current programs.\n       (11) While progress has been made, there is no statutory \n     requirement to streamline these Government programs and \n     coordinate the resources that are all intended to achieve the \n     same goal.\n       (b) Consolidated Internet Portal Required.--Commencing not \n     later than one year after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of Labor shall, in conjunction with the \n     Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and \n     organizations concerned with veterans resources, consolidate \n     Internet portals of the Federal Government on employment for \n     current and former members of the Armed Forces into a \n     comprehensive consolidated Internet portal within a single \n     existing platform or system for the purposes of connecting \n     current and former members of the Armed Forces who are \n     seeking employment with employers who want to employ them.\n       (c) Elements.--\n       (1) In general.--The consolidated Internet portal under \n     subsection (b) should include the following:\n       (A) A means through which current and former members of the \n     Armed Forces may connect for employment purposes with \n     employers seeking the experience and skills developed during \n     service in the Armed Forces, including a means of presenting \n     a profile of each member or former member to employers that \n     includes, at a minimum--\n       (i) the skills obtained by such member or former member \n     during service in the Armed Forces and additional skills such \n     member or former member is interested in pursuing; and\n       (ii) the current or intended residence of such member or \n     former member (including an option for members or former \n     members who are willing to reside in various locations).\n       (B) A means of permitting qualified prospective employers \n     to post employment openings and seek contact with members or \n     former members based on their profile for the purposes of \n     requesting the initiation of arrangements or negotiations \n     concerning potential employment.\n       (C) A means of presenting other employment resources, \n     including resume preparation, to members or former members \n     seeking employment.\n       (2) Matters considered.--In developing the consolidated \n     Internet portal, the Secretaries referred to in subsection \n     (b) should consider, at a minimum, the following:\n       (A) Public and private sector resources on matters relating \n     to the portal.\n       (B) Opportunities to incorporate local employment networks \n     into the portal.\n       (C) Methodologies to determine the most effective \n     employment resources and programs to be incorporated into the \n     portal.\n       (D) Means for streamlining processes through the portal for \n     employers to find and employ former members of the Armed \n     Forces.\n       (d) Member Participation.--\n       (1) In general.--Participation in the consolidated Internet \n     portal under subsection (b) shall be limited to members of \n     the National Guard and Reseves, members of the Armed Forces \n     on active duty who are transitioning from military service to \n     civilian life, former members of the Armed Forces, and \n     veterans.\n       (2) Voluntary.--Participation by a member or former member \n     of the Armed Forces described in paragraph (1) in the \n     consolidated Internet portal shall be voluntary. A member or \n     former member participating in the portal may cease \n     participation in the portal at any time.\n       (e) Reports by Implementing Secretaries.--\n       (1) Preliminary report.--Not later than six months after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretaries shall \n     submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a report on \n     the consolidated Internet portal under subsection (b).

Mr. SESSIONS submitted an amendment intended to be proposed \nby him to the bill S. 1197, to authorize appropriations for fiscal year \n2014 for military activities of the Department of Defense, for military \nconstruction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, \nto prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for \nother purposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 125. SENSE OF SENATE ON THE LITTORAL COMBAT SHIP \n                   PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Despite early problems with the Littoral Combat Ship \n     (LCS) program, the Navy has made substantial progress in \n     getting production on schedule and costs under control. As a \n     result, the Navy is now purchasing LCS below the \n     congressionally mandated cost cap. According to congressional \n     testimony provided by Assistant Secretary of the Navy \n     (Research, Development and Acquisition) Sean Stackley on July \n     25, 2013 before the Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection \n     Forces of the House Armed Services Committee, ``The average \n     cost of both LCS variants--including basic construction, \n     government-furnished equipment (GFE), and change orders--\n     across the 10-seaframe procurement over the five year period \n     falls under the Congressionally-mandated cost cap of $480 \n     million per seaframe (FY 2009 dollars)''. This testimony is \n     consistent with the findings in the Congressional Budget \n     Office's October 2013 report entitled ``An Analysis of the \n     Navy's Fiscal Year 2014 Shipbuilding Plan'' which states: \n     ``In the 2014 Future Years Defense Program, the Navy \n     estimated the average cost of the LCS at about $420 million \n     per ship over the next five years, including the 6 ships (2 \n     per year) to be bought in 2016 through 2018, after the end of \n     the two 10-ship contracts. That figure is well below the \n     Congressionally mandated cost cap for the LCS program of $515 \n     million per ship (adjusted for inflation). Overall, the Navy \n     estimated that the 36 LCSs to be purchased by 2026 would cost \n     about $446 million per ship, on average''. Finally, according \n     to the Department of the Navy, LCS is ``the only shipbuilding \n     program wherein the unit cost in production is on a marked \n     steady decline''.\n       (2) LCS is vital to the Navy and our national security. \n     According to Secretary of the Navy, Ray Mabus, it is ``the \n     future of the Navy and the future of how we fight''. \n     Similarly, Assistant Secretary of the Navy Stackley, in his \n     written testimony for Congress observed: ``[T]he LCS program \n     is of critical importance to our Navy. With its great speed \n     and interchangeable modules, the ship will provide \n     unprecedented warfighting flexibility. LCS is one of the \n     cornerstones of the future Navy, and provides critical \n     capability to the fleet. This fast, agile, focused-mission \n     platform is designed for operation in near-shore \n     environments, yet is capable of open-ocean operation''.\n       (3) The LCS program is an essential element of the Navy's \n     long-term shipbuilding strategy which directly supports \n     warfighting and presence requirements articulated by the \n     combatant commanders. The planned buy of 52 LCS supports \n     strategic and operational requirements validated in the \n     Navy's 2012 Force Structure Assessment (FSA) pursuant to the \n     January 2012 defense strategic guidance document entitled \n     ``Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st \n     Century Defense''. According to the Department of the Navy, \n     ``LCS and associated mission modules replace the capabilities \n     of frigates (FFGs), mine countermeasure (MCM) ships, and \n     patrol craft (PCs) which are reaching [the end of their] \n     expected service life''. Additionally, according to the Navy, \n     ``delaying procurement of these ships would slow both the \n     delivery of this critical capability to the fleet [and] \n     progress toward the 300-ship target in FY 2019 and the \n     ultimate goal of meeting a 306 ship force structure required \n     to support validated . . . warfighting and presence \n     requirements''. Similarly, as noted in congressional \n     testimony provided by Ronald O'Rourke of the Congressional \n     Research Service (CRS), ``If the LCS program were truncated \n     to 24 ships or some other number well short of 52, a \n     potential key issue [for Congress] would be the operational \n     implications for the Navy of potentially not having \n     sufficient capacity to fully perform the LCS's three core \n     missions of countering mines, small boats, and diesel \n     submarines, particularly in littoral waters''.\n       (4) The cost for all LCS seaframes under contract (FY 10-13 \n     ships) will increase if the current block buy contracts are \n     disrupted. According to the Department of the Navy, costs \n     will increase ``due to the impact of lost workload, \n     inefficiencies, and breakage to the vendor base''. \n     Additionally, negotiated ship construction prices will be \n     lost for FY 14 and FY 15 ships. Moreover, FY 15 competitive \n     prices will be required to be renegotiated in a sole source \n     environment which will likely result in significant increases \n     to FY 15 ship pricing. Slowing or pausing the program will \n     also likely result in additional costs to future ships as a \n     result of lost learning in the shipyards, increased overhead, \n     vendor pricing, and concerns about contract stability. \n     Finally, disrupting the current block buy contracts could \n     potentially cause extreme damage to the shipbuilding \n     industrial base.\n       (5) Many first-of-class ships experience unanticipated \n     challenges, setbacks, and, as a result, intense scrutiny and \n     sometimes harsh criticism. According to the Secretary of the \n     Navy, Ray Mabus, ``the first of every single class in our \n     Navy has faced similar issues and has been strengthened by \n     dealing with them''. Similarly, according to congressional \n     testimony provided on October 23, 2013 by CRS analyst Ronald \n     O'Rourke, ``In the midst of criticisms of certain Navy \n     surface ship acquisition programs in the 30-year shipbuilding \n     plan, [such as the LCS program], on issues such as cost \n     growth, ship capabilities, construction-quality, and testing \n     of combat system equipment, it can be helpful to recall, as a \n     matter of providing some historical context, that a number of \n     earlier Navy surface combatant acquisition programs--\n     including some, like the DDG-51 program, that are today \n     considered acquisition success stories--were themselves \n     criticized on one or more of these grounds''. For example, in \n     January 1990, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) \n     criticized the DDG-51 Arleigh Burke destroyer program in \n     their report to the Secretary of Defense, ``Navy \n     Shipbuilding: Cost and Schedule Problems on the DDG-51 AEGIS \n     Destroyer Program'', noting that the shipyard had originally \n     ``encountered problems in designing and constructing the lead \n     ship. The contract costs have increased substantially, and \n     the ship will be about 17 months late. Since the lead ship is \n     only 50 percent complete, additional problems could surface \n     and delay the follow ships.'' Additionally, the GAO \n     recommended ``that the Secretary of Defense ensure sufficient \n     information exists to justify the award of contracts for \n     follow ships beyond the seven now under contract''. \n     Nevertheless, the Navy went on to successfully build a total \n     of 62 of these destroyers since the program's inception with \n     an additional 13 ships planned (under construction, on \n     contract, or covered by awarded contracts).\n       (6) The Government Accountability Office's July 2013 \n     report, ``Navy Shipbuilding: Significant Investments in the \n     Littoral Combat Ship Continue Amid Substantial Unknowns about \n     Capabilities, Use, and Cost'', overstates the significance of \n     design changes to follow-on ships. As noted by Assistant Navy \n     Secretary Stackley in his July 2013 testimony before \n     Congress, ``No changes to LCS seaframe requirements are \n     envisioned in the near term as both LCS classes meet Navy \n     requirements''. Further, as the Department of the Navy has \n     stated, ``The issues and corrective efforts discussed [in the \n     GAO report] are consistent with all lead ships of any new \n     class of surface combatants, or any lead ship of a new class. \n     Other `new, potentially significant seaframe design changes' \n     mentioned [in the GAO report] as under consideration by the \n     Navy would--if accepted by the Navy--be incorporated into the \n     next procurement (LCS 25 and follow), as is standard practice \n     in all shipbuilding programs''.\n       (7) The GAO's concern with concurrency in the development \n     and fielding of LCS mission modules is misplaced. As \n     Assistant Navy Secretary Stackley has explained in his \n     congressional testimony before the House Armed Services \n     Committee, ``The modular strategy for mission packages is a \n     breakthrough concept for delivering cost effective\n\n[[Page S8287]]\n\n     capability by employing mature technologies to meet today's \n     warfighting requirements while also providing tremendous \n     flexibility to rapidly employ developing technologies to \n     counter emerging threats or otherwise close gaps today, and \n     in the future. . . In order to deliver these capabilities in \n     the capacity needed, and with an eye on controlling cost and \n     risk, the Navy is employing an incremental fielding strategy \n     wherein the first increment leverages mature technologies and \n     existing programs of record to provide a level of performance \n     exceeding that available in the fleet today''. Moreover, \n     Assistant Secretary Stackley made clear that ``[t]his \n     incremental approach minimizes concurrency risk while \n     allowing the flexibility which the modular concept provides. \n     . . This time-phased fielding of capability is fundamental as \n     it allows the Navy to rapidly field systems as they are \n     matured instead of waiting for the final capability delivery. \n     The major systems that comprise mission packages are already \n     established as individual programs, with their own \n     Acquisition Program Baselines (APBs) including cost, schedule \n     and performance objectives and thresholds''.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) chief among the mandates of the Navy is forward \n     presence;\n       (2) operating forward overseas is critical to United States \n     national security and the preservation of United States \n     national interests;\n       (3) to achieve this forward presence, the size of the Navy \n     fleet matters;\n       (4) the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) will be a critical \n     component of the overall size of the Navy fleet and, without \n     it, the Navy will not be able to provide the capabilities or \n     capacity that operational commanders require;\n       (5) the capabilities of the Littoral Combat Ship remain \n     essential to operational commanders;\n       (6) Littoral Combat Ship vessels, together with their \n     mission modules, form a key part of the long-range \n     shipbuilding strategy of the Navy to meet force structure \n     requirements in support of the January 2012 defense strategic \n     guidance document entitled ``Sustaining U.S. Global \n     Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense'';\n       (7) the Navy should continue to plan on procuring 52 \n     Littoral Combat Ship seaframes in accordance with its most \n     recent long-range shipbuilding plan, while balancing \n     available funding with achieving the lowest possible pricing \n     to the Government;\n       (8) the progress of the Navy in answering the concerns of \n     the July 2013 report of the Government Accountability Office, \n     entitled ``Navy Shipbuilding: Significant Investments in the \n     Littoral Combat Ship Continue Amid Substantial Unknowns about \n     Capabilities, Use, and Cost'', has been noteworthy and \n     adequate;\n       (9) the report on the Littoral Combat Ship referred to in \n     paragraph (8), while detailed and substantive, contains \n     recommendations that do not reflect a full and thorough \n     understanding of the Littoral Combat Ship program;\n       (10) the Navy should be applauded for its decision to \n     deploy U.S.S. Freedom (LCS 1), a research and development \n     funded platform, early and with a surface warfare (SUW) \n     mission package to gather helpful information and lessons \n     learned in order to better inform the development of \n     operational, manning, maintenance, and logistics support \n     concepts;\n       (11) the Navy should be commended for the ongoing and \n     rigorous testing of the mine countereasures (MCM) mission \n     module being conducted by U.S.S. Independence (LCS 2)--\n     another research and development funded platform--and the \n     recent successful completion of the second phase of \n     developmental testing of the SUW mission package by U.S.S. \n     Fort Worth (LCS 3);\n       (12) the Navy must continue to endeavor to drive overall \n     Littoral Combat Ship program costs down;\n       (13) the Navy must inform the future procurement strategy \n     with thorough assessments, which are based on validated \n     requirements and independent cost estimates and which include \n     program thresholds and objectives for cost, schedule, and \n     performance;\n       (14) future acquisition decisions on the Littoral Combat \n     Ship should be informed with an up-to-date service cost \n     position and ``should cost'' assessment;\n       (15) the Defense Acquisition Executive should determine \n     whether a new Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Cost \n     Analysis and Program Evaluation (CAPE) independent cost \n     estimate (ICE) will be needed to inform future Littoral \n     Combat Ship program decisions; and\n       (16) the Navy, along with the Joint Staff, should conduct a \n     requirements assessment study to serve as a revalidation of \n     the Littoral Combat Ship capabilities definition document.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2341.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON DEFENSE COOPERATION WITH \n                   GEORGIA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Georgia is a highly valued partner of the United States \n     and has repeatedly demonstrated its commitment to advancing \n     the mutual interests of both countries, including through the \n     deployment of Georgian forces as part of the NATO-led \n     International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, \n     currently serving as the largest non-NATO contributor and \n     without caveats in Helmand Province, and as part of the \n     Multi-National Force in Iraq.\n       (2) Contrary to international law and the 2008 ceasefire \n     agreement between Russia and Georgia, Russian forces have \n     constructed barriers, including barbed wire and fences, along \n     the administrative boundary line for the South Ossetia region \n     of Georgia. This ``borderization'' is inconsistent with \n     Russia's international commitments under the August 2008 \n     ceasefire agreement, is contrary to Georgia's sovereignty and \n     territorial integrity, creates hardship and significant \n     negative impacts for populations on both sides of these \n     barriers, and is detrimental to long-term conflict \n     resolution.\n       (3) The peaceful transfer of power as the result of the \n     October 2012 parliamentary elections in Georgia represents a \n     major accomplishment toward the Georgian people's creation of \n     a free society and full democracy.\n       (4) The presidential election of October 2013 marks another \n     major step in this transition to a free and open democracy. \n     International election observers from the Organization for \n     Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) concluded that the \n     election ``was efficiently administered, transparent and took \n     place in an amicable and constructive environment [. . .]. \n     Fundamental freedoms of expression, movement and assembly \n     were respected, and candidates were able to campaign without \n     restriction. [. . .] A wide range of views and information \n     was made available to voters through the media, providing \n     candidates with a platform to present their programmes and \n     opinions freely.''

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) on April 18, 1942, the brave men of the 17th \n     Bombardment Group (Medium) became known as the ``Doolittle \n     Tokyo Raiders'' for outstanding heroism, valor, skill, and \n     service to the United States in conducting the bombings of \n     Tokyo;\n       (2) 80 brave American aircraft crewmen, led by Lieutenant \n     Colonel James Doolittle, volunteered for an ``extremely \n     hazardous mission'', without knowing the target, location,\n\n[[Page S8290]]\n\n     or assignment, and willingly put their lives in harm's way, \n     risking death, capture, and torture;\n       (3) the conduct of medium bomber operations from a Navy \n     aircraft carrier under combat conditions had never before \n     been attempted;\n       (4) after the discovery of the USS Hornet by Japanese \n     picket ships 170 miles further away from the prearranged \n     launch point, the Doolittle Tokyo Raiders proceeded to take \n     off 670 miles from the coast of Japan;\n       (5) by launching more than 100 miles beyond the distance \n     considered to be minimally safe for the mission, the \n     Doolittle Tokyo Raiders deliberately accepted the risk that \n     the B-25s might not have enough fuel to reach the designated \n     air-fields in China on return;\n       (6) the additional launch distance greatly increased the \n     risk of crash landing in Japanese occupied China, exposing \n     the crews to higher probability of death, injury, or capture;\n       (7) because of that deliberate choice, after bombing their \n     targets in Japan, low on fuel and in setting night and \n     deteriorating weather, none of the 16 airplanes reached the \n     prearranged Chinese airfields;\n       (8) of the 80 Doolittle Tokyo Raiders who launched on the \n     raid, 8 were captured, 2 died in the crash, and 70 returned \n     to the United States;\n       (9) of the 8 captured Doolittle Tokyo Raiders, 3 were \n     executed and 1 died of disease; and\n       (10) there were only 5 surviving members of the Doolittle \n     Tokyo Raiders as of February 2013.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n       (a) Presentation Authorized.--The President pro tempore of \n     the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives \n     shall make appropriate arrangements for the award, on behalf \n     of Congress, of 6 gold medals of appropriate design in honor \n     of the World War II members of the 17th Bombardment Group \n     (Medium) who became known as the ``Doolittle Tokyo Raiders'', \n     in recognition of their military service during World War II.\n       (b) Design and Striking.--For the purposes of the award \n     referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury \n     shall strike the gold medals with suitable emblems, devices, \n     and inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.\n       (c) Following Award of Medals.--\n       (1) In general.--Following the award of the gold medals \n     referred to in subsection (a), 5 of the gold medals shall be \n     given to the 5 surviving members of the mission as of \n     February 2013 or their next of kin, with a sixth medal to be \n     given to the National Museum of the United States Air Force, \n     where it shall be displayed with the Doolittle Tokyo Raiders \n     Goblets, as appropriate, and made available for research.\n       (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the National Museum of the United States Air Force should \n     make the gold medal received under paragraph (1) available \n     for display elsewhere, particularly at other locations and \n     events associated with the Doolittle Tokyo Raiders.\n\n     SEC. 3. DUPLICATIVE MEDALS.\n\n       Under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the \n     Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of the \n     gold medal struck under this Act, at a price sufficient to \n     cover the costs of the medals, including labor, materials, \n     dyes, use of machinery, and overhead expenses.\n\n     SEC. 4. STATUS OF MEDALS.\n\n       (a) National Medals.--Medals struck pursuant to this Act \n     are national medals for purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, \n     United States Code.\n       (b) Numismatic Medals.--For purposes of sections 5134 and \n     5136 of title 31, United States Code, all medals struck under \n     this Act are numismatic items.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/19/senate-section/article/S8290-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AWARDING OF THE MEDAL OF HONOR\n\n  Mr. DONNELLY.
