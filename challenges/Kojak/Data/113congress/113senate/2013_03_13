Following leader remarks, the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the motion to proceed to H.R. 933, the continuing \nresolution legislation. Last night I filed cloture on a motion to \nproceed to this most important legislation. We are now in the midst of \nanother filibuster. If no agreement is reached, the cloture vote will \nbe tomorrow morning.\n\n\n                            The Ryan Budget\n\n  Mr. President, yesterday Americans got their first look at this \nyear's Ryan Republican budget. It turns out it looks like last year's \nRyan Republican budget. I wasn't the only one who said: Gee whiz, not \nagain.\n  Here is the headline from Bloomberg News:\n\n       Ryan Budget Replays Republican Hits.\n\n  One Washington Post reporter compared the release of the not-so-new \nand certainly not improved Ryan Republican budget to the movie \n``Groundhog Day,'' where Bill Murray relives his least favorite holiday \nover and over and over. Remember, this is the third Ryan Republican \nbudget.\n  This is what the Washington Post also wrote:\n\n       The unrepentant reprisal of the same fiscal vision that was \n     decisively repudiated last fall is bound to attract notice.\n\n  Indeed, this is the same budget plan we saw from Congressman Ryan \nlast year and the year before that. Even the name is the same. If \nanything, this new version is even more extreme than the last two Ryan \nRepublican budget proposals--proposals that sought to end the Medicare \nguarantee and raise taxes on middle-class families, all the while \nhanding out more tax breaks to the wealthy.\n  The Ryan Republican budget is anything but balanced, and it reflects \nthe same backward values Americans rejected in November. Instead of \nasking the wealthiest to contribute their fair share, the Ryan \nRepublican budget demands that middle-class families pay more in taxes. \nInstead of ending wasteful corporate tax loopholes, it basically ends \nMedicare. In fact, the Ryan Republican budget takes special aim at \nhealth care. It would eliminate free preventive health services for 34 \nmillion Americans. The Ryan Republican budget would increase \nprescription drug prices for seniors by $2.5 billion in 1 year. It \nwould end the coverage guarantees for 3.1 million young men and women \nwho are on their parents' health plans. The budget would end coverage \nfor mammograms, cervical cancer screenings, and contraception for more \nthan 47 million women and allow insurance companies to deny care for 17 \nmillion children simply because they were born with a heart defect or \nsome other illness. These drastic cuts will literally cost lives and \nalso jobs.\n  Instead of a balanced approach that protects the American economy, \nthe Ryan Republican budget guts education, medical research, \ninfrastructure, and even public safety. The Ryan Republican budget \nwould actually jeopardize the economic recovery; it wouldn't help it. \nAnd in case you are thinking such huge and painful cuts can buy an \nawful lot of deficit reduction, think again. Instead, Congressman \nRyan's cuts will buy more tax breaks for the wealthiest among us. This \nbudget isn't a serious attempt to\n\n[[Page S1718]]\n\nreduce the deficit. Meaningful deficit reduction will require shared \nsacrifice, including contributions from those who can best afford to \ncontribute to it.\n\n  Today, Budget Committee chairman Patty Murray will introduce a budget \nthat reflects the principle of balance. Senator Murray's plan, the \nDemocratic plan, will cut wasteful spending, reduce the deficit, and \nclose tax loopholes that benefit the rich, and it will invest in the \nthings that help our economy grow: education, preventive health care, \nworker training, and roads and bridges. It will invest in a strong \nmiddle class. And unlike the Ryan Republican plan, it won't leave you \nwondering if it is Groundhog Day all over again.\n  As things now stand, we are in the midst, as I indicated, of a \nfilibuster to even try to get on the bill. If we get on the bill \ntomorrow morning, then there will be 30 hours of waiting around, \nstaring at each other. I just alert everyone that we have an Easter \nrecess coming a week from Friday, and we are not going to be able to do \nthat. The budget has a locked-in amount of time, 50 hours, plus the \nvote-athon. So everyone should be prepared to change their plans for \nthe first few days--we hope it is the first few days--of the Easter \nrecess.\n  We are not even on this bill, and that is such a sad thing. I thought \nit was such a good atmosphere here. We had a bill at a decent time from \nthe House. As I indicated yesterday, I didn't like everything in that \nbill, but we had Senator Mikulski and Senator Shelby working together. \nThey checked in with me and Senator McConnell to let us know how they \nwere doing, and they did well on their own. They didn't need our help. \nThey came up with a plan that was fair and as balanced as could be \nunder the sequester situation, and it was bipartisan. The amendment \nthat is being filibustered is sponsored by Mikulski and Shelby. So this \nis a real shame.\n  I said last week when we were going on this bill that we would have \nopportunities for amendments. I hope we can get on the bill and have \nsome amendments offered, but each day that goes by--and we have wasted \n2 so far--we are unable to have the amendment process. We had yesterday \nwaiting all day for Harkin and Cruz because that is the first \nDemocratic amendment and the first Republican amendment. They are still \non deck, waiting to come whenever the umpire says we can go forward--\nthe umpire being one Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/13/senate-section/article/S1718-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, four years, four long years, that is \nhow long Kentuckians and Americans from coast to coast have had to wait \nfor Senate Democrats to perform their most basic of legislative \nresponsibilities.\n  Later today, we hope, that long wait will come to an end when they \nfinally release a budget plan.\n  Given what we have heard about that budget so far, it is obvious why \nthey refused to release one for so many years.\n  We hear it won't prevent programs such as Medicare from going \nbankrupt.\n  We hear it contains yet more wasteful ``stimulus'' spending, spending \nthat turns out to be a lot more effective at generating jokes for late-\nnight comedians than jobs.\n  And in order to finance more spending, we hear it relies on more than \n$1 trillion--that is trillion with a T--in new taxes, including on the \nmiddle class. Remember, Washington Democrats already got more than $600 \nbillion in taxes this year. So where is this new revenue going to come \nfrom, charities, the home mortgage interest deduction? Will they go \nafter families and small businesses yet again?\n  At least there is one thing we almost certainly know: their budget \nwill never balance--not today, not tomorrow, not ever.\n  If that was my vision for the country, frankly I would want to hide \nit from the American people too.\n  Look, a budget like that would be a disaster for our country. It \nwould betray those who are going to need Medicare when they retire.\n  It would betray the younger Americans who would be forced to grapple \nwith the consequences of Democrats' failure to get serious about the \ndebt.\n  It would betray the hard-working middle-class families that simply \ncan't afford higher taxes, especially in the Obama economy.\n  And if that is really the kind of budget Senate Democrats plan to \noffer, it would sacrifice Americans' hopes for sustained economic \nrecovery at the altar of higher taxes and bloated, unaccountable \ngovernment.\n  It would also draw an important contrast with the budget Republicans \nput forward yesterday.\n  Because here is the thing: Republicans believe we should be growing \nthe economy, not the government--and the House Republican budget \nreflects just those priorities.\n  It is a budget that does something else too; it actually balances.\n  That is important for a number of reasons, not the least of which is \nthat it would help unleash economic growth and bring down our country's \nmassive debt load. Interest payments on the national debt alone are set \nto exceed everything we spend on defense in just a few years' time, so \nthe path we are on clearly is not a sustainable one.\n  With that in mind, I hope Democrats offer something serious today. I \nhope they face up to the fact that they already got the revenue they \nare going to get. So that they can start dealing with the real issues \nthat are leading us to fiscal ruin.\n  And I hope they will finally stop trying to shield the Washington \nestablishment from every single attempt to inject a little \naccountability and reform, because if the reports I have seen are \ncorrect, the budget they plan to offer would do none of these things. \nIt would only speed up the dangerous trajectory we are on rather than \nchange it; entrench government waste and cronyism rather than root it \nout; and make things worse for the families we represent rather than \ngive them hope. Hope is something the American people really need right \nnow. They have been battered by the President's economy. They are tired \nof seeing their money wasted on an endless labyrinth of self-\nperpetuating bureaucracy.\n  So I am calling on my Democratic friends to shelve the extremist \nliberal budget we have been hearing so much about. Let's get serious \nhere and start doing the things necessary to make government more \nefficient, more pro-growth, more responsive, and more compassionate--in \nother words, enact the same priorities Republicans have and, frankly, \nthe priorities many of our constituents have too.\n  After 4 long years, Senate Democrats should be willing to do more \nthan just protect their buddies in government at all costs--to offer \nAmericans something better than a budget that would expand the IRS and \ncrush the middle class.\n  The American people deserve better than that. Haven't they waited \nlong enough already for true growth-oriented reform?\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/13/senate-section/article/S1718-3", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wanted to make a few comments. We have \nfinished our analysis of this bill. The bill has 587 pages and spends \nwell over $1 trillion. We finished at 9 p.m. last\n\n[[Page S1719]]\n\nnight. We have no objection to moving to the bill through a fair and \nopen process. We will be happy to submit our ideas to the chairman and \nranking member of the Appropriations Committee. There is a lot we ought \nto discuss about this bill. However, there is no attempt to filibuster \nthe bill. There was an attempt to do our job, which was to actually \nread the bill and see what is in it so we would be prepared to offer \nconstructive criticisms to the bill.\n  With that, I leave and I will be back on the floor in a little bit \nwhen the managers of the bill come to the floor. If they want to offer \namendments and ask unanimous consent to move on to the bill, I am sure \nthere will be no objection.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I respect my friend from Arizona. He is my \nfriend, and we have worked together on a bipartisan basis. I respect \nhis right as a Senator and his responsibility as a Senator to speak on \nissues that he thinks are important to our Nation and his home State as \nwell as to offer amendments if that is the appropriate approach he \nwants to use. However, we have wasted a day. We lost a day in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Yesterday was the day to begin the amendment process and we could \nnot. Senators objected to our coming to this process and even offering \nan amendment on the continuing resolution, which is the Federal budget \nfor the remainder of this year; in other words, until September 30. We \nknow we are just days away from the continuing resolution expiring. We \ndon't want the government to shut down; we do want to fund the \ngovernment. We understand there must be spending cuts and there is a \nhealthy difference of opinion on where those cuts should be made. The \nSenator from Arizona was on the floor yesterday and we spoke of this.\n  One aspect of this bill, which I wish to address for a moment, is the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations. This is a new responsibility \nwhich I have on the Senate Appropriations Committee, and it is an \nawesome responsibility. Not only are we dealing with the security of \nthe United States of America, first and foremost, we are dealing with a \nmassive spending bill. This is larger than any other spending bill in \nthe Federal Government.\n  Last week the House of Representatives passed a continuing resolution \nwhich covers the Department of Defense for the remainder of this year. \nMany changes are included in there, but that was done along with the \nmilitary construction budget and the Veterans Administration budget. \nThat was all finished last week. It was all sent to us by the House \nlast week ready for us to address it if we cared to.\n  Well, we had that chance yesterday, and we didn't do it. Now we have \nanother chance today, and we should take it. We have a lot to do in a \nlimited amount of time. We have this week and the next to accomplish \nnot only the passage of this Federal budget for the remainder of this \nyear but also next week we will begin consideration of a budget \nresolution for spending in the next fiscal year. Those are two awesome \nresponsibilities back to back and up against the Easter recess.\n  Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader, has come to the \nfloor expressing some frustration. He wanted to move on this continuing \nresolution this week--as early as yesterday--and give Members an \nopportunity to offer amendments. There were several Members who stepped \nforward prepared to do so, but there was a stop. There was a hold.\n  I understand the Senator from Oklahoma--and I believe my friend from \nArizona may echo his remarks--is prepared to not stand in the way of \nany of the amendments. If Members wish to offer amendments, they can do \nso, and I hope they will.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, could I ask my friend a question while he \nis on that subject?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask permission to engage in a dialogue \nwith my friend from Arizona.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to my friend from Illinois that there is no further \nobjection. The Senator from Oklahoma and I have reviewed the bill and \nyesterday we discussed its length and our obligations. I promise to my \nfriend from Illinois that we will not rehash that discussion we had. We \nhave no objection whatsoever to taking up amendments right now and \nmoving forward with that. I hope that is perfectly clear to all \nMembers. Very frankly, I am eager to move forward.\n  I will mention to my friend from Illinois that I appreciate the new \nresponsibilities he has. I appreciate the responsibilities he has \naddressing, as he just said, the largest single part of our \nappropriations bill which is in the Defense authorization. During the \nintervening time we had requested, I came up with, for example, $65 \nmillion for Pacific coast salmon restorations for States, which \nincludes Nevada. We are going to restore salmon restoration in the \nState of Nevada?\n  Also listed here is the Department of Defense to overpay contracts by \nan additional 5 percent--totaling $15 million--for Native Hawaiian-\nowned companies. I would be glad to include this long list for the \nRecord.\n  There is a request for $993,000 in grants to dig private wells for \nprivate property owners; $10 million for USDA high-energy cost grant \nprogram to go to subsidize electricity bills in Alaska and Hawaii; $5.9 \nmillion for economic impact initiative grants. The list goes on and on.\n  I say to my friend from Illinois that we were trying to examine this \nlegislation--the 587 pages or whatever it is--to find this sort of \nissue. It is our obligation to do so. We have found these things, and \nwe are still finding additional elements.\n  I see my old friend, the distinguished majority leader, on the floor. \nWe are ready to move forward with amendments. I was saying to my friend \nfrom Illinois that we found numerous additional provisions in this \nlegislation that we think are important for debate and discussion. I \nwon't go through all of them, but some of the items include $120 \nmillion for Guam; $5 million for the National Guard STARBASE Youth \nProgram; $154 million for alternative energy resource. It goes on and \non. In the meantime we have ships that cannot deport, planes that \ncannot fly, and men and women we cannot train and equip. Yet we have \nthis kind of stuff on the appropriations bills.\n  I want to share with my colleagues that the Senator from Oklahoma and \nI finished examining this bill yesterday. We are prepared with \namendments and moving forward with vigorous debate. If there was any \nmisunderstanding about that, I apologize to the majority leader and my \nfriend from Illinois.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I said yesterday on the floor, I have \nnothing but the highest respect for my friend from Arizona. I know he \nlooks into things very deeply, and I appreciate his peacemaking. Even \nthough he is a famous man in America and the world because of his \nwartime experiences, he is also a peacemaker, and I am grateful for \nthat.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion to proceed be \nagreed to.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/13/senate-section/article/S1719-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1719-S1782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS, AND \n             FULL-YEAR CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2013\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Again, I \napologize to all my colleagues if we held up this legislation, but we \ndid want time to examine this legislation as we had previously \nrequested. I thank my colleagues and look forward to moving forward \nwith amendments. The Senator from Oklahoma and I are prepared with \namendments whenever they are in order.\n  I thank my friend from Illinois, and I appreciate the enormous \nresponsibility he has in his new position.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Arizona as well. \nI think we have a rare moment of peacemaking and harmony in the Senate. \nIt may not last for long, so I want to speak while we have that moment \nand say for the Record that I don't dispute any of the statements made \nby the Senator from Arizona nor do I question his right to do so, \nincluding his responsibility to raise questions about spending.\n  We are at a time when we are cutting spending right and left--even at \nthe Department of Defense. I do want to put on record the following: \nThis bill, which we are considering as it relates to the Department of \nDefense in its entirety, is the bill that was passed by the House \nRepublican majority. This is not a bill which was written on this side \nof the Rotunda. We have received it. That doesn't mean we should not \nask questions about what the House did, but I don't want to be assigned \nthe blame or asked to take responsibility for provisions which I did \nnot author. We took the House version and brought it to the floor in an \neffort to get this moving in an expedited manner.\n  I know some of the questions the Senator from Arizona has raised are \nnot new. There was a longstanding debate here in the Senate about \nwhether to expand the notion of minority contracting to include Native \nAlaskans and Native Hawaiians. Understandably, Senator Stevens of \nAlaska, who chaired the subcommittee for a long time, and Senator \nInouye, who also chaired the subcommittee--and unfortunately he passed \naway just a few weeks ago--believed that the minority status for \ncontracting should include their native tribes people. They fought for \nit, and it was included. I know the Senator from Arizona perhaps took \nexception to that and debated with them. To renew that debate is \nperfectly appropriate, but it is not a new provision in the bill. It is \nsomething that has been there for some time. I welcome the debate. I \nthink it is a fulsome debate and an important one, but I wanted to say \nthat for the Record.\n  This is the House Republican bill and the measures which the Senator \nfrom Arizona addressed have been debated for a lengthy period of time. \nSome issues that were raised are new to me. I have to look more \nclosely--and I should--to find out the merits of the provisions.\n  Before we go any further with that, I----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, could I briefly respond?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if I could ask any time that we use from \nnow until the managers arrive on the floor be for debate only. I ask \nunanimous consent for that purpose.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I say to my friend I had no assurance that \nwhat came from the House--the defense portion of this bill--was going \nto be ``preconferenced,'' and that it was going to be the final bill. \nSo to expect for me to honestly examine the House-passed bill without \nknowing what the disposition of it would be on the Senate side is a \nlittle much. During the intervening time, the Senator from Oklahoma and \nI have found items in this bill that have nothing to do with the \ndefense bill. For example, $65 million for Pacific coast salmon \nrestoration for States including Nevada. I know there are rivers \ncoursing through Nevada all the way to the Pacific Ocean, but the point \nis there is $993,000 in grants to dig private wells for private \nproperty owners.\n  We have a list of provisions which we were able to uncover which we \nfind controversial and should be open for debate and discussion. But it \nis over, and we are moving forward.\n  I hope the Senators whose amendments have just been made and ordered \nwill come to the floor so we can debate and vote.\n  I thank the Senator from Illinois, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I see my friend and colleague from the State of Rhode \nIsland, who serves on the Defense Appropriations Committee as well as \nthe Armed Services Committee, and I will yield to him next.\n  I do want to say a word about the Department of Defense appropriation \ncontained in this bill. This act provides $604.9 billion, including \n$87.2 billion for overseas contingency operations. That is a reduction \nfrom the 2012 level of $633.2 billion. There were no changes in the \nbill that passed the House last week. The bill fully complies with the \nspending caps in the Budget Control Act. It contains no Member-\nrequested earmarks in compliance with the earmark moratorium. Congress \nhas cut the defense budget to find programs which we believe are \nexcessive to accommodate scheduling delays, budget errors, and unspent \nfunds.\n\n  The bill includes 671 cuts to programs in the budget request that \nhave funds that are not needed for the remaining 6\\1/2\\ months of the \nyear. I believe everyone should agree with the notion that if we are \ngoing to replicate last year's budget--for goodness' sake, we are not \ngoing to build the same ship twice, so we are trying to avoid those \nobvious misappropriations and waste of Federal tax dollars.\n  The bill also rescinds $4 billion in unspent prior-year \nappropriations for 87 programs that have been delayed or terminated.\n  There has been talk in the press that the Defense appropriations bill \nincluded here gives an advantage to the Pentagon when it comes to \nsequestration, but that is not true. Until this bill is enacted, the \nDefense Department is dealing with two challenges: sequestration and \nthe threat of defense being under a full-year continuing resolution for \nthe first time in our Nation's history.\n  This bill does nothing about sequestration. Nearly $42 billion in \ndefense cuts have already been ordered by the President, and this bill \ndoes not change that at all.\n  Some people think the Defense Department is being afforded special \ntreatment in being able to transfer money to deal with sequestration. \nIn fact, this bill keeps a tight rein on the Pentagon's transfer \nauthorities. The bill actually provides less transfer authority than \nwhat the Defense Department requested in February of 2012.\n  The Defense Department asks for $5 billion in general transfer \nauthority. The bill allows $4 billion. The Defense Department asks for \n$4 billion in transfer authority for overseas contingency accounts. The \nbill provides $3.5 billion. All these transfer authorities are subject \nto congressional approval processes.\n\n[[Page S1721]]\n\n  The perception that this bill gives the Pentagon excessive \nflexibility to deal with sequestration is not correct.\n  The other challenge facing the Department of Defense is the threat of \na year-long continuing resolution if we fail to pass this bill--a bill \nthat would do nothing more than extend the authority of last year's \nspending bill. Some of the Department's most pressing fiscal challenges \nrelate to trying to live in today's world using last year's budget. \nPassing a defense bill will give the Pentagon relief from the threat of \nliving under a full-year continuing resolution for the very first time. \nBut that is not because of flexibility, that is because an \nappropriations bill is a better steward of taxpayer dollars than a \ncontinuing resolution.\n  Here are five reasons why a continuing resolution would be harmful to \nour national defense: Readiness. Readiness is the way to measure \nwhether our troops are properly trained and equipped to do their \nmission. Under last year's funding bill, operation and maintenance \naccounts would be underfunded by $11 billion. In other words, if we \njust took last year's bill, we would be short $11 billion in preparing \nour troops for battle. I will tell my colleagues that these operations \nand maintenance accounts which result in readiness training mean \nsurvivability for our men and women in uniform. It is that basic. That \ndirectly translates into less training, if we don't do something about \nit, and delayed repair of equipment. Every member of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff has warned us that readiness is on the verge of plummeting \nbecause of fiscal uncertainty. That is disgraceful and unacceptable. \nOnce readiness goes down, it takes years to rebuild it.\n  Spending on unneeded programs is also a concern. Continuing last \nyear's bill would fund $17 billion worth of programs that are no longer \nneeded--specifically 31 programs that have ended.\n  For example, a continuing resolution would provide $2.6 billion for \nMRAP armored vehicles. The Pentagon has already bought these vehicles, \nand with our troops beginning to draw away from Afghanistan, we don't \nneed more at this moment. This bill would not provide funds for \nunneeded programs such as this.\n  Third, no new starts or multiyear authority. A simple extension of \nlast year's bill would extend the prohibition on new programs and \nmultiyear contract authority. A multiyear contract must be specifically \nauthorized by law and only when the government would save approximately \n10 percent compared to buying each year's requirements.\n  If this authority is not provided, the taxpayers stand to lose $150 \nmillion in cost savings for the V-22 Osprey and as much as $373 million \nin savings on the Army's Chinook helicopter. To put that in simple \nterms, if we can enter into multiyear contracting and get discounts on \nwhat we will need in the future, it is in the best interests of our \nnational defense and the taxpayers. Losing that multiyear contracting \nresults in the opposite. We overpay for things we know we will not \nneed.\n  When the government needs to be finding ways to make taxpayer dollars \nstretch further, a simple extension would require the government to \nturn away from cost savings that have already been negotiated.\n  On the fourth point, shortfalls will go unaddressed. There is a long \nlist of shortfalls in the defense budget that are not controversial but \nwouldn't be fixed by a continuing resolution. Here are just a few \nexamples we are considering: $1.5 billion for National Guard equipment; \n$2.3 billion for ship operations; $271 million to close the shortfall \nin TRICARE health care programs; $211 million added for the Iron Dome \nmissile defense program that protects Israeli cities from short-range \nrockets.\n  The President of the United States visited us yesterday for lunch and \ntalked about his upcoming trip to the Middle East to meet with our \nallies in Israel. I will tell my colleagues the President, as well as \nthe leaders in Israel, know how important the Iron Dome missile defense \nprogram is and we should not shortchange it.\n\n  Another example: $45 million is added to focus intelligence efforts \non finding Joseph Kony, the notorious leader of the Lord's Resistance \nArmy in Uganda.\n  I recently visited Africa. I have been in the field with our troops \nwho are stalking this man and they will find him. He is a notorious \nmurderer. The President has said we will put an end to his reign of \nterror and we will. This bill, the bill we are considering, will \nprovide the funds to finish that.\n  Let me summarize by saying this bill is a compromise solution that \nmeets budget caps, does not unfairly help the Department of Defense \ncompared to other agencies. It eliminates wasteful and unneeded \nspending, lowers the risk to readiness and the threat of a hollow \nforce, takes care of our troops and their families, and addresses the \npriorities of our national defense.\n  I will not quibble or argue with my colleague from Arizona or any \nother colleagues. If there are provisions in the House bill--which is \nincluded here in its entirety--that need to be challenged, addressed, \ndebated or changed, so be it. That is why we are here. But we are \nstarting with this and with the good intention of finding funds for the \nDepartment of Defense in very challenging times.\n  I yield the floor to my friend from Rhode Island.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, first, let me commend the Senator from \nIllinois for a very thoughtful statement about the pending \nappropriations bill, particularly with respect to the funding of the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  I wish to spend a moment to talk about another looming issue that is \nbeyond appropriations but is rapidly approaching.\n  In June of last year, as we commemorated the 40th anniversary of \nlegislation to establish the Pell Grant Program, we narrowly averted a \ndoubling of the interest rate on need-based student loans.\n  Back in January of 2012, Congressman Courtney and I introduced \nlegislation to permanently extend the 3.4-percent interest rate that \nhas helped make college loans more affordable for millions of students \nacross the country. But my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \ninstead voted for budgets that effectively called for the doubling of \nthe rate. They did this at a time when students are struggling--and I \nwill point out some of the difficulties we face--at a time when college \ncosts are increasing and at a time when college is becoming more and \nmore essential for obtaining any type of long-term, stable employment \nand ability to contribute to the continued economic growth of the \ncountry.\n  It took thousands of calls and letters and rallies from students and \nparents across the country and President Obama himself getting involved \nin this issue to bring everyone to the table to negotiate. However, we \nwere only able to get a temporary, short-term fix. Essentially, we were \nable to keep the interest rate at 3.4 percent but only until July 1 of \nthis year. Interest rates will again double then on these need-based \nloans unless we act.\n  One of the other ironies, of course, is that even at 3.4 percent, \nthat is a substantial interest payment at a time when Federal fund \nrates are closer to 1 percent and when large financial institutions can \nborrow at these very low rates, et cetera. So given that factor also, \nit is essential we once again respond, prior to July 1, to the \nanticipated doubling of the student loan rate.\n  Now is the time to develop not just a short-term solution but a long-\nterm solution to this growing burden of student loan debt, the rising \ncost of college, and the need to improve higher education outcomes so \nstudents complete their degrees and get the full benefit of their \ninvestment in education and we get the benefit as a society and as an \neconomy of their education.\n  Everyone agrees college costs are too high and are climbing higher. \nThere has to be real reform by higher education in terms of the way \nthey deliver services. They cannot continue to pass on increased costs. \nIf that continues to happen, families will be priced out of a college \neducation, even with our grants and loans; so we have to do something.\n  Student loan debt is the next big financial crisis we are facing. \nEven if we act now, we are looking at some very sobering statistics \nabout the growth of student loan debt already. That should prompt, \nagain, action now to prevent the doubling of the interest rate and \nlonger term action to control the costs of higher education and the \nability of families to respond to those costs.\n\n[[Page S1722]]\n\n  Student loan debt continued to rise throughout the recession. In \nfact, one of the ironies of the recession is people can't find jobs; \nthey are going back to college to get more training and sometimes they \nare going back to college because that is what they can do. So the \nirony, of course, is we are adding to the student debt. In fact, today, \nstudent loan debt is the second largest outstanding balance after \nmortgage debt. It eclipses credit card debt. It is the second largest \noutstanding balance in our economy behind mortgage debt. Borrowers are \nstruggling under that debt.\n  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York recently reported that 17 \npercent of student loan borrowers are more than 90 days past due on \ntheir payments--a large increase from under 10 percent in 2004. So in \nroughly a decade, we have seen an increasing amount of students unable \nto shoulder the burden of their debt. Even worse, if we consider that \n44 percent of student loan borrowers are not in repayment--these are \npeople who statutorily don't have to start paying--the effective \ndelinquency rate rises to more than 30 percent. That is stunning.\n  This is affecting also the lives of these young people at a time when \nthey are beginning to establish or are hoping to establish households. \nA recent Pew Research Center survey illustrates what is happening. As \nthe percentage of young adult households with student loan debt climbed \nfrom 34 percent in 2007 to 40 percent in 2010--again, a huge increase \nin debt--the share of younger households owning their home has declined \nsharply from 40 percent in 2007 to 34 percent in 2011. Home ownership, \nwhich is one of but not the only measure of the American dream, is also \none of the strongest supports of the American economy, but it is \nrapidly being priced out of the reach of young students because of \ntheir student debt. They literally can't qualify for mortgages.\n  Car ownership shows a similar trend. In 2007, 73 percent of \nhouseholds headed by young adults owned or leased at least one vehicle. \nBy 2011, that figure dropped to 66 percent.\n  Students are caught literally between a rock and a hard place. Huge \nfinancial debts for their college education prevent them from buying \nhomes, buying cars, and prevent this economy from growing as it has in \nthe past because of new households, young households coming into the \nmarketplace, buying homes and buying cars and starting families.\n  We can't do away with education. It is more important each day in a \nglobal economy. We have to deal with this issue of rising costs. The \ncost of attending college has increased by more than 550 percent since \n1985. Let me repeat that: 550 percent. That is rising faster than \ngasoline, health care, and other consumer items. It is skyrocketing. \nAgain, the universities, the colleges, education leaders at every \nlevel--Federal, State, and local--have to begin to respond to this \nrising cost of education. But keeping student loans affordable and \ninterest rates low is one part of the solution, particularly this \nimmediate crisis facing us by\nJuly 1.\n\n  The Federal Government should price student loans based on our actual \ncosts of operating the student loan programs. We should set the student \nloan interest rates in a way that minimizes the cost for students while \ncovering most of the cost for the taxpayer. The Federal Government \nprovides student loans to increase the number of Americans who can \nobtain college degrees. We do not and should not run these programs to \ngenerate revenue. They should be to increase the capital--the human \ncapital--of our country. I plan to introduce legislation to set student \nloan interest rates based on the principles of keeping costs low for \nboth students and taxpayers.\n  Providing more grant aid through Pell grants and other programs is \nanother way to tackle these college costs. However, if college costs \ncontinue to rise at the current rate, students relying on the Pell \ngrant will continue to lose ground. We need States and institutions to \npartner with us to make college affordable. Again, it has to be a \ncooperative effort.\n  With respect to the Pell grant, I have talked about the loans, but \nthe Pell grant is just an outright grant of funds to the student \nwithout the need to repay. It was for a long time the backbone of our \nFederal support to students in college and families trying to put their \nchildren through college.\n  In 1976 the Pell grant maximum was $1,400. That was enough to cover \n72 percent of the cost of attendance at a public 4-year college. In \nfact, in those good old days, with a Pell grant and a summer job and a \nlittle help, you were usually able to emerge from college after 4 years \nwithout a huge debt, and you could start your family and buy your car \nat a younger age.\n  In 2010 the maximum Pell grant was increased to $5,550, but that is \nonly enough to cover 34 percent of the cost of attendance at a public \n4-year college.\n  In my State, we have been particularly hard hit by this recession and \neconomic downturn, and students and families are feeling this pressure \nof increased tuition and higher fees at schools and colleges acutely. \nThey need these resources, and we have to ensure that they get these \nresources.\n  As I indicated, I am planning to introduce legislation to strengthen \nour higher education system and student aid programs by reestablishing \na strong Federal-university-State partnership for college access and \naffordability and by requiring institutions to assume more of the risk \nin the student loan programs and to do so in a way that I think will \nvindicate our best principles and our soundest economic rationale.\n  I look forward to working with Chairman Harkin. He has been a leader \non these issues for so many years, both as the chairman of the HELP \nCommittee and chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee. We want to \nstart by preventing, obviously, the doubling of student loans by July \n1. That is step 1, but it cannot be the last step.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I come to the floor on the 1,414th day \nsince the Senate has passed a budget and on a day where, amazingly, the \nPresident of the United States is reported to have said: ``We don't \nhave an immediate crisis in terms of [our] debt.''\n  Well, we do have a debt crisis that threatens both future \ngenerations--because somebody is going to have to pay that debt back, \nand thanks to abnormally low interest rates, right now they are not \nspiraling out of control, but if interests rates were to return to \nhistoric norms, I believe for each additional percentage point in \ninterest we would have to pay on our national debt, it would result in \nroughly $1.7 trillion more we would have to pay back. So in many ways \nthe United States is lucky, even though we are on the brink of what \nscholars such as Reinhart and Rogoff have said--we are on the precipice \nof a debt crisis because once interest rates begin to rise, the \ncreditors lose confidence in our ability to repay that debt, and our \neconomy spins out of control, resulting not only in a severe recession \nor worse but also harm to some of the most vulnerable people in our \nsociety who depend on the safety net that government provides.\n  It is also, in a debt crisis, impossible for the Federal Government \nto do what it must do in terms of national security. Indeed, that is \nwhat led the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mike Mullen, \nto say that the single greatest threat to our national security is our \ndebt. And it keeps getting worse and worse because the President seems \nunwilling to deal with the obvious and to enter into what he likes to \ncall the grand bargain but one that can only occur if the President is \nwilling to talk about the entire economy and not just raise taxes.\n  The President has said that we must embrace a balanced approach to \ndeficit reduction. Of course, reasonable people can disagree on what a \nbalanced approach looks like, but we all know what a balanced budget \nlooks like.\n  Yesterday morning House Republicans released a plan that balances the \nFederal budget over the next 10 years. We still do not have the \nPresident's proposed budget even though it was due on February 4, and \nwe are now advised that we may not see the President's own proposed \nbudget until sometime in April, which, coincidentally, is after the \ntime that the House and the\n\n[[Page S1723]]\n\nSenate will act on their proposed budgets. It seems once again that the \nPresident has taken to leading from behind.\n  For that matter, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney has told us \nthat the President's proposed budget will not even try to balance the \nbudget but, instead, put us on what he calls a ``fiscally sustainable \npath.'' But that cannot be true. Unless the Federal Government adopts \nserious reforms to Medicare and Social Security, mandatory spending \nprograms which occupy roughly 61 percent of all Federal spending--the \nkinds of reforms the President has constantly rejected--we cannot put \nour country on a fiscally sustainable path by definition.\n  As the President knows because his own bipartisan fiscal commission \ntold him so in December 2010, to save Medicare we must make structural \nchanges that ensure the program will be affordable over the long term. \nI do not know any young person the age of my two daughters--30 and 31--\nwho actually believes Medicare and Social Security are going to be \nthere for them when they retire. They simply do not believe it because \nthey see the irresponsibility of the present generation in not only \nracking up bills they are going to have to end up paying, they are \nseeing us do nothing to address the fiscally unsustainable path for \nMedicare and Social Security.\n\n  Any of us who have studied the problem understand what the problem is \nwith the Medicare system. Right now, an average couple will put, let's \nsay, $1 in the Medicare trust fund for every $3 they will ultimately \ntake out of it. This is not a pay-as-you-go system by any means, as \nopposed to Social Security, where basically you will get $1 out for \nevery $1 you put in Social Security--but not Medicare because of its \nunique problems.\n  The current Medicare system incentivizes quantity over quality, and \nits price controls distort the entire health care market. In my State, \nin Texas, about one-third of the doctors will not even take a new \nMedicare patient because of government price controls that basically \nprovide compensation to them roughly one-third less than what private \nhealth insurance plans would provide. Expanding those price controls, \nas the President has proposed, would only make Medicare's problems \nworse.\n  For all the challenges Medicare has, Medicaid--which is designed to \nprovide health care to low-income Americans--is even worse in terms of \nthe compensation provided to medical providers, hospitals, and doctors, \nand so many of them simply will not take Medicaid patients, leaving \nMedicaid-eligible beneficiaries ``coverage'' but no access in many \ninstances.\n  By restructuring the Medicare Program and increasing competition, we \ncan hold down cost growth in Medicare and make it available not only to \nthe present generation of seniors but also to future generations of \nseniors. That is the sort of serious issue that is not going to go away \nthat the Senate budget should deal with.\n  It should also provide a framework for sensible Tax Code reform. We \nall know the Tax Code is way too complicated. We also know it is \nriddled with tax credits, deductions, credits--what the Simpson-Bowles \nCommission called tax expenditures. Yet the President does not want to \neliminate those tax deductions, credits, and expenditures for the \npurpose of reforming the Tax Code, bringing down marginal tax rates not \nonly for businesses and individuals, he wants to use it to raise taxes \nagain.\n  There is a bipartisan consensus, however, that tax reform should \nlower the rates and broaden the base. Indeed, those are the \nrecommendations of the Bowles-Simpson Commission and the Domenici-\nRivlin panel as well. But, as I said, the President wants to use what \nhe calls tax reform as a Trojan horse to raise taxes again. He argues \nthat we will not have a balanced approach to deficit reduction unless \nwe pass another massive tax hike, and that is after the President \nraised taxes by $600 billion in January.\n  From what I understand, our friends across the aisle--Senator Murray, \nas the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee--are about to unveil a \nbudget proposal that would raise taxes again by at least $1 trillion.\n  I realize that if you think government is the answer to almost every \nquestion that comes up in America today, you are going to need bigger \ngovernment, more intrusive government, funded by higher tax revenue. \nBut they seem to be forgetting a few things. First of all, the \nCongressional Budget Office tells us that Federal tax revenues in 2014 \nare already projected to exceed the historical average. Secondly, the \nPresident's health care law, ObamaCare, already contains another \ntrillion-dollar tax increase that is discouraging job creation and \nhurting our economy. Finally, as I pointed out, Democrats in this body \nalready got a $600 billion tax increase earlier this year, while hard-\nworking Americans--the middle class in America--got a tax increase with \nthe return of the payroll tax.\n  By my view, no one should be talking about another tax increase until \nthe Federal Government quits wasting so much taxpayer money. My \ncolleague from Oklahoma, Senator Coburn, who was just on the Senate \nfloor, has singlehandedly worked tirelessly to expose frivolous and \nunnecessary spending, and the numbers are remarkable. For example, when \nSenator Coburn asked the Government Accountability Office to \ninvestigate how much Federal spending was duplicative, the Government \nAccountability Office found that more than $364 billion of duplicative \nspending existed. And the President wants to close down tours at the \nWhite House because of the budget sequester. Give me a break.\n  How can anyone support another massive tax increase when the Federal \nGovernment is literally spending hundreds of billions of dollars on \nredundant services? For that matter, how can anyone support another \nmassive tax increase when we are spending nearly $15 million each year \nto give millionaires unemployment checks? How can anyone support \nanother massive tax increase when we are spending $\\1/2\\ million on \nshampoo products for dogs and cats? That is your Federal Government at \nwork for you. How can anyone support another massive tax increase when \nwe are spending $181,000 studying the effects of cocaine on Japanese \nquail? I know these sound ridiculous to the extreme, but that is the \nwhole point. The Federal Government is littered with spending that we \nsimply do not need, and yet, rather than do something about that, our \nfriends across the aisle want to raise taxes once again, along with the \nPresident of the United States.\n  No one said cutting spending or reforming entitlement programs or \noverhauling our Tax Code would be easy. But if the President truly \nwants a balanced approach to our fiscal and economic challenges, he \nwill stop leading from behind and start leading from the front.\n  I am shocked the President would say in an interview with Jon Karl, \nABC News, that there is no immediate crisis in terms of the debt. What \nhe might be forgetting is what economists tell us: When the debt gets \nso large, it retards economic growth. Forget the debt crisis part. That \nhas an immediate impact on job creation in America.\n  We are all wondering why the recovery from the recession of 2008 has \nbeen the slowest since the Great Depression. Well, one reason is people \nare worried about tax rates going up because they see debt upon debt \nbeing piled up. They are sitting on the sidelines waiting to see what \nis going to happen. They are also experiencing additional costs in \nterms of health care, when they were told by the President back in \n2008-2009 if we passed ObamaCare, the average family would see a \nreduction in their health insurance premiums by $2,500. They were also \ntold a lot of other things, such as if you like what you have, you can \nkeep it. That did not end up being true either.\n  The President needs to listen to his own experts, such as the \nbipartisan fiscal commission he himself appointed. Not only do we risk \na debt crisis if we do not deal with the $16.5 trillion debt we have if \ninterest rates were to go up, it is having an immediate impact on \nunemployment. More than 20 million people in this country are either \nout of work or working part time and want to work full time. That ought \nto be enough to get the President to act.\n  Should he choose to act, should he choose to lead, we will be happy \nto meet him halfway to deal with the single most important issue facing \nthe\n\n[[Page S1724]]\n\ncountry today. But it starts with passing a budget, something Senate \nDemocrats have not done for 1,414 days.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, thanks to the cordiality and \ncooperation of Members on both sides of the aisle, but particularly \nthose who initially had an objection to us going forward, we now can \nmove forward. We are waiting for the junior Senator from Texas, Mr. \nCruz, to come to the floor. He will be offering the first amendment. As \nsoon as he gets here, we are off and running.\n  I am going to thank everybody for getting us to this point: Senator \nShelby for working with me on the bill, Senators Reid and McConnell, \nand particularly now Senators McCain and Coburn. We have a way of \naddressing their concerns. So we are ready. We are waiting for the \nSenator.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 30 to Amendment No. 26\n\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cruz], for himself, Mr. Lee, \n     Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Paul, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Johnson of \n     Wisconsin, Mr. Risch, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Scott, Mr. \n     Heller, Mr. Toomey, and Mr. Johanns, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 30 to amendment No. 26.\n\n  Mr. CRUZ. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds to carry out the Patient \n                  Protection and Affordable Care Act)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. PROHIBITION ON FUNDING.\n\n       None of the funds made available in this Act may be used--\n       (1) to carry out any provision of the Patient Protection \n     and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148) or title I or \n     subtitle B of title II of the Health Care and Education \n     Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-152), or the \n     amendments made by such Act, title, or subtitle; or\n       (2) for rulemaking under such Act, title, or subtitle.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I rise to deliver my first official speech \non the floor of the Senate on an issue which I believe is the most \nurgent issue facing the country; namely, the dire need to restore \neconomic growth to our Nation.\n  I will note at the outset this is the second opportunity I have had \nto speak on the Senate floor. The first was last week during the \nhistoric filibuster led by the junior Senator from Kentucky for nearly \n13 hours.\n  I will note a particular debt of gratitude I owe to Senator Paul. The \nvery first time I spoke on this floor was in a colloquy with Senator \nPaul. I had the opportunity to read Travis's letter from the Alamo, to \nread Shakespeare's ``St. Crispin's Day Speech,'' to read the opening \nmonolog from ``Patton,'' and to read Ronald Reagan's 1964 speech, ``A \nTime to Choose.'' This is a debt I will always owe Senator Paul. As \nthey say in the beer commercial: ``It don't get no better than that.''\n  Sadly, I promise my colleagues in the rest of my tenure, I am \nconfident we will not have an opportunity to rival those glorious words \nWilliam Barret Travis penned as he was standing for principle 177 years \nago.\n  This being said, the topic of the day is, in my judgment, a topic of \nexceptional importance. Every elected Member of Congress, whether \nRepublican or Democratic, should have as their very first priority \nrestoring economic growth in this country. In the last 4 years we have \nseen stagnant growth. In the last 4 years our economy has averaged 0.8 \npercent growth each year. To put that in context, this is a fraction of \nhistorical levels. Since World War II, our economy has enjoyed 3.3 \npercent growth per year.\n  Last quarter the economy was struggling along and grew 0.1 percent. \nIt was effectively stagnant.\n  If we want to solve the great many fiscal and economic challenges \nfacing this country, growth is the critical precondition. If we want \nthe 23 million people who are struggling to find jobs to get back to \nwork--and I know every one of us wants those 23 million people to get \nback to work--we must restore economic growth. If we want to turn \naround the train wreck which is the balance sheet of the Federal \nGovernment, our perennial recurring deficits and debts, this can't be \ndone without restoring growth.\n  In my view we should be working across the aisle in a bipartisan way \nto focus on bringing growth back. This should be our No. 1 priority. \nGiven that, the purpose of this amendment is to advance economic growth \nand, in particular, to delay funding of ObamaCare until economic growth \nreturns.\n  Let me be clear. In my view ObamaCare should be repealed in its \nentirety, which was the very first bill I introduced in the Senate. At \na minimum, in my judgment, ObamaCare should not be funded and \nimplemented at a time when our economy is gasping for breath, at a time \nwhen our economy is struggling to such a degree that implementing it \nright now could well force us into a recession.\n  It seems to me every Member of this body should stand together in \nacting decisively to prevent this economy from being pushed into a \nrecession. Implementing ObamaCare at a time when the economy is so weak \ncould do just that. ObamaCare hurts the economy. It hurts jobs. It \nhurts young people. It hurts Hispanics. It hurts African Americans. It \nhurts single moms. It hurts everybody struggling to climb the economic \nladder.\n  I would like to initially talk about four promises which were made \nwhen ObamaCare was passed and the reality we have seen as it has begun \nto be implemented. It is ironic the law is called the Affordable Care \nAct. In the 3 years it has begun to be implemented, it has proven to be \nneither affordable nor caring.\n  No. 1, before ObamaCare was adopted, President Obama promised the \nAmerican people ObamaCare would reduce the cost of insurance. In \nparticular, the President said American families would pay $2,500 less \nfor their insurance premiums by the end of his first term. I would note \nhis first term ended not long ago. Today, American families are not \npaying $2,500 less in health insurance premiums. They are not paying a \npenny less. Indeed, today American families are paying $3,000 more in \nhealth insurance premiums than they were. That is a $5,500 swing out of \nthe pockets of hard-working Americans who are struggling make ends \nmeet. The reality has not lived up to the promise.\n  The management consulting firm Oliver Wyman issued a new study \nrecently which predicted people aged 21 to 29 could see a 42-percent \nhike in premium costs. The higher premiums in particular are hitting \nyoung people. Indeed, I would point out, if you are a young person, \nthis law going into effect right now when the economy is struggling is \nparticularly problematic. If you are a young person coming out of \nschool today, you are facing: No. 1, fewer jobs. If you didn't graduate \nfrom high school, you are facing an unemployment rate today of over 12 \npercent. You have less opportunity. If you are between 16 to 19, you \nare facing an unemployment rate of over 25 percent.\n  If you are a minority, if you are Hispanic, you are facing an \nunemployment rate of nearly 10 percent. If you are African American, \nyou are facing an unemployment rate of over 14 percent.\n  What are you seeing actually in the job market if you are lucky \nenough to get a job? More and more employers are dropping health care \ncoverage because of the burdens of ObamaCare. More and more employers \nare forcing employees to work fewer hours because of the burdens of \nObamaCare. More and more individuals are seeing their premiums climb, \nespecially young people.\n\n[[Page S1725]]\n\nIf you are a young person coming out of school today, you may not find \na job.\n  It is harder to find a job because of economic growth right now. If \nyou do find a job, there is a real possibility that job will not have \nhealth insurance and you will find your hours reduced. If you do have \nhealth insurance, you will pay higher premiums. The promises have not \nlived up to the reality.\n  The second differential between promise and reality is President \nObama repeatedly told Americans, ``If you like your health plan, you \ncan keep it.'' This unfortunately has not proven to be the case.\n  The latest forecast from the Congressional Budget Office estimates \nsome 7 million people are expected to lose or be dropped from their \nemployer-provided health insurance by the year 2020. Indeed, health \ninsurers in 34 States have stopped carrying child-only insurance \npolicies. In my home State of Texas, one of the largest insurance \nmarkets in the country, every single carrier has dropped its child-only \nhealth insurance coverage. The same is true for other large States such \nas Florida and Illinois. The promise, if you like your health care \ncoverage, you will be able to keep it, has not lived up to reality, as \nmore and more Americans are losing their health insurance.\n  No. 3, President Obama pledged repeatedly not to raise taxes on \nfamilies making less than $250,000 a year. That promise has not \nmaterialized. Within ObamaCare, there is a tax on those who do not \nmaintain government-approved health insurance. There are increases on \nthe threshold of the deduction for unreimbursed medical expenses. There \nis an increase in taxes on distributions from Health Savings Accounts \nand from flexible spending arrangements. Indeed, in total, over $1 \ntrillion in tax increases are contained within ObamaCare. The promise \nhas not lived up to the reality.\n  The fourth promise which has not lived up to the reality is in \nFebruary of 2010, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said ObamaCare \nwould create 4 million jobs, 400,000 jobs almost immediately.\n  This was in 2010. By 2011, the CBO Budget Director testified before a \nHouse Budget Committee that ObamaCare would result in an estimated \n800,000 fewer jobs in the United States by 2021. The promises have not \nlived up to reality.\n  I wish to talk about five distinct harms which have come from \nObamaCare and made life more difficult for Americans.\n  No. 1, ObamaCare harms the poor and those who are struggling to climb \nthe economic ladder. Right now, 60 million people are enrolled in \nMedicaid. Medicaid is a program which is struggling, which is \nchallenged and desperately in need of reform to improve how it \noperates. ObamaCare, by raising the eligibility age and trying to \nincentivize and pressure States into expanding Medicaid, is designed to \nmove at least an additional 18 million people onto Medicaid over the \nnext 10 years.\n  The data demonstrates Medicaid beneficiaries face worse health \noutcomes than just about anybody else in the marketplace.\n  In 2010, the ``Annals of Surgery'' issued a landmark study which \nexamined the outcomes from nearly 900,000 individuals undergoing \nsurgery from 2003 to 2007. The conclusion of this study was Medicaid \npatients were almost twice as likely to die as those with private \ninsurance. Medicaid patients' hospital stays were 42 percent longer and \ncost 26 percent more.\n  Even more striking, Medicaid patients, when compared to people \nwithout health insurance, people who were uninsured, Medicaid patients \nwere 13 percent more likely to die. They stayed in the hospital for 50 \npercent longer and cost 20 percent more.\n  In 2011, Johns Hopkins did a study of patients undergoing lung \ntransplantation. Their conclusions were very much the same. They found \nthat Medicaid patients were 8.1 percent less likely to be alive 10 \nyears after the transplant compared with those with private insurance \nand also compared to those without any insurance at all. Overall, the \nJohns Hopkins study found that Medicaid patients faced a 29-percent \ngreater risk of death, and yet ObamaCare is moving more and more of the \neconomically disadvantaged onto Medicaid, which subjects them to those \nworse health care outcomes.\n\n  No. 2, ObamaCare hurts seniors. ObamaCare took $716 billion from \nMedicare, a large portion of which came from the Medicare Advantage \nProgram which serves a great many seniors, and especially poor seniors. \nAccording to the Office of the Actuary at the Center for Medicaid and \nMedicaid Services, the Medicare Advantage cuts in ObamaCare will reduce \nenrollment from 14.8 million to 7.4 million by 2017. It will cut it in \nhalf. Seven million people will lose their coverage under Medicare \nAdvantage.\n  I would remind everyone that the President said, ``If you like your \nhealth insurance, you can keep it.'' Yet 7 million seniors are losing \nMedicare Advantage.\n  The Heritage Foundation found the substantial cuts to Medicare \nAdvantage in particular hurt seniors in the States of Texas, \nCalifornia, New Mexico, Louisiana, Alaska, New York, Massachusetts, and \nalso in the District of Columbia. Those States are expected to lose \nmore than 50 percent of their enrollees by 2017.\n  I would suggest that each of us, as we return to our constituents, as \nwe return to address seniors, any in this body who vote today to \nimplement ObamaCare despite the difficult economic times, should be \nprepared to answer to seniors in our States who say: Why did you vote \nto damage the Medicare Advantage Program that I was relying upon?\n  Also, the harm to Medicare Advantage in particular is visited upon \nminorities. Hispanics are twice as likely to enroll in Medicare \nAdvantage than the average Medicare beneficiary. African Americans are \n10 percent more likely. So ObamaCare targets a program that is helping \nseniors and in particular is helping those seniors who are most \nvulnerable. In addition, 31 percent of African-American Medicare \nbeneficiaries and 38 percent of Hispanic beneficiaries are enrolled in \nMedicare Advantage plans.\n  So those of us who return to our States that have substantial \nminority populations need to be prepared to explain to Hispanic seniors \nand African-American seniors why this body, why the Federal Government \nis damaging a program they are relying upon for essential health care.\n  No. 3, ObamaCare is harming jobs. In March 2013, the Federal Reserve \nsaid, in its annual ``beige book''--which analyzes economic data from \nacross the country--that ``employers in several Districts cited the \nunknown effects of the Affordable Care Act as reasons for planned \nlayoffs and reluctance to hire more staff.''\n  Added health care costs are making it harder for businesses to hire \nnew workers and especially low-skilled workers. This is a point that is \nworth underscoring because the detrimental effects of ObamaCare are not \nuniformly distributed throughout our population. They fall the hardest \non those who are most vulnerable among us. The Heritage Foundation \nfound that ``workers who cannot produce at least $20,000 per year'' for \na single plan ``or $27,500 per year'' for a family plan ``of value to \nemployers will have serious difficulty finding full-time jobs.''\n  Madam President, when I read those statistics, those are not simply \nempty words on a page. Those are data that strike very close to home \nbecause 55 years ago that precisely described my father. When my father \ncame as an immigrant from Cuba in 1957, he was 18, he was penniless, \nand he could not speak English. The very first job my father received \nin Austin, TX, was washing dishes making 50 cents an hour.\n  The reason--he told me--he got that job was, he said: Look, I \ncouldn't speak English. I couldn't interact with people as most jobs \nrequired, but I could wash dishes. So he worked 7 days a week. The \nreason he worked 7 days a week is because when you washed dishes, they \nallowed the employees to eat, and he didn't have the money to buy food. \nSo by working 7 days a week, he ensured he ate 7 days a week.\n  So when I read statistics like this and the words, ``those who cannot \nproduce $20,000 per year in value to an employer will find themselves \nunable to find jobs,'' I can't help but think about my dad as that 18-\nyear-old kid just beginning to climb the job ladder, not speaking \nEnglish, not having yet developed skills, but what he could do\n\n[[Page S1726]]\n\nwas wash dishes. And working at 50 cents an hour is what enabled him to \npay his way through the University of Texas. It is what enabled him to \ngraduate, to get a higher paying job, and eventually to start a small \nbusiness. Then, today, to become a pastor.\n  My father is here today visiting me, and I think about the impact \nthese burdens would have had on him, and I tell you I am grateful that \nin 1957 this so-called Affordable Care Act had not been implemented \nbecause it could well have shut down the opportunity for him to survive \nand pay his way through school and begin climbing the economic ladder.\n  Additionally, ObamaCare keeps small businesses small. ObamaCare is \ndesigned so that its principal burdens are triggered when a business \nhas 50 employees or more. As a consequence, there is an incredible \ndeterrent to small businesses hiring more than 50 employees because \nhiring that 50th employee triggers enormous burdens and expenses. That \nhas particular implications for everyone in this economy struggling to \nfind work because two-thirds of all new jobs come from small \nbusinesses. By keeping these businesses small, what we are doing is \nstifling the ability to grow the economy, and in particular to grow the \neconomy by creating opportunities for those who need to begin and want \nto begin climbing the economic ladder.\n  By hiring the 50th employee, if a small business does not provide \ngovernment-approved insurance, it faces a penalty of up to $3,000 for \neach uncovered worker beyond 30 employees. Thus, as the Wall Street \nJournal explained:\n\n       If a company with 50 employees hires a new worker for $12 \n     an hour for 29 hours a week, there is no health insurance \n     requirement. But suppose that worker moves to 30 hours a \n     week. This triggers a $2,000 Federal penalty. So to get 50 \n     more hours of work a year from that employee, the extra cost \n     to the employer rises to about $52 an hour--the $12 salary \n     and an ObamaCare tax of what works out to be $40 an hour. \n     Moving to 33 hours a week costs the employer about $10 more \n     in ObamaCare tax.\n\n  The result is small businesses are staying smaller, and the \nopportunities for those struggling to achieve the American dream are \nlimited. That leads to the fourth harm: ObamaCare hurts workers.\n\n  One of the consequences we are seeing over and over is that in order \nto avoid the crushing costs of ObamaCare, employers are limiting the \nhours employees can work. So, for example, in January, a Wendy's \nfranchise in Nebraska announced it would cut the hours of nonmanagement \nemployees to 28 hours a week. As a result, about 100 employees' hours \nwere cut. That is a direct impact of ObamaCare for those 100 employees \nwho were working at Wendy's.\n  Now, some may say: Well, is Wendy's a career? So many kids, so many \nyoung people, so many Hispanics and African Americans begin, as my \nfather did, washing dishes or flipping burgers, and they use those jobs \nto gain skills and advance up the economic ladder. To have a law that \nforces small business owners to reduce those hours, to limit the hours \nthose workers can work, is particularly harmful.\n  A Taco Bell in Guthrie, OK, has also cut worker hours. A single \nmother of three told Oklahoma News 9:\n\n       They informed everybody that nobody was considered full \n     time any longer, that everybody was now considered part-time, \n     and [they] would be cutting hours back to 28 hours or less \n     due to ObamaCare.\n\n  She went on:\n\n       Several of the people I work with, some of them are single \n     parents, and we do the best we can, and 28 hours a week just \n     isn't going to cut it for the bills.\n\n  For those who are struggling, for the single moms in this country who \nare working as hard as they can to provide for their kids, seeing their \nhours reduced because of the consequences of this law is a real and \nmaterial hardship, and that, sadly, is happening all over the country.\n  Stephen Caldeira, president of the International Franchise \nAssociation, predicts that ``many stores will have to cut worker hours \nout of necessity.''\n  Let me point out, by the way, it is not hard-heartedness on the part \nof those small business owners. It is the simple reality of trying to \nsurvive in this economy. As Caldeira continues, it could be the \ndifference between staying in business or going out of business.\n  Indeed, a 2011 Hudson Institute study estimates that the insurance \nmandate will cost the franchise industry $6.4 billion and put 3.1 \nmillion jobs at risk. That is worth underscoring: 3.1 million jobs at \nrisk of kids flipping burgers, of single moms struggling to provide for \ntheir kids who are facing hard times because of ObamaCare. It is those \nwho are most vulnerable who are hit the worst.\n  Indeed, if we look at the premium increases, in particular for young \npeople, they have been significant. If ObamaCare is fully implemented, \nthey are likely to be extraordinary. According to a 2013 staff report \nfrom the Senate Finance Committee and the House Energy and Commerce \nCommittee, the ObamaCare impact on young adults in the individual \nmarket is expected to be staggering.\n  If we look at the city of Austin--a city I have lived in for many \nyears, a terrific city, a city whose slogan unofficially is ``Keep \nAustin Weird.'' It is a young, hip, vibrant----\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Weird?\n  Mr. CRUZ. Weird, which in Austin is very fitting. It is a young, hip, \nvibrant city. It is referred to as the ``Live music capital of the \nworld.'' Right now, a young adult in Austin in the individual health \ninsurance market pays an average premium of $648. Under ObamaCare, that \nis anticipated to rise to $1,836. That is a 183-percent increase.\n  I wish to repeat that, to underscore it. Today, they are paying $648. \nThat is expected to rise to $1,836. An additional $1,200 out of the \npocket of a young person struggling to survive is substantial. And, \nindeed, nationally, that is consistent with the pattern that is \nexpected all over the country. That is the average annual increase. It \nis parallel to what is expected in Chicago, Phoenix, Atlanta, and \nMilwaukee.\n  Madam President, I have been informed that the Senator from Utah has \na time issue. I ask unanimous consent to yield to the Senator from \nUtah, and thank him for joining me.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, as the manager of the bill, I thought \nwe were going to--of course Senator Cruz has offered his amendment--but \nwe were going to rotate speakers from the Democrats and Republicans. \nThere was no agreement to do roundrobin here, where the Senator from \nTexas would yield to the Senator from Utah. I think there is some \nconfusion. I wish to follow the traditional regular order, where the \nSenator from Texas, the proponent of the amendment, has full and ample \ntime; then other Senators respond, and then Senator Lee. I am not going \nto make a scene, but that is the way we usually do it.\n  Has the Senator from Texas concluded his remarks?\n  Mr. CRUZ. In terms of my remarks, I have about an additional 10 \nminutes I wish to give. But I was just informed that the Senator from \nUtah had a scheduling issue, and asked if we could show him \nconsideration. I am being told now that--if the Senator from Maryland \nwould prefer, I am happy to continue my remarks.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. And for the Senator from Utah, we all have scheduling \nissues. What we would want to do is make sure everybody has their say. \nIf the Senator from Utah has a statement he wishes to put into the \nRecord or wishes to return, we welcome him back. We in no way want to \nimpede his ability to speak.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, the issue has been obviated. So if I may \nsimply continue my remarks, and when I conclude, I will yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. The fifth impact of ObamaCare is that it imposes a \nsubstantial harm on the economy. On the economy altogether, ObamaCare \nincludes more than 20 tax increases. The Joint Committee on Taxation \nestimates that over the next 10 years ObamaCare will raise $1 trillion \nin taxes. That is $1 trillion from the private sector that is not going \nto be available to be used to hire new workers.\n  Job losses just in the medical device industry, as a result of the \nmedical device excise tax, could total as much as 47,100 or 10 percent \nof the medical device industry employment. Those jobs are needed. Those \njob losses are not\n\n[[Page S1727]]\n\ndriven by market conditions. Those job losses are driven by one thing, \nwhich is the policy decisions of the Federal Government to implement \nObamaCare.\n  On March 5, 2013, Russell George, the inspector general for the IRS, \ntestified in the House Committee on Appropriations:\n\n       It is unprecedented in recent history the amount of \n     responsibility the IRS is being given in an area that most \n     people don't think of as an IRS function.\n\n  He went on, ``This is going to lead to problems.''\n  The Congressional Budget Office expects ObamaCare penalties to total \n$130 billion over the next 10 years. That is up $13 billion from \nprevious forecasts. And more taxpayers will be hit with ObamaCare taxes \nas time goes on. There is a 0.9-percent tax surcharge on individuals' \nearned income, and a 3.8-percent surcharge on investment income for \nindividuals making more than $200,000.\n  But those taxes are not indexed for inflation. And so as inflation \nraises the nominal income of Americans, it will push more and more from \nthe middle class into paying those taxes. The Tax Policy Center \nestimates that by 2013, 2.4 percent of households will pay one or both \nof those taxes; by 2022, 4.6 percent of households will pay; by 2032, 9 \npercent of households will pay. That is a significant additional tax \nburden falling on Americans.\n  In addition, one of the most problematic short-term and long-term \nimplications of ObamaCare is less innovation. The United States has \nenjoyed tremendous advantages because our free-market system encourages \ninvestment in innovation. In health care in particular we have seen \nincredible innovation--whether in medical devices or whether in \npharmaceuticals--because the incentives are there to invest in new \nhealth care treatment. As a result, millions have lived better lives, \nhave lived longer lives, have not died from diseases that previously \nwere incurable and previously were untreatable. Because of the \ninnovation we have had in the medical field, it has led to the United \nStates enjoying a world-class health care system. ObamaCare is \nsubstantially diminishing innovation in health care.\n  Venture capital, the seed money that funds new research and \ndevelopment in health care, has dropped precipitously. In 2010, venture \ncapital in health care services was $1.2 billion. By 2011, it had \ndropped more than in half, to $541 million. According to Dr. Scott \nGottlieb of the American Enterprise Institute, only about 30 venture \nstage health care services companies got funded last year, compared to \nhundreds from previous years.\n  If we want to continue the incredible medical innovation we have seen \nover the last century, we can't be drying up the capital that is \ndevoted to research and development, that is devoted to new and \ninnovative companies. And that is exactly what ObamaCare is doing.\n  Then there are the compliance costs. The compliance costs from \nObamaCare are, quite simply, massive. ObamaCare will require American \nbusinesses, families, health care providers to spend more than 127 \nmillion hours per year in compliance costs. What could be done with 127 \nmillion hours? The problem with big numbers is it is hard to get your \nmind around them. What does it mean that 127 million hours are being \nspent on complying with ObamaCare?\n\n  To put that into perspective, Mount Rushmore--which took 14 years to \nbuild--could be completed over 1,000 times, and that is each and every \nyear. That underscores how staggering; we are talking about 1,000 Mount \nRushmores each and every year. I would note there may be some Members \nof this august body who would like to see themselves on those 1,000 or \nmore Mount Rushmores.\n  But rather than needless compliance, we should be putting that energy \ninto productive endeavors. None of that compliance cost is productive. \nAs we say in Texas, it produces neither trucks nor tortillas. It is \nsimply wasted time dealing with the burdens of government.\n  To give you a sense of the volume of burdens, as of today the \nadministration has created more than 19,000 pages of regulations, \nbulletins, and guidance since ObamaCare became law. If the IRS and HHS \nand the Department of Labor continue at their current pace, we can \nexpect an additional 3,000 pages of rules--which is what I have here, \n3,000 pages--in the next 6 months, the period covered by this \ncontinuing resolution.\n  This is 3,000 pages right here. I will tell you, I am very glad I \ndon't have to sit down and read these 3,000 pages. But I will tell you \nalso, yesterday I held a tele-townhall with thousands of Texans. A \nsmall business owner asked a question. She said, Look, in our small \nbusiness, we are struggling to make ends meet. How do we ascertain what \nthese regulations contain? I will tell you, I was very frustrated that \nI could not give her a good answer, because on my desk here is 3,000 \npages, and yet what has already been promulgated is over 19,000 pages. \nSo take this stack and send it six times up in the air. It would reach \nnearly into the gallery.\n  I told her, I don't have a good answer for how you, struggling to \nmake payroll, to make sure your employees keep their jobs, possibly \ndigest 19,000 pages of regulations, with new pages coming out without \nceasing.\n  Why is our economy struggling? It is not hard to figure out why our \neconomy is struggling when you think about the compliance costs and \nregulations that are being heaped on small businesses, when they are \ntold, Figure out what is in the 19,000 pages of regulations, and if you \nget it wrong, you can be assured the hammer of the Federal Government \nwill come down upon you.\n  That is why I am introducing this amendment today. This amendment to \nthe continuing resolution is a very simple amendment. It simply \nprovides that none of the funds within the continuing resolution shall \nbe spent to implement ObamaCare or to engage in rulemaking under \nObamaCare.\n  Let me be clear. In my view, ObamaCare should be repealed altogether. \nI think the harms from ObamaCare--and particularly the harms of the \nmost vulnerable among us--are significant enough that we should repeal \nit in its entirety. I recognize that is not a view shared by every \nMember of this body. At a minimum, however, I would submit that every \nMember of this body will agree that restoring economic growth should be \na critical priority. And with our economy gasping for breath--last \nquarter, we were at 0.1 percent growth--allowing ObamaCare to be fully \nimplemented right now has the potential of pushing this economy into a \nrecession. I know no Member of this body wants to see the economy go \ninto a recession. No Member of this body wants to see the American \npeople pay the price for damaging economic growth. If we allow \nObamaCare to be funded and implemented right now, each of us who votes \nto do so will bear a significant amount of responsibility for the \neconomic damage that comes.\n  I would submit that every Member of this body, Republican and \nDemocrat, should stand together and say, at a minimum, let's restore \ngrowth first; at a minimum, let's wait until we get back to historic \nlevels of growth--3.3 percent--before implementing such an incredibly \nantigrowth, job-killing omnibus bill.\n  Let me close with a simple observation of the power of growth. If we \ncould get back to historic averages, 3 percent to 5 percent, every \nother problem this body wrestles with becomes much simpler to resolve. \nFour percent growth for a decade would create over 10 million new jobs. \nFour percent growth for a decade would produce over $3 trillion in \nadditional tax revenue. I would note, that exceeds the tax increases. \nThe revenue from the tax increases that have been proposed by President \nObama exceeds the revenue from the tax increases that, my understanding \nis, the Budget Committee will include in its budget before this body.\n  I am all for new revenue to pay down our debt. I just believe the \nrevenue should come from economic growth and not from higher taxes that \nhammer small businesses, kill jobs, and restrict growth.\n  Most importantly, 4 percent growth over a decade would lift over 3 \nmillion out of poverty and into the middle class. Growth sometimes \nseems to be an abstract number that only economists worry about, but \nsustained growth is what has led to the unprecedented prosperity of our \ngreat Nation. It is the reason why for centuries millions of people \nhave come to America seeking a better life, because there has\n\n[[Page S1728]]\n\nbeen no country on Earth that has allowed so many people to start with \nnothing and achieve anything.\n  A stagnant economy hurts, first and foremost, those struggling to \nclimb the economic ladder. And, in my opinion, every one of us should \ncome in to work every day fighting for those struggling to climb the \neconomic ladder to make sure we remain the land of opportunity; to make \nsure we remain the hope and beacon to the world; to make sure that \nevery American has a fair chance to achieve the American dream. With \nstagnant growth, millions are shut off from that American dream. And I \nknow no Member of this body wants to see that happen.\n  Respectfully, I would urge my colleagues to restore growth first. Do \nnot allow this bill to be implemented, to kill economic growth, to kill \njobs, and to potentially push this economy into a recession. Instead, \nlet's get growth back, let's maintain our economic strength and \nsecurity, and let's make sure opportunity remains--not just for us but \nfor the next generation and the generations after that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I guess I am compelled to say: Here we \ngo again. We have been down this road a few times before since we \npassed the Affordable Care Act. Let me see, my notes tell me it is 33--\nthis makes the 34th time that someone on the Republican side has tried \nto do away with the Affordable Care Act. This is the 34th time, and \nthey failed every time. But they are free to offer amendments, I \nunderstand that. I respect the Senator's right to do that, but we have \nalready made our decisions on this and we are moving ahead.\n  I have said many times as the chair of the HELP Committee, if someone \nhas suggestions on how to improve the Affordable Care Act, to make it \nwork better, be more efficient, I am open to that. That should be \nallowed, and we should have a constant exchange on maybe how we can \nimprove it. But this idea that we are going to repeal it? I would also \nsay I wonder if my friend, the Senator from Texas, saw the last \nelection. The Senator from Texas got elected, that is for sure, and I \ncongratulate him on that. But the Presidential candidate of the \nRepublican Party who said he wanted to repeal the Affordable Care Act \nlost. President Obama, who was the President who initiated this and \nsigned it into law won, I think quite convincingly.\n  So the American people basically have said it is time to move on with \nthe Affordable Care Act. Yet here this amendment basically would repeal \nit.\n  I wonder if the Senator from Texas understands it is not just the \nAffordable Care Act his amendment would hit, it would hit a lot of \nother things. When we passed the Affordable Care Act there were \nauthorizations for other programs that were included with it. When the \namendment says we cannot fund any of the provisions of the Affordable \nCare Act, I just made a note that we also reauthorized the Nurse \nTraining Partnership Act. So a lot of the funds there go for training \nnurses.\n  Does the Senator really believe we should stop funding training for \nnurses in America at this time when we need more nurses and more nurse \npractitioners than ever before, at a time when our nursing profession \nis facing a kind of age cliff? We have a huge cohort of nurses now who \nare going to be retiring. We need to bring in new nurses. Yet his \namendment would cut funding. He says nothing we can do could support \nnurse training yet in America.\n  Medicare fraud and abuse--fighting fraud and abuse in Medicare; that \nwas also included in the Affordable Care Act. Again, they have tried \nfrontal assaults on getting rid of the Affordable Care Act. Now this \namendment says we are going to not fund it. It would be strange. We \nhave a law in effect but no funding to take advantage of it.\n  It is almost like some people on the other side of the aisle have an \nobsession with tearing down health care reform. I think it is \nunfortunate that some missed the results of the last election, so it is \ntime to move on. This amendment really is the equivalent of repeal. It \nwould turn back the clock on all we have accomplished in the past year. \nThe administration would not be able to build the insurance exchanges \nor enforce the act's requirements on private insurers.\n  Again, if this amendment were adopted, it would mean we would go back \nto the good old days when the insurance companies were in the driver's \nseat, telling you what kind of health care you are entitled to and when \nyou are entitled to it.\n  Ever since we passed the Affordable Care Act, and during the time we \ndebated it on the Senate floor, we kept asking our friends on the \nRepublican side: What is your alternative? Basically, what we got was \nthe status quo: Let's just stay with what we have.\n  I think the American people got pretty fed up with what we had, where \ninsurance companies could turn people down at the very moment when they \ngot sickest; when people had preexisting conditions and could not get \ninsurance or had to pay exorbitant prices for it.\n  I had a note, we had a family, the Grasshoffs, from Texas--the \nSenator's home State. They were unable to find coverage to pay for \ntheir son's hemophilia treatment. Why? Because they had reached their \nlifetime limit on insurance payments.\n  The Affordable Care Act bans lifetime limits, so now they can get \ntreatment. More than 100 million Americans are currently protected by \nthis provision. This amendment would take it away. So the Grasshoffs' \ntreatment for their son with hemophilia would end, and they cannot \nafford to pay for it out of their own pockets. Keep that in mind when \nyou vote on this amendment.\n  The Affordable Care Act allows young people to stay on their parents' \npolicies, we know, until they are age 26. More than 3 million young \npeople are taking advantage of this right now. Repeal would take that \naway from families. The adoption of the Cruz amendment would take that \naway because, obviously, we could not fund anything to help make this \nwork.\n  I mentioned preexisting conditions--people who have high blood \npressure, diabetes, heart disease, previous bouts with cancer. Right \nnow the Cruz amendment would say no. The insurance companies can say: \nNo, we are not going to insure you or if we do, you are going to pay \nsky-high prices for insurance.\n  One of the big things we put in the Affordable Care Act was \nprevention and wellness programs that would prevent illness. So we \nprovided for free preventive services such as mammograms and \ncolonoscopies, so people can get those without paying copays, sometimes \nas much as $300 to as much as several hundred dollars for these \nessential services. The Cruz amendment would put us back where we would \nhave to pay for those preventative screenings.\n\n  The Cruz amendment would deprive States and localities of vital \nfunding to combat chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and heart \ndisease, as well as funding to make sure our kids have access to \nlifesaving vaccines. Thanks to health reform, the Prevention and Public \nHealth Fund is saving lives. The Cruz amendment would stop that.\n  I picked up a little bit of what the Senator from Texas said about \nyoung people; that their insurance rates are going to go sky high. Has \nthe Senator ever heard of the marketplace? It is where people compete. \nUnder the Affordable Care Act, all of these insurance companies now \nwill have to go on the exchanges in the open market, with full \ntransparency, and they are going to have to compete. We have not had \nthat in the past, but under this we do. The Cruz amendment would take \nthat away--a real market out there for insurance, for individuals, \nsmall businesses. They would have the same purchasing power and choice \nthat only big companies had before.\n  I guess what is most important is these exchanges that we are setting \nup will bring coverage to 32 million Americans who do not have coverage \nright now. They live in the oppressive fear that they are just one \nillness away from bankruptcy, losing their homes, not knowing if they \ncan afford another doctor visit.\n  Did anyone tell States to stop this, stop what they were doing to \nhelp serve our citizens? That is what this Cruz amendment does. The \nCruz amendment would take us back to the days of the doughnut hole for \nthe elderly because the Affordable Care Act\n\n[[Page S1729]]\n\ncloses that doughnut hole. We are closing it year after year; 6.1 \nmillion seniors have already saved more than $5.7 billion in discounts \non drugs purchased in the doughnut hole. The Cruz amendment would stop \nthat. It would increase seniors' drug prices by an estimated $3,500 per \nperson over the next 10 years.\n  One of the key features we put in the Affordable Care Act was going \nafter Medicare fraud, preventing Medicare fraud. We have increased \ncriminal penalties, we have launched innovative technologies to detect \nand pursue those who would defraud Medicare, and we have put more cops \non the beat to preserve Medicare funds for beneficiaries and not those \nwho would scam the system. The Cruz amendment would stop all that, stop \nour efforts we put in there to get a handle on Medicare fraud.\n  Something that is very important to so many of us is what is \nhappening in rural areas. Right now, under the Affordable Care Act, \nthere are incentive payments paid to rural primary care providers in \nrural America--States such as North Dakota and Iowa and Texas. Right \nnow the Cruz amendment would stop that incentive payment for primary \ncare providers in rural areas.\n  I mentioned preventive services--right now every senior gets a \nwellness visit once a year. More than 34 million seniors got that last \nyear, a free preventive service in Medicare so they can go in and get a \nwellness check to find out if they need to do something to take better \ncare of themselves. They do not have to pay for that. The Cruz \namendment would say if they want to do it now, they have to start \npaying for it.\n  Since this is kind of a blunt instrument, this amendment we have \nbefore us would defund all activities related to health reform, \nincluding paying the Federal employees who administer Medicare. \nSecretary Sebelius has informed us payments to Medicare providers would \nbe significantly disrupted by this. You just cannot separate the \nAffordable Care Act from all the other provisions of Medicare that are \nbeing run by Health and Human Services or by CMS, the Center for \nMedicaid and Medicare Services.\n  Oh, yes, the Senator also talked about the deficit, reducing the \ndeficit. I don't understand why someone would want to stop something \nwhich the Congressional Budget Office said would reduce the deficit. I \nguess we are going to reduce the deficit by increasing the deficit? \nThat is sort of the logic of this amendment.\n  The Congressional Budget Office affirmed that the Affordable Care Act \nreduces the deficit by more than $100 billion in the next 10 years, and \nmore than $1 trillion in the decade that follows. So the Cruz amendment \nwould roll that back. I guess the Senator wants to reduce the deficit \nby increasing the deficit. Go figure that one out.\n  It is time to stop the silly games, but I guess it will continue. \nAfter all, in 1935 the Congress and President Roosevelt passed the \nSocial Security Act. Seventy-five years later there are still some on \nthe Republican side who would like to get rid of that.\n  I guess we will continue to have a few voices--not everyone--who will \nstill be fighting the Affordable Care Act a year from now.\n  In 1965 Congress passed Medicare--the Republicans fought it bitterly, \nby the way--and 45 years later a few on that side are still trying to \nundo Medicare by voucherizing it, and that sort of stuff. I just have \nto say: Here we go again.\n  William F. Buckley was the founder of the National Review and sort of \nthe godfather of the modern conservative movement in America. He was a \nvery intellectual kind of guy. He was very intellectual and a good \nwriter and speaker. I always enjoyed watching William F. Buckley. He \nonce said: ``A conservative is a fellow standing athwart history \nyelling: Stop!''\n  Well, is that really the role? I think there should be a different \nrole, and that is to stand with liberals, moderates, and everybody else \nto figure out what is best. We need to figure out what is best for \nmoving ahead and not to just yell ``stop'' or repeal something. We need \nto do something that is so meaningful and so broadly supported, then \nfigure out how to make it work the best.\n  I kind of conclude where I began. If people have suggestions on how \nto make the Affordable Care Act work better, smoother, be more \nefficient, more cost effective, fine. That would be a good debate and \ndiscussion. Just to say: No, we are not going to fund it is an \nideological approach. It is not based on budget considerations, it is \nnot based on reducing the deficit, which I just pointed out. It is not \nbased on a rational reading of the bill and what is happening out there \nin terms of setting up the exchanges and all the other things I \nmentioned. It is just an ideological approach. It is sort of tearing it \ndown and sort of going after President Obama, I guess, one more time. I \ndon't want to take the position that somebody cannot offer an amendment \nsuch as that. Sure, they can offer an amendment. They can do anything. \nHowever, reasonable, rational people in the Senate don't need to follow \nthat. We need to do what is best for the American people and leave the \nideology behind.\n  I hope the Cruz amendment will be seen for what it is, an attempt to \nrepeal ObamaCare at this moment in time when we are on the cusp of \nactually having it fully implemented. States have already moved ahead. \nEven very conservative Republican Governors have joined in and said: \nYes, we want to extend Federal Medicaid coverage in our States. \nConservative Republican Governors are setting up exchanges. We are \nmoving ahead. Now is not the time to say: Well, we are going to cut the \nfunding.\n  Again, keep in mind, this doesn't just defund the Affordable Care \nAct. I said there were other things, such as the Nurse Professional \nTraining Act, which we put in the Affordable Care Act, which would also \nbe defunded. It was reauthorized along with the Medicare fraud and \nabuse and the area health education centers. There are a number of \nthings that were put in with the Affordable Care Act that would also be \ndefunded under the Cruz amendment.\n  I hope everyone will see the amendment for what it is, and I hope the \nSenate will soundly reject it.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, we will be alternating on both sides \nof the aisle. I regret Senator Lee had to leave, and we welcome those \nwho support the Cruz amendment to speak before we have to take a break.\n  I have to go to a meeting with Senator Reid and other members of the \ncommittee at 12:30 p.m. We ask those who have views on this to come \nforward and speak. I do have some comments on the Cruz amendment.\n  First of all, we welcome Senator Cruz. He is the new Senator from \nTexas. He replaced a very dear friend, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison. \nSenator Hutchison and I were close friends and we usually agreed on \ngoals, but there were times we didn't agree on methods. With Senator \nCruz we agree that we do need a job-creating strategy. We know we need \nto promote economic growth in whatever we do and even follow the \nphysician's adage of ``do no harm.'' That is why I absolutely disagree \nwith the Senator's amendment. The very things he wants to accomplish \nand his underlying premise--though obviously well argued from his view \nin a persuasive way--I totally disagree with.\n  First of all, let's talk about what the Cruz amendment does. It \nprohibits discretionary funds from being used for the Affordable Care \nAct. It is affectionately known by some of us as ObamaCare, because \nObama does care. So the Cruz amendment would prevent the Department of \nHealth and Human Services from implementing the Affordable Care Act. \nThis would mean the staff, for example, CMS, could not issue or enforce \nregulations on insurance abuse practices, such as gender \ndiscrimination. Quality reforms that improve the care that everybody \ndoes and actually lowers cost would also be affected. For example, \nJohns Hopkins lung transplants were cited as one study--Madam \nPresident, I could go on, but if the Senator from Utah is ready to \nspeak, I will yield the floor. We were alternating, so it is actually \nthe Senator's turn.\n  Madam President, as robust as my remarks would be, I will yield to \ngive the Senator from Utah his rightful chance to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I wish to extend my gratitude to my \ncolleague from Maryland for allowing me to speak at this time. I \nappreciate that.\n\n[[Page S1730]]\n\n  I rise in support of the amendment proposed by my good friend, the \nSenator from Texas, that would defund the implementation of the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act for the remainder of this fiscal \nyear. Almost everything the American people were told about ObamaCare \nby the bill's proponents has turned out to be incorrect. We were \npromised it would save money. Now we know it will cost us more money. \nIn 2 short years, the projected cost of the government health care \ntakeover has ballooned from $940 billion to $1.76 trillion. We were \ntold it would help a struggling economy. Now we know it will help \nsmother a still struggling economy.\n  Employers cite ObamaCare as a principal reason and reluctance to hire \nnew employees. According to the National Federation of Independent \nBusiness, ObamaCare's unconstitutional mandate--which the Supreme Court \nsalvaged only by rewriting it as a tax--will kill between 125,000 and \n249,000 jobs over the next 10 years. According to the Congressional \nBudget Office, ObamaCare will reduce total American employment by \n800,000 jobs by 2021.\n\n  In fairness, these are only projections. Although I believe even \nthose projections are optimistic, they certainly contradict the \nfairytale arguments in favor of ObamaCare in 2009 and 2010, but they \nare still just best guesses.\n  The reason Senator Cruz introduced, and the reason why I support, \nthis amendment is that the case against ObamaCare is rapidly moving \nfrom fears about tomorrow to pain that is felt today--right now.\n  In 2008, then-Senator Obama promised that his policies would lower \nhealth care premiums for the average American family by $2,500; 4 years \nlater--and 2 years after President Obama signed ObamaCare into law--the \nKaiser Foundation reports that family health insurance premiums have \nactually risen by $2,370. This is one of the things we were told we \nneeded to pass the bill in order to find within the bill a $5,000 \npremium hike on working families.\n  What else have we found? We found that when the Federal Government \nrequires businesses to provide health insurance for their full-time \nemployees, businesses respond by cutting employee hours. Other \ncompanies have chosen to go farther and have simply laid employees off \naltogether or shifted those jobs overseas. Other companies have \nadmitted that the cost ObamaCare adds to their business will have to be \npassed on to their customers in the form of higher prices.\n  Then there is the devastating impact ObamaCare has had on our medical \ndevice industry, which is targeted for a special punitive tax under \nthis law. Companies from Boston Scientific, Stryker, Smith & Nephew and \nothers are laying off workers and shipping their jobs overseas.\n  It is important to remember that each of these layoffs is, in a \nsense, a double strike against our economy. On the one hand, when \npeople lose their jobs and their health insurance, the economy suffers \nin and of itself because of that impact. On the other hand, at the very \nsame time this is occurring because ObamaCare and the rest of the \nPresident's failed agenda are weighing down our economy quite heavily, \nthere are not enough new jobs being created for the recently unemployed \nAmericans to fill. So the unemployed are not only staying unemployed \nfor longer than normal, but they are also increasing demand for already \noverburdened government assistance programs. Thanks to ObamaCare, fewer \npeople are working and paying into the system to support people \nObamaCare is preventing from finding work and health insurance in the \nfirst place.\n  The beauty of the Cruz amendment is that we don't have to pass it to \ndiscover what it would do. We already know exactly what it would do. It \nwould delay the implementation of ObamaCare and thereby save taxpayer \nmoney and American jobs. It would also restore a semblance of \ndemocratic accountability to a process that is badly in need of \nprecisely that. After all, the various departments of the Federal \nGovernment have already issued some 20,000 pages' worth of regulations \nto formalize the ObamaCare system. In other words, the 2,700-page \nmonstrosity Congress passed in 2010 was only a fraction of the final \ndeforesting product.\n  Does anyone--literally anyone in the entire country--know what those \n20,000 pages of regulations say? For all we know, we could be violating \nObamaCare right now. Somewhere in those 20,000 pages there might be \nsomething saying we cannot do what we are doing at the moment.\n  Some might think I am exaggerating, but as we were all shocked to \nlearn recently, 98 percent of individual health insurance policies in \nthe United States right now are in violation of ObamaCare's standards. \nWhen ObamaCare goes into full effect, those Americans who own those \npolicies will have to either buy more expensive insurance than they \nhave now or pay the unconstitutional fine. The unconstitutional fine \nwas, according to the Supreme Court, unconstitutional as a fine and \ncould be sustained by the Supreme Court only because the Supreme Court \nrewrote the law as a tax instead of a fine.\n  To recap, ObamaCare is already costing us jobs that we need badly. It \nis raising health care costs. It is adding to our deficit and debt. It \nis forcing families off their health insurance policies they have and \nlike. It is a Trojan horse for 20,000 of new law that no elected \nofficial wrote and not a single citizen in the United States has read.\n  Then, of course, there is the slow-motion train wreck of the law's \nimplementation. A majority of States in the Union have already refused \nto set up their own ObamaCare exchanges. The bill has been passed and \nthe American people now see what is in it and they want no part of it. \nSo the Department of Health and Human Services is now charged with \nsetting up Federal exchanges in those States, but they don't know how.\n  The clock is ticking. People are losing their health insurance. The \nexchanges are supposed to be ready to handle the massive influx of \npeople dumped by ObamaCare onto those same exchanges, and the exchanges \nare not going to be there.\n  What will be there? Well, according to a report issued by the \nAssociated Press, uninsured Americans will find a 15-page, 21-step \napplication that will need approval from three separate Federal \nagencies. There are expected to be more than 4 million of these \napplications next year alone. Even as an advocate of the program says \nin this same AP story: The form will take a considerable amount of time \nto fill out and will be difficult for many people to be able to \ncomplete. That part of the process ``does not get you to the selection \nof a plan.''\n\n  ObamaCare is going to make doing your taxes feel like a round of \ngolf. For this reason, there are some who believe the only way to \nexpose ObamaCare and rescue the health care system is to let nature \ntake its course, to let it go into effect as soon as possible. They say \nthat the sooner it collapses, the sooner we can repeal it and start \nover.\n  The Senator from Texas and I and everyone else supporting this \namendment reject that logic. We cannot in good conscience send millions \nof innocent Americans into a dangerously dysfunctional health care \nsystem run by unaccountable, if well-intentioned, bureaucrats. We will \nnot sacrifice millions of families to prove a political point. People's \nlives and livelihoods are at stake. The American people are not pawns \nin Washington's partisan political game. We work for them, not the \nother way around.\n  As public servants we have an obligation to protect the American \npeople--those who elected us to serve. ObamaCare is going to hurt our \ncountry, our economy, our constituents, our friends, and our neighbors. \nIt is the single greatest threat to our economy and to our health care \nsystem. Eventually, ObamaCare will be repealed. The American people \nwill see the damage it does and demand that we scrap it and start over. \nBut for now we must at least defund it, at least for the life of this \ncontinuing resolution--for the remainder of this fiscal year.\n  Senator Cruz and I have been assured that this amendment will fail \nand ObamaCare will move ahead as planned. If that is the will of the \nSenate, then so be it. But when ObamaCare does start to break down--\nwhen waiting times start to grow, when costs start to explode, when \ntaxes start to rise, when doctors and nurses start to quit, when \nhospitals start to close,\n\n[[Page S1731]]\n\nwhen businesses start to shutter, when take-home pay falls and jobs \ndisappear, when patients and families truly find out what is in this \nbill, then the American people will know who is responsible for the \ncatastrophe of ObamaCare and who, like the Senator from Texas, tried to \nhelp.\n  A few years ago, when then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi famously \ntold Members of the House that you have to pass this 2,700 page bill in \norder to find out what is in it, she perhaps saw what we would be \nexperiencing today or at least some aspect of it. But either way, today \nwe now see what is in what they passed back then. We, as Members of the \nSenate, have had an opportunity to review this piece of legislation \nover the last few years. We know what economic impact this law is \nalready having as its still massive implementation has moved forward.\n  We need to make ourselves accountable to the American people for what \nis in this law and what we now know is in this law. I, therefore, \nrespectfully urge each and every one of my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise to speak on the Cruz amendment. \nI am glad Senator Lee had a chance to speak.\n  As I said, the Cruz amendment would prevent the Department of Health \nand Human Services from implementing funding for the discretionary \nspending aspects of the Affordable Care Act. Since the Presiding \nOfficer knows the Affordable Care Act so well and played a major part \nin it when she was a Member of the House of Representatives, she knows \nthis amendment would have disastrous consequences. It would essentially \ndefund the Affordable Care Act. They call it ObamaCare. I call it \nObamaCare. As I said earlier, Obama does care, and that is why we \npassed the legislation in the first place.\n  The Cruz amendment means that CMS couldn't do their job to, for \nexample, issue regulations on ending gender discrimination. It has been \nsaid that there are all these pages of regulation. But why should we \npay more for health insurance than men of comparable age and health \nstatus--as much as 50 percent more?\n  The Affordable Care Act also ends discrimination on the basis of \npreexisting conditions. As the Presiding Officer knows, in eight States \nwomen were denied health insurance because domestic violence was deemed \na preexisting condition. They were battered in their own home, and then \nthey were battered by their insurance agency. What are we doing here? \nThis is not where we are going.\n  Excuse me. I promised I wouldn't try to incite; I would try more to \ninspire. But I feel very strongly and passionately that the Cruz \namendment should not pass. It should not pass.\n  I wish to speak to what the Senator said about economic growth. He \nsaid he is for economic growth. I want to be on that list. He is a \nprogrowth Senator. I want to be on that list too. I think it is a \ncommittee of 100. What I want him to know is that without a form of \nhealth care that provides universal access but insisting on delivery \nmodels of reform, we will have a catastrophe and not only in an earned \nbenefit program such as Medicare. What happens is if people don't have \nhealth insurance, it gets shifted onto other people who do have health \ninsurance and the employers who have the generosity and wherewithal to \npay for it.\n  So if we want to be for economic growth, the first thing we need to \ndo is clean up our own act here. This is what we need to do here. The \npolitics of brinkmanship, ultimatum politicians, shut down, show down, \nand slam down must end. That is what we are trying to do here. What we \nare trying to do is move legislation so there is no government \nshutdown.\n  Businesses don't invest in creating jobs because they don't have \ncertainty. They don't have reliability. Where is the Federal Government \ngoing? What is it going to do? How is it going to get its act together \nso businesses can invest, whether it is in their own employees or \nperhaps bringing money back home from overseas, legally earned profits, \nto put into infrastructure? So if a person is progrowth, they want to \nhave health insurance.\n  The two costs business cannot control are the cost of health care and \nthe cost of energy. We can control the impact on reforming the cost of \nhealth care through ObamaCare. Why do I say that? First of all, if a \nperson doesn't have health insurance, they get sick and go to the \nemergency room. Do my colleagues know what the average cost of an \nemergency room visit is? It is $1,000. Do my colleagues know what a \nprimary care doctor gets? He gets $40. Now, what is wrong with that \npicture? He gets $40, not $400, by the time all of it is taken out.\n\n  I wish to bring to the attention of my colleagues a fantastic \ndocumentary that was on CNN on Sunday night. It was called ``Escape \nFire.'' It was a complete 2-hour documentary from CNN, not some lefty \nthink tank or nothing like the Institute of Medicine. This was a CNN \ndocumentary on the cost of health care and how the system we have now \nincreases costs but does not increase or improve health outcomes.\n  I am not going to argue all those dynamics here today, but if we \nreally want to lower the cost of health care, we want to have President \nObama and our Affordable Care Act. This is what businesses want. What \nthey don't want is cost-shifting. Because some people don't have it or \nbecause they got it too late in their own situation, the cost is \nactually greater.\n  The other side has talked about small business. Senator Cruz just \ntold this wonderful story about his father--a Cuban refugee, \nessentially--who came to this country. Because he couldn't speak \nEnglish, he took a job where it wasn't required, washing dishes. And \nthen here we go, one generation later, Senator Cruz is a Senator. I \nthink that is a wonderful personal story. He then went on to talk about \nbusiness.\n  His story is a lot like my own family's story. We came from Poland. \nWhen we came from Poland, it was not because we were rich; we came \nbecause we thought that Lady Liberty and her shining light really meant \nsomething. My family started small businesses. My grandmother ran one \nof the best Polish bakeries in Baltimore. My father had a small grocery \nstore. Because of a large family, he left school in the eighth grade, \nbut through his own grit and determination, with my mother at his side, \nhe served a community. Over 700 people came to my father's funeral \nbecause they loved him as much, in their own way, as we did. My father, \nthrough his grit, determination, and working--the same as Senator \nCruz's father--my father worked 6 days a week, 12 hours a day. He sent \nhis three daughters to college to be sure they had an education in \npost-high school.\n  He wanted to have health care. My father was crazy about Social \nSecurity and BlueCross and BlueShield. My father couldn't get on Social \nSecurity until the 1950s because small business was excluded. The \nreason he liked Social Security was that he worried about my mother and \nhe worried about his girls. He was worried that if he died, would his \nown insurance--my father had insurance. My father was a planner and a \nprovider--a planner and a provider--but he worried about whether that \nwould be enough to take care of us. So when he was eligible for Social \nSecurity, he said: I will pay my fair share so if anything happens, \nfine, and if nothing happens, I am glad to pay my fair share.\n  As a small businessman, he didn't have access to big markets, but \nthrough the Maryland Grocers Association--again, in the 1950s--he could \ncome in on BlueCross and BlueShield. He wanted health insurance for \nhimself, for my mother, for his daughters, and, if he could, for the \nfew people who worked for him because he knew that people were one \nfinancial bankruptcy away if a big illness happened.\n  What my father faced in the 1950s America is facing now in 2013.\n  So what does ObamaCare do? It improves access for 35 million \nAmericans who are without health insurance. It ends the punitive \npractices of insurance companies, one of which is gender \ndiscrimination. The other is the preexisting condition denials. It also \nstrengthens Medicare in a way that actually reduces health costs. Data \nhas been released in the last several days that actually shows health \ncare costs are going down, and it is not because of the recession. It \nis because our reforms\n\n[[Page S1732]]\n\nare going into effect, such as the famous Pronovost checklist developed \nat Johns Hopkins University that was quoted in another study: If we \nwash our hands and take care of certain things in the OR, we won't get \nan infection. And if we don't get infections, we don't stay in the \nhospital longer than necessary.\n  I chaired the quality initiatives committee that examined how we \ncould, through improvements in quality, not only save lives but would \nit save money, and the answer was a resounding yes. I didn't make that \nup.\n  They said: Mikulski, you are a social worker. What do you know about \ndelivering health care?\n  It wasn't my idea. I went to learned societies, such as the Institute \nof Medicine, that said to err is human, but it is also costly. I am not \ntalking about the medical malpractice stuff--infections, returning \nadmissions to hospitals within 10 days or 30 days because of the way \npeople are often discharged, the issue of prevention.\n  I am the author of the so-called preventive amendment that went into \nthe health care bill.\n  What was that all about? It meant that early detection and screenings \nsave lives--early detection and screenings save lives. That means if \nyou get your mammogram, if you get your PSA test for a man, you are \nmore likely to find it.\n  But it is not only for that dread, awful ``C'' word. Let's take a \n``D'' word: diabetes. A lot of people walk around and do not know they \nhave diabetes or high blood pressure. Both are silent killers. They can \nresult in strokes or death. If you have undetected diabetes, it can \nkill you through a coma and other things, but it can also kill you \nslowly. The consequences of prolonged diabetes can result in the loss \nof eyesight, the loss of a kidney, diabetic myopathy, where you cannot \nwalk. And if you come in so late, you are often--rather than facing an \namputation, wouldn't it have been better to find it 10 years before and \nget you into the right program, with the right diabetic educator, to \nmake sure we not only control your diabetes but we are not paying for \namputations, which is a heartbreak for the family and the person and a \nbudget buster to us?\n  This is what prevention is all about. It is not some gooshy-pooh \nthing. It is not like a slogan on a cereal box. This is the real deal. \nIf you find certain of these chronic conditions sooner, you can manage \ntheir escalation. That helps the family and the patient. It also helps \ncontrol our costs.\n  This is what we are talking about. This is why we care so much. And \nfor women, we were helped through this bill, dealing with gender \ndiscrimination, preexisting conditions. Children were helped. And now, \nright now--because ObamaCare is not fully implemented--it stops \ninsurance companies from denying families health insurance or charging \nsky-high premiums because their child has a preexisting condition.\n  What are we talking about here? We are talking about autism. We are \ntalking about type 1 diabetes. We are talking about even children who \nhave arthritis.\n  The other day I had such a poignant thing happen. I was dashing to \nthe elevator, and there was a family with a young lady, a young girl \nabout my height, but about--well, she was 13 and a tween. When they \nshowed me their picture of the last time we met, that tween, that young \nlady, was in a wheelchair. We do not think of someone around 11 or 9 \nhaving arthritis, but she does. This is going to be a chronic condition \nwith this young lady. But through the work of NIH, other great \nresearch, and working with a biologic that was used for other medical \nissues but allowed under FDA to work with her, under very strictly \ncontrolled conditions, with parental consent, of course, this young \nlady stood next to me. We laughed and we joked, back to back, because \nthe little girl that was in the wheelchair is now a tween, and she is a \nlot taller than I am. We had a good laugh. But I will tell you, when I \ngot on that elevator I had a good cry, and I was so emotional about it, \nI even feel it today.\n  What are we doing here? Don't we want to give this little girl a \nbreak? When her mother and father applied for health insurance, do we \nwant the schoolmarmish no--the nos of the insurance company saying: No, \nthat kid has arthritis. We cannot insure you.\n  That kid does have arthritis, but she is walking today. She is \nstanding proud with her mother and father, joking with a U.S. Senator, \ndoing well in school. Isn't that what we want for our country and for \nour young people? Why would we want to repeal legislation that does \nthat?\n  I could talk a lot about this bill. I feel so strongly about the \nincredible infrastructure we have in our United States--NIH, academic \ncenters of excellence, learned societies from IOM to the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics that have advised us along the way--all of us \nworking together. The biologic was developed by the private sector--the \nprivate sector--working with doctors, working with FDA, to say: Can we \ntry an off-label that meets all the ethical things where children are \ninvolved?\n  We did it, and look at the story. That is just one story. We are a \ncountry of 300 million people. That story is being acted out every \nsingle day, and it is being acted out right now in the ER. If you came \nto the ER with me at Johns Hopkins, the University of Maryland, at \nMercy Hospital, are there people who are there from trauma? Yes. Are \nthere people there who were in an automobile accident? Yes. I was there \n3 years ago myself with a fall coming out of church. Yes. But over 70 \npercent who are there are there because they do not have health \ninsurance. And they are using a thousand dollars a visit being in \nthere. What kind of system is that?\n  So if we repeal the President's Affordable Care Act, the consequences \non families, the consequences on business, will be horrific. We are \nsimply shifting the cost rather than solving the problem.\n  Are there reforms necessary? Yes. Do the Senators from Texas and \nUtah, who spoke, offer suggestions? Yes. But let's let ObamaCare go \nforward. Let's evaluate, let's do due diligence, and let's do oversight \nand make sure health reforms we have instituted are working, but do not \nrepeal it. We will endanger lives, and we will endanger our economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nuntil 2 p.m. be equally divided between Senator Cruz and myself or our \ndesignees; that at 2 p.m. the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the \nCruz amendment; that there be no amendments in order to the Cruz \namendment prior to the vote; further, that upon the disposition of the \nCruz amendment, the next amendment in order be an amendment offered by \nSenator Harkin relative to Labor-HHS appropriations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nin the quorum call be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I rise to speak on the pending question, \nwhich is the Cruz amendment, to defund ObamaCare. I appreciate him \noffering the amendment on this very relevant issue. I am glad we are \ntalking again about it.\n  When I ran for office 2 years ago, this was one of the central \nissues. There has been a court decision since then. We need to \nunderstand, court decisions are about the constitutionality of \nsomething. They do not speak to its policy wisdom. That is what this \ndebate is about today. I think it is important because since the \nelection--and even going into the election--we had lost some view on \nthis.\n\n[[Page S1733]]\n\n  But let me begin by saying health insurance is a problem in the \nUnited States. There is no doubt about it. I think that to be in \nopposition to the health care bill is not to say that we think nothing \nshould happen. On the contrary, I know health insurance is a major \nproblem for millions of Americans. Its affordability is a problem. Its \naccess is a problem, the ability of people to get the kind of health \ncoverage they want.\n  In fact, when I was speaker of the Florida House--I had the honor of \nbeing that for 2 years in Florida--we actually worked on some ideas \nthat created a marketplace where the private insurers and others could \ncome together and create creative packages for people. That is the kind \nof insurance you need. Not everybody needs the same health insurance. \nLet me give you an example.\n  A family of four with two children--I have four children--I promise \nyou, you are going to wind up in the pediatrician's office quite a bit, \nfor everything and all kinds of stuff. We are very blessed. My \nchildren, thank God, are very healthy. And even then, there are issues \nwhere you need to bring them, whether it is primary care, whether it is \nvaccinations, whether it is a cold that does not go away--whatever it \nmay be. I think it is so critically important to have that. So families \nin that circumstance need a certain type of coverage.\n  Then there are other people, people I know who are in their mid to \nlate twenties. They never go to the doctor. But if they ever get sick, \nit is probably going to be, unfortunately, something very bad. So those \nfolks maybe would rather have a plan that covers them upfront with some \nprimary care coverage--maybe a higher deductible that you could pay \nwith a health savings account--but on the back end some catastrophic \nhospitalization costs so if you truly get sick, God forbid, you have \nthe opportunity to have the kind of coverage you need.\n  The point is everybody needs different kinds of health care coverage. \nMy hope is that this country and the Federal Government--to the extent \nit has a role to play in all this--would help incentivize the creation \nof marketplaces for those sorts of innovative health ideas.\n  As I said, not everybody needs the same health insurance. That is why \nthere are some principles that should have guided us when this was \ndebated before I got here and should guide us going forward.\n  For example, I think one of our guiding principles should be that \nAmericans should be able to buy health insurance from any company in \nthe country that is willing to sell it to them. Right now, health \ninsurance is regulated at the State level. In essence, these States \nhave mandates as to what insurance companies must offer in order to \nsell insurance in that State, and you cannot buy insurance if it does \nnot have all of those. The equivalent would be of saying: You either \nhave to buy a Cadillac Escalade or you have to buy nothing. Some people \ndo not want a car that is that big and that fancy. They need something \nthat is a little different.\n  The point is those choices are not available to consumers. We should \nstart with an organizing principle by saying every American should be \nable to buy health insurance they want from any company in America that \nis willing to sell it to them.\n  Another part of that is you should be able to buy health insurance \nfor yourself. Let me tell you why that is problematic. If your employer \nbuys the health insurance for you, they do not have to pay taxes on the \nmoney. Taxes are not paid on the money that is used to buy that health \ninsurance. But if you buy it for yourself, it is income, it is treated \nas income. You have to pay tax on it. That is problematic for a couple \nreasons. No. 1, some businesses and some employers would rather give \nthem the health care money so they can go out and buy the plan they \nwant. Others would want to buy you plans or give you options among \ndifferent plans.\n  Federal employees know very well what that is like. Let me tell you \nwhat a Federal employee gets. A Federal employee gets a book. In that \nbook you get to choose between--depending on where you live--a bunch of \ndifferent plans. You go right down the graph, and it tells you: This is \nhow much this plan offers, this is how much you have to pay in premiums \nper month, this is how much you are going to owe in copayments if you \ngo to a doctor, if you go to a specialist, if you go to a hospital.\n  How many people in America get that choice? How many people in \nAmerica get the same choices on buying health care that their \nCongressmen and their Senators get? Very few. To me, that is a serious \nproblem.\n  The good news about this--imagine now, for a moment, a country where \npeople control their health care dollars, where you got to buy the \ninsurance you wanted from the company you wanted. Let me tell you what \nthe market is going to do. It is going to react to that. What the \nmarket is going to do--when there are people out there who are going to \nhave choices over how they spend their health care dollars--they are \ngoing to start creating insurance packages that people want to buy. \nThey are going to realize: We have a bunch of 25, 27, 29-year-olds in \nthe United States who do not get sick. We should create special \npackages of insurance for them. They are going to realize: We have a \nlot of families out there who can afford to pay ``X'' amount of money \nfor a family coverage plan. We should go out and create a special plan \nfor families like them.\n\n  By the way, along the lines of this level of flexibility, you could \nsee where small businesses all of a sudden can get together with other \nsmall businesses. As an example, a small chamber of commerce in a \nmidsize city somewhere can decide to bring all of those companies \ntogether. Together they can buy health insurance for their employees. \nIt is hard to buy group coverage if you only have four or five \nemployees. But if you can get together with a bunch of other companies \nthat have three, four, five employees, all of a sudden you have a \nbuying pool. That buying pool gives you leverage and power to go out \nand create plans for all of your employees.\n  There is no one size fits all. We should have that kind of \nflexibility in our insurance marketplace. We do not. These are not \ngoing to cure everything, but these are important steps forward.\n  By the way, I would be remiss in talking about medicine to not talk \nabout the malpractice insurance rates, especially for specialties. Do \nnot underestimate what a significant impediment that is for some people \nto go into the medical profession or to stay in the medical profession.\n  Right up front, let me tell you, if a doctor is negligent, if a \ndoctor commits malpractice, you should have a right to recover your \neconomic damages, and there should be some level of punitive damages to \nencourage people not to do that in the future and to be careful. The \nproblem is it has gone beyond that. In many States we have a crisis \nwhen it comes to litigation and medicine. People are not just suing \nbecause, unfortunately, something went wrong. They are suing on \noutcomes. They are not just suing because the treatment was bad. The \nresult is that doctors practice defensive medicine.\n  You go to a doctor, you go to a hospital, they order a slew of tests. \nIt is not because you need them, but because they want to make sure \nthey are covered; that if they ever wind up in a court they can be able \nto say to the jury: Look at all of those tests I ordered--even though \nmost of them might not have been necessary. Who do you think pays for \nthat? We do.\n  It is worse than that. There are places like in Florida where \nobstetricians do not even have coverage at all. They go bare. They hire \nlawyers to protect their assets so they cannot be sued. I know true \nstories of obstetricians who will not see certain patients anymore \nbecause they are afraid of the outcome of what may happen.\n  So I think we need to look at, perhaps, not as a part of the \ninsurance situation but in health care across the States, a way to \nincentivize States to pass medical malpractice reform that protects \npatients. People should always have the right to access the court \nsystem for wrongdoing, and especially to be compensated for their \neconomic damages. If a doctor commits malpractice and you cannot work \nanymore, all of those lost wages that you are not going to be able to \nwork for in the future, you should be able to be rewarded for that.\n  If we allow doctors to continue to be sued in this country as an \nindustry,\n\n[[Page S1734]]\n\nwhich is what it has become, people are not going to go to medical \nschool.\n  Here is another problem we are starting to see. A lot of young people \nin medical school do not want to go into the complex issues anymore. \nThey do not want to become brain surgeons. They do not want to become \nOB-GYNs. They want to go into some other specialty that in addition to \noffering better hours--your beeper does not go off if you are a plastic \nsurgeon at 3:00 in the morning. In addition to that, they do not have \nto worry about liability. Let me tell you, that is a problem. In \nFlorida, most of our cardiologists are over the age of 50. What does \nthat mean 10 years from now? That means we are not going to have enough \ncardiologists. It is discouraging people from going into very important \nprofessions in medicine because they are afraid they are going to get \nsued--not for doing something wrong but because things did not turn out \nwell in treatment.\n  Let me put on the record that I am not against people being able to \nsue a negligent doctor. In fact, I think negligent doctors should not \nonly be sued, they should lose their license. I am just saying, if we \ngo too far, like anything else in the world, you are going to lose \npeople from medicine. They are going to decide not to go in it.\n  Let's talk about this issue for a moment and the amendment that is \nbefore us. The problem with ObamaCare is that it is a one-size-fits-all \napproach to the entire country. The health care needs of Americans are \nvery different. No. 1, they are very different geographically depending \non where you live; No. 2, they are very different depending on your \nfamily situation, your health situation, et cetera.\n  Now, some people are very sick. They are chronically ill. That is \nwhere we can have a conversation about high-risk pools because these \npeople are very difficult to insure. If someone is sure to get sick, it \nis hard to find an insurance for them because you are guaranteed to be \nsick. So we have to find a solution for that problem. That is where \nconversations about high-risk pools at the State level are a valid \nthing to talk about. But beyond that, I think people should have \nflexibility. That is not what ObamaCare does.\n  I understand that people read the newspapers and say: This is good. \nWe are going to get a health care plan. We are going to be able to buy \ninsurance. My boss is going to be forced to give me health insurance.\n  That is not how it is going to work out, guys. That is not how things \nwork out in the real world. We are already starting to see the impacts \nof it. What is amazing to me is as this law begins to develop, as \npeople start to see the true impact and the unintended or maybe even \nthe intended consequences of this law, I predict right now that the \nnumber of people who were excited about ObamaCare is going to dwindle \ndramatically.\n  The proof is how many groups have come here already and asked to be \nexempted. How many unions, how many other groups have raised their \nhands and said: Please do not make us live under the laws that we \nsupported. Do not make us live under their laws that we held rallies \nfor. Do not make us live under these laws that we bragged about because \nit has a negative impact on us. And some of them are coming to bear \nright now.\n  No. 1 is the cost. When this bill was passed, they said it would be \nabout $1 trillion--$940 billion to be exact. Now we know it is $1.7 \ntrillion in gross cost over the next few years.\n  How about tax hikes? Absolutely, because starting in 2014, the IRS is \ngoing to create a problem for millions of Americans and small \nbusinesses. Basically, if you are not buying health insurance of the \nkind they want, of the kind the law requires--not just health \ninsurance, a specific kind of health insurance--you are going to owe \nthe IRS a fine. Think about that for a moment. If you are a small \nbusiness owner or an individual, and you are not buying the health \ninsurance the government says you must have, you now are going to have \nto pay a fine every year to the IRS.\n\n  Some people are going to do the math. They are going to say it is \ncheaper to pay the fine than it is to buy the health insurance. That is \nproblematic, but it is a cost.\n  We are trying to grow our economy. That is the only solution to our \nproblems. Over the next couple of weeks, we are going to debate \nbudgets, we are going to debate continuing resolutions, and the word \n``debt'' is going to come up. We cannot tax our way out of this debt. \nThere is no tax increase that gets us out of this debt. To my own \nparty, I say while we always have to have fiscal discipline, you cannot \ncut your way out of this debt alone either. The only real solution to \nour debt problems--and the debt matters because it is killing jobs in \nAmerica--the only real solution to our debt problems is a combination \nof two things: rapid, robust economic growth.\n  If we can grow our economy at 4 percent a year, we could generate $3 \ntrillion for debt reduction over the next decade, and we would create \nmillions of jobs and pull people out of poverty and strengthen our \nmiddle class, which is the source of our exceptionalism as a country.\n  The second thing we need is fiscal discipline on future spending. \nThis bill violates both. This bill violates both. It hurts economic \ngrowth because the only way you are going to grow your economy is if \nyou make America a better place to create jobs and start businesses. \nThat is how economic growth is created. When someone takes money they \nhave or money they borrowed or money someone invested in them, and they \nuse it, they risk it to open a new business or to grow an existing one, \nas the idea works, they start hiring people, and those people now are \nmaking a middle-class salary. Those people are now buying things and \nspending money, creating jobs and opportunity for others.\n  That is the formula for growth and prosperity. This hurts that \nbecause what you are now saying is, in addition to everything else you \nhave to put up with in America--all the State and local regulations, \nall the complicated Tax Code stuff, the natural downturn in the \neconomy, globalism and the changes that it has brought--in addition to \nall of that, here is one more thing you are going to have to do: You \nare either going to have to offer health insurance of a certain kind or \nyou are going to owe the IRS a fine.\n  I promise you that is not the kind of thing chambers of commerce put \non their pamphlets when they try to attract businesses to their \ncommunities or their States. This is not going to help in job creation. \nThe tax hikes are a big problem. It is especially bad for small \nbusinesses because they have this arbitrary number of people--50 \nemployees or more--who have to do certain things. OK. So what do you \nthink a lot of businesses are going to do? I know people. They have \nalready told me about this.\n  If you have 51 employees, this is a huge incentive to only have 49 \nemployees. So you think about that for a moment. If you own a small \nroad-paving company with 50 full-time employees or 51 full-time \nemployees, you sit down with your accountant to do your math for next \nyear. Your accountant will tell you: By the way, if you get rid of a \ncouple of employees, this is how much money this is going to save you \nbecause of ObamaCare.\n  So do we want to have an incentive in our laws to have businesses get \nrid of workers because it helps them avoid certain costs mandated by \ngovernment? This is happening. This is not pie in the sky, this is \ngoing to happen. There are people planning to do that already. It is \nhappening right now.\n  Here is another thing. How about part-time workers versus full-time \nworkers. We have already seen evidence of this across the board. But I \nwill tell you where you are seeing it already is in people who own a \nbunch of franchises. So you own a chain of Kentucky Fried Chickens or a \nchain of McDonalds, and all of a sudden you have incentive to move as \nmany of those people as you can to part time because they do not \ntrigger the ObamaCare mandates either. So now you have all of these \nbusinesses across America that have an incentive that we have created \nin this law--I say ``we,'' the people who were here when this passed--a \nperverse incentive to cut people's hours so they do not trigger the \nmandate. These are horrible consequences that are going to have an \nimpact on our country at a time when we should be growing our economy \nand creating middle-class prosperity, not working against it.\n\n[[Page S1735]]\n\n  So my prediction is that when they start to fully implement this over \nthe next 12 to 18 months, it is going to be an epic disaster. Not \nbecause it was ill-intentioned, per se. I think the goal of providing \nan environment where everybody can buy affordable health insurance is \nsomething we should take very seriously and something we have to work \non. You cannot have a strong, stable middle class if people cannot \nafford the cost of living. You cannot have a strong and stable middle \nclass if people do not have access to quality health care at an \naffordable price. We should work on that. We should work on that very \nhard. But we have to do that with balance.\n  This is not balanced. This is an across-the-board application to the \nentire country that is going to hurt a lot of people. There are people \nin America who are going to lose hours at work because of this bill. \nThere are people in America who are going to lose the health insurance \nthey have which they are happy with because of this bill. There are \npeople in America who are going to have to lay off people, and \ntherefore there are people in America who are going to lose their jobs \nbecause of this bill. Our debt is going to grow.\n  I hope we will pass this amendment. I hope we will defund this \nprogram. It was ill-designed. As the true ramifications of this bill \nbegin to apply over the next few months and the next couple of years, \nwe are going to be right here on this floor trying to fix it because \nthis country cannot be what it is meant to be if it has to deal with \nsomething like this hanging around its neck.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Before the Senator from Florida leaves the floor, I \njust wanted to commend him for his observations. I listened carefully \nto what the Senator from Florida had to say. It reminds me of the \nprediction many of us made when it was passed: It would be the single \nworst piece of legislation in modern times.\n  Everything the President predicted would happen has not happened. \nPremiums have gone up; jobs have been destroyed. The single biggest \nstep in the direction of Europeanizing our country that we could \npossibly have taken we took with ObamaCare.\n  So I just wanted to commend the Senator from Florida for his \ncomments. They are right on the mark.\n  I also want to thank Senator Cruz for offering this amendment. I \noffered it in the last Congress myself. There is no way to fix this \nthing, no way to fix it. It needs to be pulled out by its roots. The \nSenator from Florida pointed out it is also destroying jobs.\n  I was on a tele-townhall the other night. A restaurant manager called \nin and said exactly what the Senator from Florida just said, that they \nwere moving to lower their employment and to have more part-time \nworkers in order to try to deal with the impending ObamaCare explosion.\n  So I am sure the Senator from Florida is running into that in his \nState as well.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Let me say a couple of things--actually, a true world \nexample. Here is the startling thing about it. A lot of people are not \nfully aware of what this means yet. This may surprise some of us who \nare here every day or the people who cover politics on a daily basis, \nbut most Americans are not tuned into C-SPAN 24 hours a day. They get \ntheir news in tidbits in the morning when they are making their coffee. \nThey have the radio on. They hear some stuff on the radio on the way to \nwork. Then they go to work for 10, 12, 14 hours to run a business. They \nget home, they have to do homework with the kids, make dinner, put them \nto bed. Maybe they get to watch an hour or two of TV. They wake up \ntomorrow morning and they do it all over again. They are not in touch \nwith all of this on a daily basis. They have lives to lead.\n  You will be surprised how many small business men and women and how \nmany employees around the country are not even aware of this yet, do \nnot even realize the decisions they are going to have to make next \nyear. So if you are in a business that has anywhere between 45, 55, 60 \nemployees, when you sit down at the end of this year with your \nplanner--be it your accountant, your lawyer, whatever it is you use, \nyour human resources people--and do next year's planning, they are \ngoing to tell you: OK, next year we have this new law. This new law \nsays we have to offer this kind of insurance. Here are your choices: \nOption No. 1 is you can offer the insurance, and this is how much more \nit is going to cost than what you are paying right now. Option No. 2 is \ndo not offer any insurance and pay a fine to the IRS every year from \nnow on. Here is how much that is going to be. Option No. 3 is to let \nsome people go so you do not have to do any of this.\n  I am telling you, a lot of these people are going to say: You know \nwhat. It breaks our heart; we do not want to do it; it is not good for \nour business, but of the three options, the only one that is going to \nallow us to survive is to let some people go. That is not good for us. \nThat is not good for us.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Well, the Senator from Florida may have mentioned that \nearlier in his remarks. But so far there are 20,000 new pages of \nregulations--so far--a stack this high.\n  This is absolutely indecipherable by very intelligent people, and \nthey are just getting started.\n  I want to thank the Senator from Florida for his comments. I think \nthey are right on the mark. This is a huge mistake for our country. \nHopefully, someday, maybe even beginning with this amendment, we may \nbegin to undo this massive mistake we made a few years ago.\n  Madam President, we have been saying for 3 years this bill will be \ntoo expensive; it won't do what it promised. Every day we are seeing \nfurther proof of that.\n  The Federal Reserve said it will cost jobs--the Federal Reserve not \nthe RNC. We predicted that. Yesterday we had a glimpse of the \napplication process for ObamaCare. It turns out applying for it will be \nas difficult as doing your taxes.\n  Today there is another AP story saying some folks will see their \ninsurance bill double next year as a result of this law. As I \nindicated, so far there are 20,000 pages of regulations and many more \nare expected. This bill is an unmitigated disaster for our country, an \nabsolute disaster.\n  I applaud Senator Cruz for offering this amendment. I strongly \nsupport his efforts. Not a single Member of my party in the House and \nthe Senate voted for this bill in the first place. We need to get this \nbill off the books and straighten out our country. This would be a big \nstep in the direction of achieving that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I assume a number of my colleagues have \nseen the movie ``Lincoln.''\n  One particularly brief but poignant moment of that movie showed the \nPresident's staff discouraging him from spending so much time talking \nto regular people, leaving the White House and inviting normal people \nwho weren't involved in politics every day or didn't work in the White \nHouse into the White House to talk.\n  They were saying: Mr. President, you need to run this war. You have \nso much to do. You shouldn't be meeting with people as much.\n  President Lincoln said to his staff: I need my regular public opinion \nbaths.\n  Just listening to the last few speakers, particularly the Republican \nleader, I think it is more important more people in this institution go \nout and talk to real people who are affected by this health care law. \nThere is the 25-year-old who has already benefited from staying on her \nmother's health care plan, the person in the high-risk pool who has \ninsurance now--such as a friend of mine in Port Clinton in Ottawa \nCounty, Ohio, does--because of this law. People have seen the consumer \nprotections. They haven't lost their insurance because they were \nexpensive for an insurance company.\n  My colleagues need to get a public opinion bath, walk around their \nStates a little more and listen to people outside of the country clubs \nand outside of the trade associations who are charged ideologically and \nnot really particularly open about these kinds of issues.\n  I rise to oppose the amendment offered by Senator Cruz, the badly \nnamed ``Restore Growth First'' amendment, which would prohibit \nresources included in the continuing resolution to implement the \nAffordable Care Act.\n\n[[Page S1736]]\n\n  Specious claims about how the health law will harm our economy have \nalready been debunked by the hundreds of Ohioans who are able to have \nannual wellness visits, by the tens of thousands of young adults \nstaying on their parents' insurance plans, by the seniors who are \nseeing the doughnut hole coverage gap closing with real savings on \nprescription costs.\n  It has been debunked by Americans who are no longer denied coverage \nbecause of a preexisting condition, by the Americans who are not forced \nto pay more for insurance because of a preexisting condition, by women \nwho may now rely on affordable, accessible reproductive health \nservices; and starting in 2014, Americans who have not been able to \nafford health insurance in the private market will be able to \ncomparison shop, if needed, to purchase insurance.\n  These much needed health care reforms which will benefit Americans \nnext year are already benefiting Americans and have been for a couple \nof years. Continued implementation of these reforms is crucial for \nimproving the quality of care and bending the cost curve.\n  I agree with Senator Cruz on one thing: health spending is related to \nthe economy and to the deficit. Let's be clear. We know the health care \nlaw will reduce the deficit by over $100 billion over the next decade. \nThese are Congressional Budget Office numbers, not Republican numbers \nor Democratic numbers. On the Cruz amendment, repealing the health care \nlaw would increase, not reduce, the deficit.\n  We know how it is helping people. There are 100,000 reasons in my own \nState of Ohio to stand up for this health care law and reject this \namendment: Nearly 97,000 of Ohio's young adults are now able to stay on \ntheir parents' plan until age 26.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Would the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. BROWN. I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent to be recognized at the end of \nthe Senator's remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Almost 100,000 of Ohio's young adults are now able to stay \non their parents' health plan. Seniors have saved almost $300 million \nin prescription drugs just since the passage of the health care law, \nwith an average per beneficiary savings of $774. And up to 147,000 \nsmall businesses in Ohio are eligible for tax credits.\n  Finally, thanks to the health law, more people in my home State and \nacross the Nation have access to free preventive services. As I said, \nthere are 100,000 reasons for Ohioans to like this law and oppose this \namendment.\n  There are 2 million Ohioans with private insurance who have gained \npreventive health services with no cost sharing. This means major \nillnesses may be detected earlier. It means decreasing treatment costs \nand human suffering over the long term.\n  The Affordable Care Act was the most promising initiative to control \nhealth care costs in decades. The health care law is about reducing \nhealth costs for consumers and investing in more affordable preventive \ncare for Americans.\n\n  The health care law is about containing costs as we extend insurance. \nIt means people, rather than going to the emergency room with a sick \nchild, may go to the family doctor and receive preventive care prior to \nthe child's ear infection becoming serious. Under the new medical loss \nratio rules health insurance plans must spend at least 80 percent of \npremium dollars on health care costs, not executive bonuses, not other \nadministrative expenses. In Ohio, 143,000 received over $11 million in \nrebates.\n  The Prevention and Public Health Fund is the part of the health care \nlaw which will give us test data about how to bend the cost curve \nthrough preventive programs. Ohioans received more than $17 million \nalready to prevent chronic diseases and decrease smoking rates.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BROWN. Certainly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would ask of the Senator, pending before the Senate is \nthe Cruz amendment which would literally remove any funding to \nimplement the Affordable Care Act, as I understand; is that correct?\n  Mr. BROWN. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. We have heard from the Republicans on the other side of \nthe aisle that they oppose this intrusion of government into health \ncare and creating health insurance exchanges so Americans who currently \ndon't have a choice in health insurance and want to get a different \npolicy, if they care to get one, would have a choice through the \nexchanges?\n  Mr. BROWN. This is what they have been saying, yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The premise behind this is the government shouldn't be \ninvolved in this, as I understand the Republican argument; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. BROWN. That is what they say.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Did I hear the Republican leader come to the floor and \nspeak about thousands of pages of regulations, government regulations, \nwhich will now be part of health care?\n  Mr. BROWN. You did.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator from Ohio, is he aware of \nthe fact every Member of the Senate has a government-administered \nhealth insurance plan?\n  Mr. BROWN. I am aware of it. I assume my colleagues are too.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is the Senator aware of any Senator on the Republican \nside who has come forward--and there may be one, I don't know--who has \nsaid: I am so opposed to government-administered health care, and as a \nSenator I will not take advantage of the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Program?\n  Mr. BROWN. I have not heard any say that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The same Senators who are critical of ObamaCare because \nthe government is involved in health care have themselves, their \nfamilies, and children protected by a government-administered health \ninsurance plan?\n  Mr. BROWN. It is my understanding this has been sort of the hypocrisy \nwe have woven through this debate over the last 3 years.\n  Mr. DURBIN. What is good enough for these Senators apparently is not \ngood enough for the rest of America?\n  Mr. BROWN. Apparently not good enough for a senior, not good enough \nfor somebody who is low income but working two $10-an-hour jobs, I \nguess it is not good enough for them.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is it not true the amendment by the Senator from Texas is \nbreathtaking because it says we eliminate all funding for the \nAffordable Care Act in terms of, for example, the extension of the \navailability of health insurance for children up to the age of 26?\n  As I understand the Cruz amendment, we couldn't fund that aspect of \nthe Affordable Care Act.\n  Mr. BROWN. The Cruz amendment doesn't just anticipate changes in the \nfuture, it takes away all these services which have been out there that \nI have been talking about: the thousands of people in Illinois, Ohio, \nand Wisconsin who have benefited; 25-year-olds, 22-year-olds, such as \nsomebody who graduates from Champagne, Urbana, Madison, or Columbus and \ndon't have insurance but have a job, are 23 years old and may stay on \ntheir parents' health plan. All of the preventive care literally \nhundreds of thousands of seniors in Ohio now receive with no copay or \nno deductible would all be wiped away. All the provisions people have \nbenefited from already would be taken away by this amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. This breath-taking Cruz amendment would actually say to \nthese families with children who are currently on the family policy up \nto the age of 26: It is over. Those kids are now on their own.\n  Mr. BROWN. These kids would be on their own, but the Senators who are \npushing this amendment would still have their health insurance, just to \nreiterate that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Cruz amendment does not eliminate the government----\n  Mr. BROWN. It doesn't take away the insurance for those people voting \non this amendment; that is correct.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, which \nprotects Senators and Congressmen, is not affected by the Cruz \namendment?\n  Mr. BROWN. My reading of it is it is not affected.\n  Mr. DURBIN. They don't hate that aspect of government-administered \nhealth insurance?\n\n[[Page S1737]]\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Apparently not.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is it also true the seniors who would receive benefits \nunder the Affordable Care Act, for example, annual physicals which are \navailable, those would be eliminated as well?\n  Mr. BROWN. In my State and the Senator's State, since his State is \nslightly larger than mine--over 1 million seniors in each State and \nhundreds of thousands in the Presiding Officer's State of Wisconsin--\nmillions of seniors have received some kind of preventive care, such as \nscreenings for diabetes, screenings for osteoporosis, and not paid a \ncopay or deductible. They have received their physicals and not had \ntheir deductibles, copayer deductibles, waived as a result of the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  The Cruz amendment would, while still protecting health insurance for \nSenator Cruz and others, wipe away those benefits for seniors.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is it also not true in the U.S. Capitol we have an \nAttending Physician's Office run by the U.S. Navy, a government entity, \nwhich makes itself available to each Senator if they care to pay a \nmonthly fee for annual physicals--a government-administered annual \nphysical for Senators?\n  Mr. BROWN. It is true. That is true. This is open to people \nregardless of how they vote on the Cruz amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Does the Cruz amendment eliminate this government-\nadministered physical exam which is available for Members of the \nSenate?\n  Mr. BROWN. It does not.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am starting to note a pattern here. The Senators who \nwish to do away with government-administered health care for everyone \nelse want to keep it for themselves. Does that pattern emerge from the \nSenator's analysis?\n  Mr. BROWN. We had this discussion back in 2009 and 2010 when we \ndebated this health care law, that Members of the House and Senate \ncontinue to receive health insurance.\n  I recall one House Member was unhappy during campaigning against the \nAffordable Care Act, as he recently came to the House. He didn't get \nhis insurance for the first month paid for by the government, as he \ntried to take away insurance for low-income, moderate-income people in \nmy State, my district and the Senator's State.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say Senator Cruz would certainly be able to offer \nan amendment which eliminated all government-administered health \ninsurance as it applies to any person in the United States. If he did \nthat, he would be consistent. Instead, what he has done is go after \nthose today who are struggling to find their own health insurance, \ncannot afford it, and are simply asking for the same option as Members \nof Congress have today: to be able to go to an insurance exchange and \nchoose the insurance plan that is best for them and their families. I \nthink it would be more consistent.\n  I ask the Senator from Ohio if he thinks it would be more consistent?\n  Mr. BROWN. I would like to see Senator Cruz or one of the supporters \nof the Cruz amendment offer an amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. I appreciate the words of the Senator from Illinois.\n  To close, Senator Durbin's comments accurately explain that there is \na bias in this institution on tax policy and health policy for some \nSenators to take care of themselves and people like them, a little more \nthan paying attention to the rest of the country. I think this \namendment shows this and is one more good reason to vote against the \nCruz amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, we have been discussing and debating \nObamaCare for 3 years--several years anyway. I have not heard the \nargument before where they say you have the same government-run plan. \nThat is not true. That is not true at all.\n  I have worked in the corporate world and been on the leadership part \nwhere we were making decisions and offered our employees the benefits \nof different companies. It could be Aetna, Blue Cross-Blue Shield or \nanybody else. We could make that determination as to what we wanted and \nthen we paid for it.\n  I don't think that argument has ever been used, to my memory. I \nwasn't coming down to talk about that, but I will, since I am a \ncosponsor of the Cruz amendment. I think anything you are able to do to \nget rid of ObamaCare is in our interests.\n  Right now, the attorney general in the State of Oklahoma is Scott \nPruitt. I spoke with him this morning. He has a lawsuit with an amended \ncomplaint challenging the implementation of ObamaCare. Scott Pruitt is \narguing the IRS is attempting to redefine ObamaCare's mandate tax in \norder to hike taxes on Oklahoma employees. That is what is happening \nright now in my State of Oklahoma. I don't know how the polling goes. I \nwould only say this: I sense an air of anxiety with a lot of these \npeople trying to support ObamaCare right now, because people have \ncaught on. People in the State of Oklahoma have caught on. In Oklahoma, \nwe would have to spend an additional $400 million over the next 10 \nyears on Medicaid in order to cover those who already qualify and will \nbe forced into the program--this government program we are talking \nabout--due to ObamaCare and the mandate. This money will be diverted \nfrom schools and from roads and other needs, public safety, in the \nState of Oklahoma. Our research shows that premiums in Oklahoma could \nincrease anywhere from 65 to 100 percent due to the coverage mandates \nrequired by ObamaCare. It is as if we are having this debate all over \nagain, but they are bringing up things now I have never heard of.\n\n  I want to mention one thing, and that is there is a friend of mine in \nOklahoma whose name is David Green. David Green several years ago \nstarted with one store, a thing called Hobby Lobby--1 store in the \nState of Oklahoma--and now he has 500 stores in 41 States and he has, I \ndon't know, I think it is over 50,000 employees. He is now facing a new \ntype of intimidation he has never faced in his life, and it is the \nintimidation of saying because of David Green's religious convictions \nagainst providing his employees with abortion-inducing drugs his \ncompany now faces fines amounting to $1.3 million a day.\n  All those pro-abortionists out there like this. This is wonderful. \nBut he is someone who has hired thousands of people in 41 States in \nthis country and is now providing all these benefits for Americans, and \nall he is saying is his religious convictions don't allow him to \nparticipate in abortion-inducing drugs. So he is under the threat right \nnow, if you do the math, of a $1.3-million-a-day fine. And I guess I am \nmore sensitive to this than I should be because I have known him from \nthe very beginning.\n  I want to speak briefly, because I know I have a couple of colleagues \nwho wish to speak. Does the Senator wish to make a UC to get in line?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Yes, I came to the floor today to support \nthe Cruz amendment. Does the Senator from Oklahoma still wish to speak?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes, I just wanted to ask whether the Senator wanted to \nlock himself in with a unanimous consent request while I finish on \nanother subject.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Yes. Madam President, I ask unanimous \nconsent to speak for up to 5 to 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I do cosponsor this amendment, and I \nwill be voting for it at 2 p.m. today. But there is another one that \nwill come up, amendment No. 28, and it could be coming up in a very \nshort time this afternoon, and I was afraid I wouldn't have a chance to \nmake a couple of comments about it.\n  I am cosponsoring this amendment by Senator Paul, and it withholds \nfunding to go to Egypt until Egypt's President Morsi declares he \nintends to abide by the Camp David peace accords, which have kept the \npeace between Egypt and Israel for over 30 years.\n  If you talk to any of your Israeli friends, they will tell you this \nis significant, and I appreciate the fact he recognizes that. In fact, \nthe bill I had\n\n[[Page S1738]]\n\nintroduced back in--well, I actually introduced it earlier, but \nreintroduced it on January 25 of this year--S. 207--calls for the \nsuspension of the shipment of F-16s and other military equipment and \nservices to Egypt until Morsi agrees to continue to uphold Egypt's \ncommitment under the 1979 Camp David peace accords.\n  A lot of people don't realize they have been our friend, and if you \nask any of your Israeli friends, they will tell you they are. It \nhappens that this President is a Muslim Brotherhood president. He is \nnot like the ones we have had in Egypt before. People who think of \nother countries having the same kind of system we have, they do not. \nRight now the military is a military we trained. There is a Major \nGeneral Elkeshky, who happens to be here now and who is a friend of \nmine, and he was trained at Fort Sill in Oklahoma. The majority of the \nmiddle-grade officers in Egypt have been trained in the United States. \nThey are our friends. And that is what we are getting at here.\n  So I made that qualification when I said we want to reduce the things \nwe are doing, and I was talking about military equipment--the F-16s--\nway back in January, until they make that commitment. I think that is a \nvery reasonable commitment.\n  The amendment that will be coming up, amendment No. 28, will be by \nSenator Paul and myself and it will talk about support for Egypt and go \ninto other areas of support over and above military equipment, saying \nthat until such time as they agree with what they have agreed to over \nthe last 30 years or so--that they will continue to be our friends--\nthen we want to withhold this. It is the only leverage we have. I said \nthis back in January, that the only leverage we have, in order to \nencourage them to come with us, is to say we are going to withhold some \nthings, and that is what we are doing.\n  So when that amendment comes up--of course, I still have my bill, S. \n207, and it is essentially the same as the Paul-Inhofe amendment. It is \nnot necessary to have them both in terms of a vote, but I think on one \nwe will have to have a vote, but it should tie in to what their \nbehavior has been in the past, what it should be in the future, so that \nwe don't have a Muslim Brotherhood guy running a country and we don't \nknow how our equipment is going to be used.\n  Our F-16s and other equipment, our tanks, have been used to \nparticipate in the defense of our friends in the Middle East, primarily \nIsrael and of ourselves. I am hoping we will get to that when we have a \nchance to have a vote on it.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Madam President, I thank the Senator from \nOklahoma for his comments.\n  I came to the floor to voice my support for the Cruz amendment. I \nwant to concentrate on the cost of the health care law, which is why we \nare asking in this amendment to defund that bill because we simply \ncan't afford it. So much of our budget already is not considered. \nFrequently, during negotiations on how we stabilize our deficit and our \ndebt situation, there are many items off the table, things such as \nMedicare and Social Security. As unsustainable as those programs are, \nthey are off the table in terms of negotiation. But if you want to take \na look at the problem with the health care law--ObamaCare--it is the \nfact that it is simply not affordable. I know the name of the bill is \nthe Affordable Care Act, but we simply can't afford it. Basic economics \n101 describes the problem, because ObamaCare will dramatically increase \nthe demand for health care. Thirty million more Americans--and let's \nface it, we all want those Americans to have access to affordable \nhealth care--will be accessing health care or trying to, demanding \nhealth care through some kind of program, such as Medicaid, while at \nthe same time the supply will be dramatically reduced. That is going to \nbe an economic disaster.\n  What I wish to do is put up a couple of charts and graphs showing the \ntrue cost. We don't talk about the true budget window when ObamaCare \nfully kicks in in the year 2016. This is based on the CBO estimate, and \nall we have had to do is extrapolate the final 3 years. Basically, it \nshows that ObamaCare won't cost the $1 trillion it was originally \nestimated to cost when it is fully implemented between 2016 and 2025. \nIt will actually cost $2.4 trillion, at a minimum. And, of course, it \nwill be paid for by these taxes, fees, and penalties, which I guess now \nare taxes, equaling about $1.4 trillion.\n  So given the $2.4 trillion worth of cost, we have $1 trillion worth \nof taxes--and, by the way, the majority of those or a great portion of \nthose taxes will be indirect on middle-income Americans--that leaves \nabout a $1 trillion hole in the current budget window. That is the $716 \nbillion that will apparently be taken out of Medicare providers. We are \nnot sure what will be happening in the full budget window, but that is \na $1 trillion deficit risk.\n  Again, these are all estimates, and I would argue in general that the \nFederal Government is not particularly good at estimating anything. \nBack when they first passed Medicare in the mid 1960s, they projected \nout 25 years and said Medicare would cost $12 trillion in 1990. In \nfact, it cost $110 trillion--over nine times the original estimate. I \ndon't believe the Federal Government has gotten better at estimating in \nthat intervening time period.\n  As a matter of fact, President Obama famously repeatedly said that if \nwe passed a health care law, by the end of his first term the cost of a \nfamily plan would actually decline by $2,500. Unfortunately, that \nguarantee has not come true. When President Obama took office, the \naverage cost of a family plan was a little over $12,000. If his promise \nhad come true, we would be looking at a family cost of $10,000. In \nfact, the cost of a family plan today is now $15,000. Again, that is \nsomewhat of a broken promise.\n  But let's take a look at what I think is the greatest risk in terms \nof cost projections by the CBO in that estimate of the total cost of \nObamaCare--the $2.4 trillion we are talking about in the true budget \nwindow. The CBO estimated only 1 million people net would lose their \nemployer-sponsored care and get dumped in the exchanges with the \nsubsidies. But it is going to be far worse than that, because 160 to \n180 million Americans access their health care through their employers. \nI was one of those employers. I purchased health care for more than 31 \nyears. The decision employers are going to be making in terms of \nwhether to carry health care has dramatically changed under the health \ncare law. Now the decision is going to be: Do I pay $15,000 for a \nfamily plan and then try to comply with the now 20,000 pages of law--\nrules and regulations?\n  Leader McConnell printed out those 20,000 pages. You can see it in \nthe hallway. It is an enormous burden for anybody trying to comply with \nthat.\n  Anyway, the decision is: Do I pay $15,000 trying to comply with \n20,000 pages of rules and regulations or do I pay the $2,000 to $3,000 \nfine--the penalty--and in so doing I am not exposing my employees to \nfinancial ruin, I am making them eligible for huge subsidies in the \nexchange? If an individual has a median household income of $64,000, \nthey will be eligible for $10,000 in those exchanges--$10,000 worth of \nsubsidies. Who isn't going to take that deal?\n  And that is my point. As employers, we will drop coverage. Employers \nare incentivized to do so. So rather than 1 million Americans losing \ntheir employer-sponsored health care and enjoying those subsidies, \nthere will be tens of millions.\n  One of the amendments I will be offering in this budget process will \nbe asking the CBO to provide the worst-case scenario: What happens if \nthe McKinsey study is true, 30 percent of employers will drop coverage \nor 50 or 100 percent? It will be a simple amendment to get the worst-\ncase scenario.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I come to the floor today to speak in \nsupport of the Cruz amendment and I do that as a doctor, as someone who \nhas practiced medicine for 25 years taking care of families all around \nthe State of Wyoming.\n  When we entered into the discussion about health care, and then \nultimately the discussion of what became the Obama health care law, I \nwould come to the floor and say, yes, we need to do\n\n[[Page S1739]]\n\nhealth care reform. Patients know what they want. They want the care \nthey need, from a doctor they choose, at lower cost. Because cost was \nthe driver of all of this.\n  Then we got into the debate and into the discussions and what we \nended up with was a health care law over 2,000 pages long. I said then: \nDoes that make a lot of sense? Let's go back to what one of our \nFounding Fathers said. James Madison, the father of the Constitution, \nsaid: Congress shall pass no laws so voluminous they cannot be read nor \nso incoherent they cannot be understood. Regrettably, that is exactly \nwhat we got with this health care law--a law so voluminous it cannot be \nread and so incoherent it cannot be understood.\n  And when you say: Well, how do we know it is so long that it could \nnot be read, how voluminous, well, Nancy Pelosi said it herself. She \nsaid: First you have to pass it before you get to find out what is in \nit. Well, the American people now know what is in the health care law. \nThey know it, and they don't like it.\n  I have had townhall meetings all around the State of Wyoming. When \nyou go to a community and talk about the health care law and ask the \nsimple question, Do you believe that under the President's health care \nlaw you will be paying more for your health care, all the hands go up. \nAnd then you ask the question, Do you believe that under the \nPresident's health care law the quality of your care and the \navailability of your care will actually go down, and again all the \nhands go up. That is why as of today this health care law continues to \nbe very unpopular. Nationwide, more people think the health care law is \ndoing harm than believe it is doing well.\n  Let's take a look at what the President promised during the \ndiscussion and why some people supported it.\n  First of all, the President said that under the health care law, if \nyou like the plan you have, if you like the care you have, you can keep \nit.\n  We now know from many studies and reports that is not the case. It \nseemed in having just read the law as it was being discussed that you \nweren't going to be able to keep it, but it wasn't until now that \npeople realize more and more that they are not able to keep what they \nhad if they liked it.\n  The other thing the President promised is that under his health care \nlaw, insurance premiums for a family would drop by $2,500, he said, by \nthe end of his first term in office. The first term has come and gone, \nand what families around the country are seeing is that health care \npremiums didn't go down, they actually went up--up quite a bit, up by \nover $3,000 per family.\n  Why is it that the law is so unpopular? There are many reasons, but \npart of it is this so-called individual mandate--the mandate that the \ngovernment can come into your home and tell you that you have to buy a \ngovernment-approved product. Many people around the country believe it \nis unconstitutional. It actually went to the Supreme Court, and the \nCourt ruled. The Court ruled that it was not unconstitutional. But it \nis still unworkable, it is still very unpopular, and it is absolutely \nunaffordable for us as a nation.\n  I talk to physicians and I talk to the nurses who take care of \npatients. This health care law is bad for patients, it is bad for \nproviders--the nurses and doctors who take care of those patients--and \nit is terrible for the American taxpayers.\n  The most interesting thing to me in the last week has been the report \ncalled the ``Beige Book,'' which the Federal Reserve comes out with \nevery month. They travel around the country and ask their Federal \nReserve people what is happening in this community, that community, in \nthis part of the country, in that region of the country. And what is \nhappening to the economy? In this past month's report, it said that \nspecifically as a result of the health care law, businesses aren't \nhiring. The Federal Reserve has called this a drag on the economy--the \nhealth care law.\n  How can that be? Well, there are a couple of things. One is the huge \nuncertainty--businesses not knowing what the impacts of the health care \nlaw specifically in terms of dollars and cents are going to be. But \nthere are a couple of components of the health care law that are really \nhurting in terms of businesses hiring people. One is that things kick \nin for businesses once a business has 50 employees. So if a business \nhas 49 full-time employees and they are trying to expand and they have \nmore business and they want to hire more people, they have to decide, \nwhat is the cost of that additional 50th employee?\n  Well, the costs are dramatic because it then kicks that business into \nthe huge expenses of supplying government-approved health care--not \nnecessarily health care or insurance at a level that those employees \nmight need or want or that business can afford, no; a government level \nof approved health care that may be much more than that individual \nneeds or wants or can afford because the government is saying: We know \nwhat is best, the government knows what is best for you, the family in \nthis community or that community and people working for that business. \nSo that is part of it. So those folks aren't hiring.\n  Remember, I said full-time employees. They define full time as 30 \nhours or more a week. So we have the businesses known as the 29ers, \nwhere they are, for purposes of not having additional full-time \nemployees, hiring people for 29 hours a week. There have been reports \nin the press of different businesses where people are working two \ndifferent jobs at two different businesses because they can only get \npart-time work, and the reason they can only get part-time work is \nbecause when they are part-time workers, the businesses aren't mandated \nto pay for very expensive health care which makes it much more \ndifficult to be successful as a business and to keep hiring more \npeople.\n  There was a report of a Five Guys hamburger chain in one community. \nThey said: We are not going to expand, we are not going to build \nanother, we are not hiring any more full-time people, and we are going \nto cut the hours of the people we have. We are putting in more part-\ntime people.\n  This is one of the unintended consequences of the health care law--\nhurting the economy directly through impacting jobs.\n  The President says he wants to improve the economy, get people back \nto work, get America on the road to recovery. Yet the health care law \nis--according to the Federal Reserve in this month's ``Beige Book''--\nhurting the economy, dragging down the economy.\n  So I come to the floor today to support the amendment by Senator Cruz \nbecause the American people know what they were looking for in health \ncare reform, which was, of course, the care they need from a doctor \nthey choose at lower cost, and that was not at all provided under the \nPresident's health care law.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise to speak today in opposition to the \nCruz amendment, which would prohibit any funding in the continuing \nresolution from being used to carry out the goals of the Affordable \nCare Act.\n  The broad scope of this amendment clearly indicates that anything \nanticipated under the Affordable Care Act would be subject to \ndefunding, and that is a broad category of activities. In fact, we \nalready have seen the Affordable Care Act produce demonstrable positive \nresults in my State of Rhode Island, and those results could be \neliminated or reversed.\n  For example, because of the Affordable Care Act, there are \nprotections in place today for children with preexisting conditions to \nensure they are no longer denied coverage. There are over 15,000 \nchildren who have a preexisting condition who could have been dropped \nfrom insurance coverage prior to the enactment of the Affordable Care \nAct. Their parents and other adults--approximately 200,000 Rhode Island \nadults also living with preexisting conditions--will gain protection \nfrom being dropped from coverage beginning in January. We began with \nchildren, and now we are expanding it to adults. If we don't do that, \nthen we are going\n\n[[Page S1740]]\n\nto have a whole category, a huge segment of my population who may lose \naccess to insurance, and the inevitable result will be that they will \ngo to expensive emergency rooms, and they will cost all of us more \nmoney. Rather than saving money and dealing with the deficit in a \nresponsible way, this will just add to our deficit problems and deny \npeople health care.\n  The law, the Affordable Care Act, included new tax breaks for small \nbusinesses to make health insurance more affordable. Small businesses \nhave been able to access a tax credit of up to 35 percent of their \nhealth care costs every year since 2010. Beginning in 2014, these \nbusinesses may receive a tax credit of up to 50 percent of their health \ncare costs for any 2-year period. Again this support under the \nAffordable Care Act could be jeopardized or eliminated under the \nproposed amendment.\n\n  Also in jeopardy are discounts on covered brandname and generic \nprescription drugs for seniors who have reached the prescription drug \ncoverage gap known as the famous or infamous doughnut hole. Already in \nRhode Island, seniors have saved--individual senior citizens of Rhode \nIsland have saved $20.5 million as a result of these discounts since \nthe law was enacted. These discounts will continue until the coverage \ngap--the doughnut hole--is eliminated in 2020. The Cruz amendment will \nstop that. Essentially we are telling seniors go back to the time of \nthe doughnut hole, more money out of your pocket at a time when you can \nafford less and less for prescription drugs.\n  Many of my colleagues on the Republican side say they support these \naspects of the Affordable Care Act, yet this amendment would \neffectively do away with them or cast so much doubt or confusion that \nthey would not be effectively implemented. We have to, I think, \ncontinue to effectively implement the Affordable Care Act, not only in \nterms of providing access to quality care for all of our citizens but \nbecause within the Affordable Care Act were significant efforts to \nimprove health care efficiencies. Indeed, through these reforms, we \nwere able to extend the Medicare Program by, I believe, 8 years, to \n2024, in terms of our funding models. All of that would be jeopardized \nby this amendment.\n  There are some other examples, too. For example, the Affordable Care \nAct would reauthorize funding to help immunize uninsured and \nunderinsured children and adults. Every year my State of Rhode Island \nreceives $3 million to immunize this population. Funding for \nimmunizations is critical for the child and the family, but it also \nbenefits all of us, because if you can immunize 75 to 95 percent of the \npopulation, immunologists and health specialists will tell us we are \nall protected through something that is technically known as herd \nimmunity. It makes sense, if you have a sufficient number of people who \nare vaccinated against the disease, when an outbreak occurs the \nlikelihood of it spreading is diminished dramatically. This is another \nexample of a public health initiative under the Affordable Care Act, \nwhich, if it is repealed or defunded, will leave us all vulnerable to \ndiseases. That is not a benefit, that is a detriment to all of us.\n  We have to, again, I think, consider other aspects of the Affordable \nCare Act. One other aspect I wish to mention is the critical area of \nhealth care workforce programs, programs that help train doctors and \nnurses. Many of these programs are funded in the continuing resolution \nand they, too, would be either eliminated or so uncertain as to be \nunreliable for the institutions. In my home State, colleges and \nuniversities, such as at the University of Rhode Island, are using \nthese programs to help train a new generation of health care \nprofessionals, not just physicians but physician's assistants and \nnurse-practitioners. Indeed, what we are seeing, because of the \nAffordable Care Act, is a refocus to more emphasis on family \npractitioners, primary care that is less expensive and more effective \nover the long term in terms of prevention--all that would be \njeopardized under this proposed amendment.\n  There are countless other examples of not only interfering with \nhealth care access for a vast number of Americans, but actually setting \nback our efforts to reduce the deficit and to sustain programs such as \nMedicare. The burden might be particularly felt by seniors because one \nof the things that was most compelling in the debate about the \nAffordable Care Act was closing this doughnut hole. Seniors believe we \nhave taken a positive step to do that. This would be an about-face for \nthe seniors of America, causing them to see more and more costs in \ntheir limited budgets.\n  These are not the messages we want to give to seniors or families. I \nurge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I ask for 3 minutes to speak on the Cruz amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, today I rise to speak on behalf of the \nCruz amendment. I want to spend a couple of minutes explaining my \nthoughts behind the amendment and why I am proud to be a cosponsor of \nthis amendment.\n  All across Nebraska I do roundtable meetings, where I sit down with \nhospital communities, I sit down with medical professionals, I sit down \nwith small businesses. I have done this for years and years.\n  Over the last couple of years since the Affordable Care Act was \npassed, I have had a number of opportunities to sit down with small \nbusinesses. Invariably the first issue that comes up is the crushing \neffect of the regulatory environment. Businesses will tell me they \nsimply are afraid to grow or cannot grow because of what Washington is \nburdening them with. More specifically, they talk to me about the \nAffordable Care Act and the toll it is taking on their businesses.\n  I will give you a perfect example: a small business, a franchise \nbusiness. They have a franchise in Lincoln, they have a franchise in \nOmaha. The owner of that business said to me: You know, my business is \nnot too bad. We could actually grow this business. We look out there in \nthe future and see some opportunities to grow this business.\n  They went on to say: We have about 48 employees now, and we are not \ngoing to grow. I said: Why would that be? Why have you decided you are \nnot going to grow this business? Their answer was straightforward. They \nsaid: When we grow to over 50 employees, we become subject to the \nrequirements that are impossible for a business our size to meet under \nthe Affordable Care Act. The owner said to me: Mike, I met with the \naccountants and the lawyers. We have looked at this in every possible \nway we can, and we decided we are going to stay a business of this \nsize.\n  It was not isolated to that business. I went down the interstate and \nsat down with another business in a different community and the story \nwas the same. I was told business was pretty good and that business was \nthere for them to grow. They had about 47 or 48 employees, and they \nmade the decision they will not grow. This is at a time in our Nation's \nhistory where we are desperate for employment in the United States.\n  In Nebraska, we have been fortunate. We pay our bills. Our \nunemployment never got over 5 percent because we are a conservative \nState. Having said that, when we hear businesses say the greatest \nimpediment to their growth is not the competition down the street or \nacross the street, the greatest impediment to their growth is the \nFederal Government, when we hear that, we have to realize we have done \nsomething very seriously wrong.\n  I want to wrap up with another thought, and it is on a different area \nof the Affordable Care Act.\n  Madam President, I ask for an additional minute to finish this \nthought.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I met with a group of young people \ntoday. They have their whole lives in front of them. They are talking \nand thinking about what they are going to do in terms of going to \ncollege and what their careers might be. They\n\n[[Page S1741]]\n\nasked me about the Affordable Care Act. I said: One of the things that \nis important to point out is that my generation is going to do very \nwell under this act. We have caps on how much our premiums can go up, \nand we have Medicare out there. Then I said: Your generation is not \ngoing to do well. Why? Because your premiums are going to go straight \nup and you are at a point in your lives where you are not going to use \na lot of health care. I am at a point in my life where I will use a lot \nof health care.\n  This imbalance is going to be devastating to the younger generation. \nWhen they start thinking about starting their families, buying their \nfirst home and making an investment, what is the Federal Government \ngoing to do? It is going to place a crushing blow upon them in terms of \nhigher premiums, and that is the reality of the situation.\n  I will wrap up with this thought; I could go on and on. As a former \nGovernor, I can tell everyone that adding 24 million people to Medicaid \nis such a flawed policy approach. I could talk about the impact this is \ngoing to have on accessibility for care by people who desperately need \nthat care, but the bottom line is this: This was a flawed policy. I was \nhere when it was passed. It is a policy that needs to be defunded. We \nneed to do the right thing with health care, and this is not it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, could we just have quiet. We are going \nto have our first vote on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Cruz \namendment.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Lautenberg), \nthe Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Manchin), and the Senator from \nRhode Island (Mr. Whitehouse) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 53 To Amendment No. 26\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, and I ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself, and Mr. \n     Cardin, proposes an amendment numbered 53 to amendment No. \n     26.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the spending package we are considering \nthis week I think is a little bit unusual, to say the least. Five of \nthe twelve Appropriations subcommittees get detailed, full-length \nspending bills: Defense, Military Construction, Agriculture, Homeland \nSecurity, and Commerce and Justice. The other seven appropriations \nbills are basically on autopilot, continuing resolutions. So with a few \nexceptions, whatever the government spent last year on programs in \nthese seven subcommittees the government will spend this year.\n  I know for a fact this is not what the chairwoman of the \nAppropriations Committee wanted. She fought hard for an omnibus that \nwould have included all 12 spending bills. I am very respectful of \nthat. She fought hard for it, but this is where we stand right now.\n  I am speaking today because the programs under the jurisdiction of \nthe Senate Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nAppropriations Subcommittee, of which I am privileged to chair, would \nbe put on autopilot. I suppose it comes as no surprise I think that is \na terrible mistake.\n  The Labor-HHS bill--or Labor-H, as it is known in the terminology \naround here--is how we fund the National Institutes of Health, the \npreeminent biomedical research entity in the world. This bill is how we \nfund the child care and development block grant, which gives working \nfamilies access to high-quality childcare. It is how we provide Federal \nfunding to teach students with disabilities--the Individuals With \nDisabilities Education Act--it is how we help local school \njurisdictions meet their constitutional obligation to provide a free \nand appropriate education to all kids, even kids with disabilities.\n  These services are critical to this Nation. It has been said before--\nactually, the first person I ever heard say it was a recently departed \nand beloved chairman, Senator Dan Inouye, who once said: The Defense \nAppropriations Committee is the committee that defends America. The \nLabor, Health and Human Services, and Education Committee is the \ncommittee that defines America--who we are as a country, what we are \nabout as a people, what we are going to do for the future of our \nchildren in America.\n  So we need to examine every year whether we are spending the right \namounts of taxpayer money for these services. If that makes sense for \nthe Defense appropriations bill, to take a look at it yearly, to see if \nwe are spending the right amounts, if it is right for Homeland Security \nand Agriculture, why shouldn't the same level of oversight be applied \nto the Labor, Health and Human Services bill?\n  As a way of sort of describing where we are, this past December, we \nnegotiated a fiscal 2013 spending bill with Republican and Democratic \ncounterparts, House and Senate. So I, Senator Shelby, Congressman \nRehberg, and Congresswoman DeLauro on the House side all read this bill \nthrough in December and signed off on it.\n  That was going to be in the omnibus bill. Well, as we know, we did \nnot have an omnibus spending bill. So the talks were bicameral and \nbipartisan. They were difficult talks and we hammered out an agreement \nand we had a compromise. I got some of what I wanted and I lost some of \nwhat I wanted. But that is the nature of compromise. So with an \nexception, which I will explain shortly, the amendment I have just \noffered is what was agreed upon in December. No more money, not adding \nany money. But we are changing some of the accounts to better represent \nwhat we decided, both bicameral and bipartisan, should be priorities. \nThat is the amendment I am offering. Again, I repeat, it is what we \ndecided upon in December in terms of what our priorities ought to be. \nIf we just go with Labor-H in a CR, all of that is wiped\n\n[[Page S1742]]\n\nout. So what I am proposing to replace that is the autopilot version \nwith a detailed bipartisan compromise.\n  I want to emphasize this point. This amendment is not my Labor-HHS \nbill. Now, obviously if I had my druthers, I would have spent dollars \nas I wanted them to be spent. But compromise does not work that way. \nThis amendment includes the priorities from the other side of the aisle \nand from the other side of the Capitol. It was a give and take. Even \nthough there are things in the amendment I would like to change, it is \nvastly superior--vastly superior--to putting all of these programs on \nautopilot and doing this year exactly what we did last year and the \nyear before, because we were on autopilot last year too.\n  Let me point out two things that are different in this amendment than \nwhat was in December. I said it was the same but there are two things \ndifferent. The agreement we hammered out in December, with Republicans \nand Democrats in the Senate, Republicans and Democrats in the House \nAppropriations Committee, included money for the Affordable Care Act, \nfor ObamaCare. This amendment I am offering today took that out, just \ntook it out. Even though we had agreed upon $513 million for that in \nDecember, this is not in my amendment. I want to make that clear.\n  The second major difference between the December bill and this \namendment is the total cost. As I said, the December bill would not fit \nwithin our new budget cap. We have a new budget cap since December. So \nthis amendment fits within that budget cap by a very small, across-the-\nboard cut of 0.127 percent. That is one-eighth of 1 percent to every \nprogram in the bill. I did not do an across-the-board cut on some at \nthe expense of others. No. We just did it on everything, .127 percent. \nSo the programs that would have received increases in the December bill \nstill get the increases, just minus .127 percent. The programs that \nwere cut in the December cut will still get cut, they will just be cut \nby .127 percent more. But other than those two changes, no additional \nhealth reform money, no other kinds of cuts. The amendment is basically \nidentical to what we agreed upon in December. So I want to take a look \nat it and see why it is better than what I call the autopilot version \nor the continuing resolution.\n  Let's start first with education. Title I is the cornerstone Federal \nprogram for helping all students, especially those from disadvantaged \nbackgrounds, helping them meet high academic standards. More than 90 \npercent of the school districts across America receive title I funds. \nMy amendment, the one that is before us, has $107 million more for \ntitle I. What is in the bill before us has absolutely no increase, \nzero.\n  We were able to bump that up again by an amount equal to .127 \npercent, as I said. It is basically the same. That is title I. Special \neducation, I mentioned IDEA, we have a $125 million increase in the \namendment I am offering; in the CR, no increase whatsoever.\n  National Institutes of Health, we are especially proud of this. The \nomnibus, the Senate CR that is before us, has $71 million more than \nlast year. This amendment bumps it up to $211 million. So the CR has \n$71 million, we have $211 million for an NIH increase.\n  Childcare. The underlying CR includes $50 million more than last \nyear. My amendment would increase that to $107 million. That means the \nchildcare subsidy for working families of 10,000 additional children, \nfamilies who basically depend upon this so they are able to go to work.\n  AIDS drugs. The Ryan White AIDS Drug Assistance Program provides \nlifesaving drugs to people living with HIV. My amendment includes $29 \nmillion more for this program. The CR has no increase whatsoever.\n  So far I mentioned only some of the larger programs in the bill. My \namendment addresses dozens of smaller priorities as well. At the full \ncommittee markup of the Labor-H bill back in July of last year, Senator \nInouye, who was chairman at that time, promised Senator Murkowski that \nthe final fiscal year 2013 spending bill would include $10 million for \nsuicide prevention among Alaska Natives and Native Americans. I did not \nmake that promise, but it was made by the chairman of the committee. I \nam honoring that promise. I honored it when we negotiated this in \nDecember. We included that $10 million. That is in my amendment also.\n  Again, a small increase for suicide prevention is not possible in a \nCR. But it is in my amendment. If we approve it, that funding will \nbecome law.\n  TRIO Program. It is an important program to many Members on both \nsides of the aisle. It has had broad support. The TRIO Program makes \nthe dream of a college education possible for low-income students. As \nwe know, this goes basically to students who are the first in their \nfamily to go to college. So if your parents had not gone to college, \nthey would be eligible for TRIO, based upon income levels.\n  The bill we negotiated in December included an increase for the TRIO \nProgram. Again, that is not possible in a CR, the bill that is before \nus. But it is in my amendment. If Congress approves it, TRIO will get a \n$14 million increase this year. I just did not have it on my chart.\n  I could go on and on. There are a lot of things. Food safety, lead \npoisoning screening for kids in this country, lead poisoning screening, \ndiabetes prevention, worker safety. These are important priorities. \nThey are all addressed in my amendment, because we addressed those in \nDecember. But they are not in the bill before us.\n  Again, let me sort of sum up what we have here in this amendment. It \nis the same total cost as what is in the bill before us, no additional \nmoney. It was a bicameral, bipartisan compromise that we hammered out \nin December. There is more money for NIH, childcare, education, I \nmentioned things such as TRIO, I mentioned things such as IDEA and \nothers. I think it fulfills our constitutional duty to be good stewards \nof the public's money, to do adequate oversight on appropriations, and \nto mold and shape, again in a bipartisan, bicameral method, to work it \nout.\n\n  There are some who say, gee, if we pass this, the House will not take \nit. I do not know why not. They agreed upon it in December. I do not \nmean the whole House, but the House Appropriations Committee, under the \nchairmanship of Chairman Rogers, agreed on this in December. It was all \nsigned off on. So I do not know why they would not accept it. They did \nnot put it in their bill when they sent it over here. Okay. They did \nnot. Well, there are some other things they did not put in the bill \nwhen they sent it over here too. So I think it is incumbent upon us to \ndo our duty, to make sure we look at these programs and decide where we \nwant to bump some up, maybe some we want to cut down, some we want to \nmodify. That is what we did in December. Well, we finished in December. \nI think we started working on it back around July, if I am not \nmistaken. We finally got it worked out in December.\n  If we had had an omnibus, we would have had this. I would not be here \ntoday offering this amendment. Again, to those who say: Well, if we had \nthis, the House would not accept it, is that a reason for us not to do \nour duty? Is that a reason for us not to do what is right and just and \nfair, because someone says maybe the House will not take it? I mean, \nthe House would have some serious explaining to do on why they would \nnot take it since it was already in the December compromise that was \nreached.\n  I would point out again that the defense bill, the Defense \nappropriations bill that is here is what they agreed upon in December. \nIf that is the case, then why cannot we do Labor-H and all of the \nthings that we fund the same as what we had in December also? That is \nmy basic point here.\n  As I say, we did make a couple of changes. One change we did is we \ntook out the funding for ObamaCare, which I think is a good deal. I \nmean, ObamaCare is something we have to continue to implement. It is \ngoing to save us a lot of money. It is going to make lives better for \npeople all over America, already is making lives better for people with \npreexisting conditions, people with very intricate diseases and \nconditions that need to be managed, young people who are staying on \ntheir parents' policies until they are age 26, the elderly who get \ntheir free health screenings every year under Medicare. So it is \nalready making a big impact. I am a big supporter of ObamaCare. I want \nto make sure it gets funded and implemented. But the\n\n[[Page S1743]]\n\nfact is that we could not do that. Well, that is no reason then not to \nincrease NIH and childcare development block grants, IDEA, TRIO \nPrograms, a host of other things. If the will of the body was that we \ncould not do anything to implement ObamaCare, then at least let's do \nour duty and agree to meet the goals and meet the targets we set in \nDecember in our negotiations.\n  We laid the bill down earlier. As I said, it is basically what we had \nin December. I am hopeful that Senators and their staffs will take the \ntime to look through it and see what is in there, because I think they \nwill come to the same conclusion. No more money than what we have in \nthe CR. It is basically the same with the exceptions I mentioned of \nwhat we did in December. We will have a better result, a better \nplatform going forward the rest of this year and next year by not doing \na CR but by doing this bill in a bill form, just as we have done for \nother bills in this appropriations measure.\n  Again, I want to thank Chairman Mikulski for fighting so hard for \nthis. I know she has done everything possible. But, again, sometimes it \nfalls to an amendment that we have to do to get things done. I am \nhopeful my friends on the other side of the aisle again will take a \nserious look at this and support this amendment. As I said, I see no \nreal reason not to support it.\n  I mean, I am anxious to see if someone has some arguments as to why \nwe shouldn't support this since, as I said, we had hammered out this \nagreement over a long period of time last fall. We always spoke about \nhow we want to work in a bipartisan fashion, we want to accept the \nresults of bipartisan negotiation.\n  That is what we did last year. I think we started probably around \nJuly, had an August break, at least by September--probably started in \nJuly, then September, October, November, December we worked it out in a \nvery bipartisan fashion, although I didn't get everything I wanted in \nthe bill.\n  If my friends on the other side of the aisle now want to say: No, we \nare not going to accept this, what is the use of engaging in long, \nhard, difficult, strenuous bipartisan negotiations where we reach an \nagreement and they respond: Well, we don't care. We are not going to \nsupport it anyway.\n  I have taken great pride in working with my colleagues in a \nbipartisan fashion last year on the reauthorization of the Food and \nDrug Administration bill, the drug user bill, the drug safety bill. We \nworked long and hard on these for probably almost 2 years and were able \nto get them through. There were other bills I have been involved in \nwhere we did good bipartisan negotiating, and that was the same as \nthis.\n  This is not something I rammed through and said: This is my bill; \ntake it or leave it. That is not the way I work. I have been the chair \nor ranking member of this subcommittee since 1989. It is a great \nsubcommittee because it meets the human needs, social needs, \neducational needs, and, yes, biomedical research needs and disease \ncontrol needs, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is \nalso funded under our subcommittee.\n  It keeps Americans safe. The Defense Committee keeps us safe from \nforeign entities, other entities that would want to do us harm \nmilitarily. Homeland Security does the same.\n  This committee keeps us safe from diseases. It keeps us safe from \nillnesses. It provides for the kind of research which has overcome so \nmuch in the last 20 to 30 years and the great strides we have made in \ncancer and other chronic diseases. We have made great strides because \nwe have invested in them. This is what the subcommittee does.\n  It also provides for education, making sure kids who come from the \npoorest families and poor areas also receive a fair shake in education \nfunds, programs for students who go to college, Pell grants and student \nloans. It is incumbent upon us, as we can't continue to have continuing \nresolutions on this type of bill. Times change, circumstances change, \nand we need to modify the bill and do things which recognize some of \nthe new realities. This is what we have done. I am hopeful we can get \nsupport for this amendment. I don't think it is a heavy lift at all for \nanyone to support this.\n  I said, and I will repeat, repeat, repeat and keep repeating: There \nis no new money, no more than what is in the underlying bill. It is \nbasically the same as we hammered out in December through long \nnegotiations.\n  Hopefully, it may be a little easier for my Republican colleagues, as \nthere is not any money in there for the implementation of ObamaCare. \nThis is something I didn't agree with, but that is life and one of the \ncompromises one has to make. The other items in this bill are vitally \nimportant to the health, the welfare, the education, and safety of the \nAmerican people.\n  I hope the amendment will pass, and I ask my colleagues for their \nsupport.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an explanatory statement \nand a detailed funding table accompanying the amendment be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   DIVISION__--LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND \n                            RELATED AGENCIES\n\n       Following is an explanation of the effects of this division \n     (hereafter referred to as the ``bill''). Funds for the \n     individual programs and activities within the accounts in \n     this act are displayed in the detailed table at the end of \n     the explanatory statement for this act. Funding levels that \n     are not displayed in the detailed table are identified in \n     this explanatory statement.\n       In implementing this bill, the Departments and agencies \n     should be guided by the language and instructions set forth \n     in Senate Report 112-176 accompanying S. 3295 unless \n     specifically addressed in this statement. In cases where the \n     language and instructions in the Senate report specifically \n     address the allocation of funds, those that should be \n     implemented have been restated in this explanatory statement.\n\n                                TITLE I\n\n                          DEPARTMENT OF LABOR\n\n                 Employment and Training Administration\n\n\n                    TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICES\n\n                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)\n\n       The bill provides $84,291,000 for migrant and seasonal \n     farmworker formula grants, including $5,678,222 for migrant \n     and seasonal farmworker housing grants, of which not less \n     than 70 percent of this amount shall be used for permanent \n     housing grants. The Secretary of Labor shall submit annual \n     reports documenting the use of farmworker housing funds. The \n     reports should include information on the amount of funds \n     used for permanent and temporary housing activities, \n     respectively; a list of the communities served; a list of the \n     grantees and the States in which they are located; the number \n     of individuals or families served listed by State; and a list \n     of allowable temporary housing activities.\n\n\n                          OFFICE OF JOB CORPS\n\n                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)\n\n       The Department of Labor's mismanagement of Job Corps \n     appropriations led to considerable disruptions for current \n     and new students at the end of program year 2011. The \n     Department delayed notification to the Committees on \n     Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate \n     regarding the shortfall once discovered.\n       In October 2012 the Department began implementing several \n     cost-cutting measures and shall provide quarterly reports \n     detailing its cost-cutting measures and their impact on both \n     centers and students.\n       The bill includes language allowing the Secretary to \n     transfer up to $30,000,000 for Job Corps operations from \n     unobligated balances. The bill requires the Secretary to \n     transfer not less than $10,000,000 within 30 days of \n     enactment of this act.\n       Contracts provided for the operation and maintenance of Job \n     Corps facilities are generally let on a 2-year basis, with as \n     many as 3 option years depending on the quality of \n     performance. When evaluating contract renewals or re-bids, \n     the Secretary shall provide due consideration to the Federal \n     investment already made in high-performing incumbent \n     contractors as a part of a full, fair, and open competitive \n     process. As part of this process, the Department shall \n     consider documented past performance of student outcomes and \n     cost-effective administration as key factors in determining \n     fair market value in Job Corps procurements.\n\n             Occupational Safety and Health Administration\n\n\n                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES\n\n       The language in Senate Report 112-176 directing the \n     Department to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking on silica \n     stands as a recommendation of the Senate Committee on \n     Appropriations. There is a need to protect workers from \n     developing silicosis. Therefore, not later than 30 days after \n     enactment of this bill, OSHA shall provide the Committees on \n     Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate \n     a report describing its efforts in this area, including a \n     chronology related to its silica standard-setting effort \n     initiated in 1997 and the number of silica enforcement \n     activities the agency has undertaken since that time.\n\n[[Page S1744]]\n\n                 Mine Safety and Health Administration\n\n\n                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES\n\n                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)\n\n       In order to prepare properly for emergencies, the Mine \n     Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) should continue to \n     devote resources toward a competitive grant activity for \n     effective emergency response and recovery training in various \n     types of mine conditions. The Committees on Appropriations of \n     the House of Representatives and Senate also expect to be \n     notified in advance of any reallocation of funds pursuant to \n     new bill language included in the bill.\n       The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is directed to \n     provide an additional analysis as a follow-up to its report \n     (prepared in response to a request in last year's conference \n     agreement) concerning MSHA's proposal to lower the \n     permissible exposure limit for coal dust. The follow-up study \n     should discuss the available data and estimates to date \n     regarding trends in the prevalence of coal workers \n     pneumoconiosis and other occupational respiratory diseases \n     among coal miners over the past two decades. The study shall \n     include including the adequacy of the data, methodologies, \n     and conclusions that can be drawn regarding trends in \n     prevalence both nationally and to particular regions or \n     categories of mining. The GAO shall provide to the Committees \n     on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and Senate \n     an interim report not later than 90 days after enactment of \n     this bill.\n\n                       Bureau of Labor Statistics\n\n       The Bureau of Labor Statistics shall follow the language \n     under the Bureau of Labor Statistics heading in Senate Report \n     112-176.\n\n                           General Provisions\n\n\n                       General Transfer Authority\n\n       The bill includes a provision modified from last year's \n     bill that provides transfer authority of not to exceed 1 \n     percent of the funds appropriated for fiscal year 2013 in \n     this Act for the Department of Labor.\n\n\n               TRANSFER AUTHORITY FOR EVALUATION PURPOSES\n\n       The bill modifies a provision that allows up to 0.5 percent \n     of discretionary appropriations provided in this act for all \n     Department of Labor agencies to be used by the Chief \n     Evaluation Office for evaluation purposes consistent with the \n     terms and conditions in this bill applicable to such office.\n\n\n           TEMPORARY NON-AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYMENT H-2B PROGRAM\n\n       The bill continues a provision relating to the ``Wage \n     Methodology for the Temporary Non-Agricultural Employment H-\n     2B Program'' regulation published by the Employment and \n     Training Administration and includes a new provision relating \n     to the ``Temporary Non-Agricultural Employment of H-2B Aliens \n     in the United States'' regulation published by the Employment \n     and Training Administration and the Wage and Hour Division.\n\n\n                    WORKING CAPITAL FUND RESCISSION\n\n       The bill includes a new provision that rescinds $10,337,000 \n     from ``Departmental Management, Working Capital Fund''.\n\n\n   EVALUATION FUNDING FOR THE TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE COMMUNITY \n               COLLEGE AND CAREER TRAINING GRANT PROGRAM\n\n       The bill includes a new provision that allows up to 3 \n     percent of funds provided for the Trade Adjustment Assistance \n     Community College and Career Training grant program to be \n     used for evaluation and technical assistance purposes.\n\n\n            TRANSFER OF COMPTROLLER GENERAL RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n       The bill includes a new provision that transfers Davis-\n     Bacon Act claims responsibilities from the Comptroller \n     General to the Secretary of Labor.\n\n                                TITLE II\n\n                DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\n\n       This explanatory statement includes tables allocating \n     funding for the programs, projects and activities in this \n     Act.

Any action to \n     eliminate or consolidate programs, projects and activities \n     should be pursued through a proposal in the President's \n     budget so it can be considered by the Committees on \n     Appropriations.\n       HHS is directed to include in its fiscal year 2014 \n     congressional budget justification the amount of expired \n     unobligated balances available for transfer to the \n     nonrecurring expenses fund (NEF), and the amount of any such \n     balances transferred to the NEF.

CDC is directed to \n     explain in the congressional budget request how sound \n     scientific data are linked to measurable public health and \n     preparedness goals and objectives for each program, and how \n     those goals directly relate to the budget request. In \n     addition, CDC is directed to provide the following \n     information in the fiscal year 2015 and future budget \n     requests:\n       Program evaluations--an identification of the timeframes \n     and criteria used to evaluate each program;\n       User fee, reimbursement, and other sources of funding--an \n     itemization of the actual and estimated collections for each \n     activity and the actual annual costs related to each \n     associated user fee, reimbursement, and other funding source \n     used to support CDC activities;\n       Accounting--a more detailed accounting of how funds are \n     spent in each program. The budget justification should not \n     only be an accounting of how funds will be spent in the \n     coming fiscal year, but also how funds have been spent in the \n     previous fiscal years, potentially under different budget \n     structures or organizations;\n       Types of activities supported--the breakdown of intramural \n     and extramural funding for each program; and\n       Working Capital Fund (WCF)--The object class breakout of \n     annual WCF resource inputs, assets, expenditures, carry over, \n     WCF-supported FTE, WCF-supported contract FTE, and WCF-\n     supported overhead for the prior actual year, current year \n     and budget year at each Center, Institute, or Office, in \n     addition to the CDC aggregate levels. The budget \n     justification should include the projected and actual reserve \n     with a breakout justification to explain the projected use \n     and identification of any reserve and residual funds for the \n     prior actual year, current year, and budget year. Further, \n     CDC shall brief jointly the Committees on Appropriations no \n     later than July 15, 2013 on the WCF governance structure, \n     rules in place to ensure appropriate activity and accounting, \n     and hypothetical impact of the fund if it were implemented in \n     fiscal year 2013 and funding adjustments for the expected \n     implementation at the beginning of fiscal year 2014.\n       Repairs and Improvements--the categorization of the needed \n     repairs for CDC facilities in areas such as security, life/\n     safety repairs, condition index, and other repairs.\n       Data Reporting.--Significant opportunities exist to create \n     administrative and economic efficiencies in the reporting of \n     public health data. For that reason, the Director of CDC is \n     directed to work with State and local health officials, to \n     submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations no later \n     than 180 days after enactment of this act on the \n     opportunities for consolidating the various data collection \n     systems in CDC. The report should\n\n[[Page S1747]]\n\n     include the opportunities and costs, advantages and barriers, \n     and projected timeline to such a consolidated data reporting \n     system, along with recommendations for adoption. The report \n     should include full consideration of a single Web-based data \n     collection information technology platform.\n       Individual Learning Accounts.--A long-standing provision \n     extending availability of funds for the Individual Learning \n     Account program has been deleted, as well as a long-standing \n     general provision regarding the management of this program. \n     The training and professional development of CDC staff shall \n     be supported and maintained by the centers and leadership of \n     CDC.\n       Office of the Director (formerly Public Health Leadership \n     and Support).--The program line has been changed to Office of \n     Director to better reflect the activities these funds \n     support.\n       Scientific Research Coordination with NIH.--CDC programs \n     are expected to coordinate with the Institutes and Centers of \n     the NIH to identify scientific gaps for ready opportunities \n     to accelerate understanding of diseases and their prevention \n     in NIH and CDC research portfolios. Specifically, updates are \n     requested in the fiscal year 2014 budget request on this \n     effort as it relates to each of the CDC cancer programs.\n\n\n                     NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH\n\n       The bill includes $30,873,259,000 for the accounts that \n     comprise the NIH total appropriation. This amount includes a \n     $40,000,000 increase for Institutional Development Awards \n     (IDeA) within the National Institute of General Medical \n     Sciences and a $15,000,000 increase for the Cures \n     Acceleration Network within the National Center for Advancing \n     Translational Sciences (NCATS). To improve transparency, the \n     bill also includes an increase of $25,300,000 for NCATS to \n     fully fund the Clinical and Translational Science Awards \n     (CTSA) program within that Center; in fiscal year 2012, CTSAs \n     were funded partially through contributions from other \n     Institutes and Centers (ICs).\n       Other than the adjustments described above, funding for \n     each IC is increased over the fiscal year 2012 level by an \n     equal percentage.\n       In accordance with longstanding tradition, the bill does \n     not direct funds to any specific disease research area. NIH \n     is expected to base its funding decisions only on scientific \n     opportunities and the peer review process.\n       NIH is expected to adopt a reasonable NIH-wide policy for \n     non-competing and competing inflation rates that is \n     consistent with the overall funding increase. Further, NIH is \n     expected to support as many scientifically meritorious new \n     and competing research project grants as possible, at a \n     reasonable award level, with the funding provided in this \n     act.\n       All the NIH ICs are expected to continue to support the \n     Pathways to Independence program, which provides new \n     investigators with mentored grants that convert into \n     independent research project grants. In addition, New \n     Innovator Awards, Director's Pioneer Awards, and the \n     Transformative R01 Program are supported through the Common \n     Fund. NIH should have a reasonable policy for inflationary \n     increases on research training stipends that are not below \n     the federal pay policy. The Office of the Director (OD) shall \n     ensure, as practicable, the programs and offices within OD \n     receive increases proportional to the overall increase, \n     unless otherwise specified.\n       NIH is expected to limit funding for the Intramural \n     Research Program to the same share of the overall NIH budget \n     as in fiscal year 2012. The percentage of funds used to \n     support basic research across NIH is expected to be \n     maintained.\n       CTSAs.--NIH shall make no changes to the CTSA program until \n     the Institute of Medicine (IOM) completes its evaluation of \n     the program, due in June 2013. Following the completion of \n     that evaluation, if NIH then determines that adjustments to \n     the CTSA program are needed, the NCATS Director is directed \n     to brief the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations \n     before implementing the changes.\n       Clinical Trials.--GAO is requested to conduct a review of \n     how NIH has applied the recommendations from the 2010 \n     Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendations on NCI's clinical \n     trials across all ICs to improve all NIH-wide clinical trial \n     activity. The review should examine the specific \n     recommendations NIH can consider to further improve the \n     efficiency and effectiveness of administering, monitoring, \n     managing, and supporting clinical trials.\n       Clinical Trials Patient Enrollment.--NIH is directed to \n     host a workshop on the challenges regarding enrolling and \n     retaining patients in clinical trials. The workshop should \n     include public foundations that provide clinical trial \n     navigation services, the NIH Foundation, and other \n     appropriate organizations. Topics should include the \n     development of ways to track, monitor, and improve \n     participation and enrollment in NIH-funded clinical trials, \n     particularly among underrepresented and uninsured \n     populations. The workshop should also discuss potential \n     public-private partnerships that could address these goals.\n       Common Fund.--NIH is expected to continue the longstanding \n     policy for Common Fund projects to be short-term, high-impact \n     awards, with no projects receiving funding for more than 10 \n     years. NIH is directed to discontinue health economics \n     research within the Common Fund.\n       Extramural and Intramural Research.--NIH plans to impose an \n     additional level of scrutiny on extramural principal \n     investigators with grants of $1,500,000 or more. NIH is \n     directed to ensure that this policy, and any other new \n     measures which are intended to improve oversight and \n     accountability for extramural researchers, should apply \n     equally to intramural researchers as well.\n       Peer reviewers for extramural research would benefit from \n     knowing the scope of intramural activities that are related \n     to the subjects under consideration to reduce the possibility \n     of duplication. Therefore, NIH is directed to make such \n     information available to extramural peer review study \n     sections.\n       Improved Trans-NIH Coordination.--The Director of the \n     Division of Program Coordination, Planning, and Strategic \n     Initiatives is requested to develop a strategic plan to \n     improve coordination and facilitation of trans-NIH research. \n     The plan should include measurable objectives and specific \n     steps that NIH and the ICs will take to reduce duplication \n     and increase the effectiveness and efficiency of research \n     activities occurring in multiple ICs. The plan should be \n     posted on the NIH Web site within 180 days after enactment \n     and updated routinely thereafter regarding progress made \n     toward reaching the objectives.\n       Kennedy's Disease.--NINDS supports research related to \n     spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, also known as Kennedy's \n     disease. NINDS is encouraged to continue research into the \n     causes of this disease and animal testing for possible \n     avenues for treatment.\n       Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Awards.--The \n     number of Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service \n     Awards has declined each year since fiscal year 2007. While \n     there is a need to increase stipend levels, NIH should put a \n     higher priority on maintaining the number of awards. NIH is \n     expected to continue efforts to support new investigators.\n       National Children's Study (NCS).--There have been \n     significant concerns in the scientific community about NIH's \n     plans to change substantially the design of the NCS. \n     Therefore, the bill requires NIH to charter a comprehensive \n     IOM/National Research Council review to evaluate the proposal \n     and make the results public before contracts are awarded for \n     the NCS Main Study. Topics covered by the review should \n     include: the representative sample size, participation of \n     traditionally underrepresented groups, generalizability of \n     the data, participant retention rates, statistical artifacts, \n     required infrastructure, involvement of academia, study \n     costs, and other factors determined relevant by the review \n     experts.\n       NCATS.--NCATS should make every effort to prevent \n     duplication, redundancy, and competition with the private \n     sector. To that end, NCATS is directed to work with industry \n     representatives to initiate a process that will inform the \n     private sector on a regular basis about the Center's current \n     and planned programs and activities. A plan and timeline to \n     implement this process is requested within 90 days of \n     enactment.\n       Opioid Drug Abuse.--The June 2011 IOM report on pain \n     indicates that abuse and misuse of prescription opioid drugs \n     resulted in an annual estimated cost to the Nation of \n     $72,500,000,000. Therefore the National Institute on Drug \n     Abuse is urged to support scientific activities that provide \n     companies with the basic science to develop and implement \n     innovative strategies to reduce opioid drug abuse. Such \n     strategies may include new chemical molecule structures, \n     coatings, agents, or other processes with a goal of \n     preventing abuse while still providing the necessary pain \n     relief required for patient care.\n       Improved Coordination and Dissemination of Research.--The \n     OD is expected to work with the ICs and other HHS operating \n     divisions to establish a systematic means of disseminating \n     research results for the purposes of preventing duplication \n     of effort across the Department and enabling NIH to target \n     its research more effectively.\n       IDeA.--NIH is expected to maintain the fiscal year 2012 \n     levels for the Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence \n     (COBRE), IDeA Networks of Biomedical Research Excellence, and \n     the IDeA Clinical Trial and Translation Program programs. NIH \n     is directed to divide the increase over the fiscal year 2012 \n     level for IDeA equally between a new COBRE competition and \n     additional awards for the IDeA Clinical Trial and Translation \n     Program. Last year NIH was urged to give the IDeA Director \n     the flexibility to include all States that qualify for the \n     Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research \n     (EPSCoR) program in the IDeA program. An update on this \n     proposal was requested in the fiscal year 2013 congressional \n     budget justification. NIH failed to respond to either \n     request. Therefore, NIH is directed to review whether changes \n     to the eligibility criteria are warranted, including the \n     possible inclusion of all EPSCoR-eligible States, and to \n     present its recommendations in a report to the House and \n     Senate Committees on Appropriations and the relevant \n     authorizing committees no later than 120 days after \n     enactment. In addition, the NIH and IC Directors are \n     requested to work with the IDeA Director to implement a plan \n     to improve coordination and co-funding of IDeA awards and \n     programs to increase opportunities to improve biomedical \n     research capacity and training.\n       Scientific Management and Review Board (SMRB).--The NIH \n     Director has rejected the recommendation by the Scientific \n     Management and Review Board to create a new Institute on \n     substance use, abuse, and addiction-related research, and has \n     decided that\n\n[[Page S1748]]\n\n     the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the National \n     Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism should pursue \n     ``functional integration'' to advance this research rather \n     than consolidation. NIH is expected to provide specific \n     details on how the two Institutes plan to achieve such \n     integration in the fiscal year 2014 congressional budget \n     justification.\n\n       Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration\n\n       The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \n     Administration (SAMHSA) is expected to provide more detailed \n     information in its annual congressional justification, \n     including budgetary and programmatic information on programs \n     as they existed in prior fiscal years, even if the budget \n     request proposes a new structure or consolidation. SAMHSA \n     shall not make changes to any program, project, or activity \n     as outlined by the budget tables included in this \n     explanatory statement without prior notification to the \n     House and Senate Committees on Appropriations.\n       SAMHSA and the Department are directed to exempt the Mental \n     Health Block Grant (MHBG) and the Substance Abuse Prevention \n     and Treatment (SAPT) Block Grant from being used as a source \n     for the PHS evaluation set-aside in fiscal year 2013, as was \n     done prior to fiscal year 2012.\n\n\n                             MENTAL HEALTH\n\n       Within the total provided for Mental Health Programs of \n     Regional and National Significance, the bill includes the \n     following amounts:\n\n\n        Budget activity                                   FY 2013 level\nCapacity\n  Seclusion & Restraint.......................................2,444,000\n  Youth Violence Prevention..................................12,817,000\n  National Traumatic Stress Network..........................48,713,000\n  Children and Family Programs................................6,474,000\n  Consumer and Family Network Grants..........................6,224,000\n  MH System Transformation and Health Reform.................10,603,000\n  Project LAUNCH.............................................34,640,000\n  Primary and Behavioral Health Care Integration.............30,749,000\n  Suicide Lifeline............................................5,512,000\n  GLS--Youth Suicide Prevention--States......................29,682,000\n  GLS--Youth Suicide Prevention--Campus.......................4,966,000\n  AI/AN Suicide Prevention Initiative.........................2,938,000\n  Homelessness Prevention Programs...........................30,772,000\n  Minority AIDS...............................................9,265,000\n  Criminal and Juvenile Justice Programs......................4,281,000\n  Grants for Adult Trauma Screening and BI....................2,896,000\n  Tribal Behavioral Health Grants............................20,000,000\nScience and Service\n  GLS--Suicide Prevention Resource Center.....................5,550,000\n  Practice Improvement & Training.............................7,437,000\n  Consumer & Consumer Support T.A.

Not less than $10,000,000 shall be used for \n     competitively awarded grants targeting tribal entities with \n     the highest rates of suicide per capita over the past 10 \n     years. Funds shall be used for effective and promising \n     strategies that address the problems of substance abuse and \n     suicide and promote mental health among AI/AN young people.\n       Within the funds provided for the National Child Traumatic \n     Stress Network, the bill provides $1,500,000 for the targeted \n     collection of new outcome data from selected centers, as well \n     as analyses and reports related to the National Center for \n     Child Traumatic Stress core data set.\n       All grants awarded for the Primary and Behavioral Health \n     Integration program shall be funded under the authorities in \n     section 520(K) of the PHS Act.\n       Funds provided to Project LAUNCH should not duplicate \n     activities eligible for funding elsewhere in HHS and should \n     focus on mental health promotion and promotion strategies for \n     children aged 0 to 8.\n\n\n                       SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT\n\n       Within the total provided for Substance Abuse Treatment \n     Programs of Regional and National Significance, the bill \n     includes the following amounts:\n\n\n        Budget Activity                                   FY 2013 Level\nCapacity\n  Opioid Treatment Programs/Regulatory Activities.............8,886,000\n  Screening, Brief Intervention, Referral, and Treatment.....28,187,000\n  TCE--General...............................................13,256,000\n  Pregnant & Postpartum Women................................15,970,000\n  Strengthening Treatment Access and Retention................1,000,000\n  Recovery Community Services Program.........................2,445,000\n  Access to Recovery.........................................87,666,000\n  Children and Families......................................29,678,000\n  Treatment Systems for Homeless.............................41,571,000\n  Minority AIDS..............................................65,863,000\n  Criminal Justice Activities................................70,000,000\nScience and Service\n  Addiction Technology Transfer Centers.......................9,064,000\n  Minority Fellowship Program...................................546,000\n  Special Initiatives/Outreach................................1,436,000\n       SAMHSA shall ensure that Addiction Technology Transfer \n     Centers continue to maintain a primary focus on addiction \n     treatment and recovery services in order to strengthen the \n     addiction workforce.\n       All funding appropriated to the Center for Substance Abuse \n     Treatment for drug treatment courts shall be allocated to \n     serve people diagnosed with a substance use disorder as their \n     primary condition.\n       SAMHSA shall ensure that funds provided for Screening, \n     Brief Intervention, Referral, and Treatment are used for \n     existing evidence-based models of providing early \n     intervention and treatment services to those at risk of \n     developing substance abuse disorders.\n\n\n                       SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION\n\n       Within the total provided for Substance Abuse Prevention \n     Programs of Regional and National Significance, the bill \n     includes the following amounts:\n\n\n        Budget activity                                   FY 2013 level\nCapacity\n  Strategic Prevention Framework/Partnerships for Success...109,754,000\n  Mandatory Drug Testing......................................4,906,000\n  Minority AIDS..............................................41,307,000\n  Sober Truth on Preventing Underage Drinking (STOP Act)......7,931,000\n    National Adult-Oriented Media Public Service Campaign.....1,000,000\n    Community-based Coalition Enhancement Grants..............5,931,000\n    Intergovernmental Coordinating Committee on the Prevention of \n      Underage Drinking.......................................1,000,000\nScience and Service\n  Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder.............................9,802,000\n  Center for the Application of Prevention Technologies.......7,511,000\n  Science and Service Program Coordination....................4,082,000\n  Minority Fellowship Program....................................71,000\n       SAMHSA shall make continuation awards for Strategic \n     Prevention Framework State Incentive Grant/Partnerships for \n     Success (SPFSIG/PFS) grantees at amounts not less than what \n     grantees received in fiscal year 2012. Furthermore, SAMHSA \n     shall use any additional funding to provide new grants under \n     SPFSIG/PFS. These new grants shall be awarded as the program \n     was originally designed prior to fiscal year 2011, with \n     similar eligible applicants, a multiyear project period, and \n     reliance on epidemiological workgroups. SAMHSA shall award \n     these multiyear grants on an annual, incremental basis rather \n     than fully funding them in fiscal year 2013.\n\n\n                HEALTH SURVEILLANCE AND PROGRAM SUPPORT\n\n       Within the total provided for health surveillance and \n     program support, the bill includes the following amounts:\n\n\n        Budget activity                                   FY 2013 level\nHealth Surveillance..............................................29,424\nProgram Management...............................................72,229\nMilitary Families.................................................3,500\nPublic Awareness and Support.....................................13,545\nPerformance and Quality Info.

These funds are made \n     available through section 241 of the Public Health Service \n     (PHS) Act.\n       Within the total for the Patient Safety Research portfolio, \n     the bill provides $4,000,000 for research grants authorized \n     by section 933 of the PHS Act, as proposed in Senate Report \n     112-176.\n       Within the total for the Crosscutting Activities Related to \n     Quality, Effectiveness and Efficiency Research portfolio, the \n     bill provides $38,555,000 for investigator-initiated \n     research.\n\n               Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\n\n\n                           PROGRAM MANAGEMENT\n\n       The bill includes $3,826,187,000 for the Program Management \n     account. The bill moves the State Health Insurance Assistance \n     Program from CMS Program Management to the\n\n[[Page S1749]]\n\n     Administration for Community Living. The conferees recommend \n     the following levels within the Program Management account:\n\n\n        Program management                                FY 2013 level\nResearch, Demonstration and Evaluation......................$21,160,000\nProgram Operations........................................2,608,785,000\nState Survey and Certification..............................381,278,000\nState High Risk Insurance Pools..............................44,000,000\nFederal Administration......................................770,964,000\n       The bill includes funding for Research, Demonstration, and \n     Evaluation activities, including the Medicare Current \n     Beneficiary Survey. CMS is requested to include in its fiscal \n     year 2015 congressional budget justification all programs, \n     projects, and activities authorized in the Affordable Care \n     Act (ACA) intended to be supported, along with amounts \n     expended in the current year and 3 prior fiscal years.\n       CMS Policy Guidance.--CMS uses Medicare Administrative \n     Contractors (MACs) as its agents in lieu of federal employees \n     to process reimbursement activity. The MACs may develop and \n     implement independent policies, which can be perceived as \n     being inconsistent with CMS guidance. CMS is requested to \n     provide a detailed description in the fiscal year 2015 budget \n     request of the mechanisms CMS has in place or plans to put in \n     place to ensure its contracting agents consistently adhere to \n     CMS policies.\n       Critical Access Hospitals.--The Secretary is urged to \n     create a review process for those hospitals less than 35 \n     miles by primary road from the nearest hospital for the \n     purpose of improving access to essential health services, \n     including acute medical inpatient care. If changes are \n     required, HHS should work with Congress for approval. CMS is \n     encouraged to work with the Office of Rural Health Policy in \n     HRSA to ensure that rural patients maintain access to \n     necessary health services.\n       Fungal Meningitis.--The 2012 outbreak of fungal meningitis \n     remains a concern, with more than 500 illnesses and a median \n     patient age in the late 60s. While the primary responsibility \n     for ensuring the safety of drugs lies with other agencies of \n     Federal and State government, CMS should consider whether \n     there are actions it can take to ensure that the providers \n     are operating in a manner that is consistent with State and \n     Federal standards, and report to the Committees on \n     Appropriations within 180 days of enactment of this act \n     regarding its conclusions.\n       Fraud, Waste, and Abuse.--CMS is urged to implement a \n     process across all operations to increase its focus on \n     preventing improper payments and paying claims right the \n     first time. A 2010 GAO report found that CMS had no formal \n     process in place to ensure that vulnerabilities identified by \n     the Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC) program are addressed. \n     CMS is directed to include in its annual report to Congress \n     the steps it has taken to implement a systematic process \n     across all operations to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse \n     in both federal and contractor-operated program and \n     administrative activities and an accounting of RAC-\n     reported vulnerabilities. Similar language was proposed in \n     the Senate Report 112-176.\n       Rural Patient Access.--The Committees on Appropriations \n     strongly support efforts to preserve and improve rural \n     patient access to providers and durable medical equipment \n     (DME). CMS is requested to provide an update in the fiscal \n     year 2015 budget request on the steps CMS is taking to ensure \n     changes due to the competitive bidding process will not \n     negatively impact rural patient access to quality DME.\n\n\n              HEALTH CARE FRAUD AND ABUSE CONTROL ACCOUNT\n\n       The bill includes $309,790,000 from the Medicare Trust Fund \n     for the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control account.\n       Medicare Fraud Prevention.--CMS is expected to develop a \n     more robust set of tools to prevent fraud, for example using \n     the latest technology to ensure only valid beneficiaries and \n     valid providers receive benefits and ensure that payments are \n     for authorized benefits. GAO is directed to review the \n     feasibility, cost, benefits, and barriers for CMS to \n     implement a Medicare transactional system with ``smart card'' \n     type technology. The review must examine technology related \n     to beneficiary and provider validation and authentication at \n     point of entry for provider care within the Medicare program \n     and consider ease of implementation, impact on the \n     beneficiary and provider, ease of use, cost attributes (long \n     and short term), and other criteria relevant decision making, \n     sourcing and implementation. GAO is expected to publish a \n     report within 1 year after enactment of this act.\n\n                Administration for Children and Families\n\n\n                     REFUGEE AND ENTRANT ASSISTANCE\n\n       The Department of HHS shall provide a briefing within 45 \n     days of enactment for the House and Senate Committees on \n     Appropriations regarding the rate of expenditure for all \n     Refugee and Entrant Assistance programs, including \n     information on the number of unaccompanied alien children \n     placed into the Department's care, the number of arriving \n     refugees and refugees otherwise receiving services, and how \n     the characteristics of these populations have changed over \n     recent years.\n\n\n                 CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT\n\n       The bill includes a $110,000,000 increase for the Child \n     Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG), including a \n     $14,035,000 increase in existing set-asides for quality \n     improvement activities. HHS is encouraged to continue efforts \n     to improve the quality of child care programs, including the \n     early childhood care and education workforce.\n       Under current law State child care agencies may use CCDBG \n     funding to pay for a wide variety of initiatives, including \n     helping providers with the cost of supplies, such as diapers \n     for infants and toddlers.\n\n\n                CHILDREN AND FAMILIES SERVICES PROGRAMS\n\n       Within the funds provided for Head Start, the bill includes \n     $25,000,000 to support the transition costs associated with \n     the Designation Renewal System and $25,000,000 for grantee \n     cost-of-living adjustments.\n       The bill includes $3,000,000 within Child Abuse \n     Discretionary for competitive grants to support the \n     implementation of research-based court teams models that \n     include the court system, child welfare agency, and community \n     organizations in order to better meet the needs of infants \n     and toddlers in foster care.\n       The bill includes up to $10,000,000 for the Healthy Foods \n     Financing Initiative within the Community Economic \n     Development Program.\n       The Department of HHS is encouraged to support efforts that \n     help TANF recipients graduate high school or complete a GED, \n     which is often critical to securing employment.\n\n                  Administration for Community Living\n\n\n                 AGING AND DISABILITY SERVICES PROGRAMS\n\n                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)\n\n       The bill transfers the State Health Insurance Assistance \n     Program from the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services to \n     the Administration for Community Living (ACL).\n       Within the funding provided, the bill provides $998,000 to \n     continue the 24-hour call center to support Alzheimer's \n     family caregivers.\n       The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations received \n     no advance notice that the Department intended to establish \n     the ACL when the fiscal year 2013 budget was submitted to \n     Congress. Carrying out such organizational changes without \n     advance notice ignores the critical oversight role of the \n     Committees on Appropriations. This is not a precedent that \n     should occur again and the Department is urged to provide \n     advance notice of such mergers, particularly when they have \n     an impact on appropriations structures and funding levels. \n     ACL shall provide the House and Senate Committees on \n     Appropriations a briefing within 30 days of enactment on how \n     ACL is balancing the needs of the disabled and elderly \n     communities.\n\n                        Office of the Secretary\n\n\n                    GENERAL DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT\n\n       The Department is directed to include in its annual budget \n     justifications the amount of administrative and overhead \n     costs spent by the Department for every major budget line. \n     Beginning in fiscal year 2015, and each year thereafter, the \n     Department shall include the amount and percentage of \n     administrative and overhead costs spent by the Department for \n     every program, project and activity.\n       The Department is directed to issue a report identifying \n     which programs throughout HHS address teen dating violence \n     and healthy relationship strategies as a means to prevent \n     teen pregnancy.\n       The Comptroller General is directed to issue a report \n     within 180 days of enactment on the Department's coordination \n     of activities related to patient centered outcomes research \n     (PCOR), whether funded in this bill or through the Patient \n     Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund. The report should \n     review the processes and practices used by the Department to \n     ensure that the various operating divisions supporting \n     patient centered outcomes research prevents duplication and \n     is coordinated. Further, the report should review the \n     criteria and procedures used by the Department prior to \n     disseminating or making recommendations based on patient \n     centered outcomes research results. The report should also \n     include a review of the evaluation criteria used to allocate \n     funding and determine research topics, as well as the \n     metrics to measure effectiveness.\n       The bill provides $250,000 for the Advisory Council on \n     Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services, $1,000,000 for a \n     competitive grant or contract for the principal purpose of \n     providing assistance regarding transportation assistance for \n     individuals with disabilities, $1,000,000 to continue the \n     national health education program on lupus for healthcare \n     providers, and $3,010,000 to continue the preventing violence \n     against women initiative.\n       HHS is directed to include in future budget requests \n     information on user fees, reimbursements, and other sources \n     of funding available to HHS operating divisions that itemizes \n     the actual and estimated collections for each activity and \n     the actual annual costs related to each associated user fee, \n     reimbursement, and other funding source used to support these \n     activities.\n       The Department is directed to ensure that all necessary and \n     feasible steps have been taken to ensure that Antideficiency \n     Act violations similar to those reported on July 14, 2011 do \n     not occur in the future. The Department is directed to ensure \n     that future Antideficiency Act violations are submitted in a \n     timely manner with the appropriate account adjustment or \n     other action to remedy the violations.\n       HHS is urged to work with Congress to propose a special \n     hiring authority in lieu of the\n\n[[Page S1750]]\n\n     continued expanded use of title 42. The Department is \n     requested to issue a report on the key parameters that would \n     need to be included in a special hiring authority within 180 \n     days of enactment to the House and Senate Committees on \n     Appropriations and the relevant authorizing committees.\n       The Secretary is encouraged to issue the rules and \n     regulations required by P.L. 111-353 in a timely manner.\n       The Department is urged to continue existing programs run \n     by the Office of Minority Health that address health \n     disparities in rural and disadvantaged populations.\n\n\n                      OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL\n\n       The Office of Inspector General (OIG) is directed to \n     provide a report to the Committees on Appropriations of the \n     House of Representatives and the Senate that provides an \n     update on OIG activities related to the investigation of \n     grantees' use of taxpayer resources to influence laws, \n     regulations or policies at the State or local level. \n     Additionally, the report should include detail as to how HHS \n     is implementing any new policies and how the Department is \n     tracking or monitoring grantee performance.\n\n\n            PUBLIC HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES EMERGENCY FUND\n\n                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)\n\n       The Department is directed to issue a report, not later \n     than 90 days after the date of enactment of this act, on the \n     implementation of a 5-year budgetary planning process for the \n     development of medical countermeasures. The report should \n     include end-to-end details of planned investments, including \n     the costs associated with existing and anticipated new \n     research and development, the costs of procuring and \n     maintaining all materials placed in the Strategic National \n     Stockpile, and the costs associated with distribution, \n     dispensing and surveillance. The report should include the \n     costs necessary to ensure sustainability of the multiple \n     Centers for Innovation and Advanced Manufacturing. The report \n     should also include details of the investment and progress \n     made to date in the development of products for diagnosis, \n     protection and treatment for the full range of radiation \n     exposures from nuclear and radiation threats.\n\n                           General Provisions\n\n\n                          EVALUATION TAP LEVEL\n\n       The bill modifies a provision establishing reprogramming \n     requirements for evaluation tap funding.\n\n\n PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ACCESS REGARDING THE USE OF FUNDS PROVIDED BY THE \n               PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT\n\n       The bill includes a modified provision relating to the \n     improvement of a more accessible Web site that details the \n     use of funds made available under section 4002 of the Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n  PERSONNEL SUPPORT FOR THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT\n\n       The bill includes a new provision relating to the public \n     disclosure of the number of full-time equivalent Federal \n     employees or contractors assigned to activities to carry out \n     the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \n     Act.\n\n                               TITLE III\n\n                        DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\n\n                    Education for the Disadvantaged\n\n       The bill includes a new provision clarifying that title I \n     funds may be used to address the transportation needs of \n     homeless children and youth, as well as support homeless \n     liaisons.\n       The bill includes new language under the School Improvement \n     Grant (SIG) program that allows funds to be used to implement \n     a research-proven, whole-school reform model.\n       New language is also included that will allow a State \n     educational agency, with the approval of the Secretary, to \n     establish an alternative State-determined school improvement \n     strategy that may be used by local educational agencies under \n     the SIG program. The purpose of this alternative strategy is \n     to allow State educational agencies to develop their own \n     flexible models that can be implemented by local educational \n     agencies that receive SIG funds.\n       It is expected that any approach taken with SIG funds \n     should address school-wide factors, whole school culture, the \n     individual needs of the students and data to inform \n     instruction and for continuous improvement; ensure that the \n     needs of students are addressed through the organization of \n     the school, curriculum and instruction, and social and \n     emotional support services; as well as address teacher and \n     leader effectiveness, including through training and support \n     for teachers and school leaders in school improvement efforts \n     and in the needs of students.\n       The bill also includes new language to allow local \n     educational agencies that are eligible to receive services \n     under the Rural Education Achievement Program to modify not \n     more than one element required under a school improvement \n     model.\n       Over the past decade Bureau of Indian Education schools \n     have received approximately 0.7 percent of each year's \n     appropriation for ESEA Title I Grants to LEAs. The Department \n     is urged to continue using its existing formula in allocating \n     these funds and to follow this practice in any relevant \n     future emergency funding that provides it the same authority \n     and discretion.\n\n                               Impact Aid\n\n       The bill includes language providing for formula grants for \n     Impact Aid construction grants.\n\n                      School Improvement Programs\n\n       The bill allows for up to 3 percent of funds available for \n     the State Grants for Improving Teacher Quality program to be \n     used for competitive awards to national not-for-profit \n     organizations for recruiting, training, or providing \n     professional enhancement activities, including in the area of \n     civic education, for teachers or school leaders, particularly \n     for high-need schools most likely to face shortages in these \n     areas. The bill allows up to 10 percent of the set-aside \n     funds to be used for related research, development, \n     evaluation, dissemination, and technical assistance.\n       The bill provides $380,000,000 for formula grants to States \n     and $9,214,000 for competitive grants to improve the quality \n     and reliability of assessment systems within the State \n     Assessments and Enhanced Assessments Instruments program.\n\n                       Innovation and Improvement\n\n       The bill includes $549,284,000 for the Race to the Top \n     program. These funds are available for obligation through \n     December 31, 2013.\n       The Departments of Education and HHS are directed to use \n     this appropriation for another competition under the Race to \n     the Top--Early Learning Challenge (RTT-ELC). In combination \n     with additional resources allocated for the CCDBG and Head \n     Start programs, it is expected that these investments will \n     help improve early learning and development systems and \n     opportunities for young children.\n       The bill includes $149,417,000 for the Investing in \n     Innovation program, as described in Senate Report 112-176. \n     The bill does not include the new authority and funding \n     proposed in the Senate bill regarding ARPA-ED.\n       An opportunity to review the results from the significant \n     investment made in both the RTT and Investing in Innovation \n     programs is expected. The Secretary is directed to continue \n     to provide the Committees on Appropriations of the House of \n     Representatives and Senate the findings from evaluations, \n     including impact evaluations and interim progress \n     evaluations, of activities conducted using these funds.\n       The bill includes $14,097,000 for continuation costs for \n     the School Leadership program.\n       Within FIE, the bill includes funding for the following \n     activities in the following amounts:\n\n\n        Budget activity                                   FY 2013 level\nArts in Education...........................................$26,500,000\nData Quality and Evaluation...................................1,276,000\nFull Service Community Schools...............................11,094,000\nNational Clearinghouse for Educational Facilities.............1,000,000\nPeer Review.....................................................350,000\nChild Literacy Initiative....................................29,000,000\n       The bill also includes $10,000,000 for a new STEM \n     initiative, as described in Senate Report 112-176.\n\n                           Special Education\n\n       The bill includes new language clarifying provisions of the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The first \n     provision clarifies that penalties paid by States for \n     violating maintenance of effort under part B of the IDEA \n     shall be reallocated to States by formula to those States \n     that did not violate those requirements. The language further \n     clarifies that both the reduced State allocations due to \n     penalties paid and increased amounts under the reallocation \n     shall not be considered in fiscal year 2013 or future years \n     for allocations under the statutory formula. The bill also \n     includes new language clarifying that the level of effort \n     under part B that a LEA must meet in the year after it fails \n     to maintain its fiscal effort is the level that it should \n     have met in the prior year. This language clarifies \n     congressional intent and is consistent with the Office of \n     Special Education Program's (OSEP's) April 4, 2012, informal \n     guidance letter on the issue.\n       Additionally, the bill includes language clarifying that \n     funds reserved under section 611(c) of the IDEA may be used \n     to help improve State capacity to meet data collection \n     requirements under the IDEA and improve data collection, \n     quality, and use under the act.\n       The bill includes new language allowing the Department to \n     use up to $2,710,000 for incentive grants to States that \n     choose to serve children 3 years old until entrance into \n     elementary school, as described in Senate report 112-176.\n       Within this account, the bill includes $1,996,000 to remain \n     available through September 30, 2014, for the Promoting \n     Readiness of Minors in SSI (PROMISE) program. The bill \n     includes language that slightly modifies the program as it \n     was initially created in last year's bill. The bill also \n     includes new language that allows a portion of the funds \n     provided to be used for Pay for Success awards, as described \n     in Senate Report 112-176. The Committees on Appropriations of \n     the House of Representatives and Senate expect to be notified \n     prior to the issuance of any notice related to the Pay for \n     Success activity.\n\n            Rehabilitation Services and Disability Research\n\n       The bill includes $3,624,226,000 for Rehabilitation \n     Services and Disability Research.\n       The bill includes $6,075,000 for Demonstration and Training \n     Programs. Within this amount, the bill includes $750,000 to \n     support a new competition for parent training and\n\n[[Page S1751]]\n\n     information centers. The Rehabilitation Services \n     Administration (RSA) shall coordinate with OSEP in carrying \n     out this activity. The bill does not include funding for new \n     technical assistance activities at RSA.\n       The bill continues language allowing unmatched funds in \n     excess of any funds requested during the reallotment process \n     to be available for the PROMISE program referenced under the \n     Special Education account. Such funds used for the PROMISE \n     program will remain available for obligation through \n     September 30, 2014.\n       The bill allows up to $20,000,000 made available to PROMISE \n     after reallotment to be used for Pay for Success, as \n     described in Senate Report 112-176. The Federal Government \n     will use funds to pay for defined outcomes, such as \n     employment or graduation. Philanthropic groups and social \n     impact investors will finance the services and would earn \n     payments if those services lead to the agreed-upon outcomes. \n     Any funds deobligated from Pay for Success projects will be \n     immediately available for programs authorized under the \n     Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\n       The bill includes $37,771,000 for the Assistive Technology \n     program. This includes $30,492,000 for State grant activities \n     authorized under section 4 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; \n     $4,283,000 for protection and advocacy systems authorized \n     under section 5; $996,000 for technical assistance activities \n     authorized under section 6; and $2,000,000 to support \n     alternative financing programs (AFPs) that provide financing \n     mechanisms for loans.\n       AFPs have had success in providing low-interest loan funds, \n     interest buy-down programs, revolving loan funds, and loan \n     guarantees, and in emphasizing consumer choice and control \n     and other partnerships that help people with disabilities \n     acquire assistive technology devices through loans. Such \n     devices and services enable people with disabilities to live \n     independently and often are the means that enable them to \n     become or remain employed. While many State programs have \n     developed equipment demonstration projects, lending libraries \n     and reuse programs, these do not cover certain types of \n     higher-cost expenses that promote independence, such as \n     adapting vehicles and modifying home entrances and showers to \n     enable people to remain in their homes.\n\n           Special Institutions for Persons With Disabilities\n\n\n               NATIONAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE FOR THE DEAF\n\n       The bill includes $65,422,000 for the National Technical \n     Institute for the Deaf. Funding for construction will be \n     considered in the future as needs may warrant.\n\n                      Student Financial Assistance\n\n       The Department shall provide the same funding in fiscal \n     year 2013 as in fiscal year 2012 for the Work Colleges \n     program authorized under section 448 of the Higher Education \n     Act (HEA) from the Federal Work-Study Program appropriation.\n\n                            Higher Education\n\n       The bill includes $67,432,000 for International Education \n     and Foreign Language Studies--Domestic programs. The increase \n     in funds over the fiscal year 2012 level will support new \n     awards in the Undergraduate International Studies and Foreign \n     Language programs and expand access to study abroad, as \n     authorized by section 604(b) of the HEA.\n       The bill includes language allowing funds awarded under the \n     Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need program to be \n     used to fund continuation costs for the Javits Fellowship \n     program.\n       The bill includes $29,494,000 for the Fund for the \n     Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE). Within the \n     amount for FIPSE, the bill includes $25,000,000 for the First \n     in the World initiative, with up to $9,000,000 set aside for \n     minority-serving institutions; $1,128,000 for the Training \n     for Realtime Writers program; $2,366,000 for continuations \n     for international consortia projects; and $1,000,000 for the \n     Secretary to enter into an agreement with the National \n     Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences to \n     conduct a study on the impact of Federal regulations and \n     reporting requirements on institutions of higher education as \n     authorized under section 1106 of the Higher Education \n     Opportunity Act of 2008.\n       The bill includes $854,932,000 for TRIO. The last Upward \n     Bound grant competition may have disadvantaged applicants in \n     rural areas. Many of the rural programs that were not renewed \n     in the last round are located in areas of extreme poverty \n     that would appear to be prime targets for Upward Bound \n     grants. The Department shall provide an analysis within 60 \n     days of enactment of this act of how selection criteria and \n     outcomes changed in the past Upward Bound grant cycle, in \n     order to determine whether applicants from rural areas were \n     put at a disadvantage compared to other applicants.\n\n  Historically Black College and University Capital Financing Program \n                                Account\n\n       The bill includes language allowing funds for the HBCU \n     Capital Financing Program to remain available through \n     September 30, 2014.\n\n                    Institute of Education Sciences\n\n       The bill includes $38,077,000 for Statewide Data Systems. \n     The bill allows up to $10,000,000 to be used for awards to \n     public or private agencies or organizations to support \n     activities to improve data coordination, quality, and use at \n     the local, State, and national levels.

The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I wish to speak on the bill and \ncomment on the amendment.\n  First of all, I want to say to the Senator from Iowa how much I \nadmire him and the fantastic job he has done on behalf of the poor, \npeople who didn't have health care, and the disabled people who had no \nvoice in Washington. I want the Senator to know I am so sorry he is \nretiring. I really am. The Senator is neither shy nor retiring in the \nleadership role he played and the very pragmatic solutions he came up \nwith over the years.\n  If I may ask, how long has the Senator chaired the subcommittee on \nLabor-HHS?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Before I respond specifically to the question, let me \nalso state how proud I am of the Senator from Maryland and her long \nservice, now the longest serving woman in the history of the Senate, \nand her devotion to the underprivileged, to those who lack a voice and \na vote in the Senate. There is no one stronger for them than the \nSenator from Maryland.\n  It has been a pleasure of mine to work with the Senator through all \nthese years. I can honestly say I don't remember any time we have ever \ndisagreed on anything.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The Senator is correct. If I might comment back, we \nsound like two war horses at the VFW Hall. The next thing, if it wasn't \nprohibited, we would be doing shooters on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate the Senator's sentiments. One of the things \nwhich makes me feel comfortable about retiring is knowing this \ncommittee is left in good hands, and I mean that, really good hands.\n  To answer the Senator's question, I have been either chair or ranking \nmember of this subcommittee since 1989. When the Democrats were in \ncharge I was chair up until 1995, and then Senator Specter was chair \nfrom then until 2001. Following that, I became chair for about a year \nand a half or two. It went back to Republicans, and I picked it back up \nagain in 2007. Since 1989, I was chairman or ranking member of the \nsubcommittee.\n\n[[Page S1765]]\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. This would be, in 2014, essentially the Senator's \ndiamond jubilee, 25 years.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. We could exchange a lot of things about diamonds, but \nthat would be quite a benchmark.\n  This is what I am going to say: What we would like to do is return to \nregular order where the Senator could have brought his bill to the \nfloor all by itself--not in the midst of a threat of a showdown, \nshutdown, lockdown. He could have brought it up with his ranking \nmember. Now you have the Senator from Kansas, Mr. Moran, and we have \nopen, public debate, transparent, going through category after \ncategory: education, special education, funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health, the Department of Labor, all of those things.\n  The Senator's subcommittee is one of the most robust, other than \ndefense, and second in size in expenditure. It funds the entire \nDepartment of Labor, the entire Department of Education, and the entire \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. Under that, there are \nspectacular agencies and independent agencies, such as the Social \nSecurity Administration, which is literally headquartered in my \nhometown of Baltimore.\n  It has, I would say, 40 percent of the domestic expenditures which \nmeet compelling human need. It also funds the kinds of programs we need \nfor the workforce of the future and our research of the future.\n  The Senator deserves to have his day. Anyone who wishes to analyze \nit, scrutinize it, amend it, improve it from both sides of the aisle \nshould do this.\n  I say to my colleague, what I want to do is get this bill through \nthis Senate, working with my colleague Senator Shelby, who has been my \nranking member over the years and who is so well versed on the \nagreement. Essentially, the ideal situation would have been regular \norder where we would have passed our bills before October 1. You could \nhave been on the Senate floor.\n  Now we are in something called a continuing resolution where the \nentire Federal Government is in one package. Everybody is trying to \nparse it, understand it, and they should. This is not the way to \ngovern. We shouldn't be threatened with these deadlines and kind of an \nultimatum-type situation.\n  We are going to try to do the best we can. The Senator has made his \npoint and done it robustly. He produced a great bill, along with \nSenator Shelby, in terms of coming out of the subcommittee, and then \nfashioned it. It is not only great on content, policy, but it has the \nsense of receiving value for the dollar as well and keeps an eye on \nthat.\n  At the same time, we were able to fashion a bipartisan agreement, but \nyou couldn't move the bill. Here we are now into this larger issue. My \njob is to get this bill through the Senate, working with Senator \nShelby. This is our job.\n  I am going to say to Senator Harkin and to all Members on both sides \nof the aisle, we need to get back to regular order. We can't be doing \nbig bills nobody understands, that everybody is suspicious of. We need \nto be able to do this the way the founders of the Appropriations \nCommittee wanted us to, committee by committee, out in the open, with \nfull and open debate where we could focus on the content. When we bring \nCommerce-Justice-Science, we can focus on the Justice Department, focus \non Federal law enforcement, and focus on science programs.\n  We can look at Labor-HHS, which has such an enormous labor impact on \nour economy and an impact on the future of our economy. Remember, \nresearch and development, the workforce of the future, through \neducation, Pell Grants, are all of the great things on this bill.\n  As the Senator proposes this amendment and the Senate works its will \non this amendment, I want to say get the job done. Let's get the bill \npassed and then let's solve the sequester problem, which has a \nDraconian shield hold over us. Let's get rid of brinkmanship, shutdown, \nshowdown politics.\n  Let's return to our regular order where we may produce bills, debate \nthem in the full sunshine of the Senate--and not only do a good job, \nbut the American people can understand what we are doing. There aren't \njust views on policy. This is America. That is what a democracy is and \nwhat a parliamentary body is. We should be able to bring process and \nprocedure. This means following a regular order with our legislation.\n  I thank the subcommittee chairman, Senator Harkin, for his advocacy \nin the last 2 years. He and Senator Shelby worked together to produce a \ngreat bill. We are where we are, and I hope we do all we can to pass \nthe bill and return to regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I would be remiss, while we are on the \nSenate floor, as I was thinking about Senator Harkin, Senator Mikulski, \nboth senior Members--she is the chairperson of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee where I have had the privilege to serve a \nnumber of years. We all go back to our House days. That is where I \nfirst met Senator Harkin. He was a couple of years younger then, and so \nwas I. Senator Mikulski and I were on the same committees over there. \nSenator Harkin came to the Senate a couple of years before we did. We \nhave been involved together on the issues and against each other and so \nforth, but we stayed friends. And I think Senator Harkin is absolutely \nright. Senator Mikulski is very on point on regular order; that what we \nare trying to do on the Appropriations Committee--and this is a big \nstart here--is to go back to the way we used to do things--regular \norder. We would have our spirited debates--and they were spirited--in \nthe subcommittees of Appropriations, the full committee would come to \nthe floor, and we would debate it, vote on it, and go to a conference \nwith the House, work it out, come back, and live with it. We haven't \ndone that in a long time. What we are trying to do now is get back on \nthat track, and this is a big first step.\n\n  Having said that, I would like to take just a few minutes to speak on \nChairman Harkin's amendment. I believe there are three critical points \nmy colleagues should understand about this amendment. First, the draft \nomnibus that has been talked about was never finalized. There were more \nthan a dozen significant items not agreed to at the time negotiations \nended in December. A lot of those negotiations were done at the staff \nlevel. Critical decisions regarding health care, education, and labor \npolicies and billions of dollars in funding decisions at that point \nremained undecided. They were never finalized.\n  I think these provisions have been decided and put in this amendment \nwithout consultation by Senator Harkin. These items included such \ncritical issues as conscience protections for health care providers and \nprovisions limiting the job-killing rules by the National Labor \nRelations Board. Those were critical issues for us.\n  Second, the Harkin amendment replaces a bipartisan continuing \nresolution which the distinguished chairperson has been talking about \nhere for 2 days which includes key provisions in this bill we filed \nwhich would support research at the National Institutes of Health and \nemergency operations at the Centers for Disease Control with a 160-page \nbill that no Republican has approved. I believe the Harkin amendment \nboth begins new programs and makes authorization changes to programs.\n  In addition, any program that did not receive an increase in funding \nduring negotiation on the draft omnibus that he has talked about is cut \nin an across-the-board cut. These reductions hit critical job-training \nprograms and funding for hospital preparedness.\n  Finally, if the Harkin amendment is agreed to, it will undo a very \nfragile consensus and poison the entire continuing resolution we have \nput before us, putting our government at the risk of a shutdown. None \nof us want that. House leadership has already stated they cannot and \nwill not support the inclusion of the Harkin amendment, and I don't \nbelieve we should risk funding the entire Federal Government to do so.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I want to respond to my friend from \nAlabama, and he is my friend, and he knows that very well. We have \ntraveled\n\n[[Page S1766]]\n\ntogether. Our spouses are friends, and he is a dear friend of mine. We \nhave worked together, as he said, going clear back to our House days. \nBut I am disappointed that my friend opposes this amendment. If there \nis one thing that has been clear in my association with the Senator \nfrom Alabama through all these years, I think it is that he has been an \nunrelenting champion of NIH research. I am told the University of \nAlabama at Birmingham ranks 11th in terms of NIH funding. That is even \nhigher than the University of Iowa, by the way.\n  So my amendment, as my friend knows, would put in a $211 million \nincrease for NIH funding that goes around the country. It doesn't just \ngo to Maryland, although some goes to Maryland, but a lot goes around \nthe country. So this does that.\n  Then I would say to my friend from Alabama, during the negotiations \nfrom last year, the Senator from Alabama offered an amendment during \nour full committee markup--that was last July--that would require the \nDepartment of Labor to delay both the wage rule and the comprehensive \nrule regarding H-2B visas. I opposed the amendment, but I included it \nbecause it was, again, part of a bipartisan, bicameral agreement.\n  The Senator is right that this agreement was never signed off on \nhigh--I guess by the Speaker of the House or the majority or minority \nleader here in the Senate--but usually they have been very \naccommodating if the Appropriations Committee agrees and we all agree \non what is called the four corners: the Republican House, the \nDemocratic House, the Republican Senate, and the Democratic Senate. \nBasically, we would move those bills.\n  So, again, this amendment that was offered by my friend from Alabama \nthat would require the Department of Labor to delay both the wage rule \nand the comprehensive rule regarding H-2B visas is in this amendment, \neven though I oppose it, because it was part of a bipartisan agreement. \nThe only way this provision can take effect is by approving my \namendment because it is not in the CR. Since my friend from Alabama \noffered this amendment, I think he considered it to be important, he \nfought for it, but it won't take effect in a CR.\n  I would also remind my friend and others that the cost of this \namendment is the same as in the underlying substitute.\n  My friend said there were other things in the bill in December that \nwere not finalized. That is true, I say to my friend. That is very \ntrue, there were other things. But these were called riders. Some were \nRepublican riders, some were Democratic riders. Are they in this bill? \nNo, because they weren't agreed to. They were there, but they were \nnever agreed to--and for good reason. Some of them were, obviously, \nvery closely held by Democrats and some very closely held by \nRepublicans, so there just wasn't agreement.\n  I am just saying that in the amendment now before us are the things \non which we did agree. So the Senator is right. Some of the things that \nwere out there on the riders we didn't include because they simply were \nnot agreed to in December. I am just saying that what is in this bill \nis what we did agree to in December.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  EPA\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this week, March 10 to 16, has been \ndesignated Sunshine Week. What better time for it this year since \nPresident Obama has a brandnew nominee to head the Environmental \nProtection Agency, and that agency is in desperate need of sunshine and \ntransparency. In the midst of Sunshine Week, I wanted to talk about \nthese very serious issues.\n  First of all, let's go back a little bit. The first day President \nObama took office in 2009, the White House Web site declared that his \nadministration would become ``the most open and transparent in \nhistory.'' The President issued high-profile orders pledging ``a new \nera'' and ``an unprecedented level of openness'' across the Federal \nGovernment. Those are great goals and great aspirations. Unfortunately, \nthe record--particularly, as I said, at the EPA--is a lot different.\n  President Obama's EPA has earned a reputation for ignoring \ncongressional information requests, ignoring and frustrating FOIA--the \nFreedom of Information Act--hiding elite e-mails, which is completely \ncontrary to EPA policy, and hiding other important information from the \npublic. Is it in desperate need of a new leader who will reverse these \nantisunshine, antitransparency practices and build a true culture of \ntransparency and openness. Unfortunately, President Obama's nominee, \nGina McCarthy, comes from inside the very troubled agency and she has \nbeen directly involved in many of these problem areas. That is why I \nthink we need to talk about these concerns.\n  I wish to go through four important categories where the EPA--\nincluding during Gina McCarthy's service--has exhibited a complete lack \nof transparency. It has been exactly the opposite of sunshine, \nopenness, and transparency.\n  First of all, e-mails and the growing e-mail scandal. A lot of the \nEPA's troubles have surfaced through their dubious e-mail practices, e-\nmail practices that have been used, in my opinion, clearly to \ncircumvent transparency laws such as FOIA and to circumvent \ncongressional oversight. We have uncovered the use of alias e-mail \naccounts and private e-mail accounts to conduct official agency \nbusiness.\n  What is the issue there? The issue is that clearly this is a way to \navoid transparency, avoid these being produced through FOIA requests, \nand try to avoid producing these important e-mails when Congress has \nasked for them and to keep the public and Congress in the dark.\n  The most infamous example of this is Lisa Jackson, the former EPA \nAdministrator's complete disregard for transparency through her Richard \nWindsor e-mails. Richard Windsor was an alias. I think, clearly in my \nopinion, she used this alias when it came to openness and producing \ndocuments, et cetera, that this was not necessarily her.\n  As it turns out, multiple EPA officials have been conducting business \nthrough aliases or through private e-mail accounts, and these private \ne-mail accounts are absolutely prohibited by the EPA. In spite of that, \nwe have uncovered a pattern. This is not an isolated incident. It is \nnot just Richard Windsor who has been used as an alias, but there is a \npattern. The Acting Administrator, Bob Perciasepe, has used an alias \nprivate account. Region 8 Administrator Martin used me.com, a private \naccount; Region 9 Administrator Blumenfeld used comcast.net, a former \naccount; former Deputy General Counsel Yang, a lawyer for the EPA, used \na gmail.com account. That is completely contrary to the clear rules of \nthe EPA.\n  It doesn't stop with the use of these completely improper private e-\nmail accounts for official business. We have also uncovered high-level \nofficials collaborating with environmental groups to push their biased \nagenda. Administrator Martin--since he resigned over all this when we \nhad this come out--regularly communicated with far-left environmental \ngroups such as the Environmental Defense Fund on his personal e-mail \naccount to circumvent Federal transparency laws. His personal e-mails, \nwhich we have since gotten, exposed the EPA's efforts to further bury \ncoal plants under crushing regulations.\n  Again, this is not just some technicality. These private accounts and \naliases were clearly used to hide stuff from Congress, hide stuff from \nthe public, and to try not to disclose all this collusion with outside \nenvironmental groups and what--in my opinion--is a far-left agenda.\n  Another very important category is FOIA. FOIA is the Freedom of \nInformation Act. It was passed into law by Congress in 1966. It was \npassed for a very simple purpose: to direct sunshine onto the Federal \nGovernment. Here we\n\n[[Page S1767]]\n\nare in the middle of Sunshine Week, and FOIA is a classic example of an \nimportant tool to direct sunshine onto the Federal Government.\n  Under former Administrator Jackson's leadership, FOIA has become a \njoke at the EPA. Al Armendariz, the former EPA Administrator, had to \nresign after claiming it was EPA's policy to ``crucify'' domestic \nbusinesses. He actually called FOIA ``nonsense.'' As others at the EPA \nwould try to have others think, Al Armendariz was not some rogue EPA \nofficial. In fact, this is the general attitude of the EPA.\n  The Obama administration again has tried to get away with the claim \nthat they are ``the most transparent in history.'' Yet as the \nAssociated Press has reported, they sometimes produce a lot of pieces \nof paper under FOIA, but ``more often than it ever has, it cited legal \nexceptions to censor or withhold the material, according to a new \nanalysis.''\n  This is a perfect example. This is a document produced under a FOIA \nrequest. It is one of the infamous Richard Windsor e-mails. Guess what \nis produced. Nothing. It is one thing to redact a few words or a \nparticularly sensitive sentence. They have produced absolutely nothing. \nThere is not a single word from the body of the e-mail. This is \nroutine. The EPA has regularly mismanaged FOIA requests. It is clearly \nin the business to frustrate these sorts of requests and not to follow \nthe law.\n  I would like to show some other examples. Again, these are produced \ne-mails. Most of them are from the infamous Richard Windsor e-mails. \nAgain, not a word in the body of any of these e-mails is produced. \nThere is not a single word. This is another good example. There is not \na single word produced. So we get plenty of paper, but what information \ndo we have for the public? Nothing.\n  There is something else that is particularly outrageous. We have an \ne-mail that was produced from the Office of General Counsel to Region 6 \nofficials. That e-mail talks about standard EPA protocol regarding FOIA \nrequests. It is not about a particular FOIA request, which might be \noverbroad, inappropriate, and might have arguments against it. Again, \nthis e-mail is from the EPA lawyers to an EPA region, and it is about \nhow to deal with FOIA in general. That standard EPA protocol--according \nto this e-mail--is ``to alert the requestor that they need to narrow \ntheir request because it is overbroad, and secondarily that it will \nprobably cost more than the amount of money they agreed to pay.'' Then \nwhen the requestor doesn't immediately respond to that, they just shut \ndown any EPA response.\n\n  Again, this is outrageous. This was not a response to a particular \nrequest. This was the advice from EPA lawyers about how they should \nalways consider responding. Just always say it is overbroad, just \nalways say it is going to cost more money, and then shut things down, \nfoot drag, and obstruct. That is absolutely ridiculous.\n  A third important category in this pattern of activity is EPA's use \nof secret data. This EPA, more than any other in history, has been \npromulgating rules and regulations which have a dramatic effect on \nmajor sectors of our economy. Obviously, this is a big deal and big \nconcern, particularly when it costs us jobs or potentially shuts down \nbusinesses. Yet the EPA has been completely opposed to releasing any of \nthe numbers, the science--the alleged science--and the data behind \nthese decisions.\n  Again, many of EPA's regulations have big pricetags. Yet EPA refuses \nto publicize the basic scientific data underlying virtually all of what \nthey have done. The new Clean Air Act rules are the biggest example. \nImplementing the Clean Air Act happens to be the responsibility, by the \nway, that Gina McCarthy has been directly overseeing since June of \n2009.\n  The National Ambient Air Quality Standards, for example, are complex \nand sweeping in their nature. The law requires, as it should, that they \nbe based on sound scientific data and that it be implemented through a \nrobust decisionmaking process. Unfortunately, that has not been the \ncase and recent standards have suffered from a rushed process, reliance \non secret data, and biased scientific review.\n  The only way we can fully know what is going on and have a discussion \nabout this is if EPA releases the underlying scientific data--the \nunderlying numbers. I have personally asked for this. In fact, this \nrequest is 20 months outstanding. I asked for it almost 2 full years \nago. Yet EPA has adamantly refused.\n  Recently, it has come to light that EPA fails to complete \ncomprehensive economic analyses of a majority of its rules. A February \n2013 study reveals that the Agency's disregard for economywide impacts, \nas well as any other discrete negative impacts, renders their cost-\nbenefit analyses to be misleading and based on manipulated data. Again, \nthis is a very important category.\n  If sunshine is to mean anything, if it is to have any real meaning as \nwe stand here in the midst of Sunshine Week, we need to see the data \nbehind these enormously important decisions. EPA cannot use secret \ndata. That is contrary to the letter and spirit of the law. It is \ncertainly contrary to the public having access to important information \nand to our responsibility in Congress on oversight.\n  The final category I wish to mention is the so-called unified agenda. \nUnder Federal law, every agency is required to produce their regulatory \nagenda. In fact, they are required to produce it under law twice a \nyear--once in the spring and once in the fall, and that is called the \nunified agenda. Again, every agency is required to produce that to the \nOffice of Information and Regulatory Affairs.\n  The problem is this requirement is observed sort of like the \nrequirement to pass the budget is observed in the Senate. In 2012, the \nEPA was 8 months late producing their spring 2012 regulatory agenda, \nand they have yet to submit their fall 2012 regulatory agenda. Again, I \nhave asked EPA directly about this. More than 6 weeks after the \ndeadline passed, EPA has yet to respond to the simple question of when \nthey will submit their spring and fall regulatory agendas. We have not \nseen a bit of either of them yet.\n  This is important because it is about sunshine, openness, and \ntransparency. It is about being fair and open to the American people \nand giving the American people--including through its representatives \nin Congress--full information. This is an important area that the \nnominee to head the EPA, Gina McCarthy, has to address. It is awfully \nbasic and legitimate to say to Gina McCarthy: If you want to become the \nnew EPA Administrator, you will need to answer these big, obvious, and \npertinent questions. It is particularly important since you come from \ninside this very troubled, completely nontransparent agency and have \nbeen at the heart of many of these troubling areas.\n  One thing I will question her directly on is her active coordination \nwith Al Armendariz, whom I mentioned earlier, in shutting down key \nenergy projects. That direct coordination was highlighted in an e-mail \nwe did get from Armendariz celebrating the death of a petroleum coke \nplant in Texas. Armendariz wrote in that e-mail: ``Gina's new air rules \nwill soon be the icing on the cake.'' Shutting down jobs, shutting down \nAmerican businesses is going to be the icing on the cake.\n  In conclusion, I want to underscore that President Obama's EPA, \nunfortunately, has been the worst example of how hollow his promise is \nof being the most open and transparent administration in history. As we \nbegin to consider the confirmation of a new EPA Administrator, this \nneeds to be a big focus of our attention. Surely she needs to commit in \nvery concrete and specific ways to change this culture. I am concerned \nthat she has been part of this culture. She comes from inside the \nagency. She is directly involved in many of these very troubling areas. \nSo we need to hear how she is going to reverse this culture and usher \nin a new era of openness and transparency. I will have specific \nrequests for her that will allow her to prove that commitment, and I \nknow many other Members of the Senate have similar concerns.\n\n  I look forward to that discussion with Gina McCarthy. I look forward \nto continuing this discussion with the entire U.S. Senate. Transparency \nWeek is an important time and an appropriate time to start that \nimportant discussion and to end these abusive practices by the current \nEPA.\n\n[[Page S1768]]\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the continuing \nresolution before the Senate to fund the government and keep this \ncountry moving forward. This is a very difficult assignment that they \nhave been handed, especially as we have a brandnew chair and ranking \nmember.\n  The bill increases support for firefighters battling blazes out West. \nThat is very good. It maintains a critical safety net for women and \nchildren. That is very good. It returns full funding to several \ncritical conservation programs and reaffirms our commitment to \nveterans, especially rural veterans--all very good. I thank Senator \nJack Reed and Senator Tim Johnson in particular for their efforts in \nthose areas.\n  But while no bill is perfect, I am deeply--deeply--disappointed by \ntwo provisions that were slipped into this bill by the House of \nRepresentatives when this deal was being cooked up in December.\n  This is Sunshine Week for the Federal Government. It is a time to \nhighlight the need for greater transparency and openness so voters can \nhold their elected leaders accountable and for what happens here in \nWashington, DC, and to just know what is going on.\n  I take transparency seriously. When I first ran for the Senate 7 \nyears ago, I campaigned on the need to bring more accountability and \nhonest leadership to Washington, DC. My first vote in this body was for \na sweeping ethics bill that, among other provisions, improved \ndisclosure rules and reformed the earmark process so that everybody \nwould know which Member or Members of Congress requested an earmark, \nand it required Members to certify that they and their families had no \nfinancial interest in that earmark.\n  Under regular order, folks had a chance to come down to the floor and \ntry to remove earmarks they did not like. In fact, a few years ago I \nremember former Senator Jon Kyl and I had a pretty good debate on this \nfloor about an important project for the city of Whitefish, MT. So we \ndebated it, and we took a vote on it in the Senate.\n  That is why I am so upset by two agriculture-related provisions that \nsomeone from the House of Representatives put into this bill--and that \nthe Senate seems willing to accept. I do not know who authored this \nprovision. Maybe someone in Washington knows, but no one is willing to \nput their name on it, and that is a shame. It is a shame that folks who \nget so bent out of shape about earmarks do not seem to be troubled by \nthese provisions.\n  Montana is home to thousands of working families who make a living \noff the land. Like my wife and me, they are family farmers and \nranchers. The House of Representatives is prepared to toss those \nworking families aside in favor of the Nation's large meatpacking \ncorporations. The House inserted a provision in the bill that gives \nenormous marketing power to America's three largest meatpacking \ncorporations while stiffing family farmers and ranchers.\n  Family-run production agriculture faces tremendous market \nmanipulation. Chicken farmers, hog farmers, and cattle ranchers all \nstruggle to get a fair price from the meatpackers, and if they fight \nback, they risk angering corporate representatives and being shut out \nof the market. Thanks to this provision, the Agriculture Department \nwill not be able to ensure a fair, open market that puts the brakes on \nthe worst abuses by the meatpacking industry.\n  What is worse is that the USDA took congressionally mandated steps to \nprotect ranchers from market manipulation over the last few years. That \nis what we told them to do in the 2008 farm bill. This provision will \nactually overturn rules the USDA has already put into place. But \napparently intense, behind-the-scenes lobbying won out in the House of \nRepresentatives, and now we are back to square one with the big \nmeatpackers calling the shots.\n  The second provision sent over from the House tells the USDA to \nignore any judicial ruling regarding the planting of genetically \nmodified crops. Its supporters are calling it the ``farmer assurance'' \nprovision, but all it really ensures is a lack of corporate liability.\n  The provision says that when a judge finds that the USDA approved a \ncrop illegally, the Department must reapprove the crop and allow it to \ncontinue to be planted--regardless of what the judge says.\n  Let's think about that. The U.S. Congress is telling the Agriculture \nDepartment: Even if a court tells you that you failed to follow the \nright process and tells you to start over, you must disregard the \ncourt's ruling and allow the crop to be planted anyway.\n  Not only does this ignore the Constitution's idea of separation of \npowers, but it also lets genetically modified crops take hold across \nthis country even when a judge finds it violates the law. Once again, \nagribusiness, multinational corporations are putting farmers as serfs. \nIt is a dangerous precedent. It will paralyze the USDA by putting the \nDepartment in the middle of a battle between Congress and the courts.\n  The ultimate loser will be our family farmers going about their \nbusiness in feeding America in the right way. Sunshine Week should not \nbe show and tell. Slipping corporate giveaways into a bill at the same \ntime that we call for more open government is doubling down on the same \npolicies that created the need for Sunshine Week. That is why we need \nto remove those corporate welfare provisions from the bill.\n  Montanans elected me to go to the Senate to do away with these shady \nbackroom deals, to get rid of handouts to big corporations, to make \ngovernment work better. We still have many challenges in front of us. I \ncommend the leaders of the Appropriations Committee for their \ncommitment to working together to bring us a plan on which we can vote.\n  These two provisions undermine our good work to support family farm \nagriculture. These provisions are giveaways, pure and simple, and will \nbe a boon worth millions of dollars to a handful of the biggest \ncorporations in this country. They deserve no place in this bill. We \nsimply have to do a better job on both policy and process.\n  I know Chairwoman Mikulski is committed to doing better. I strongly \nsupport her efforts. I wanted to thank her for that commitment. But we \nought to start right here and now by striking those corporate \ngiveaways.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 33.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Would the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield to the chairwoman.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. First of all, I know the Senator has been waiting \npatiently to file his amendment. I have been waiting patiently for him \nto be able to do it. As I understand it, we are trying to negotiate a \nsequence to vote on the Harkin amendment and for the Senator to be able \nto offer his amendment as promptly as swiftly as we can.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum without violating \nthe Senator's rights.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 33 to Amendment No. 26\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment and call up amendment No. 33.\n\n[[Page S1769]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 33.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe disposed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To strike certain authorities relating to the use for grants \n  of funds of the Office of Economic Assistance of the Department of \n                                Defense)\n\n       Strike section 8039, relating to the use for grants of \n     funds of the Office of Economic Assistance of the Department \n     of Defense.\n       Strike section 8104, relating to the use of funds of the \n     Office of Economic Assistance of the Department of Defense \n     for grants for Guam.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I come to the floor to talk about amendment No. 33, which \nwould strike sections 8104 and 8039 of the bill. It is a pair of Guam \nearmarks that directly contravene the explicit directions provided by \nthe Armed Services Committees of the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives in the conference report on the fiscal year 2013 \nNational Defense Authorization Act.\n  Congress has not yet received a sufficient cost analysis of the \nproposed movement of the troops from Okinawa to Guam. Because of that, \nand the whole operation of these troops from Okinawa to Guam has still \nnot been decided, the Armed Services Committees of the House and Senate \nexplicitly prohibited this type of premature investment in civilian \ninfrastructure.\n  At a time when the Department of Defense is facing the impact of \nsequester, on top of the $487 billion in cuts directed by the \nPresident, it is appalling and disgraceful that the authorizing \nlanguage would be directly circumvented by the authorizers.\n  I want to read the language for my colleagues' benefit. After hours \nand hours of hearings, of amendments, of markup, of 3 weeks on the \nfloor of the Senate, the product stated:\n\n       Restriction on development of public infrastructure. If the \n     Secretary of Defense determines that any grant, cooperative \n     agreement, transfer of funds to another Federal agency, or \n     supplement of funds available in fiscal year 2012 or fiscal \n     year 2013 under Federal programs administered by agencies \n     other than the Department of Defense will result in the \n     development (including repair, replacement, renovation, \n     conversion, improvement, expansion, acquisition, or \n     construction) of public infrastructure on Guam, the Secretary \n     of Defense may not carry out such grant, transfer, \n     cooperative agreement, or supplemental funding unless \n     specifically authorized by law.\n\n  So here is clear language of the National Defense Authorization Act \ndirectly contradicted by this continuing resolution. What in the world \nis the job of the authorizers if it is not to have the language adhered \nto? At a time when the Department of Defense is facing the impact of \nsequestration, on top of $487 billion in cuts already directed by the \nPresident, the appropriators decided that we would spend $140 million \non Guam. It is absolutely unbelievable, I say to my colleagues.\n  Now, let me tell my colleagues about the effect of the sequester that \nhas happened now. According to this line item in the appropriations \nbill, it will spend $140 million on a wastewater treatment plant on \nGuam and another project. So we are going to spend $140 million on \nthat.\n  Meanwhile, I say to my colleagues, here is what has already happened, \nwith the sequester to the Armed Forces. The Army: Cancels four brigade \nexercises at the National Training Center or Joint Readiness Training \nCenter. The Army: Reduced base operations by 30 percent; cancels half \nthe year of helicopters and ground vehicle depot maintenance; stops \npost-war repair of 1,300 vehicles and 17,000 weapons; reduces readiness \nof 80 percent of the Army's nondeploying brigades; stops tuition \nassistance for all Active and Reserve soldiers.\n  Navy: Cancels several submarine deployments; reduces flying hours on \ndeployed carriers in the Middle East by 55 percent; steaming days by 22 \npercent; reduces Western Pacific deployed operations by 35 percent; \nnondeployed Pacific ships lose 40 percent of steaming days; reduces \nMiddle East Atlantic MED ballistic missile defense patrols; shuts down \nall flying for four of nine carrier air wings 9 to 12 months to restore \nnormal readiness at two to three times the cost; cuts all major naval \nexercises; defers emergent repairs; cancels Blue Angels shows in third \nand fourth quarter; USS Truman carrier deployment delayed indefinitely.\n  I might say that deployment was to the Middle East where the \ncentrifuges are spinning. The USS Eisenhower career deployment extended \nindefinitely; USS Nimitz and USS Bush carrier strike groups will not be \nfully ready for scheduled fiscal year 2013 deployments.\n  Air Force: Likely prevent Air Force's ability to achieve the 2017 \ngoal of being fully auditable; defer nonemergency facility \nrequirements; reduce repairs by 50 percent over 420 projects at over \n140 installations across the Air Force; affects runway repairs and \ncritical sustainment projects; delays planned acquisition of satellites \nand aircraft, including JSF and AC-130J, which will increase the future \ncost of these systems; reduces flying hours for cargo, fighter and \nbomber aircraft; stops tuition assistance for all Active and Reserve \nairmen.\n  Marine Corps: I hope my colleagues will listen to this. The \nCommandant of the Marine Corps says:\n\n       By the end of this year, more than 50 percent of my combat \n     units will be below minimal acceptable levels of readiness \n     for deployment to combat.\n\n  I repeat. The Commandant of the Marine Corps says:\n\n       By the end of this year, more than 50 percent of my combat \n     units will be below minimal acceptable levels of readiness \n     for deployment to combat.\n\n  Unable to complete rebalancing of Marine Corps forces into the Asia \nPacific region; will cause 55 percent of the U.S. Marine Corps forces \nto have unsatisfactory readiness ratings; 50 percent of the U.S. Marine \nCorps aviation squadrons will fall below ready-to-deploy status; U.S. \nMarine Corps will not be able to accomplish planned reset of equipment \nreturning from overseas expeditionary forces; depot level maintenance \nwill be reduced, delaying resettability by 18 months and reducing \nnondeployed forces; facilities sustainment will be funded at 71 percent \nof requirement, reducing effectiveness of home station training and \nquality of life.\n  These are the effects of sequestration. So what do they do? What do \nthey do in the continuing resolution? They add $140 million for Guam \nfor a wastewater treatment plant. Talk about divorced from reality. \nTalk about insensitivity to the men and women who are serving this \ncountry. I am already beginning to hear from them, I will tell you \nthat.\n  There are a lot of bright young men and women who are serving this \ncountry, are serving it with courage and skill and are the best \nprobably we have ever seen. I am hearing from their leaders. They are \nmaking decisions about whether to stay in the military. It is an All-\nVolunteer Force. I can tell you what a lot of them are deciding when \nthey see something as ridiculous as this, and there are other \noutrageous and stupid things in this bill.\n  While all of the things are taking place in the Air Force, the Army, \nand the Marine Corps, we are now on this list--we have $5 million--they \nare adding money, adding money, adding millions. In fact, it comes up \nto billions--$5 million for the National Guard Youth Challenge Program, \n$5 million for the Department of Defense Star Base Youth Program, $154 \nmillion for an Army, Navy, and Air Force ``alternative energy resource \ninitiative,'' $18 million for unspecified ``industrial preparedness,'' \n$16 million for Parkinson's disease research--there is a whole bunch in \nhere for medical research. They are taking it out of defense. I am for \nresearch in all of these programs, whether it be Parkinson's or \nneurofibromatosis or HIV/AIDS research, but they are taking it out of \ndefense.\n  They are adding $9 million for unspecified radar research, $20 \nmillion for university research initiatives, $7 million for a Civil Air \nPatrol Program increase, $45 million for Impact Aid. The list goes on \nand on and on.\n  While the Air Force is unable to fly, the Civil Air Patrol will get \nan additional $15 million. I am a great admirer of the Civil Air \nPatrol.\n  The fact is that what we are doing is we are cutting the flying hours \nand affecting the readiness of the men and women who are serving in the \nmilitary\n\n[[Page S1770]]\n\nin this country. I repeat a statement of the Commandant of the Marine \nCorps: By the end of this year, ``more than 50 percent of my combat \nunits will be below minimal acceptable levels of readiness for \ndeployment to combat.'' What did these appropriators do? They put in \n$140 million for wastewater treatment on Guam, which is expressly \nprohibited by the National Defense Authorization Act.\n  I have been on this floor for many years fighting against what I \nbelieve is encroachment by appropriators on the authorizers' business. \nI have never, in 26 years as a member of the defense appropriations \ncommittee and the Armed Forces committee, seen anything quite as \negregious as this.\n  I say to my colleagues, who are authorizers and not appropriators, if \nyou let them get away with directly violating and contradicting the \nexpress language of the National Defense Authorization Act, you are \nnext. You are next. This is unacceptable. I hope my colleagues will \nvote on the issue of whether we need to spend this money, particularly \nat this moment, with the condition of our military.\n  Many of our constituents say: Why is this being so hard hit? Why is \nthe military being so hard hit?\n  They don't quite understand sequester--this thing the President said \nwon't happen. This sequester affects 19 percent of what we call the \ndiscretionary spending. They exempted about two-thirds of all of the \ndiscretionary spending and then took 50 percent of what was left of 19 \npercent of the spending. This has a dramatically increased effect on \nwhat we need most; that is, our national security. It is shameful.\n  I hope my colleagues and friends know that this Guam provision would \nprovide, which is expressly prohibited, $120 million for a public \nregional health laboratory and civilian wastewater improvements. The \nDepartment of Defense wants to move marines to Guam but does not know \nhow much military infrastructure will be needed--military \ninfrastructure will be needed to support the move--what the \nimplications will be to operational responsiveness in the Pacific \ntheater or how much any of it will cost.\n  Over the last 2 years, the Armed Services Committee received many \nhours of testimony, briefings, and meetings on the troop realignment in \nthe Pacific and directed the Center for Strategic and International \nStudies to conduct an independent assessment on U.S. force strategy in \nthe region. The assessment--delivered in August 2012--recommended a \nbetter alignment of engagement strategies between the U.S. Pacific \nCommand and the Department of Defense in order to improve our \ncapabilities in the region and respond to a range of contingencies. The \nCSIS was clear in the appraisal that the Department of Defense had not \nadequately articulated the strategy behind its future posture planning \nnor aligned the strategy with resources in a way that reflects current \nbudget realities.\n  After more testimony, briefings, and meetings, the Armed Services \nCommittee acted and, through the vehicle of the fiscal year 2013 \nNational Defense Authorization Act, prohibited the use of funds for any \nmilitary realignment to Guam until the Department of Defense and the \nU.S. Pacific Command provided a detailed set of reports. These reports \nwill address the plan for ensuring that any proposed force realignments \nin the Pacific region to include moving U.S. marines from Japan to Guam \nand Hawaii are supported by resources that will allow our forces to \nmeet operational requirements. Admiral Locklear, commander of the U.S. \nPacific Command, told me yesterday that these reports would be ready \nthis summer.\n  The Department of Defense has planning left to do. While Congress may \nsomeday authorize some number of marines to be realigned to Guam, it \nwill only be after we have a clear understanding of the clear \nimplications and costs. In this context, the Appropriations Committee \nwould fund unrequested civilian infrastructure--not military \ninfrastructure, civilian infrastructure--far greater in scope than \nwould be required in the event the most extreme estimates of troop \nrealignment occurred. There is absolutely no justification for it.\n  This is why the Armed Services Committee expressly prohibited such \nfunding, because we don't know how much military or civilian \ninfrastructure we may need, if any. Has one single marine, sailor, or \nairman been assigned to Guam as part of the intended buildup that would \njustify using DOD money to rebuild Guam civilian wastewater facilities \nor build a new civilian health laboratory? The answer is obviously no. \nThe support payoff to Guam to solve an already existing problem has \nnothing to do with any future military realignment to Guam. This is no \nbetter than last year's set of earmarks for a cultural artifacts \nrepository.\n  It should be very clear by now that these expenditures pushed through \nin direct contravention of the bipartisan, bicameral decisions of the \nArmed Services Committee are a shameful waste of taxpayers' money. In \nmy view, this is a clear example of political abuse of the \nappropriations process.\n  I could go on for a long time. In fact, instead of doing a continuing \nresolution, we should be doing everything we can to avoid the \nsequester, which has such a disastrous effect on our military.\n  I am sure my colleagues are aware that in Tehran the centrifuges are \nspinning. North Korea just had another nuclear test. They threatened to \ncancel the cease-fire of 1953. They are making very aggressive noises \ntoward South Korea and, I believe, our 30,000 men and women who are \nstationed there. Tension between Japan and China is very high. For my \ncolleagues' information, I am sure they know that the Chinese have \nincreased, doubled, and redoubled their spending on their military. The \nMiddle East is in a state of turmoil, which could lead to an \ninternational crisis almost at any moment. Seventy thousand Syrians \nhave been slaughtered by Bashar al-Asad. There are over 1 million \nrefugees, as that conflict shows all possibility of spreading to \nLebanon and to Jordan.\n  What are we doing? We are imposing Draconian cuts on the U.S. \nmilitary, which caused the Commandant of the Marine Corps to say 50 \npercent of all his combat units will be below minimal acceptable levels \nof readiness for deployment to combat.\n  I have been around this body and this Nation for a long time. I have \nseen this movie before. Everybody talks about war weariness. Everybody \ntalks about how weary we are of Iraq and Afghanistan, and indeed we \nare. We were war weary after Vietnam. We cut the military, cut the \nmilitary, and we cut the military as we are doing today. The Chief of \nStaff of the U.S. Army in the late 1970s came before the Armed Services \nCommittee and said we have a hollow army. Do you know what we are doing \nright now with sequestration? We are hollowing out our military. To add \ninsult to injury, we are putting on a long list of wasteful, \nunnecessary programs, many of which have nothing to do with defending \nthis Nation. Some are outright pork-barrel spending.\n  I hope my colleagues, particularly those on authorizing committees, \nwill understand that if the appropriators are able to directly \ncontradict language in authorizations that are passed by both Houses of \nCongress and signed by the President of the United States, then you \nbecome irrelevant to the process. I don't think the 80-so of us who are \nnot members of the Appropriations Committee should be subjected to \nirrelevance.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to say the Senator who currently \nnow chairs the Subcommittee on Defense will speak on the amendment of \nthe Senator from Arizona. I wish to speak about the process and about \nsequester.\n  First, the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense finished its work \nbefore the August recess. The authorizers didn't get it done until \nDecember 20. There is a gap here because Senator Inouye--a very happy, \nblessed, and beloved memory--moved his committee in an expeditious way, \nwhich appropriators are supposed to do.\n  Remember, appropriations are supposed to be done before October 1. \nSenator Inouye chaired the committee, chaired the full committee and \nthen chaired this Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense. Senator \nInouye did his job under the authorization that was present before him.\n\n[[Page S1771]]\n\n  The authorizers didn't pass their bill until December 20. We want to \nrespect the authorizers not only on defense but on every committee. \nThey need to pass their bills before we pass ours. We work on our bills \nby holding our hearings under regular order beginning when we get the \nPresident's budget, which we wish would be up-tempo a bit. Then we \nstart our hearings, mark up our bills in May and June, and begin to \nmove them through the process.\n  Before we attack the Appropriations Committee, we should attack the \nprocess and get back to regular order, where authorizing and \nappropriating are in sync.\n  The second thing I wish to comment on is sequester. I want to \nacknowledge what the Senator from Arizona said about the impact of \nsequester. Sequester is an awful, awful, awful thing. That is not on \nthis bill. When the Budget Committee comes up, along with the \nnegotiations by the President with the leadership of the House, I \nabsolutely agree with him, we must cancel sequester and ensure that not \nonly our Defense Department but others who defend America, such as our \nBorder Patrol guards, are not unduly harmed. And we are hollowing out, \nto use the quote from General Amos, an extraordinary Commandant.\n  What we need to do is get a process in order to have the proper \npolicy debates.\n  I note that the subcommittee chairman will now comment on the \nspecifics.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Senate majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me thank the chairwoman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Mikulski. This is her first major assignment on the \nfloor of the Senate. It is an awesome responsibility. I note that she \nwas not only up for this job, she was made for this job. She has the \nknowledge, skill, and drive we need to make sure the Appropriations \nCommittee is playing its important historic role in the Senate.\n  I commend the Senator from Alabama, my friend Senator Richard Shelby \ntoo. Senator Shelby and Senator Mikulski have been close partners in \ndeveloping a very complicated bill. This bill we are considering is \ngoing to fund the Federal Government for the remaining 7 months; \notherwise, when we run out of money March 24, literally, the government \nwill close. They are working and have worked hard for the last several \nweeks to get this bill ready.\n  A version of the bill passed the House. Now it is being considered on \nthe floor of the Senate and Senators are being allowed to offer \namendments, which is their right.\n  One of the Senators who just offered an amendment is Senator John \nMcCain of Arizona, who is well known to virtually everyone in America \nas a former candidate for President and by virtue of his service to our \nNation. I would say I count John McCain as a real friend. We came to \nthe House of Representatives the same year. We have maintained that \nfriendship here in the Senate. We have worked closely together on \nimmigration reform and many other issues. I can't think of a finer \nSenator on the other side of the aisle.\n  I don't need to speak to John McCain's reputation when it comes to \nmilitary service. We know the story: a Navy pilot shot down over \nVietnam, captured and held captive, subjected to torture for more than \n5 years. John's body still bears the scars of that terrible experience. \nThank God he survived and continues to serve in the Senate representing \nthe people of Arizona and the Nation in his capacity as a Senator. He \nhas been the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee, so he \nknows those issues not only as a veteran, a man who served in the \nVietnam war, but also as a Senator who has looked closely at each of \nthe issues that affects the Department of Defense. He doesn't hold a \ncandle to anyone, take a step back to anyone when it comes to his \ncommitment to our military and our Nation's defense. But now it is my \nresponsibility to come to the floor of the Senate and argue against an \namendment Senator McCain is offering on the Department of Defense bill. \nYou might think to yourself: Durbin, how did you get this assignment? \nThe fact is, as chairman of this particular subcommittee, it is my \nresponsibility to argue the other side of the issue that Senator McCain \nhas brought to the floor.\n\n  I come to this assignment brandnew, just a few weeks now, since the \nuntimely passing of our great friend and national hero, Dan Inouye of \nHawaii. Because of his passing, there were vacancies created, and I \nended up in this position as chairman of the Subcommittee on Defense \nAppropriations in the Senate. It is a job I am learning, and I confess \nthere are many here who know it better than I do. But I will do my best \nbecause I know the awesome responsibility attached to it.\n  I stand today to urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment \nJohn McCain has offered to this continuing resolution as it relates to \nthe Department of Defense. There are basically four provisions in \nthis--three or four provisions in the McCain amendment--and I wish to \naddress each of them.\n  One of the provisions allows the Department of Defense to give grants \nto organizations. That sounds like a very easy thing to explain, and it \nis. The three organizations that receive the grants from the Department \nof Defense are well-known to most Americans; certainly two are--the USO \nis one.\n  The USO for decades has been an organization which has tried to \nprovide help to our veterans, usually stationed overseas, and to give \nthem things as basic as entertainment, to counseling, or when they go \nthrough airports to make sure they have a place to stop by and get a \ncup of coffee and a doughnut. That is the USO. I have understated their \nmission, but we are all familiar with it.\n  The other organization is one known to every American, I am sure, the \nRed Cross. The third is an organization new, but important, called \nFisher House. Fisher House. Let me tell you about Fisher House.\n  Two years ago, I was invited to the grand opening of a Fisher House \nfacility near the Hines VA Hospital in Chicago. Fisher House is to \nmilitary and veterans hospitals what Ronald McDonald houses are to \nchildren's hospitals. What we are saying here in the underlying bill is \nthat the Department of Defense can provide grants to these \norganizations--Fisher House, Red Cross, and USO. The McCain amendment \nsays no, they can't. The McCain amendment strikes the authority of the \nDepartment of Defense to give them these grants. I think that is a \nmistake. And for that reason alone, I hope my colleagues will vote \nagainst the McCain amendment.\n  The services being provided through these organizations and at these \nfacilities are nothing short of remarkable. Fisher House, right in the \ncity of Chicago, near Hines VA Hospital, is a beautiful home--a place \nwhere families who have a loved one who is going through surgery or \nrehabilitation at the Hines VA Hospital are given a chance to stay \novernight. They do not have to pay for a hotel room and they are \ntreated like royalty, as they should be. These are military families--\nmothers and fathers, spouses and children, who are treated like royalty \nat Fisher House while they are waiting for their loved one to finish \nthe treatment or surgery they need to come back home.\n  Why wouldn't we do that? Why wouldn't we provide that kind of \nservice? The Fisher House facilities are largely built by charitable \ncontributions, donations from everybody. So to give to the Department \nof Defense the ability to transfer up to $4 million a year--$4 \nmillion--to the Fisher House, why, of course, we want to do that. \nAcross America they do such extraordinary things.\n  In terms of the Red Cross grants, here is what the Red Cross does, \nand every Member of Congress knows this. A family will call a Senator \nand say: Senator Shelby, we live in Mobile, AL, and I wanted you to \nknow the mother of a soldier overseas has just passed away and we have \nto get the word to him right away. What Senator Shelby or what Senator \nDurbin would do is to call the Red Cross and say: You have to help us. \nWe have to get in touch with this service man or woman overseas \nsomewhere. So it is an opportunity for them to use their network of \nvolunteers and communications to reach out to that soldier, that \nsailor, that airman, or marine. That is what they do. They spend about \n$10 million in emergency communication services to keep\n\n[[Page S1772]]\n\na hotline running connecting servicemembers, veterans, and their \nfamilies with the services they offer. There is $2 million for theater \nsupport of deployed troops--emergency communication services between \ndeployed servicemembers and their families back home.\n  They provide lounges, the Red Cross does, in these theaters of \noperation, war settings, for troops to have access to computers so they \ncan be in touch with their families back home.\n  One of the big surprises I ran into as I visited our troops in \nAfghanistan and Iraq was to find many of them Skyping away with their \nfamilies while they are far away. Some of these facilities are being \nprovided by the Red Cross.\n  The list goes on and on of all that the Red Cross does to support and \nhelp our troops. But the list can't tell you in specifics what Red \nCross volunteers do. These men and women--and you see them everywhere \nunder the flag of the Red Cross--show up when a tornado hits, when a \nflood hits, and they always show up when our troops need a helping \nhand.\n  When our troops get off the plane in Landstuhl, Germany, after being \ngrievously wounded or injured overseas and are about to be \nhospitalized--maybe facing their first surgery--one of the first \nsmiling faces they will see will be a Red Cross volunteer, there to \nsay: What can I do for you; can I get in touch with your family; is \nthere something you need? The stories are legendary about soldiers who \nland at these bases and a Red Cross volunteer walks up to them.\n  I recall one story in particular about one of the soldiers who \nvolunteered at the Red Cross who said: What do you want? And the \nsoldier said: I need a rootbeer float. Imagine, a rootbeer float. And \nin a matter of 15 minutes, up pops the Red Cross volunteer with a \nrootbeer float. It was a small thing for that soldier, but it was an \nimportant thing.\n\n  So to say we are not going to allow the Department of Defense to \nprovide grants to the Red Cross, the USO, or to Fisher House I think is \na mistake. These are great organizations with great volunteers and they \ndo a wonderful job day in and day out to help our troops overseas. If \nit were my son or daughter overseas, I would like to know the Red Cross \nis going to be there. I would like to know the USO is going to be \nthere. And God forbid that we would ever need some work at a military \nhospital; I would like to know there is a Fisher House nearby in case a \nfamily needs it because they can't otherwise afford to stay at a hotel \nfor a number of nights.\n  The McCain amendment would stop the grants by the Department of \nDefense to these three organizations. If it were not for the fact that \nsuch a fine man, a veteran, offered this amendment, some people might \nsay: Why would you do that to our military servicemembers? I don't \nthink we should.\n  There is also a situation that has been going on for some time \nregarding Guam. Guam is an important place for stationing some 16,000 \nmarines--16,000 men and women who volunteered to serve in the U.S. \nMarine Corps and are stationed on Guam. It is a challenge. I have been \nthere. It is a remote location, but important for our national \nsecurity, particularly in the Pacific theater. Wouldn't we want to say \nto the men and women who are there in uniform that they are going to \nhave the basics taken care of? And wouldn't we want to say that one of \nthe basics is to make sure they have safe drinking water and wastewater \ntreatment facilities?\n  Here is what we found out. We found out that on the island of Guam \nour 16,000 marines are in a facility that has reached the absolute \nlimit in terms of wastewater treatment. The Department of Defense came \nto us and said: For these troops, we have got to build a new wastewater \ntreatment facility. Well, of course, we do. We don't want to \nshortchange them or jeopardize public health in any way.\n  The McCain amendment would eliminate this money, $106 million in \nfunding, for a wastewater treatment plant on Guam. This is not some \nfrill, this is a basic. Everyone wants to believe their son or \ndaughter, volunteering for the Marine Corps and stationed somewhere \noverseas, is being taken care of by our government--that the government \nis doing everything we can to make sure they have the basics they need \nto stay healthy. Well, this is one of those basics--$106 million for a \nwastewater treatment plant in Guam.\n  There is also a $13 million ask here that I think makes sense when it \ncomes to the safety of these troops. We want to make sure there is a \npublic health lab in Guam. God forbid these men and women in uniform, \nor anyone who represents the United States, is facing some biological \nterrorist. God forbid there is some substance being used that could \nendanger their lives, and God forbid we would have to rely on \nlaboratory facilities in Atlanta, GA, if you are halfway around the \nworld. That is where the most professional facilities are. So the \nDepartment of Defense said: Let's put a $13 million investment in a \nbasic public health lab in Guam to protect the safety of Americans and \nour troops.\n  Look at these things. Look at what I am asking for--not for museums, \nnot for things that may be considered frivolous and unnecessary in a \ngiven context but, rather, for the basics to support our troops in the \nfield and to provide those who are stationed on Guam some of the most \nfundamental and basic public health facilities.\n  So it pains me to come to the floor and to resist an amendment \noffered by my friend Senator McCain, but I do it in memory of Senator \nDan Inouye, who helped write this bill, who himself was a recipient of \nthe Congressional Medal of Honor and had a distinguished career of \nservice in the military.\n  I hope my colleagues will listen carefully to this debate, and though \nthey feel the strong positive feelings I do toward Senator McCain, they \nwill go to the merits of the issue and defeat the McCain amendment. \nMake sure the ability of the Department of Defense to continue to work \nwith Fisher House, the Red Cross, and the USO is authorized in law. \nLet's make sure the 16,000 marines on Guam have the most basic things \nthey need to be safe and healthy and come home just as we want them to. \nThat is what this is all about.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the McCain amendment.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the time until 5:30 p.m., \nfor debate on the McCain amendment, be equally divided between Senators \nMcCain and myself or our designees; that at 5:30 p.m. the Senate \nproceed to a vote in relation to the McCain amendment and that there be \nno amendments in order to the amendment prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I don't know if Senator McCain is nearby, \nbut if he is, I want to give him a chance to come over and use the few \nminutes remaining before the rollcall vote.\n  But for those Members of the Senate who did not listen to the earlier \nstatements by Senator McCain and myself, this amendment is very basic \nand very straightforward: Senator McCain would cut or eliminate the \nability of the Department of Defense to give grants to three \norganizations: Fisher House, Red Cross, and USO.\n  Fisher House is the Ronald McDonald House of military and veterans \nhospitals. I have visited the one in Chicago. I have talked to my \ncolleagues about other Fisher House facilities around America. They are \nremarkable and amazing places.\n  Fisher House is where a family who may not be wealthy has a chance to \nstay and be treated like royalty while their son, their daughter, their \nhusband, their mother is being operated on in a military hospital. That \nis what Fisher House is all about. I have seen it. The volunteers who \nman these houses make sure people are treated in the way they should be \nand make us proud as Americans. The McCain amendment would eliminate \nthe authority of the Department of Defense to give money to the Fisher \nHouse to continue their operations.\n  The McCain amendment would also eliminate funding grants that are \ngiven to the Red Cross and the USO. The Red Cross is an extraordinary \norganization,\n\n[[Page S1773]]\n\nand every American knows what they are about. But in the fiscal year \n2010, the Red Cross provided more than 597,000 emergency communications \nservices for nearly 150,000 military families, and they provided nearly \n$6 million in financial aid to 5,000 military families, not to mention \nthousands of Red Cross volunteers--including servicemembers, veterans, \nand military spouses--offered comfort and support to our wounded troops \nand their families at hospitals around the world.\n  The USO is another great organization which has provided assistance \nand entertainment to our troops, many of them stationed far away from \nhome and far away from their family.\n  In addition, the McCain amendment would eliminate the construction of \na wastewater treatment facility in Guam. We have 16,000 marines \nstationed in Guam. The administration--the President has asked for this \nmoney because the wastewater treatment facility in Guam is inadequate. \nIt is not safe. It is a public health hazard. An environmental impact \nstatement prepared for the realignment of marines from Okinawa to Guam \nclearly finds that the current system is near capacity and needs \nupgrading.\n  So whether you argue that Guam is going to have a large future, a \nsmall future, the current allocation of marines in Guam deserves the \nmost basic sanitary wastewater treatment facility. You would expect it, \nwould you not, for your son or daughter serving in our Marine Corps? We \nshould expect no less, and the McCain amendment would eliminate the \nfunding necessary for this wastewater treatment facility, as well as a \npublic health laboratory to test samples of suspected toxic substances \nin a timely manner to protect Americans and our troops in that theater \nof the world.\n  I don't know why Senator McCain has picked out these elements. I \nthink they are all positive elements. I hope my colleagues will join me \nin defeating the McCain amendment. It is an amendment which would take \nneeded resources away from the USO, Red Cross, and Fisher House and \ndeny this wastewater treatment facility in Guam. I hope my colleagues \nwill join me in opposing the McCain amendment.\n  At this point I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum, in the hopes that Senator McCain can return before the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded. I wish to give my friend, Senator McCain, the \nauthor of this amendment, the opportunity to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I guess the time here is short. Sometimes \nwhen you can't argue the merits of an issue you just make up something. \nSenator Durbin claims this amendment would cut funding for the Fisher \nHouse, Red Cross, and the USO. If you read the bill, the Fisher House \nis covered in the CR in section 8070. The Red Cross and USO are covered \nin section 8078. This amendment strikes section 8039, which pertains to \nthe Office of Economic Adjustment fund, the OEA fund. It has nothing to \ndo with Fisher Houses, the Red Cross, mothers of America, apple pie, or \nthe flag--nothing to do with those except that it strikes legislation \nwhich is expressly prohibited in the Defense authorization bill. It \nstrikes language which is directly prohibited by the National Defense \nAuthorization Act.\n  If the Senator wants to claim that Fisher House, Red Cross, USO, \nsmall animals, children, the United Way, whatever else he wants to, \nthey are covered in other parts of the bill. I suggest to the Senator \nfrom Illinois reread the bill which says--section 8070 talks about \nFisher Houses; section 8078 talks about the Red Cross and the USO. Our \namendment strikes 8039, which is the Office of Economic Adjustment, \nthat funding.\n  I thank the Senator for recognizing that. It is already part of the \nrecord. It is very clear this has nothing to do with the Fisher House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we have been assured by the House in the \nconstruction of this bill that this provision was added explicitly to \nmake certain that there be no question that the grants that are given \nto these organizations would be authorized and included in this \nappropriations process. That is their belief. With an abundance of \ncaution, we support their belief because we know of the importance of \nthese organizations.\n  I now move to table the McCain amendment No. 33, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nLautenberg) and the Senator from Rhode Island (Mr. Whitehouse) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 48, nays 50, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 35 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--48\n\n     Baldwin\n     Baucus\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Blumenthal\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Coons\n     Cowan\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Heinrich\n     Heitkamp\n     Hirono\n     Johnson (SD)\n     Kaine\n     Klobuchar\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murphy\n     Murray\n     Nelson\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schatz\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Warren\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--50\n\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Barrasso\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coats\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     Cruz\n     Donnelly\n     Enzi\n     Fischer\n     Flake\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Heller\n     Hoeven\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson (WI)\n     King\n     Kirk\n     Lee\n     Levin\n     Manchin\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Moran\n     Murkowski\n     Paul\n     Portman\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rubio\n     Scott\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Thune\n     Toomey\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Lautenberg\n     Whitehouse\n       \n  The motion was rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set the pending \namendment aside to consider----\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order. I know there \nis a lot of gloating over this amendment--I don't mean yours. Could we \nkind of keep it quiet so Senator Inhofe can offer his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first, I ask unanimous consent to set \naside the pending amendment for consideration of my amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I just 2 minutes ago got a copy of what my dear friend is \ngoing to offer, and here we go again with a series of environmental \nriders that have nothing to do with this bill, that would change laws \nthat protect our rivers and our streams, and involve the EPA making \nsure we prevent oilspills.\n  Frankly, I am objecting to this at this time unless I know we are \ngoing to have a 60-vote threshold; otherwise, I will put us in a quorum \ncall at this time.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have the floor because I am reserving the right to \nobject.\n  Mr. INHOFE. No, I have the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. All right. Go ahead.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First of all, I would not object to a 60-vote threshold \nin order to get things to move along. I would say my good friend from \nCalifornia has seen this bill several times before, and several months \nago we actually had a vote on it, but I have no objection.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you so much.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 29 to Amendment No. 26\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n[[Page S1774]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. This is something we are all familiar with. There is a \nspill prevention or an SPCC----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 29 to amendment No. 26.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the expenditure of Federal funds to enforce the \nSpill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure rule of the Environmental \n                   Protection Agency against farmers)\n\n       At the end of title VII of division C, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 17___.  No funds made available under this Act shall \n     be used to implement or enforce with respect to any farm (as \n     that term is defined in section 112.2 of title 40, Code of \n     Federal Regulations (or successor regulations)) the Spill, \n     Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure rule, including \n     amendments to that rule, promulgated by the Environmental \n     Protection Agency under part 112 of title 40, Code of Federal \n     Regulations.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. This is a bill that for years and years has come up. It \nwas originally designed for refineries that have very large amounts of \nstorage, of oil, of propane, of all that type of material, and it was \ndesigned for them to have the necessary safeguards in place. Then, \nlater on, there became a gray area. I ask the question because it has \nnever been answered: Should they now be able to apply this to farms? \nFarms may have perhaps a little bit of propane over here and over here, \nsomeplace else, something else. It might add up to the 1,320 gallons at \none time. If that is the case, then they would be under the same \nrequirements as we currently have for refiners. I am talking about them \nhaving to do volumes and volumes of paperwork. They would have to \npurchase new double-lined containers and build berms around their \nstorage facilities. We are talking about hundreds of thousands of \ndollars, and this could be an average-sized farm.\n  The EPA has not done enough outreach to farmers to help them get into \ncompliance. When this came up before, we introduced this same amendment \nthat would give them time, with the assurance at that time that they \nwould do this. In fact, I recall personally visiting with Lisa Jackson \nand she had every intention to go ahead and make these notifications.\n  So the EPA shouldn't be allowed to enforce the rule against farmers \nat this time. What this amendment does is asks for an extension to give \nthem time. I plan on talking to the new Director of the EPA about this \nvery issue. This is not just exempting farmers. This is giving more \ntime, in this case, until the end of this fiscal year.\n\n  So I would like to be able to pass this. I do urge its adoption and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, if we are still on the Inhofe amendment, is \nthere still an opportunity to speak on the amendment before a vote is \ncalled or is the Senator asking for a vote immediately?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I am sorry, I could not hear the Senator.\n  Mr. REED. Is the Senator asking for a vote immediately or is there \nstill an opportunity to speak?\n  Mr. INHOFE. No. We are asking for a vote sometime tomorrow.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Does the Senator wish to have time?\n  Mr. REED. I would like to, at the appropriate moment, be recognized \nto speak, respectfully, against the Senator's amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, now is the time.\n  Mr. REED. Now is the time? Well, in that case, let me go ahead and \nspeak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, Senator Inhofe is proposing a very sweeping \namendment that would affect a rule the EPA has developed over the \nnormal rulemaking process, with notice and comments over many, many, \nmany months. It is scheduled to go into effect in May of this year. The \namendment the Senator is offering, as I understand it, exempts all \nfarms from this EPA oilspill regulation. Again, this rule is designed \nto prevent or significantly prevent the pollution of navigable waters \nby oilspills coming from agricultural operations.\n  One of the issues here is the definition of what appropriate farm \nshould be exempt. As I understand the amendment, it is all farms. That \nincludes large agribusinesses that have the capability not only of \nmitigating these hazards but also the resources to do so and, \ncollectively, would contribute to environmental quality.\n  I know the agricultural community is concerned. And I know also this \nthe type of very complicated legislation that is best resolved at the \nauthorization level. The Senator from Oklahoma, I think, has already \nindicated there are bills pending, and these bills are much more finely \nattuned in nuance to address more specifically the problem rather than \na total effective preemption from the rule for all farms.\n  So I would urge very strenuously that--and I know the intentions of \nthe Senator from Oklahoma are to assist the agricultural community, but \nI do not think this is the place or the time, as we try very seriously \nto get a bill through by the end of the week, essentially, that will \nkeep the government operating, to decide on these complicated \nauthorization issues, effectively cutting out completely a very serious \nand detailed rulemaking process that the EPA has undertaken.\n  So I will urge my colleagues at the appropriate time to resist the \namendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Go ahead.\n  Mr. REED. I will certainly yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I want to correct and make sure it is clear the \nunderstanding of what this is. This is something that is in existence \ntoday, and it is going to be temporarily holding this until the EPA \nwill study to see what kind of hardship this is going to be to all the \nSenator's farmers and my farmers. This is not the bill that--I actually \nhave a bill that would exclude farmers from this. This is not that \nbill. This merely extends that deadline to give them time to do what \nthey had agreed they were going to do in terms of the EPA studying this \nissue.\n  I wanted to make sure that clarification was on the Record.\n  Mr. REED. I appreciate very much that clarification. But let me \nretain my time and then yield to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If I could ask my colleague a couple questions, if he \nwould engage in a colloquy with me.\n  Mr. REED. I will yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I know the Senator from Rhode Island--and I appreciate \nwhat he said about how sweeping this is. The Senator has the amendment \nin front of him, does he not?\n  Mr. REED. I have the amendment, yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I need to say here, please, colleagues, this is not any \nkind of an extension of time. This says:\n\n       No funds made available under this Act shall be used to \n     implement or enforce with respect to any farm. . . .\n\n  And it goes through the Spill, Prevention, Control, and \nCountermeasure rule.\n  Does my colleague read it the way I do? This is not an extension of \ntime. This is a prohibition on EPA implementing the rule. Am I correct?\n  Mr. REED. I believe the Senator is absolutely correct. There is no \ntime extension. One could argue that as this CR runs out maybe this \nprovision would run out. But the intent of the bill is clearly that \nthere is no money to be expended for any implementation against any \nfarm.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Exactly.\n  Mr. REED. That is the language of the bill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to ask my colleague a couple other questions.\n  Farmers are exempted if they store less than 1,320 gallons of oil \naboveground or less than 42,000 gallons underground. That is the rule.\n  Is my colleague aware of that?\n  Mr. REED. Well, I thank the Senator for bringing that to my attention \nbecause one point I would make--and I think Senator Inhofe does want to \nengage also--but one point I would make is that in this EPA rulemaking \nprocess there is a requirement to evaluate the cost and benefits with \nrespect to the rule. In that sense, many of these issues have been \naddressed, and they have been done so in a very careful way.\n\n[[Page S1775]]\n\n  Two, it has been done by listening to--in fact, requiring legally to \ntake the opinions, the comments of many people, stakeholders from all \nsides. And then, frankly, the other cost and the traditional cost to \nprotest a rule is not to legislatively eliminate it, particularly in an \nappropriations bill, but to contest the rule in court based upon the \nfacts.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my colleague yield for one more question? I know my \ncolleague, Senator Inhofe, wants to speak. By the way, we have a deep \nfriendship. But this is something we have never agreed on.\n\n  I want to make a point about the EPA rule. Farmers storing any amount \nof oil, I say to my colleague, are exempted if an oilspill could not \nreasonably be expected to reach rivers and streams.\n  My colleague was talking about this as some Draconian rule. The fact \nis, even one quart of oil, used oil, can contaminate up to 2 million \ngallons of drinking water.\n  I am a little blindsided on this, I have to say to my friend. If he \nis going to keep on doing these riders on here that threaten the health \nof the American people, I wish he would take it to me and at least give \nme a personal heads up because this is something that is very serious, \nand I will be speaking more on it tomorrow.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. REED. I believe I still have the time.\n  Let me make one point. This is a complicated rule that has tried to \nbalance various equities--environmental protection, protecting the \nnavigable waters of the United States, recognizing small farms or farms \nwhere in no way their oil could reach down to where it should be \nexempt.\n  Here, on the other side, is an amendment that is very broad, open \nended--no funds, all farms. I think in this context, I would urge my \ncolleagues to resist the amendment.\n  I think the Senator from Oklahoma wants to speak.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes. Let me make one comment for clarification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. We will have the opportunity to look at this closer, as \nthe Senator from California suggests, tomorrow. We have talked about \nthis in the past. This is extending that May 30 date to the end of the \nfiscal year. As you know, everything that would be an amendment adopted \non this would expire at the end of the fiscal year. So it is just an \nextension of that time. Because by their own admission, the EPA has not \nhad time to listen to the concerns of the farmers. And I am talking \nabout farmers in both of your States there as well as my State of \nOklahoma.\n  As far as making the determination as to where the oil might go, I \nthink we all know that would be a very difficult thing to do. There has \nbeen an effort for quite some time to take the word ``navigable'' out, \nwhich would open it to anywhere.\n  So I think perhaps tomorrow we will have time to get into this. I \nreally wanted to get it in the queue. I have done that, and we will \nhave a chance tomorrow.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REED. If I could reclaim the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Let me say, I think the Senator's comments are accurate in \nthat because the CR terminates on September 30, then because it \nterminates, the CR, this language might go away. But the clear language \nhere is not a--and I think that is the point the Senator from \nCalifornia made--is not a time-certain extension for the EPA to do \nsomething. It is: No funds, no farms. And I think there is a reasonable \nconcern--that certainly I have--that this will not just be a deliberate \ndelay of several months, but this is the intent to stop this law \nindefinitely, as this language was drafted.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Look, I would conclude by saying, yes, that would be my \nintent, but not with this legislation. This amendment does not do that. \nI actually do have a bill that I have up that would permanently exempt \nfarmers in certain categories from being under the jurisdiction of \nthese limitations. But that is not what this is at this time.\n  I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, here in Washington, DC, the budget debate \nis often discussed in terms of abstract numbers and political winners \nand losers. But the truth is that budgets are about far more than that. \nThey are about our values and our priorities, and they are about the \npeople across the country whose lives are impacted by the decisions we \nmake.\n  Today the Senate Budget Committee discussed one approach to tackling \nour budget challenges, an approach that, while getting our debt and \ndeficits under control, will also create jobs and build a foundation \nfor prosperity from the middle out.\n  Tomorrow we will continue this discussion and vote on a plan. Then we \nwill move this debate here to the Senate floor, and then, hopefully, \nwork toward a balanced and bipartisan agreement with the House of \nRepresentatives, while the American people have a chance to weigh in.\n  I believe our budget must meet not just one but many pressing \nchallenges of our time. We have come a long way since early 2009 when \nPresident Obama entered office facing massive deficits and an economy \nthat was shedding hundreds of thousands of jobs per month.\n  We have made progress toward getting our debt and deficits under \ncontrol, and we have added back jobs, but the recovery is not as strong \nor as fast as it needs to be. Millions of workers continue struggling \nto get back to work, and we still have some very serious challenges \nwhen it comes to our medium and long-term deficit and debt challenges.\n  In the coming weeks and months, we will be asked to make tough \nchoices as we work to tackle these challenges responsibly. This process \nis not going to be easy. There is a serious difference of opinion about \nwhat our government should be doing to keep our economy and our \nnational finances moving in the right direction.\n\n  One approach is to follow a path back to the economic policies of the \nlast administration. This is the path to more tax cuts for the rich but \nless opportunity for the middle class to get ahead. It is a path not to \nprosperity, which can only truly be built from the middle out, but to \nthe deterioration of our national infrastructure and the decline of our \nschools and the dismantling of the Medicare promise we have made to our \nseniors. This approach, in fact, was on the ballot last November. \nVoters around the country rejected it. Instead, they want an approach \nthat puts the middle class first, that returns our Nation to the fiscal \nand economic policies that have worked for this country before, by \nfocusing on jobs and the economy, cutting spending responsibly, and \ncalling on the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share.\n  The Senate budget--which we put out today--reflects the progrowth, \npro-middle class agenda that the American people went to the polls and \nsupported in November.\n  Our budget is really built on three principles: No. 1, we need to \nprotect our fragile economic recovery, create jobs, and invest in long-\nterm growth. No. 2, we need to tackle our deficit and debt fairly and \nresponsibly. And, No. 3, we need to keep the promises we made to our \nNation's seniors and families and our communities.\n  We believe with an unemployment rate that remains stubbornly high and \na middle class that has seen their wages stagnate for far too long, we \nsimply cannot afford any threats to our fragile recovery.\n  That is why this budget uses equal amounts of responsible spending \ncuts and new revenue from the wealthiest Americans to fully replace the \ncuts from sequestration--cuts that, by the way, threaten hundreds of \nthousands of jobs this year, and cuts that endanger economic growth for \nyears to come, and cuts that are being felt in States such as mine, \nwhere military families are losing services, local housing officials \nare being forced to cut housing vouchers for the homeless, and \nfurloughs are being handed out to those\n\n[[Page S1776]]\n\nwho are cleaning up nuclear waste that threatens our environment.\n  The budget we are offering invests in infrastructure and job training \nto get Americans back to work now. It prioritizes education, as well as \nresearch and development, so that our workforce of today and tomorrow \nhas the skills to compete in the 21st century global economy.\n  Our budget puts jobs and the economy first and foremost. But it also \nbuilds on the work we have done over the last 2 years to tackle our \ndeficit and debt responsibly.\n  Since 2010, Congress and the administration have worked together to \nreduce the deficit by $2.4 trillion--$1.8 trillion coming from spending \ncuts, $600 billion coming from allowing tax rates to rise on the \nwealthiest Americans, which we voted on in the year-end deal.\n  The Senate budget takes us the rest of the way to that $4 trillion \ngoal and beyond. It builds on the $2.4 trillion in deficit reduction \nalready done with an additional $1.85 trillion in new deficit \nreduction, for a total of $4.25 trillion in deficit reduction since the \nSimpson-Bowles report.\n  Our budget reduces the deficit to below 3 percent of GDP by 2015 and \nkeeps it well below that level for the rest of the 10-year window in a \nresponsible way. It pushes down our debt, as a percentage of the \neconomy, moving in the right direction. Our budget tackles the deficit \nthe way the American people have consistently said they want it done, \nwith an equal mix of responsible spending cuts made across the Federal \nbudget and new revenue raised by closing loopholes and cutting wasteful \nbreaks that primarily benefit the rich.\n  This budget cuts spending responsibly by $975 billion, finding \nsavings across the budget, including health and defense. It matches \nthose responsible spending cuts with $975 billion in new revenue, which \nis raised by closing loopholes and cutting unfair spending in the Tax \nCode for those who need it the least, while locking in tax cuts for the \nmiddle class and low-income working families and protecting them from \nhaving to pay a penny more.\n  Since we have so far been unable to get a deal because Republicans \nreject using new revenue from the wealthiest to help us reduce the \ndeficit, I want to emphasize that there is bipartisan support for \ndeficit reduction through making the Tax Code more fair and efficient. \nDuring the recent fiscal cliff negotiations Speaker Boehner proposed \nthat we reduce the deficit by $800 billion by closing what he called \nspecial interest loopholes and deductions. This budget takes him up on \nthat.\n  In addition to investing in jobs and economic growth and tackling our \ndeficit and debt responsibly, this budget also keeps the promises we \nhave made to our seniors, our families, our veterans, and our \ncommunities. We strongly reject the call to dismantle Medicare by \nvoucherizing it because this critical program that seniors and families \nsupport, paid into, and depend on should be protected. This budget \ntakes a responsible, fair approach. It is the one endorsed by \nbipartisan groups and experts. It is the one supported by the vast \nmajority of the American people.\n  The House of Representatives is also working on their budget \nresolution today. I know there are going to be serious differences \nbetween the visions and values and priorities within the budgets which \nwill emerge from our Chamber and theirs. But the American people are \ngoing to have an opportunity now to examine these budgets side by side. \nThey are going to be able to decide which approach is best for our \neconomy, best for our jobs, and best for the middle class. They will \nlet us know whether they want to go back down the path of the trickle-\ndown policies that decimated the middle class and threw our economy \ninto a tailspin or if they would prefer the approach we have seen work \nbefore: to tackle our deficit responsibly, to reinvest in the middle \nclass, to build a strong foundation for growth, and to restore the \npromise of American opportunity.\n  The Senate budget is a balanced and responsible approach to taking us \ndown that second path. I am hopeful the House of Representatives will \njoin us at the bargaining table so we can end this gridlock and work \ntogether toward a responsible and bipartisan budget deal that the \nAmerican people expect and deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, before the Senator leaves the floor, the \nchair of the Budget Committee--first of all, I want to compliment her \non the work she has done on the Budget Committee. It is indeed \nimpressive. I want to compliment her because she is headed for a \nbalanced approach, really. Increased revenue. We are not talking about \nrates, we are talking about getting rid of tax break earmarks, earmarks \nthat go on not for one group for 1 year but go on indefinitely, such as \nsubsidies for corporate jets and sending jobs overseas.\n  But the other areas she is looking at are how we can be more frugal \nin our spending, and then a rigorous review of mandatory spending. We \nhave to review it to see how we can get more value for our dollar.\n  The Senator has championed veteran's health care. She and I know we \ncan get more value there. I compliment the Senator on that.\n  I am going to ask the Senator a question about timing and process. \nDoes the Senator have a time mandate that has been assigned to her to \ncomplete her bill?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland. First \nof all, let me just say it is truly a pleasure to be on the floor with \nthe chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I just remember when the \nSenator and I were here back in 1992, the Year of the Woman, and now \nhere we are managing these critical financial bills.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. It is the economic framework for the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Exactly. Families across the country should be grateful \nfor the work the Senator is doing on the appropriations side of the \ncommittee, which focuses on making sure their kids can go to school, \nthat they have the research and investment they need for their health \ncare, and so many transportation infrastructure projects that allow \nthem to go to work and raise their families in a responsible way.\n  I respect and admire the work the Senator is doing right now on a \nvery difficult and challenging budget CR that no one wishes looked like \nit does, but we recognize the reality of the task the Senator has been \ngiven. She is managing it in the best way possible.\n  To answer the question, I would tell the Senator that we are in a \nvery short timeframe. Our Budget Committee will proceed through the \namendment process, and tomorrow night pass out our budget after many \namendments. At that time, our staff will work over the few short days \nthey have to have the paperwork ready to lay down our bill on the floor \nof the Senate, hopefully, Monday night. We are under a very constricted \ntimeframe. It is the one piece of legislation that comes before this \nbody like that with 50 hours of debate and multiple amendments. We need \nto finish that before we can leave for the April break.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Well, I want to share the Senator's sense of urgency to \nget her bill done. In order for her to get her bill done, I need to get \nmy bill done. I want to pledge my cooperation, and I believe that of my \nvice chairman, Senator Shelby. We have a sense of urgency to move our \nbill because we must take it over to the House. There, we have a \ndeadline that is a Draconian one: If we do not have a continuing \nfunding resolution passed before the Easter-Passover break, we will \nface a government shutdown. That is horrific in terms of our economy \nand the people who want the U.S. Government to govern itself. It is \nalso one more sign that we have a problem governing. I say that \nbecause, while the Senator is marking up her bill tomorrow, we want to \nmove through here so that we are done.\n\n  I would like to have this bill done tomorrow. There are those who \nhave obligations in their States and even at an international \nconference. I would like to support that, but Senator Shelby and I need \nsupport too. So we do not doubt people offering amendments, we do not \nquestion their content or their policy, but we have timing and process.\n  Our bill is not meant to be ``pin the tail on the donkey.'' It is not \nmeant to\n\n[[Page S1777]]\n\nsolve every problem the U.S. Government has. Our job is to keep the \ncontinuing resolution.\n  I want to say to the Senator, while, speaking to a much larger \naudience, I know there is pent frustration not to be able to offer \namendments and debate. We are doing that. You win some, you lose some. \nThat is called the Senate. I want the Senator to know we want to work \nwith her so that we do not interfere in her work. But I believe one of \nthe ways we can get to the budget, which is the real framework for how \nwe can even vitiate sequester, is to get out our bill, meaning the \ncontinuing funding resolution.\n  So I want to compliment the Senator on her work. I pledge to support \nit, but I ask the support of all of the other 98 of our colleagues. \nLet's look at what we need to get done on the continuing funding \nresolution, not what we would like to get done.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. If the Senator from Maryland, the chairman of our \nAppropriations Committee, would yield for a minute, I want to back her \nup on that. I know there are probably 8,000 amendments that can be \noffered to this because nobody is happy with the fact that we are faced \nwith a continuing resolution that does not reflect the needs of all of \nour communities. I know she did not come here to debate process or to \nbe the mother of Senators and get them over here to offer amendments. I \nknow where her passion is. It is fitting for her kids and families and \ncommunities in Maryland. That is what she wants to get back to.\n  If we can get past this and put the CR in place, swallow hard and \nthen get our budget done and work toward a process of a bipartisan \nbudget, we need to do that so we can then give the Senator the ability \nto put the Appropriations Committee bills together. They will come out \nhere and we will be able to offer amendments and people will have their \nsay about the spending of the future. We cannot get to that unless we \nget that work done.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. That is right. An open and transparent process in that \nlegislation that we put together over a weekend, 571 pages. Senators \nMcCain and Coburn were right, but I could not do any more because I did \nnot get it from the House until Thursday. So, again, I am not here to \ndebate process, but I am the prodder of the process. So I am out here \nprodding and pleading: Please, let's get a simple, contained order of \namendments. We thank the other side of the aisle. They are working with \nus.\n  In terms of the floor staff who is working on this, we need the \ncooperation of the Senators.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I would back up the Senator and urge Senators to, \nplease, finish this product, move on to our budget next week, and get \nthat done. Then we can get to the point that America will respect the \nwork of this body and not lurch from crisis to crisis as the Senator \nhas outlined and get back to focusing on the policies those families \nshe cares about and represents so well want her here for.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Absolutely. I see my colleague from Maryland, such an \nable and active Member, a member of the Finance Committee that is known \nto make a contribution. We want him to make a couple of trillion \ndollars' worth of contributions, as a matter of fact.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from Maryland, \nSenator Mikulski. I was listening to the exchange between Senator \nMurray and Senator Mikulski. I just want to concur in their comments. \nWe need to act on H.R. 933, the amendments offered by Senator Mikulski \nand Senator Shelby. It is important for us to move forward on this for \nseveral reasons.\n  First, we are over 5 months into the fiscal year. We need to enact \nthe fiscal year 2013 budget. If we are going to the fiscal year 2014 \nbudget, we have to get past the fiscal year 2013 budget. So it is \ncritically important that we pass the continuing resolution omnibus \nbill, send it back to the House, and, hopefully, reconcile those \ndifferences very quickly because we only have a few more days to get \nthis enacted in order to make sure government continues, but just as \nimportantly to give predictability to our agencies for the next 7 \nmonths.\n  We are very close to getting that done. I urge my colleagues to \ncooperate as the chairperson of the Appropriations Committee, Senator \nMikulski, has said. I certainly strongly support the work that has been \ndone. I thank Senator Mikulski and Senator Shelby for bringing us \ntogether in a way that I would hope the Senate would operate, that we \nwork together, Democrats and Republicans, come together on a bill, and \nmove that legislation.\n  Having said that, I must tell you I share the frustration that \nSenator Mikulski talked about. There are provisions that are not \nincluded in this legislation that I would like to see included, and \nthere are some provisions that are included that I would like to see \nnot included. Let me talk about one of the provisions that is included \nthat I regret is there. That is the provision that would extend the pay \nfreeze for our Federal workforce through the remainder of the current \nbudget year, fiscal year 2013.\n  I am proud to represent the people of Maryland in the Senate, along \nwith my colleague Senator Mikulski. We represent 130,000 Federal \nworkers. That is about 5.6 percent of the Maryland workforce who are \nFederal workers. These are public servants. These are people who are on \nthe frontline. These are people who are providing critical services \nevery day to the people of this country.\n  A couple of weeks ago, I was at the National Institutes of Health. I \nhad a chance to talk to the workforce there. What they are doing is \ncritically important to the people of this country. I could tell you \nthat the basic research they do is critically important to a lot of \ncompanies in the creation of jobs. That is absolutely true.\n  I will tell you the story of one individual I happened to meet. One \nof the scientists there took me to the program on which they are \nworking. The work they are doing is in the field of research on renal \ncancer. The reason I say this is I had a chance to meet with one of the \nindividuals who is in the program. He comes from a different State and \nwas diagnosed a while ago with having a form of renal cancer with no \ncure. He was told by his doctor that he had basically two choices: We \ncan treat you with the only technology we know here or at any facility \nin the country--and you have 6 months to live--or you may participate \nin an NIH program where they are looking at alternative ways to treat \nthis form of renal cancer. This person chose the latter course, \ntraveled to Bethesda, MD, and participated in the program. They \ndiscovered for this form of cancer a drug therapy that will stop the \ngrowth of the cancer cells. He is now living a somewhat more normal \nlife with hope of survival. He didn't have that just a few months ago.\n  When I spoke with this person about what he felt about sequestration \nor about government shutdowns, do you know what he told me? He said: I \nnever thought I would need government. I was working. I never thought I \nwould need government. NIH needs the money we give them. It helped save \nmy life, and it helped develop the type of scientific base we need in \nthis country.\n  This story could be told many times over. They need the \npredictability of a budget. They need the legislation Senator Mikulski \nis promoting, which will give them funding for the remainder of this \nyear so they can continue their critically important work.\n  I visited the Social Security Administration a week ago and met a lot \nof hard-working Federal workers who were trying to send Social Security \nbenefits to those who need them. We have people with disabilities \ntrying to get a disability determination to receive a check. There is a \ndelay in getting this done--a delay that will only become longer if the \nSocial Security Administration doesn't have the people it needs in \norder to process those claims.\n  I could mention many other agencies--NSA and the critical work they \ndo in cyber security. These are the best mathematicians in the world \nwho are Federal workers serving in the most noble of public service. \nThis includes Departments such as NIST, National Institute of Standards \nand Technology, which develops technology needs for our future, and the \nwork done at FDA, the Food and Drug Administration, on food safety.\n  These are all people working in my State of Maryland for a Federal \nagency\n\n[[Page S1778]]\n\nas Federal workers. They are getting the job done for the people of \nthis country and deserve our support. They have already sacrificed and \nhave seen budgets that have shrunk. There are fewer people working, and \ntheir mission has increased--more work, fewer workers. They have now \nbeen through 2 years--which will now increase to 3--of a pay freeze. \nThis translates into a $90 billion contribution to the deficit problems \nof this country. This is what the Federal workers have done.\n  Quite frankly, I find it disappointing that a very modest pay \nadjustment for a 7-month period--a .5 percent, one-half of 1 percent \nincrease, which was in the President's budget--was held off for the \nfirst 5 months and will now be held off for the remainder of this year. \nI think this is wrong. That pay adjustment should have gone forward. I \nregret that it is not included in the legislation we will act on.\n  The Federal workforce will have additional sacrifices because this \ncontinuing resolution on the omnibus bill incorporates the lower \nnumbers caused by these across-the-board cuts by sequestration. As a \nresult of that, many of our Federal workers will be getting furlough \nnotices. What does a furlough notice mean? That means as many as 1 day \nout of 5 they will be asked to not show up for work, which translates \ninto a 20-percent pay cut, and some possibly 1 out of every 10 days, \nwhich is a 10-percent pay cut. If you have a mortgage payment to make \nor your utility bills to pay, creditors are not going to accept the \nfact that it can be 10 percent less because you have been furloughed 1 \nday out of every 10 days.\n  Our Federal workers will even do more, and I think we need to \nacknowledge that not by just saying ``you are doing a great job at \npublic service'' but by giving them the support they need. I hope that \nas we move forward on the budget considerations for fiscal year 2014, \nwe will take into consideration the sacrifices already made by our \nFederal workforce and give them the support they need to get the job \ndone for the people of this country.\n  There are provisions which were left out of this continuing \nresolution omnibus bill which I think should have been included. Let me \nsupport Senator Harkin and the amendment he has pending, which would \nbasically put into the continuing resolution the work that was done \nduring regular order by the Appropriations Committee on the Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill. It really accepts regular order. It doesn't \nincrease the total at all; it just adjusts the money that was spent in \nfiscal year 2012 to the committee priorities established in fiscal year \n2013. In other words, it establishes regular order with the same \nappropriation dollars in order to update the spending in the agencies \nunder the committee's jurisdiction. This makes sense.\n  Let me give you one example, and I could give you many others. I \nspoke about the National Institutes of Health. I spoke about how \nvaluable the work is that they accomplish. Well, as a result of budget \nreductions, they may now only approve about one out of every seven \ngrants. They make grants to our universities and to groups who work to \nfind answers for these diseases. They only now may do one out of every \nseven. As was explained to me by Dr. Collins, they must choose between \nthe really great grants that are submitted and the great, great grants \nthat are submitted. They can take only a few of the really great \nprojects that are out there.\n  We need to do better. Senator Harkin's amendment would increase the \namount of money going to NIH by about $140 million. Once again, it \ndoesn't change the overall totals; it adjusts the priorities from \nfiscal year 2013 to fiscal year 2014. I urge my colleagues to support \nthe Harkin amendment to enable an agency such as NIH to receive the \nhelp needed without affecting the overall spending of this Nation.\n  I really do look forward to us working together, Democrats and \nRepublicans, in the national interest to compromise in a bipartisan \nmanner. This is what we need to do. This is exactly what Senator \nMikulski and Senator Shelby have done in bringing forward this \nlegislation. It deserves our support.\n  I listened to Senator Murray, as I know we will be voting on a budget \nnext week for fiscal year 2014. What we need to do is work together, \nDemocrats and Republicans, let these bills go to conference, work \ntogether and bring out a budget that represents the best for our Nation \nto move forward.\n  What I hear most from the people of Maryland is that they want us to \nmake decisions. They need the predictability of a budget. We can give \nthem that for our current year by the enactment of the bill that is \ncurrently before us, and then we could give them the predictability \nthey need for the future decisions of our Nation by approving in a \nbipartisan manner the budget for fiscal year 2014. I would hope we \ncould do that also as this would clearly be in the best interests of \nour Nation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we began a markup on the budget today. \nIt is the first time in 3 years the Budget Committee has actually met \nto begin to mark up a bill. We had opening statements today. We made \nopening statements before we saw the chairman's mark, and the mark was \nproduced later after the opening statements were completed.\n  Tomorrow we will have a markup on the budget and it will be 1 day, \nand amendments will all be completed tomorrow. There will be several \ninterruptions, but the determination is to finish, which, of course, is \ncontrary to what we would like to have happen. The Republican members \nof the committee asked that we have a week set aside and we do opening \nstatements beginning Monday or Tuesday and that we actually have \namendments up during a normal process and be able to actually engage in \nthe kind of debate I think would be helpful for the financial future of \nour country. The chair and the Democratic majority decided we would \njust do opening statements this afternoon and we would do all the \namendments tomorrow and we will complete tomorrow regardless. So that \nis where we are.\n  I am glad we do have a budget being brought forward. If it is brought \nto the floor, it will be the first time in 4 years the Democratic \nmajority has brought a budget to the floor. This is in violation of \nplain law, statutory code of the United States, 1974, requiring a \nbudget be passed every year and brought forward. They refused to do so. \nThe majority leader said it was foolish to bring a budget. What he \nmeant was it was foolish politically. Surely he wouldn't contend it is \nfoolish for America that the Democratic leadership in the Senate bring \nup a budget. Surely it would be good for the country to do this every \nyear, as the law requires. But that is where we have been. So we are \nglad.\n  The House passed earlier this year a bill that said no budget, then \nno pay. It said, Congress, if you don't pass a budget, at least out of \nyour own House, then you don't get paid. So that picked up the pace, \napparently, and we have a budget, although the President has not \nsubmitted his budget. Amazingly, I think it is the first time in 90 \nyears, somebody said--the first time certainly in my memory--the \nPresident of the United States, who is required by law to have the \nbudget in by February 4, has waited for the House, which is marking up \na budget today, and the Senate to do their budget first. That goes \nagainst what mayors and city councils do and Governors do. But that is \nwhere we are.\n  I will tell you one thing that we have learned in the short time we \nhave had the budget that I think defines a lot about where our majority \nwants the country to go. Over 10 years, this budget--at a time of a \ndangerous fiscal crisis--spends more--$640-some-odd billion more--than \nthe current law we passed about 20 months ago in August of 2011. We \nagreed to the Budget Control Act. We agreed to a certain amount of \nmoney that we would spend and no more. The President signed it and both \nparties in the House and Senate agreed to it. But what happens? Here we \nare with their proposing a budget that will spend more money than we \nagreed to spend just a few months ago.\n  The worst thing about this is that the Budget Control Act did not go \nfar\n\n[[Page S1779]]\n\nenough. We should have reduced spending more. In addition to that, it \nlooks as though there will be about $1 trillion in new taxes in this \nbudget. So it is tax more and spend more. It is the wrong direction for \nAmerica.\n  People say: Well, that is just politics; what is the matter with you \nguys. Why can't you reach an agreement? It is hard to reach an \nagreement when the country is on an unsustainable debt path that puts \nus in danger of financial crisis; a path that is already slowing growth \ndown in our country. Agreeing to a budget that continues down this path \nis not the right thing to do. So I am deeply disappointed that we are \nin this fix.\n  I wish we had had an opportunity in committee to really have a lot of \ndiscussion about it back and forth, because there are good Democratic \nmembers of our committee, talented members, good Republican members, \ntalented members, who bring so much to the discussion. But it was just \nboth sides talking today. Some good statements were made but not the \nkind of engagement we would like to have had. So that is a \ndisappointment.\n  Under the current baseline we are on, according to the Congressional \nBudget Office, in the tenth year of this budget we are dealing with \nright now--the Budget Control Act--interest on our debt will be $850 \nbillion--$850 billion in interest payments for 1 year on the money we \nhave borrowed--the almost $17 trillion we have borrowed. This is why it \nis such a dangerous thing. The highway bill is $40 billion or $50 \nbillion a year, aid to education may be $100 billion.\n  I am saying that in just a few years, because we have run up \nunnecessarily so much debt, that interest will be $900 billion. That \nwill be more than the Defense Department by far. The Defense \nDepartment's base budget is about $540 billion, and it is actually \nbeing cut. Interest will be the largest growing item in the budget.\n  Food stamps went from $20 billion a decade ago to $80 billion. I just \nleft my farmers, who came up from Alabama, and we were talking about \nthat. The farm bill is about $100 billion a year. Of that farm bill, \n$80 billion of it is the food stamp budget. It has gone up four times. \nThe $20 billion that goes to farmers, in aid and insurance, actually \nwas cut this year, but nothing was cut out of food stamps. They \nresisted that, and rejected even a modest amendment I offered to end a \nclear abuse which wouldn't have hurt anybody. I guess what I am saying \nis we are in serious business here and we have to get off the debt \ncourse we are on.\n  Erskine Bowles, who was appointed by President Obama to head the \nfiscal commission, along with Alan Simpson--the Simpson-Bowles \nCommission--said this Nation has never faced a more predictable \nfinancial crisis. What he was saying was, if we don't get off the debt \npath we are on, we are going to have a financial collapse. They didn't \nsay exactly what, but something like Greece, something like we had in \n2007, throwing our country back into a recession, which would be a very \ndangerous thing. It was a bipartisan warning to us that we needed to \nact, and we haven't acted since then, and that was over 2 years ago.\n  We haven't done anything. So a lot of people are saying and you have \nheard it said that we have to act because we are worried about our \nchildren and our grandchildren. And we should be worried about the debt \nthat is out there for our children and grandchildren.\n  Senator Kelly Ayotte from New Hampshire put a picture up in our \nBudget Committee today of her two children, ages 5 and 8, and she had \none with $1,100,000 on that child's picture, and the younger one had \n$1,300,000 on her picture. That is what was calculated will be the \nshare of the Nation's debt that they will carry when they are adults. \nThis is wrong. We should not--must not--do this to our children and \ngrandchildren. It was not done to us. Our parents left us with a \ncountry much more responsibly managed than this.\n  We have never, ever had a situation in which we have had four \nconsecutive years of deficits amounting to $1.2 trillion a year. Never. \nOh, President Bush spent too much. Yes, he did. He deserves some \ncriticism. I think he does deserve some criticism. The year before he \nleft office, his deficit was $161 billion; his last year was $470 \nbillion. For the last 4 years, we have averaged $1.2 trillion, and it \nis systemic and it is deep and it has to be changed.\n  Now, there is one more thing I really would like for my colleagues to \nfocus on, and I will wrap up with this point, but it is really \nimportant. The question is: When you have debt equal to $17 trillion, \ndoes it impact the economy now? Yes. It puts us at risk for some sort \nof fiscal crisis. If there is a collapse in Europe, a collapse in \nJapan, a collapse in China, it could kick us off into a major financial \ndisaster in the United States. It is a very fragile situation.\n  But the question is: Does the debt we have now slow growth today? I \nthink that is a really important issue, and so we have done the \nresearch.\n  The issue was originally raised by Rogoff and Reinhart. They have \ndone a number of studies and wrote a big book about all the nations \nthat have gone into default and have had a debt crisis over the last \n200 years. It is a thoroughly respected work of two highly competent \nand proven, respected economists. What they concluded was that when \ndebt reaches 90 percent of the size of your economy, you slow economic \ngrowth by 1 to 2 percent.\n  Where are we now? A lot of people have been using the ``public debt \nof the United States.'' That is one way to calculate it, and our public \ndebt represents about 76 percent of our gross domestic product. But the \nother debt that we use, the one you have seen most often, is the $16 \ntrillion figure that has the numbers spinning on it--$16 trillion is \nwhat is called the gross debt. A lot of people seem to think we are not \nin danger because Rogoff and Reinhart were talking about the public \ndebt. That is not so. We have examined their work, and we have examined \ntheir footnotes and their reports and analysis. It is the gross debt. \nThat is what they were using; that is what they calculated. We are at \n104 percent gross debt, so we are well over the 90.\n  I would contend that the reason our economy has failed to meet, for \nthe last 3 years, the growth expectations that were out there is \nbecause our debt is dragging us down now. And there are hundreds of \nthousands--millions of Americans who are probably out of work today \nbecause of the debt drag.\n  We need to get off this path, and the budget the majority moves in \nour committee gets us nowhere off this path. It never brings our gross \ndebt below 90 percent or 94 percent of GDP, and we haven't finished the \nanalysis of it.\n  In addition, the International Monetary Fund, the European Central \nBank, the International Settlements Bank--all three have done similar \nstudies with a little different approach, and they all reach the same \nconclusion. What they have concluded is that however you calculate the \ndebt, the United States is already above the line where growth is \nslowed.\n  I think it was 2 years ago that the Congressional Budget Office--our \nnonpartisan group who makes projections for our debt and finances in \nthe future--calculated that this year, 2013, we would have 4.6 percent \ngrowth. They predicted a much higher growth last year than the 2.2 \npercent we got the year before that, and they missed the previous year. \nThey missed 3 consecutive years, predicting higher growth than \noccurred. And growth means a lot.\n  White House economic expert Christina Romer has estimated that a 1-\npercent growth in the economy--a difference between 2 and 3 percent--\nmeans you would create 1 million jobs to have 3 percent growth rather \nthan 2 percent growth. That is what growth does to job creation, to \nwages, the possibility of getting raises, getting more wages, more \novertime, perhaps, more bonuses, because the economy is growing. And if \nit is not growing, our workers are hurting.\n  So in our vision--I think the members of the Republican side of this \nBudget Committee--we are united in the belief that we can bring this \nbudget under control and we can balance it.\n  Now, I have to tell you, the budget Chairman Murray produced tonight \ndoes not balance ever. It never balances. They say it is a balanced \napproach. They even said a couple times that it is a balanced budget, \nin our hearing. All they were trying to do was use the word \n``balance,'' I think maybe--surely not but perhaps--they were hoping \npeople would hear them\n\n[[Page S1780]]\n\nsay they have a balanced budget, which comes nowhere close to balance. \nWith $500 billion, $600 billion, $700 billion of deficit out there for \nyears and years, it never balances. Congressman Ryan made his budget \npublic, openly, a day before he commenced his hearing, and it balances \nin 10 years.\n  This is the deal. There is good and bad news in what I am saying. The \ngood news is that we can increase spending every year by 3.4 percent \nand the budget will balance. The path we are on, the CBO current \nbaseline projects us increasing spending each year at 5.4 or 5.6 \npercent. So if you reduce that growth instead of growing at that level, \nyou grow at 3.4 percent, the budget will balance. And 3.4 percent is \nhigher than what the Congressional Budget Office says inflation will \nbe. They say it is about 2.2 percent; it will be about 25 percent over \n10 years. So you can increase spending over 10 years by 40 percent \nabove the inflation rate, and the budget will balance. You just can't \nkeep increasing it by 5.4 or 5.6 percent.\n  It is critical for America that we get on the right course. So this \nis deeply troubling to me. I know we can do this. It is not that hard.\n\n  But here is the bad news and why it is painful a bit to get there; \nthat is, because more than half of our budget now is the entitlement \nprograms and interest. As I said, interest on the debt--you have to pay \nit. You really can't cut the interest except by reducing your debt. And \nthere is no balanced budget in the short-term future, so the interest \nis going up at a solid rate.\n  Then you have our big entitlement programs. You have Medicare, you \nhave Social Security, and then you have some large ones--Medicaid, \nwhich is a surging program growing at 8 percent a year, projected to \nincrease by 117 percent over 10 years, and then food stamps is \nconsidered to be an entitlement. You put all those entitlements \ntogether and you have a problem. Those are in law. And ``entitlement'' \nmeans that if your income is at a certain level, your age is a certain \nage, you are entitled to the benefit that the law gives you whether the \ngovernment has any money or not. Congress doesn't have to appropriate \nit. The government has to go out and borrow the money if they don't \nchange the law.\n  So we need a plan to change Medicare, Social Security, food stamps, \nand some of the other entitlement programs in a way that saves them \nfrom the financial disaster they are headed toward, puts them on a \nsound path, and actually begin to restore the finances of America.\n  There is still waste, fraud, and abuse in the remaining part of the \ngovernment. There are still programs that don't do any good for the \nmoney they get. There is still money spent on projects that should \nnever have money spent on them from Washington, DC, and they ought to \nbe eliminated. But to slow growth from 5.4 percent a year to 3.4 \npercent a year, we need to touch a little bit of everything. And \nspending will still go up. That is the good news. We can still spend \nmore, but we just can't spend it quite at the increased rate we are on.\n  Some people say: Why don't you balance it now? Why are you talking \nabout waiting 10 years?\n  We probably should do it sooner than 10 years. But I think it is a \nrealistic appeal to Democrats and Republicans alike--let's get on this \npath, this path that is not too hard to achieve what would be fabulous \nfor America.\n  Two things. First, I believe that if we were to pass a budget that \nwould be on the path to balance in 10 years, we would feel some \neconomic growth that we have never felt before. Investors worldwide, \ninvestors in the United States, and businesses would feel so much \nbetter about our country. I really think that is true. Second, we would \nreduce the huge debt hanging over us that is already slowing down \ngrowth. Those two things we can accomplish.\n  I don't know where we will go. We will pass a budget out of \ncommittee, I am sure, on a party-line vote. Maybe it will pass here on \nthe Senate floor by a party-line vote, and then it will go to \nconference. I don't know, maybe Speaker Boehner or Chairman Ryan's \nbudget will match up with the Democratic budget out of the Senate, and \nmaybe something good will happen for America and we can reach some sort \nof agreement. But we cannot tax our way out of this. We can't keep \nincreasing spending, for heaven's sake. We need to reduce the growth of \nspending to a level that is reasonable and can put us on a path to \nbalance.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of an \namendment that I have filed, along with Vice Chairman Chambliss, to the \nappropriations bill now on the floor, which will address a unique \nproblem the intelligence community faces in applying the sequester \nreductions to the National Intelligence Program, NIP, budget.\n  In short, this amendment would ensure that the intelligence \ncommunity--which has to be as predictive and agile as possible--will \nhave the same level of flexibility in implementing budget cuts as the \nDepartment of Defense, where most of its budget is located. Without \nthis relief, the intelligence community will be far less discriminating \nin how it adjusts personnel and financial resources to address the \ndynamic and unforeseen threats our Nation will face in the upcoming \nmonths.\n  This is a commonsense amendment. It does not cost a dime, and it will \nlikely avoid a great deal of harm to our intelligence capabilities.\n  Let me briefly describe the background and how the amendment would \nwork.\n  As has been described many times, the terms of the sequestration \nrequire that the same level of budget cuts apply across the board. That \nis, departments and agencies have to apply the same percentage cut \nacross each account.\n  It therefore becomes very important how those accounts are defined. \nIf the account is very large, a manager has more leeway to prioritize \nfunding and cut the least important, or the least urgent, needs. By \ncontrast, if the account is defined as being smaller, there is less \nflexibility to cut funding responsibly, and more important programs \nwill suffer.\n  Because of language included in the Fiscal Year 2012 Defense \nAppropriations Act, however, the intelligence community must apply the \nsequester in a highly restrictive way. That legislation required that \nthe definition of an account for sequestration in the intelligence \ncommunity is at something known as the Programs, Projects, and \nActivities--known as PPA--level. The intelligence community's budget \nhas 685 PPAs, and each will need to be cut equally. The most \nproblematic of these PPAs for the intelligence agencies are the 354 \nPPAs within the intelligence agencies' Operations and Maintenance, O, \naccounts. These are the accounts which fund current operations and \nsalaries.\n  The overall Department of Defense budget is roughly 10 times that of \nthe intelligence community, but it has only 3 times more PPAs--in other \nwords, it has relatively fewer accounts that are affected by \nsequestration, and thus greater flexibility to absorb the sequester \ncuts, since they can be applied within larger budget accounts.\n  This amendment would help alleviate this problem by permitting the \nagencies in the intelligence community that are funded by the Defense \nAppropriations bill to use the same definition of what constitutes a \nProgram, Project, and Activity Account as the Defense Department when \napplying sequestration reductions to its O accounts. This specific \nchange will reduce the number of these PPAs from 354 to 5 and will not \naffect other PPAs. No budget outside of the intelligence community is \naffected--we simply provide these intelligence agencies with the same \nlevel of flexibility as the Pentagon.\n  In times like today, where the threats are neither static nor \npredictable, I ask that my colleagues approve this amendment so that \nthe intelligence community may be nimble and responsive to the dangers \nour Nation faces.\n  This is not a simple budgetary matter. How the cuts of sequestration \nare applied makes a great deal of difference in practical terms.\n  Just yesterday, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and \nother intelligence agency heads testified at the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence's hearing on Current and Projected National \nSecurity Threats to the United States. They described the numerous, \ncomplex, and interrelated threats we face. Director Clapper noted\n\n[[Page S1781]]\n\n``how quickly and radically the world--and our threat environment--are \nchanging.'' He stated there is an increasing risk to U.S. critical \ninfrastructure from cyber attacks, in particular from isolated state or \nnon-state actors using less sophisticated but still effective \ntechniques that are more prevalent today. I ask unanimous consent that \nan excerpt from this transcript be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The terrorist threat continues to become more diffuse since the al-\nQa'ida core leadership has been degraded and its affiliates in the \nArabian Peninsula and Africa look to fill that void and strike against \nthe United States. Countries like Iran and North Korea continue their \nefforts to develop ever more deadly weapons of mass destruction, and \nlook to market them to counter their failing economies. And, the \ninstability in the Middle East and North Africa that has grown since \nthe Arab spring continues to create more dangers and potential \nflashpoints in countries that 3 years ago were not assessed to have \nsuch risks.\n  In the past 6 months, it has been clear that the intelligence \ncommunity needs to surge additional resources to collect and analyze \nintelligence on Northern Africa. Our policymakers need more and better \ninformation to deal with instability and terrorist activities in Libya, \nMali, and Algeria. Under sequestration, however, agencies would be \nlimited to do so. The same needs apply to address threats that emanate \nfrom Iran, North Korea, Syria, and cyberspace, to name just a few.\n  There is no doubt that the intelligence community can reduce spending \nand contribute to the Governmentwide reductions. But to strip it of all \nflexibility to cut programs and personnel across the board makes no \nsense.\n  If our intelligence agencies are to absorb the cuts required by \nsequestration, our Nation's security would be better served by \nproviding the intelligence community with the flexibility it needs to \nimplement cuts in as responsible and thoughtful way under these \ncircumstances.\n  The changes my amendment seeks are necessary to help the intelligence \ncommunity adapt to a changing world as the sequestration reductions are \nimplemented. I understand there may be concerns with how the other \nchamber will view this amendment, but I believe that our counterparts \non the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence--Chairman Mike \nRogers and Ranking Member Dutch Ruppersberger--support making these \nchanges to help intelligence agencies succeed in their mission.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me make clear that this amendment is \nintended, and I believe does, have no effect on the visibility that \nCongress has in how the intelligence community will make budget \nreductions due to sequestration or with how these agencies reprogram \nfunds. The only thing affected by the amendment is the size of the \naccounts from which sequestered funds must be taken.\n  On behalf of myself and Vice Chairman Chambliss, I urge adoption of \nthe amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nExcerpts From the Testimony of Director of National Intelligence James \nClapper, Before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, March 12, \n                                  2013\n\n       In my considered judgment as the nation's senior \n     intelligence officer, sequestration jeopardizes our nation's \n     safety and security. And this jeopardy will increase over \n     time. The National Intelligence Program, or NIP as it's \n     called, which I manage is spread across six cabinet \n     departments, and two independent agencies. Much of it is \n     included in the DOD budget. For that portion of the NIP, the \n     Congress directed that the National Intelligence Program use \n     an even more onerous set of rules to carry out these cuts \n     than that imposed on the Defense Department.\n       This restrictive Program Project and Activity, or PPA, \n     structure as it's known, compounds the damage because it \n     restricts our ability to manage where to take deductions in a \n     balanced, and rational way. Accordingly the sheer size of the \n     budget cut, well over $4 billion, or about 7 percent of the \n     NIP will directly compel us to do less, with less. Some \n     examples, and I'll have to be circumspect here, in a--in an \n     open, unclassified setting, and we're prepared to speak more \n     specifically in a classified setting, of the impacts of \n     sequestration.\n       We'll reduce human technical, and counter intelligence \n     operations resulting in fewer collection opportunities while \n     increasing the risk of strategic surprise. This includes for \n     example, possibly furloughing thousands of FBI employees \n     funded in the National Intelligence Program. Our cyber \n     efforts will be impacted. This is an area where, as you all \n     know, we must--we need to keep ahead of rapid technology \n     advances to maintain and increase access to adversaries as \n     well as provide warning of a cyber attack against the U.S.\n       Critical analysis and tools will be cut back. So we'll \n     reduce global coverage, and may risk missing the early signs \n     of a threat. Our response to customers will suffer as well. \n     We'll let go over five thousand contractors, and that number \n     may grow, who are an integral part of the intelligence \n     community, and this is on top of the thousands of contractors \n     we've let go in previous years. We'll delay major systems \n     acquisitions, and decommission older, but still productive \n     overhead reconnaissance capabilities, thus reducing coverage. \n     Virtually all of the 39 major systems acquisitions across the \n     intelligence community would be wounded.\n       We'll have to re-negotiate contracts and slip schedules to \n     the right, which in the long run, will cost us more. And \n     we'll scale back cutting edge research that helps us maintain \n     a strategic advantage. Since we're already halfway through \n     the fiscal year, the mandate of across the board cuts are \n     equivalent to 13 percent, because we'll be forced to take \n     them in just seven months. These condensed timelines magnify \n     the impact these cuts will have on the I.C. So in response, \n     our approach starts with the premise that mission comes \n     first. Therefore, our two highest priorities are: One, to \n     protect our most valuable resource, our civilian workforce so \n     we can focus on the threats we face. And two to support \n     overseas operations.\n       Our civilian workforce works 24/7 around the world and is \n     crucial to performing that mission. It is our civilian \n     professionals who will provide the resilience and ingenuity \n     to help compensate for the other cuts we'll incur. I am \n     resolutely committed to minimizing the number, and lengths of \n     furloughs that would be required, not only because of the \n     direct impact on our mission because of the severe impact on \n     the morale of the people who do it. I plan to follow Deputy \n     Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter's sterling example, and have \n     my pay reduced as well in solidarity with any I.C. employees \n     that have to be furloughed.\n       Now let me emphasize here that we are not arguing against \n     taking our share of the budget reductions. What I am saying \n     is we must manage this budget crisis, and continue our vital \n     missions. And in so doing, we'll minimize the impact on our \n     nation,and on our employees. Therefore, I plan to submit a \n     reprogramming action that mitigates some of the most \n     egregious cuts to help us cut in a more rational mission \n     focused manner. And in this, I'm asking for your support, and \n     the other intelligence oversight committees for expedited \n     management and consideration.\n       And Madam Chairman I want to on behalf of the entire \n     intelligence community, thank you for your leadership and \n     your care for the mission of the intelligence community, and \n     introducing a bill that would give us that flexibility. Now I \n     must tell you that, unfortunately, I've seen this movie \n     before. 20 years ago I served as director of Defense \n     Intelligence Agency, the job that Lieutenant General Mike \n     Flynn has right now. We were then enjoying to reap the peace \n     dividend occasioned by the end of the Cold War.\n       We reduced the intelligence community by 23 percent. During \n     the mid to late '90s, we closed many CIA stations, reduced \n     human collectors, cut analysts, allowed our overhead \n     architecture to atrophy, and we neglected basic \n     infrastructure needs, such as power, space, and cooling. And \n     we let our facilities decay. And most damaging, most \n     devastatingly we badly distorted the workforce. All of that \n     of course was--was reversed in the wake of 9/11, and thanks \n     to the support of the Congress over the last decade, we \n     rebuilt the intelligence community into the premier in such \n     capability on the planet.\n       And now if we're not careful, we risk another damaging \n     downward spiral. So I'm going to do all I can to prevent \n     history from repeating that cycle. But to be clear, the--the \n     scope and magnitude of the cuts already underway will be long \n     lasting. Unlike more directly observable sequestration \n     impacts, like shorter hours of public parks, or longer \n     security lines at airports, the degradation to intelligence \n     will be insidious. It will be gradual and almost invisible, \n     unless and until, of course we have an intelligence failure.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to speak on an amendment I have \noffered with my colleague from Colorado, Senator Udall, but before I do \nso, I want to commend the senior Senators from Maryland and Alabama, \nSenators Mikulski and Shelby, for putting forth a bipartisan proposal \nto prevent a government shutdown, and to congratulate them both on \ntheir new roles as Chairwoman and Vice Chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee. I look forward to working with both of them \nas we complete work on the fiscal year 2013 funding bills and begin the \nfiscal year 2014 budget process.\n  I also want to thank my friend from Colorado, Senator Udall, for \nworking with me to develop this bipartisan amendment, which is based on \na stand-\n\n[[Page S1782]]\n\nalone bill that we introduced last week.\n  Our amendment would help mitigate the harmful effects of the \nindiscriminate across-the-board cuts, known as sequestration, which \ntook effect on March 1.\n  Our amendment would not reverse the automatic spending reductions, \nbut would empower the heads of Federal agencies and departments to set \npriorities and implement the cuts in a smarter way.\n  Without this amendment, sequestration will be applied without \ndistinction between high and low priority programs, programs that have \na proven track record of success and those that should be reduced or \neliminated.\n  To ensure appropriate Congressional oversight, the amendment requires \nagency heads to submit their spending proposals to the House and Senate \nAppropriations Committees for approval.\n  This Congressional oversight is an important step in the process \nbecause the Appropriations Committees know the budget of each agency \ninside and out. This review process also provides a strong incentive \nfor each department or agency to put forth a serious plan if it wants \nto avoid the across-the-board cuts that would otherwise take effect.\n  Mr. President, this is an approach that our intelligence community \nhas requested. The Nation's senior intelligence officer, Director \nClapper, testified yesterday before the Intelligence Committee that \nsequestration jeopardizes our Nation's safety and security and that the \nacross-the-board nature of the cuts compounds the damage by limiting \n``our ability to manage where to take deductions in a balanced, and \nrational way.'' His plea was for flexibility, saying ``All we're asking \nfor is the latitude on how to take them to minimize the damage.''\n  The Udall-Collins amendment would provide that needed flexibility to \nthe intelligence community and other areas of our government, and I \nurge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Finally, I would like to note how pleased I am that the legislation \ncurrently before the Senate includes full-year funding bills for a \nnumber of departments and agencies, including the Departments of \nDefense, Homeland Security, Justice, Veterans Affairs, Commerce, and \nAgriculture. While I wish we had been able to move all of the annual \nappropriations bills, at a minimum, we appear on the verge of passing \nfull-year funding bills for the departments I just mentioned, which is \nparticularly imprortant for the Department of Defense.\n  Military leaders have repeatedly warned that failure to enact a full-\nyear defense funding bill would have dire consequences for our \nmilitary. Military readiness would suffer, and the military would not \nbe fully ready to respond to crises because DOD could not transfer \nfunds from investment accounts into readiness accounts.\n  A year-long CR for the Defense Department would have resulted in a \nhollow force because the Pentagon would not have been able to increase \nproduction rates for existing weapons, start new programs, or sign \nmultiyear procurement contracts that will provide significant savings \nfor taxpayers.\n  When I questioned Deputy Defense Secretary Ash Carter on February 14, \n2013, at a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing about what the \ncontinuing resolution means for the Navy and our domestic shipbuilding \ncapability, he testified that:\n\n       We're in the absurd position where we're five months into \n     the fiscal year and we have the authority to build the ships \n     that we built last year and no authority to build the ships \n     that we plan to build this year. That's crazy . . . and that \n     has nothing to do with sequester, by the way, that's the C.R.\n\n  The full-year funding bills that are included in the continuing \nresolution offered by Senators Mikulski and Shelby will help alleviate \nsome of the impacts of sequestration on the departments and agencies \nfunded through those bills.\n  Unfortunately, the departments and agencies that find themselves \nfunded under a continuing resolution, operating under a budget based on \nlast year's needs, are not as lucky. It is all the more important for \nthese departments and agencies that we provide additional flexibility, \nas the Udall-Collins amendment would do, in carrying out the cuts \nmandated by the Budget Control Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support this amendment so that \nthe cuts that are taking place now can be targeted at programs that do \nnot work while sparing those programs that do.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nleader remarks tomorrow, March 14, the Senate resume consideration of \nH.R. 933; that there be up to 1 hour of debate equally divided in the \nusual form on the Harkin amendment; that upon the use or yielding back \nof time, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Harkin \namendment; that there be no amendments in order to the amendment prior \nto the vote, and the amendment be subject to a 60-affirmative-vote \nthreshold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Cloture Motions\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I have been waiting today to take just a \nmoment to honor Myron Fleming, Director of Doorkeepers, who is retiring \nafter 40 years of working on Capitol Hill.\n  Myron began his work in the Capitol with the office of Senator Howard \nMetzenbaum of Ohio. He has worked in the Senate for 33, 34 years, and \nprior to that he worked in the House of Representatives for 7 years. He \nis someone\n\n[[Page S1783]]\n\nwhom I have watched over the many years I have been here. He has a \nwonderful personality. He is someone who helps keep order in this \ninstitution, and his presence in the Senate is one that is calming. \nEveryone who knows him likes him. It just will not be the same without \nhim.\n  While I will miss him, I know he will be glad to spend more time with \nhis wife Jean Carolyn, as well as his children Mark and Mitchell and \ntheir granddaughter Nila.\n  We talked earlier in the day when I learned he was retiring, and I \nhave already spoken about what a fine gentleman he is. But here is one \nthing he and I joked about today. I was here handling the floor as I \ndid for Senator Daschle for many years, and there was this big crash. \nEveryone said: What has happened? What happened was Myron was rushing \naround doing the work he did, and he could not have done a better \npirouette if he been a ballerina. He flipped in the air and came \ncrashing down. Everybody thought something bad had happened, and Myron \njust got up, smiled, and walked away. He and I joked about that earlier \ntoday. I will always remember that. I asked Gary to find somebody on \nthe staff who was there when Myron fell, and no one remembered, but \nMyron and I remembered. So I went and talked to him myself.\n  Myron is leaving next week to go on a cruise to Cancun, Mexico, with \nhis wife and his granddaughter. I thank him on behalf of the entire \nSenate for his faithful service to our country and to the U.S. Senate. \nI wish him well in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/13/senate-section/article/S1783-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JANICE MILLER\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize one of my longest-\nserving and loyal staffers, Janice Miller. After more than a quarter of \na century in my Las Vegas office, Janice retired on February 22, 2013. \nShe has earned a happy and restful retirement from public service, but \nshe will be deeply missed.\n  Just six months after I had been elected to serve my first term in \nthe U.S. Senate, Janice joined my staff. A self-described cat lover, \nJanice soon came to be known for her laughter and her sharp wit. Along \nwith her no-nonsense attitude, she showed true compassion for the \ncountless Medicare and Social Security recipients she assisted \nthroughout her career.\n  Janice is a true Nevadan. She attended the Western High School in Las \nVegas, and then went to the University of Nevada, Reno. Although Las \nVegas is her home, she continues to be an avid Wolf Pack supporter. In \nher youth, Janice had a tremendous activist spirit. That was tapped \ninto by one of her mentors, my good friend and former chief of staff, \nRey Martinez. Rey taught Janice at Western High School, and he also \nintroduced her to politics, where she stayed until her recent \nretirement. Janice has always cared deeply about women's issues, \nranging from women's health care to access to education and equality in \nthe workplace.\n  Janice Miller, during the time she worked on my campaigns, was an \nall-star. Janice also had tremendous compassion for senior citizens who \nwere often struggling with Social Security issues. In the more than 25 \nyears that Janice was with me, she never lost her concern for the \nseniors who needed her help. She always went above and beyond, helping \nto develop invaluable resources for Nevada's seniors in need. She \nhelped to write the first ``Retiree Guide'' for my office. Thousands of \ncopies of this guide are still used as a catalog of information and \nresources for seniors in southern Nevada.\n  Janice developed a deep understanding of the medical field through \nher work and her continued outreach to the community. Cindy Lubiarz, \nvice president of business development at Care Meridian, credits Janice \nwith helping to facilitate the development of the CareMeridian \nPediatric Facility, the only free-standing, post-acute inpatient \npediatric facility in Nevada, which is set to open its doors later this \nyear.\n  While fighting to ensure that Nevadans in need got the benefits they \ndeserved, Janice also battled breast cancer. As a survivor, she serves \nas a source of strength for so many women who are facing the same \nchallenge. She took this role in her personal life as well as in her \nprofessional life. Her support has meant so much to Mary Liveratti, \nretired administrator for the Nevada Division of Aging and Disability \nServices, who is a breast cancer survivor herself. When Janice first \nlearned of Mary's diagnosis, she pulled her aside at a meeting to tell \nMary that she had also battled breast cancer and to offer Mary support \nand encouragement. When Mary talks about this incident, it brings her \nto tears because she knew she was not alone in her fight.\n  Janice's kind spirit, in-depth knowledge of Medicare and Social \nSecurity, and commitment to public service will be truly missed. I \nthank her for her tireless service, and wish her well in her \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/13/senate-section/article/S1783-2", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING LIEUTENANT VALERIE DELANEY\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

DONALD ZACHARIAS\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, Mississippi State University and \nmy State of Mississippi lost one of its most outstanding leaders with \nthe passing of Dr. Donald Zacharias on March 3 at the age of 77. Dr. \nZacharias served as the president of Mississippi State University from \n1985-1997. His name became synonymous with the highest qualities of \nleadership, vision, and humanity. He was blessed with gifts that \nenabled him to make important contributions to higher education \nthroughout the country.\n  I ask that a March 3, 2013 article from the Clarion-Ledger newspaper \ntitled ``Former MSU president Donald Zacharias' legacy one of \ntransformation,'' be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows.\n\n                [From the Clarion-Ledger, Mar. 3, 2013]\n\n  Former MSU President Donald Zacharias' Legacy One of Transformation\n\n                           (By Therese Apel)\n\n       Former Mississippi State University President Donald \n     Zacharias is being remembered among friends, family and MSU \n     faithful as a man with a vision for the university--and a man \n     who left a legacy of growth and progress at the school he \n     loved.\n       Zacharias, who led the Starkville university from 1985-97, \n     died Sunday of complications from multiple sclerosis after an \n     extended illness. He was 77.\n       ``He had an influence not just on MSU but on higher \n     education at large in Mississippi,'' said Sid Salter, \n     director of University Relations. ``He had some rather \n     tumultuous battles with the Legislature over funding higher \n     education. I think that's really where he could shine in his \n     ability and his willingness to fight for what he believed \n     in.''\n       Roy Ruby was vice president for student affairs when \n     Zacharias joined the MSU family and later was dean of the \n     College of Education and interim president of the university. \n     Until a year ago, when Zacharias was admitted to a nursing \n     home, the two were neighbors.\n       ``He was a man of solid integrity, and he was a man of his \n     word,'' said Ruby. ``He was a man who, in all aspects of his \n     life, tried to do right. He was a good family man, a good \n     citizen of the state, and an exemplary college \n     administrator.''\n       Current MSU President Mark Keenum said Zacharias was \n     someone he looked up to.\n       ``I counted him as a friend, a mentor and an inspiration. \n     Don Zacharias was a man of\n\n[[Page S1784]]\n\n     great courage and dignity--and he was one of the most \n     influential leaders in the history of Mississippi higher \n     education,'' Keenum said.\n       Salter said he and his late wife, Paula, who also had \n     multiple sclerosis, were friends with Zacharias and his wife \n     of 53 years, Tommie.\n       ``They took an interest in Paula, and, ironically, he would \n     later be diagnosed with MS,'' Salter said. ``He had a \n     tremendous impact on me. He was a solid guy and a man of \n     great integrity.''\n       Zacharias brought Mississippi State to a new level of \n     prominence during his 12\\1/2\\ years of service.\n       He raised MSU's visibility and reputation nationally, and \n     enrollment climbed to the largest in the state at almost \n     16,000. African-American enrollment more than doubled to \n     2,200, 15 percent of the student body and the highest \n     percentage among SEC schools, according to a Sunday news \n     release from the university.\n       Enrollment, private contributions, research and athletic \n     achievement all grew significantly as part of Zacharias' \n     legacy.\n       ``Dr. Donald Zacharias was a transformative figure at \n     Mississippi State University,'' Keenum said. ``He really \n     helped bring MSU into the modern era, and he did so by \n     developing a broad vision for the leadership that Mississippi \n     needed from a land grant university.''\n       Zacharias, upon his retirement from MSU, said: ``I saw \n     things in Mississippi State University that others might not \n     have seen. I felt that I had made the right decision to be at \n     this university because I liked both what it stood for and \n     its overall character. I liked its mission, and I liked the \n     students and alumni. I saw the potential.''\n       Gary Harris, a coach and educator at Heritage Academy in \n     Columbus who graduated from MSU in the early 1990s, said he \n     remembers Zacharias as someone who was able to connect with \n     everyone, regardless of their backgrounds.\n       ``Because of my involvement in several campus \n     organizations, I was around Dr. Z many times,'' he said. ``He \n     was a very kind, knowledgeable man who always seemed to know \n     how to make everyone in the room seem important. He was a \n     tremendous leader for our campus during some very difficult \n     financial times.''\n       Salter said many of Zacharias' dreams for the university \n     continue to be fulfilled.\n       ``He had a long reach, and his influence extended past his \n     own tenure as president.''\n       Funeral arrangements are incomplete, but the Zacharias \n     family will communicate details through the university. A \n     public memorial service is tentatively planned for Thursday \n     on the Starkville campus of MSU.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/13/senate-section/article/S1784-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JUDGE STEVEN ELLIOT\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Judge \nElliot as he retires from the bench having honorably served on Nevada's \nSecond Judicial District Court for 16 years. Judge Elliot's wisdom and \ntemperance has made him an extremely effective and admirable judge. His \ndistinguished career as an attorney, judge, and public servant in \nNevada is worthy of our appreciation.\n  After graduating from Stanford University and earning his juris \ndoctor from the University of Denver, Judge Elliot was first elected \nSparks City Attorney in 1979 and held that position until his election \nto the district court. While working as city attorney for Sparks, he \nfounded the Washoe County Domestic Violence Task Force and supported \nthe Washoe County DUI Task Force. Judge Elliot also crafted legislation \nrequiring land developers to dedicate water rights to local \ngovernments, saving taxpayer dollars.\n  In 1997, Judge Elliott assumed his position as district judge where \nhe was assigned in the family division and general jurisdiction dockets \nworking on civil and criminal cases. As chairman of the Employee \nRelations Committee, he led a year-long task force to revise the \nemployee manual. He also served on the Nevada Statewide Court Security \nTask Force to improve security for judges and the public in courthouses \nthroughout Nevada.\n  In addition to his responsibilities in the court, he has also been \nvery active in many community organizations. He has tirelessly worked \nto improve the life of Nevada's young people and abused and battered \nwomen, as well as promoted clean and safe communities in Nevada.

A bill to improve hydropower, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \naimed at increasing the production of our hardest working renewable \nresource, one that often gets overlooked in the clean energy debate--\nhydropower. The Hydropower Improvement Act of 2013 is a bipartisan bill \nco-sponsored by my colleagues Senators Wyden, Risch, Cantwell, Crapo, \nMurray, and Begich, true hydropower advocates. The Hydropower \nImprovement Act of 2013 seeks to increase substantially the capacity \nand generation of our clean, renewable hydropower resources that will \nimprove environmental quality and support local job creation and \neconomic investment across the nation.\n  There is no question that hydropower is, and must continue to be, \npart of our energy solution. It is the largest source of renewable \nelectricity in the United States. The approximately 100,000 megawatts \nof hydroelectric capacity we now have today provide about seven percent \nof the Nation's electricity needs. Hydro-electric generation is carbon-\nfree baseload power that allows us to avoid over 200 million metric \ntons of carbon emissions each year. Hydropower is clean, efficient, and \ninexpensive. Yet, despite its tremendous benefits I am constantly \namazed at how some undervalue this important resource.\n  Perhaps it's because conventional wisdom dismisses our Nation's \nhydropower capacity as tapped out. That is simply not the case. If \nanything, hydropower is really an underdeveloped resource--something we \ncertainly understand in my home State of Alaska where hydro already \nsupplies 24 percent of the State's electricity needs and over 200 \npromising sites for further hydropower development have been \nidentified. There is great potential for additional hydropower \ndevelopment in every state, not just Alaska.\n  According to the Department of Energy, conventional hydropower \nfacilities have the capacity to generate an additional 75,000 megawatts \nof power--a staggering amount of clean, inexpensive power. Now, that \ndoesn't seem possible until you realize that only three percent of the \ncountry's 80,000 existing dams are even electrified. Significant \namounts of new capacity--anywhere between 20,000 and 60,000 megawatts--\ncan be derived from simple efficiency improvements or capacity \nadditions at existing facilities. Additional hydropower can be captured \nin existing man-made conduits and hydroelectric pumped storage projects \ncan help reliably integrate other renewable resources that are \nintermittent, such as wind, onto our grid.\n  The Hydropower Improvement Act of 2013 seeks to multiply our nation's \nhydropower capacity in an effort to expand clean power generation and \ncreate domestic jobs. The bill provides the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission with the authority to extend preliminary permit terms and to \nexplore a possible 2-year licensing process for hydropower development \nat non-powered dams and closed loop pumped storage projects. The bill \nestablishes an expedited process for FERC to consider ``qualifying \nconduit'' hydropower facilities and increases the rated capacity for \nsmall hydro projects to 10 megawatts. The act also calls for the \nDepartment of Energy to conduct studies of the technical flexibility \nand grid reliability benefits that pumped storage facilities can \nprovide to support intermittent renewable energy, as well as on the \nrange of opportunities for conduit hydropower potential. Importantly, \nthe Hydropower Improvement Act of 2013 does not contain any spending \nauthorizations and therefore does not represent any new funding.\n  It is my hope that as the Senate considers our Nation's long-term \nenergy policy, we can finally recognize the important contribution the \nrenewable resource of hydropower makes, and will continue to make, \ntoward our clean energy goals. Our colleagues in the House have already \ndone so. The Hydropower Improve Act of 2013 is a companion piece to \nH.R. 267, the Hydropower Regulatory Efficiency Act of 2013 sponsored by \nRepresentatives McMorris-Rogers and DeGette. H.R. 267 recently passed \nthe House by a stunning 422-0 vote and is supported by both the \nNational Hydropower Association and American Rivers. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this hydropower legislation to \npromote the further development of our most cost-effective, clean \nenergy option.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Begich, Ms.\n\n[[Page S1788]]\n\n        Cantwell, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Merkley):\n  S. 551. A bill to provide an election to terminate certain capital \nconstruction funds without penalties; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a bill to reform \nthe Capital Construction Fund. This legislation would allow fishers to \nwithdraw monies from their CCF accounts without penalty or interest, \npreventing overfishing and overcapitalization.\n  The Capital Construction Fund, CCF, program was developed at a time \nwhen American fishers were having a hard time competing with highly \nefficient foreign fishing vessels. The program was designed to enable \nfishers to deposit a portion of their fishing-related earnings into a \nCCF account on a tax-deferred basis. Fishers then make withdrawals from \ntheir CCF account to construct, reconstruct, or under limited \ncircumstances, acquire fishing vessels. However, any unauthorized \nwithdrawal from CCF account is subject to severe interest and other \npenalties.\n  The program was a success. The CCF program helped U.S. fishers build \na modern state-of-the-art fleet. Unfortunately, that U.S. fleet is now \novercapitalized. This problem is exacerbated by concerns surrounding \noverfishing. Fisheries managers have begun to implement catch-share \nlimits to reduce the number of fish that they allow fishers to catch \neach year. Now, the U.S. commercial fishing fleet has more harvesting \ncapacity than our fisheries can sustainably support. However, the \nmonies fishers put into CCF accounts remain and represent a potential \nfor further overcapitalization. Yet, current CCF regulations penalize \nwithdrawals made for anything other than authorized expenditures.\n  The resulting situation is problematic for the fishers, the industry \nand the resource. That is why I am reintroducing legislation today, \nalong with my colleague Senator Murkowski, to address this problem and \nrelieve the pressure to increase further capitalization of the fishing \nfleet. My legislation will enable CCF accountholders to make a one-time \nwithdrawal from their CCF accounts. Accountholders would be required to \npay the taxes due on the monies withdrawn, but without having to pay \ntax penalties. An income-averaging formula would be applied to the \nwithdrawals in an effort to avoid assessing an excessive tax rate on \nthe one-time withdrawal. Any fisher taking advantage of one-time \nwithdrawal would then be required to close their CCF accounts and would \nbe prohibited from further participation in the program.\n  This is a win-win-win situation. The fisher gets to take the money \nout of his CCF without having to pay penalties and interest, but still \npays the taxes when due; the government gets taxes on the withdrawals; \nand the resource and the fishers who remain in the fishery avoid \nfurther capitalization of an already over-capitalized industry.\n  I look forward to working with Senators Murkowski, Murray, Cantwell, \nBegich and Merkley, the fishing community, and the bill's other \nsupporters to advance this legislation to the President's desk.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 551\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor an exclusion for assistance provided to participants in certain \nveterinary student loan repayment or forgiveness programs; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I rise today to \nreintroduce the Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program Enhancement \nAct with my friend, Senator Mike Crapo of Idaho. This bipartisan bill \nwould exempt Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program, VMLRP, awards \nfrom federal income taxation in order to increase veterinary services \nin areas around the country that lack adequate veterinary expertise.\n  Authorized in 2003 by the National Veterinary Medical Services Act, \nNVMSA, the United States Department of Agriculture's, USDA, Veterinary \nMedicine Loan Repayment Program serves a dual purpose in assisting \nqualified veterinarians in reducing their student debt while also \nalleviating veterinarian shortages in rural areas. Specifically, the \nprogram authorizes the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, \nNIFA, to repay up to $25,000 of a veterinarian's debt per year if they \nagree to serve in high-priority veterinary shortage areas for at least \n3 years. However, awards under the program continue to be taxed at a \nrate of 39 percent, effectively limiting the number of awards that can \nbe provided and delaying veterinary services to areas in desperate \nneed. The awards are taxed with the tax payments paid under the program \nby the federal government, and the tax payments themselves are also \ntaxed.\n  The Department of Agriculture determines whether an area is eligible \nfor assistance under the VMLRP through a ``shortage situation'' \ndeclaration process. Currently, two circumstances lead to such a \ndesignation. A geographic designation is made when a given geographic \narea suffers from a shortage of veterinarians overall and an area can \nalso be designated as a shortage area when it suffers from a shortage \nof veterinarians who practice in a particular field of veterinary \nspecialty. Currently, my home state of South Dakota has 6 designated \nshortage situations; three of them are statewide designations noting a \nshortage of practitioners in veterinary specialties. Moreover, the \nBureau of Labor Statistics estimates that employment of veterinarians \nwill grow by 36 percent by 2020, creating a need for 22,000 additional \nveterinarians. The future growth and increased demand for veterinarians \nbecomes even more pressing when considered in combination with national \nstatistics that show\n\n[[Page S1790]]\n\ndozens of counties across the country that have more than 25,000 food \nanimals but zero veterinarians.\n  Attaining a professional degree in a specialized and advanced field \nlike veterinary medicine takes more than academic fortitude and \npersonal dedication. According to the American Veterinary Medicine \nAssociation, the average VMLRP award recipient in Fiscal Year 2011 had \nan average eligible debt of over $100,000. Given the financial \nresources necessary to pursue a degree in higher education, I have long \nfought for this legislation to make it easier for students to pay off \ntheir loans. While South Dakota is truly a wonderful place to call \nhome, it is a difficult place for a young veterinarian to earn a living \nwhen saddled with 6 figures of school debt. My legislation will help by \nenhancing the assistance veterinary graduates receive in exchange for \nmeaningful public service while also providing important services to \nunderserved rural areas.\n  With an economic impact of $21.4 billion each year, according to the \nSouth Dakota Department of Agriculture, the importance of agriculture \nto the South Dakota economy cannot be understated. Our ranchers, many \nof whom operate in very rural areas, rely on the access they have to \nqualified veterinarians to care for their livestock and many of them \nmust drive long distances to access the nearest veterinarian that works \nwith their specific type of livestock. This lack of adequate access to \nveterinary services could have ramifications for both human and animal \nhealth, as well as animal welfare, disease surveillance, public safety \nand economic development. Farmers and ranchers make their living in \nagriculture but food security is fundamentally in all of our interests. \nEveryone in America benefits from the veterinary services provided in \neven the most remote areas of the country. As such, I am committed to \ndoing all I can to help bring veterinarians to underserved parts of our \nstate.\n  I am proud to have fought for the establishment of the VMLRP program \nand for securing funding for the program through my seat on the Senate \nAppropriations Committee. Unfortunately, the 39 percent tax that is \nassessed on these benefits continues diminish the full benefits of the \nprogram. With enactment of this legislation, for every three \nveterinarians selected for the loan repayment awards, an additional \nveterinarian could also be selected to serve in an underserved shortage \narea. Moreover, such an exemption is not without precedent. In 2004, \nCongress exempted from taxation the assistance received by participants \nin the National Health Services Corps, NHSC.\n  It should be noted that nearly 140 organizations from across the \nnation have announced their support for a tax exemption for VMLRP, \nincluding the South Dakota Veterinary Medical Association, South Dakota \nFarmers Union, South Dakota Farm Bureau, South Dakota Cattlemen's \nAssociation, South Dakota Stockgrowers Association, South Dakota \nCattlemen's Association, South Dakota Pork Producers Council, the \nAmerican Veterinary Medical Association, the American Farm Bureau \nFederation, the American Sheep Industry Association, the National \nFarmers Union, and many, many others.\n  The VMLRP has had proven success in providing our agricultural \nproducers with access to the veterinary services that they need to be \neffective. In fiscal year 2011, the program filled at least one \nshortage area in 35 States. Through the Veterinary Medicine Loan \nRepayment Program Enhancement Act, we can ensure that the program, and \nthe awards offered through it, is continued and strengthened for the \nbenefit of our students, rural communities, and family farms and \nranches.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nStatement of Support for the Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program \n                        Enhancement Act of 2013\n\n       The undersigned organizations offer our strongest support \n     for the Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program \n     Enhancement Act of 2013 championed by Senator Tim Johnson (D-\n     SD), Senator Michael Crapo (R-ID), and Representative Kurt \n     Schrader (D-OR-5).\n       Our organizations represent a broad spectrum of animal \n     agriculture from all across our great country. We are \n     concerned about the continued economic viability of America's \n     farmers, ranchers, and the businesses they own. We support \n     public policy that promotes vibrant rural communities. We are \n     livestock producers; processors; animal health and research \n     organizations; veterinary medical associations; and livestock \n     feed, pet food and animal drug companies. We represent \n     businesses that care deeply about animal health and animal \n     agriculture. Together we urge Congress to pass the Veterinary \n     Medicine Loan Repayment Program Enhancement Act without \n     delay.\n       The legislation provides a federal income tax exemption for \n     awards received under the Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment \n     Program (VMLRP) and similar state programs. The awards are \n     presently taxed at 39 percent.\n       Veterinary medicine loan repayment awards help qualified \n     veterinarians offset a portion of the educational debt in \n     return for practicing food animal medicine or veterinary \n     public health in federally designated high-priority \n     veterinary shortage situations. Congress set a precedent for \n     tax exemption in 2004 when it passed ``The American Jobs \n     Creation Act of 2004'' (H.R. 4520, P.L. 108-357) making the \n     National Health Service Corps (NHSC) loan repayment program \n     awards tax exempt. Prior to P.L. 108-357 the NHSC awards were \n     taxed at 39 percent.\n       VMLRP participants provide a wide array of veterinary \n     services for rancher's livestock (beef, dairy cows, turkeys, \n     chicken, swine, goats, sheep, farmed deer and elk, camelids, \n     and working farm horses) including accredited medical \n     procedures including vaccinations (i.e., Brucellosis official \n     calf-hood vaccination/RB51), castration and dehorning, \n     pregnancy detections, breeding soundness exams, and services \n     for acute illness, trauma, dystocia or obstetrical \n     difficulties. They provide required services for interstate \n     movement of livestock, including commuter agreements, animal \n     health testing requirements needed to ship livestock, \n     tuberculosis checks and blood sample services for \n     Brucellosis, Bluetongue, and Bovine Viral Diarrhea. They \n     perform duties for state and federal disease control and \n     eradication programs and play a role in a state's veterinary \n     emergency response teams. Veterinarians practicing in public \n     health provide regulatory oversight for critical programs and \n     activities protecting livestock and poultry populations from \n     catastrophic diseases of animal and public health importance. \n     They perform domestic and foreign animal disease surveillance \n     activities, epidemiological investigations, institute \n     mitigation measures for disease control and are active first \n     responders in the event of an animal disease outbreak or \n     incident that threatens animal or human health. Also, they \n     perform outreach and education contributing to animal disease \n     awareness for producers, veterinary practitioners and the \n     public.\n       By passing the Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program \n     Enhancement Act, Congress will bolster animal health and \n     welfare, protect the nation's food supply and ensure that \n     ranchers and farmers will have access to veterinary services \n     they need for their livestock.\n           Sincerely,\n\n\n   Livestock Producers, Processors, Packers and Related Organizations\n\n         American Horse Council;

A bill to amend the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 \nto require captioning and video description at certain movie theaters; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today marks the 25th anniversary of the \nappointment of Gallaudet University's first Deaf president, Dr. I. King \nJordan. This historic appointment, the product of the ``Deaf President \nNow'' student protests, was truly a catalyzing moment--a moment to \nestablish dignity--for the Deaf community. As President Jordan stated \nin his acceptance speech, the Deaf community would ``no longer accept \nlimits on what we can achieve.''\n  Deaf President Now was significant not only for the Deaf community, \nbut it also showed other Americans what Deaf individuals are capable \nof. We saw the rights of the Deaf community brought to the forefront. \nAnd the Deaf President Now movement, with the active involvement of the \nDeaf community, helped lead to passage of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act 2 years later, in 1990.\n  The Americans with Disabilities Act is one of the landmark civil \nrights laws of the 20th century--a long-overdue emancipation \nproclamation for Americans with disabilities. The ADA has played a huge \nrole in making our country more accessible, in raising the expectations \nof people with disabilities about what they can hope to achieve at work \nand in life, and in inspiring all of us to view disability issues \nthrough the lens of equality and opportunity.\n  Before the ADA, life was very different for folks with disabilities. \nBeing an American with a disability meant not being able to ride on a \nbus because there was no lift, not being able to attend a concert or \nballgame because there was no accessible seating, and not being able to \ncross the street in a wheelchair because there were no curb cuts. In \nshort, it meant not being able to work or participate in community \nlife. Discrimination was both commonplace and accepted.\n  Since then, we have seen amazing progress. The ADA literally \ntransformed the American landscape by requiring that architectural \nbarriers be removed and replaced with accessible features such as \nramps, lifts, curb cuts, widening doorways, and closed captioning. More \nimportantly, the ADA gave millions of Americans the opportunity to \nparticipate in their communities. We have made substantial progress in \nadvancing the four goals of the ADA--equality of opportunity, full \nparticipation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency.\n  But despite this progress, we still have more work to do. Although \nmost television and home videos contain captioning for individuals who \nare deaf or hard of hearing--or the rest of us--most movie theaters do \nnot. Thus millions of Americans who are deaf or hard of hearing are not \nable to attend a movie with their families or friends, at a time and \nlocation that they want, simply because captioning is not available. \nThe same is true for individuals who are blind or visually impaired; \nmost movie theaters do not provide access to video description \ntechnology, which would allow these individuals to have access to the \nkey elements of a motion picture by contemporaneous audio narrated \ndescriptions during the natural pauses in the audio portion of the \nprogramming, usually through headphones.\n  A similar problem occurs in airplanes, with respect to in-flight \nentertainment. Many airlines are now providing in-flight entertainment \nfor their passengers--but individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing \ncannot access it, because the overwhelming majority of this programming \ndoes not have captioning. Individuals who are blind or visually \nimpaired are similarly excluded, since video description is not \nprovided for such programming either.\n  So we have a situation where an individual, in his own home, can \nusually access captioning or similar technology on his television when \nwatching live television, or a television show, or a movie. Such \ncaptioning is often available in other venues, such as restaurants and \nsports bars. I do not believe that it would be difficult to provide the \nsame technology access for individuals with disabilities in movie \ntheaters or on airplanes. This would allow these Americans with \ndisabilities\n\n[[Page S1792]]\n\nto have the same access as everyone else.\n  Today I am introducing two bills. These bills will allow Americans \nwith visual or hearing impairments to enjoy going to the movies and \nwatching in-flight entertainment, through captioning and video \ndescription, just as they can at home.\n  The first S. 555, entitled the Captioning and Image Narration to \nEnhance Movie Accessibility, CINEMA, Act, would amend Title III of the \nADA to require movie theater complexes of two or more theaters to make \ncaptioning and video description available for all films at all \nshowings.\n  The second, S. 556, entitled the Air Carrier Access Amendments Act, \nwould require air carriers to make captioning and video description \navailable for visually-displayed entertainment programming--live \ntelevised events, recorded programming, and motion pictures--that is \navailable in-flight for passengers. In instances where the programming \nis only available through the use of an individual touchscreen or other \ncontact-sensitive controls, the bill would authorize the U.S. Access \nBoard to develop accessibility standards so that individuals with \ndisabilities can operate the displays independently.\n  I look forward to working with my fellow members to pass these two \nbills and ensure that individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, or \nwho are blind or visually impaired, can have the same access to movies \nand in-flight entertainment as other Americans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 555\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

and\n       Whereas an Arms Trade Treaty that has been signed by the \n     President and has received the advice and consent of the \n     Senate, is a non-self-executing treaty that has no domestic \n     legal effect within the United States, unless and until it \n     has been adopted by the enactment of implementing legislation \n     by the Congress: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the President should not sign the Arms Trade Treaty, \n     and that, if he transmits the treaty with his signature to \n     the Senate, the Senate should not ratify the Arms Trade \n     Treaty; and\n       (2) until the Arms Trade Treaty has been signed by the \n     President, received the advice and consent of the Senate, and \n     has been the subject of implementing legislation by Congress, \n     no Federal funds should be appropriated or authorized to \n     implement the Arms Trade Treaty, or any similar agreement, or \n     to conduct activities relevant to the Arms Trade Treaty, or \n     any similar agreement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/13/senate-section/article/S1794-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1794-S1795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 32.

(a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) United States officials reportedly took Suleiman Abu \n     Ghayth into custody on February 28, 2013.\n       (2) Abu Ghayth is the son-in-law of Osama Bin Laden and a \n     member of al Qaeda.\n       (3) From 2001 to 2002, Abu Ghayth allegedly served al \n     Qaeda, urged others to swear allegiance to Bin Laden, spoke \n     on behalf of and in support of al Qaeda's mission, warned \n     that attacks similar to those of September 11, 2001, would \n     continue, and actively supported al Qaeda's efforts to kill \n     Americans.\n       (4) On or about May 2001, Abu Ghayth allegedly urged \n     individuals at a guest house in Kandahar, Afghanistan, to \n     swear an oath of allegiance to Bin Laden.\n       (5) Members and associates of al Qaeda have executed a \n     number of terrorist attacks intended to kill Americans, \n     including the attacks on the United States on September 11, \n     2001, in New York, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, which killed \n     approximately 2,976 people.\n       (6) On the morning of September 12, 2001, Abu Ghayth \n     appearing with Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, served as a \n     spokesman for al Qaeda and warned the United States and its \n     allies that ``[a] great army is gathering against you'' and \n     called upon ``the nation of Islam'' to do battle against \n     ``the Jews, the Christians and the Americans''.\n       (7) After the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Abu \n     Ghayth gave a speech in which he warned that ``the storms \n     shall not stop, especially the Airplanes Storm'', and advised \n     Muslims, children, and opponents of the United States ``not \n     to board any aircraft and not to live in high rises''.\n       (8) In 2002, Abu Ghayth allegedly said ``al Qaeda has the \n     right to kill four million Americans, including one million \n     children, displace double that figure, and injure and cripple \n     hundreds and thousands''.\n       (9) In 2002, Abu Ghayth reportedly arranged to be smuggled \n     to Iran, where he was held under a loose form of house arrest \n     for several years.\n       (10) Abu Ghayth has been reportedly tied to the October 8, \n     2002, attack on United States Marines training on Faylaka \n     Island off the coast of Kuwait, which resulted in the death \n     of one American.\n       (11) Kuwait reportedly stripped Abu Ghayth of his \n     citizenship because of his role in recruiting Kuwaitis for al \n     Qaeda.\n       (12) Abu Ghayth is reportedly believed to have been in Iran \n     since his release in 2010.\n       (13) On or about March 1, 2013, Abu Ghayth was brought to \n     the United States to stand trial on terrorism charges in the \n     United States District Court for the Southern District of New \n     York.\n       (14) On March 8, 2013, Abu Ghayth pled not guilty to \n     terrorism charges.\n       (15) On September 14, 2001, in the wake of the terrorist \n     attacks on the United States, Congress passed the \n     Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107-40), \n     which the President signed on September 18, 2001.\n       (16) The Authorization for Use of Military Force authorizes \n     the President ``to use all necessary and appropriate force \n     against those nations, organizations, or persons he \n     determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the \n     terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or \n     harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent \n     any future acts of international terrorism against the United \n     States by such nations, organizations or persons''.\n       (17) Section 1021 of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 2012 (Public Law 112-81) affirms the \n     authority of the Armed Forces of the United States to detain \n     covered persons pursuant to the Authorization for Use of \n     Military Force.\n       (18) Section 1022 of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 2012 establishes a requirement, subject to a \n     case-by-case national security waiver by the President, for \n     military custody of foreign members of al Qaeda and \n     associated forces who participated in the course of planning \n     or carrying out an attack or attempted attack against the \n     United States and its coalition partners.\n       (19) Abu Ghayth is an enemy belligerent and meets the \n     definition of a covered person under section 1022 of the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012.\n       (20) Military custody for enemy belligerents, consistent \n     with United States and international law, provides the best \n     means to collect the intelligence that can prevent future \n     terrorist attacks and save American lives.\n       (21) Long-term law of war military detention affords the \n     opportunity for interrogators to return periodically over \n     subsequent months and years to gather additional information.\n       (22) It is this access to detainees in long-term law of war \n     custody that allowed the intelligence community to gather \n     information that helped ultimately locate Bin Laden.\n       (23) Members of al Qaeda, like Abu Ghayth, are not common \n     criminals. They are enemy belligerents at war with our \n     country. United States detention and interrogation policies \n     must distinguish between intelligence collection to prevent \n     terrorist attacks and standard criminal prosecutions.\n       (24) When the United States places enemy belligerents in \n     courts under Article III of the Constitution for trial, \n     grants them the legal rights normally reserved for common \n     criminals, and focuses on prosecution rather than \n     intelligence collection, the United States can miss valuable \n     information that will help keep our country safe.\n       (25) Al Qaeda affiliates throughout the world, such as al \n     Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and al Qaeda in the Islamic \n     Mahgreb, present a complex and growing threat to the United \n     States and its interests.\n       (26) United States forces continue to capture members of al \n     Qaeda and associated forces.\n       (27) The United States has a top-rate facility at Naval \n     Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, that allows for the secure and \n     humane detention and interrogation of foreign enemy \n     belligerents.\n       (28) On January 22, 2009, President Obama issued an \n     executive order to close the detention facility at Naval \n     Station Guantanamo Bay, yet Congress has prohibited the use \n     of funds to transfer detainees at Naval Station Guantanamo \n     Bay to the United States or to construct or modify facilities \n     in the United States to house detainees at Naval Station \n     Guantanamo Bay. Congress has also placed restrictions on the \n     ability to transfer detainees at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay \n     to foreign countries.\n       (29) On February 15, 2011, the Under Secretary of Defense \n     for Intelligence, Michael Vickers, said ``[t]he \n     administration is in the final stages of. . .establishing its \n     detention policy''.\n       (30) On April 7, 2011, General Carter Ham, the Commander of \n     the United States Africa Command responded to a question \n     about what he would do if we captured a member of al Qaeda in \n     Africa, by saying he would need ``some lawyerly help on \n     answering that one''.\n       (31) On June 28, 2011, the Commander of the United States \n     Special Operations Command, Admiral William McRaven, \n     testified that his options to detain foreign enemy \n     belligerents were to detain them temporarily on a ship, \n     transfer them to a third country, or ``if we can't do either \n     one of those, then we'll release that individual and that \n     becomes the--the unenviable option, but it is an option''.\n       (32) On March 6, 2012, approximately a year later, when \n     asked during a hearing of the Committee on Armed Services of \n     the Senate whether the administration has developed a \n     detention policy for enemy belligerents, Admiral McRaven \n     testified ``nothing has changed since then''.\n       (33) Approximately 28 percent of detainees who have been \n     released from Naval Station Guantanamo Bay have reengaged or \n     are suspected of having reengaged in terrorist activity.\n\n[[Page S1822]]\n\n       (34) Former detainees at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay have \n     conducted suicide bombings, recruited radicals, and trained \n     recruits to kill Americans and our allies.\n       (35) Said al Shihri and Abdul Zakir represent two examples \n     of former detainees at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay who \n     returned to the fight and assumed leadership positions in \n     terrorist organizations dedicated to killing Americans and \n     our allies.\n       (36) On November 29, 2012, in a 54 to 41 vote, the Senate \n     agreed to Senate Amendment 3245 to S. 3254, the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, which would \n     have permanently prohibited use of funds for the transfer or \n     release of detainees from Naval Station Guantanamo Bay into \n     the United States.\n       (37) As enacted, the National Defense Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 2013 (Public Law 112-239) prohibits for one year \n     the use of Department of Defense funds to transfer or release \n     detainees at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay to or within the \n     United States, its territories, or possessions.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate to--\n       (1) reaffirm that the United States remains at war with al \n     Qaeda and its associated forces;\n       (2) assert that when a member of al Qaeda or an associated \n     force is taken into custody, the focus should be on \n     intelligence collection and the prevention of future attacks \n     and not on prosecution;\n       (3) believe by bringing members of al Qaeda and its \n     associated forces into civilian custody, rather than military \n     detention, the United States inappropriately gives these \n     terrorists the rights afforded by the civilian system of \n     justice in the United States, including speedy presentment \n     and Miranda rights;\n       (4) believe no terrorists should ever hear ``you have the \n     right to remain silent'';\n       (5) believe that Abu Ghayth and other members of al Qaeda \n     or associated forces like him should be placed in military \n     custody and brought to Naval Station Guantanamo Bay for long-\n     term, interrogation, and, as appropriate, trial by military \n     commission, consistent with chapter 47A of title 10, United \n     States Code (as amended by the Military Commissions Act of \n     2009 (title XVIII of Public Law 111-84)); and\n       (6) call on the Obama Administration to work with Congress \n     to establish a coherent detention policy for the long-term \n     detention and interrogation of enemy belligerents, and the \n     potential trial by military commission of foreign enemy \n     belligerents, that will help collect intelligence, protect \n     our country, and prevent future attacks.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 85.
