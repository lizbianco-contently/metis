I, of course, welcome all Senators and our staff back from \nthe Thanksgiving recess. I am sure that, like me, people spent time \nwith their loved ones, some here and some at their homes around the \ncountry.\n  For many families across America, this Thanksgiving was particularly \nunique and special. Because of President Obama's recent Executive \nactions, many immigrant families celebrated their holiday together for \nthe first time without the threat of someone knocking on their door in \na police uniform.\n  These people now, instead of staying in the shadows, are having a \ngood time. Their holiday is not threatened to be ruined. All over \nAmerica they are openly giving thanks or blessings with family that \nthey haven't been able to enjoy in the past. Instead of looking over \ntheir shoulder, they joyously revel in the time they spent with their \nloved ones.\n  What President Obama did needed to be done.\n  The chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the presiding President pro \ntempore, spent days and weeks coming up with a very difficult piece of \nlegislation, comprehensive immigration reform. Amendments by the scores \nwere heard and debated. Republican amendments were adopted, Democratic \namendments were adopted, and that matter was brought to the Senate \nfloor where there was a good, genuine, long debate. On the floor, \namendments were offered, debated, and voted upon. We created a very \ngood bill based upon the work of the Judiciary Committee. It was \nbipartisan, and it was one that had an overwhelming vote on the Senate \nfloor.\n  This had to be done. It had to be done because we have all seen \nfirsthand our Nation's failing immigration system was tearing families \napart. Each day Senate offices all over America would receive pleas--I \ndid in Nevada--from loved ones who have fallen victim to our Nation's \nflawed immigration system.\n  I met with these people personally. I have talked with them on the \ntelephone, I have read their letters, I have seen their emails, and it \nis heartbreaking to listen and hear some of their stories, their \nexperiences. So I always try to do everything within the law to help, \nand sometimes we can help. Other times they cannot be helped within the \nconfines of the law, so they wind up very unhappy.\n  Early this year I was able to--for example, the experience that we \nhave all had--unite Edith Fawkes, a mother from Las Vegas, with her 12-\nyear-old son Brahyam. That was a festive occasion, it was touching, but \nit is all too rare. For every one family who is reunited, thousands and \nthousands of others have been decimated by deportations.\n  That is why the Executive action taken by the President is so very \nimportant. It helps mend our Nation's broken immigration system, gets \ncriminals off the streets, strengthens our border security, and spurs \nour economy. It spurs our economy. Underline and underscore that.\n  President Obama's action keeps families together. That is the most \nimportant thing. It allows parents with children who are U.S. citizens \nor green card holders to temporarily stay in our country, this country \nthey call their home. By acting, the President said mothers, fathers, \nsons, and daughters are no longer relegated to the shadows of American \nsociety.\n  The American community now knows there is a path forward. There \nreally is a way. President Obama took the first step. It is a good \nfirst step, but it is only a temporary solution.\n\n[[Page S6226]]\n\n  If I had my way, the President would have signed a comprehensive \nimmigration bill into law, one that came out of the Judiciary \nCommittee, instead of announcing Executive actions. But we could not \nsit idly by waiting for the Republicans to act while homes are broken \nup all over our country--and, frankly, their actions hurt our economy. \nThe President has taken the first step. I repeat, the first step. Now \nCongress must act to address all the issues in our broken immigration \nsystem.\n  The House Republicans can still and should pass the bipartisan \nimmigration bill that the Senate passed 520 days ago. In the meantime, \nI will keep fighting in Congress to pass comprehensive immigration \nreform that brings permanent long-term relief to our Nation.\n  We have done all we can in the Senate. We need to do more. I am \nbegging the House to do something. If they brought this bill to the \nfloor, it would pass overwhelmingly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/01/senate-section/article/S6226-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 AGENDA\n\n  Mr. REID.

I had a conversation today \nwith Senator Wyden.\n  We need to work on reauthorizing Defense authorization legislation. \nWe have a lot to do, and there isn't much time to accomplish it, so I \nurge all Senators to work hard and work in a timely and efficient \nfashion. We may have to be here the week before Christmas--and \nhopefully not into the Christmas holiday--but there are things we have \nto get done.\n  I talked to the Secretary of Energy today. He has seven nominations \nto fill. These are important positions in the Department of Energy--\nChief Financial Officer, head of the science division, fossil fuels--\nall of these important issues that these people deal with.

Mr. President, while the distinguished Senate leader is \nstill on the floor, I thank him for his comments on the immigration \nbill. I would note he was kind to talk about hundreds of hours. I may \nnot have spent that, but a whole lot of other Senators did--and that \nbill would not have been on the floor and would not have been voted on \nwithout the leadership of the Senator from Nevada. He made sure there \nwas a calendar, that there was time, and that he would keep the Senate \nin session while we had rollcall after rollcall. We had 136 amendments \nthat were adopted in committee, and more than a dozen were considered \non the floor. But we passed that bill by a 2-to-1 margin. The \nRepublicans and Democrats joined together, and I applaud the leader for \nwhat he did.\n  I would tell one short story. Not long after that I was in Oregon, \nnorth of Portland, and went to a farming area. I went to church on a \nSunday. My brother-in-law was saying the mass. He is fluent in Spanish. \nThere were hundreds and hundreds of workers--these are all taxpayers, \nhardworking people. They make the community and they make the economy \nof the area.\n  I was introduced at the end. They all stood, raised their hand, and \nasked blessings on me and on the Senate for what we had done because it \ngave them hope for themselves and their families.\n  As long as I live, I will remember that, and I would hope--knowing at \nthat time that we had enough votes, or enough votes to pass it in the \nHouse, I would call on the House leadership to do the right thing, \nallow it to come to a vote. Let Republicans and Democrats, everybody \nwho does speeches on immigration, let them do what Senator Reid had us \ndo in the Senate, actually vote yes or vote no. Let them do the same--\nvote yes or vote no, and let the blessing the people gave for us in the \nSenate also be a blessing for those in the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, through the Chair to the distinguished \nPresident pro tempore of the Senate, for me in Nevada it is very \nimportant in the State of Nevada because the State of Nevada is 10 or \n15 years behind the State of California as far as demographic changes. \nWe have the largest number of Hispanics and Asians in the State of \nNevada now. But my friend, the senior Senator from Vermont, basically \nhas very few minorities in the State of Vermont. He did this--led this \nbill--because it is the right thing to do.\n  The people of Vermont, I know, are very cognizant of their senior \nSenator. He has taken on issues during his time in the Senate not \nbecause necessarily they are important for the State of Vermont--which \nthey are, because anything that is good for the country is good for \nVermont--but he takes these issues on because it is certainly the right \nthing for the country. There is a long list of things he has done over \nthe years that have very little bearing on the State of Vermont but \nhave a tremendous bearing on this country. That is why he is the \ntremendous leader he is.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished majority leader.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Just before our August recess, this body passed S. Res. \n525.\n  I thank Senator Wyden, the vice chair of the Whistleblower Protection \nCaucus I am starting next year, for being an original cosponsor of the \nresolution.\n  S. Res. 525 recognized July 31 as National Whistleblower Appreciation \nDay. On that day way back in 1778, the Continental Congress passed the \nfirst whistleblower law in the United States. I would like to quote it:\n\n       Resolved,\n       That it is the duty of all persons in the service of the \n     United States . . . to give the earliest information to \n     Congress or other proper authority of any misconduct, frauds \n     or misdemeanors committed by any officers or persons in the \n     service of these states, which may come to their knowledge.\n\n  This resolution was passed by the Continental Congress in 1778 \nwithout a recorded dissent.\n  Then and now, Congress's control of the purse strings has given us an \nobligation to guard against wasteful and fraudulent spending.\n  On this past July 31, whistleblower groups met to honor some of our \ncolleagues on the Hill for their support of whistleblowers who report \nwaste or fraud. I was not able to be there because the House of \nRepresentatives Judiciary Committee held a hearing on oversight of the \nFalse Claims Act. I am always wary when I hear the biggest violators of \na law hire people to talk about ``strengthening'' the False Claims Act. \nSo at the House of Representatives, I had an opportunity to comment on \na chamber of commerce release of a report on the False Claims Act. It \nclaims the act ``plainly is not getting the job done'' since ``the \ngovernment has recovered only $35 billion since 1987.'' The current \nnumber as of\n\n[[Page S6227]]\n\ntoday is actually $42 billion that has been recovered under the False \nClaims Act of 1986, and that surely is nothing to sneeze at--at least \nwhere I come from it is not.\n  The fact is that since 1986 no other law on the books has been more \neffective in battling fraud. Before the 1986 amendments, the False \nClaims Act only brought in about $40 million a year. At that rate it \nwould have recovered only $1 billion in the past 25 years. So thanks to \nthe 1986 amendments, it brought back 42 times as much.\n  Clearly, I say to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the False Claims Act \nis working, and it is working fantastically. The chamber's report says \nthe law is ``ineffective at preventing fraud.'' Yet my staff have met \nwith some of the authors of that chamber report, and I have to say to \nyou that the chamber had no concrete proposals for preventing fraud \nmore effectively than the False Claims Act.\n  Now, the chamber people meeting with my staff talked about ``a gold-\nstandard compliance certification program,'' but to me and my staff it \nis just a pie-in-the-sky idea with no specifics. They told my staff, \n``We deliberately left this vague.'' So that is the problem. They lack \ndetails on who would create the program, who would enforce the program. \nBasically, they lacked details about everything. But they want this \nSenate to believe that once this pipe dream is in place, it will \nmagically increase the amount of taxpayer dollars the government \nrecovers.\n  In exchange, the report proposes hefty concessions for its big \ncorporate sponsors. For starters, they want to eliminate the use of \nexclusion or debarment. These happen to be some of the government's \nstrongest tools in deterring fraud. The chamber report would require \nwhistleblowers to report internally 180 days before any whistleblower \ncan file a False Claims Act suit. Yet, in most corporations, reporting \ninternally just puts a huge target on the back of the employee blowing \nthe whistle, just as it does on the back of a Federal whistleblower \nwithin the Federal bureaucracy. We should trust whistleblowers to use \ntheir common sense to know the safest place to report. Internal \nreporting and a 6-month head start on retaliation before the \nwhistleblower gets a chance to be heard in court is a recipe guaranteed \nto reduce disclosures of fraud.\n  I have long advocated companies developing strong internal compliance \nprograms, so I see nothing wrong with having those compliance programs. \nHowever, having one of these programs is not a reason to get a ``get \nout of jail free'' pass. I am skeptical that companies will self-report \nviolations. Certification of a compliance program will not turn up the \ncold hard facts on whether they do or do not self-report. Even when a \ncorporation does come forward, the company line is never going to be \nthe complete picture. That is why the False Claims Act incentivizes \nwhistleblowers, and, in fact, it has worked.\n  Further, some corporations have actually been using compliance \nprograms as a trap for muzzling whistleblowers. By making their \ncompliance program an arm of their legal department, anything a \nwhistleblower reports is protected as confidential information covered \nunder the attorney-client privilege. Many corporations also require \nemployees who provide tips to their compliance departments to then sign \nnondisclosure agreements. This has a major chilling effect on \nwhistleblowers contemplating filing a False Claims Act suit. \nWhistleblowers brave enough to file then find themselves the subject of \nlegal action claiming they have violated attorney-client privilege or \nnondisclosure agreements. Now, a very simple question: Is this how we \nought to treat whistleblowers?\n  This report's recommendations contradict its assertion that the False \nClaims Act has failed by not recovering enough money. The report \nproposes to limit government recoveries across the board, regardless of \nparticipation in any compliance certification program. That makes no \nsense.\n  In the last 5 years the Federal Government has grown larger and \nlarger and spending has gotten more and more out of control. The \nFederal Government now spends about $1 trillion in contracts and grants \neach year. Inspectors general, the Government Accountability Office, \nand congressional oversight committees simply have not been able to \nkeep up. Whistleblowers using the False Claims Act have played a very \nkey role in checking fraud and wasteful spending. Annual recoveries \nunder the False Claims Act have increased dramatically in just the past \n5 years. Last year the Justice Department recovered $2.6 billion in \njust health care fraud through the False Claims Act. The False Claims \nAct is clearly doing exactly what we intended it to do, and that is to \nrecover taxpayers' money being lost to fraud.\n\n  State attorneys general around the country have used State false \nclaims acts to successfully recover billions of dollars for their \nStates. I will give some examples.\n  Last October--that is, October of 2013--then-Virginia attorney \ngeneral Ken Cuccinelli recovered $37 million for the State of Virginia \nfrom a drug company that was inflating its prices to scam taxpayer \ndollars from Medicare. The next month, in 2013, Cuccinelli recovered \n$21 million in two health care fraud settlements with multinational \npharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson, which was paying millions of \ndollars in kickbacks to the Nation's largest pharmacy. Yet, just days \nbefore Cuccinelli announced the settlements, Health and Human Services \nSecretary Kathleen Sebelius also made an announcement. She revealed \nthat this administration did not intend to treat ObamaCare as a Federal \nhealth care program, exempting it from antikickback laws. Precisely \nbecause of the fraud opportunities under ObamaCare, one provision \nCongress added to the law made a violation of antikickback law an \nautomatic violation of the False Claims Act. This administration has \nchosen to ignore that part of ObamaCare.\n  Congress must step forward and reiterate that ObamaCare is no less \nsubject to the antikickback law and False Claims Act than other Federal \nhealth care programs. Congress should strongly consider strengthening \nthe False Claims Act's connection with suspension and debarment. That \nwould keep repeat offenders away from the taxpayer dollars they have \ndefrauded in the first place.\n  This issue, then, is really one about law and order. If we really \nwant to improve the False Claims Act--not go the direction of the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce--we should make a judgment or settlement under the \nlaw result in an automatic review for suspension or debarment. That \nwould capitalize on the success of the law while increasing its \ndeterrent effect.\n  The False Claims Act has already provided a crucial check during a \ntime of growing government and outofcontrol Federal spending. \nWhistleblowers have been the key to the government finding out about \nfraud when it happens. We have to do all we can to honor them for the \npatriotic service they provide to the taxpayers and protect them from \nthose who resist the role they play.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/01/senate-section/article/S6227-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6227-S6228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          COLORETTI NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I continue my objection to consideration \nof the nomination of Nani Coloretti to be the Deputy Secretary of the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development.\n  In keeping with my efforts to end secret holds, I have been very open \nabout the reason I put a hold on this nomination. The Obama \nadministration isn't giving me the same consideration.\n  In May, I found out about questionable hiring practices at the \nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network, known as FinCEN. FinCEN is an \nagency within the Treasury Department that collects and analyzes \nfinancial reports for law enforcement agencies to use in their money \nlaundering investigations.\n  FinCEN has been hiring additional personnel to beef up its \nenforcement division. The problem occurred when the agency posted the \njob requirements but then disqualified candidates for a criterion that \nwas never in the original job posting: a law degree.\n  This is illegal under Federal hiring guidelines.\n  I also learned that FinCEN rejected qualified veterans who applied \nfor the positions. Veterans' preference doesn't guarantee veterans a \njob but it does give them extra consideration for jobs for which they \nare qualified.\n  The unemployment rate for post-9/11 veterans is significantly higher \nthan\n\n[[Page S6228]]\n\nthe rate for the general population. These men and women are extremely \ncapable. They have an array of job skills to offer in the workplace.\n  It is inexcusable for FinCEN, or any other Federal agency, to reject \nqualified veterans who faithfully served our country.\n  The Office of Personnel Management already determined that the FinCEN \nhiring practices were illegal and referred the case to both the U.S. \nOffice of Special Counsel and the Treasury Department's Inspector \nGeneral. The investigations need to cover whether Treasury Department \nofficials knew about the hiring problems and did nothing until OPM \nforced their hand. And if FinCEN tried to game the system to \nshortchange our Nation's veterans Congress needs to know. In addition, \nwhoever is responsible must be held accountable.\n  To find out what happened, I requested all emails sent between the \nTreasury Department and FinCEN on this matter.\n  As the Treasury Assistant Secretary for Management, Ms. Coloretti \noversees the Treasury's human resources department and may have known \nabout the illegal hiring practices, or was at least in a position to \nknow. If she did, she certainly shouldn't be rewarded with a promotion. \nHowever, regardless of her involvement, the Treasury Department needs \nto come clean.\n  As I said earlier, I have requested emails from the Treasury \nDepartment to help me get to the bottom of this. So far, I have \nreceived four emails.\n  Instead of open transparency, the Obama administration is once again \nobstructing access to the information I need to conduct proper \ncongressional oversight.\n  The Treasury Department tried to convince me that no other relevant \nemails exist but I am not convinced. Their search was limited to only \nthe 8 months when the vacancy announcements were open. This excluded \nany email communications that took place in preparation for posting the \nannouncements or during 2014 when problems with the announcements were \nfound. That is unacceptable. So I will continue my objection to \nconsideration of Ms. Coloretti's nomination.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King).

Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Judge \nAudrey Evans, who will be retiring as United States Bankruptcy Judge \nfor the Eastern and Western Districts of Arkansas.\n  Judge Evans graduated Cum Laude from the University of Texas at \nAustin in 1967 and taught in public schools before eventually settling \nin Little Rock in 1975. Judge Evans became active in her community, \nincluding serving as a volunteer in Little Rock public schools and \nrepresenting the Little Rock School Board on the Pulaski County Board \nof Equalization.\n  In 1983, Judge Evans received her Juris Doctorate, with high honors, \nfrom the University of Arkansas at Little Rock School of Law where she \nwas Associate Editor of the UALR Law Journal. Judge Evans began her \nlegal career clerking for G. Thomas Eisele, then Chief Judge of the \nU.S. District Court, Eastern District of Arkansas. Prior to her \nappointment as bankruptcy judge, Judge Evans represented both debtors \nand creditors in private practice.\n  While in private practice, Judge Evans was an active member of the \nbar in many capacities. Notably, she was a member of the Arkansas Board \nof Law Examiners from 1995 until 2001, serving as Chairperson in 2001; \nand she was on the Board of the Volunteers' Organization for Central \nArkansas Legal Services, VOCALS, for 8 years, serving as chair from \n1993 to 1995.\n  Judge Evans was appointed to bankruptcy court in February of 2002 by \nPresident George W. Bush, and served as Chief Judge from 2003-2009. As \na bankruptcy judge, Judge Evans is best known for her courtesy and \npatience as well as her respect for the law and pursuit of justice. \nAnyone appearing before Judge Evans felt they had a just, fair, and \nfull opportunity to be heard.\n  Judge Evans continued her service to the bar regularly speaking at \nbankruptcy conferences in Arkansas, Memphis, and throughout the Eighth \nCircuit. She was the Education Chair for the Eighth Circuit Bankruptcy \nJudges Conference, and served as President of the Central Arkansas \nDebtor-Creditor Bar Association from 2006-2007. She is a Fellow of the \nAmerican College of Bankruptcy and an active member in the William R. \nOverton Inn of Court.\n  Judge Evans has been supported in her work by her husband, Don, their \ntwo sons, and five grandchildren. It is with great pleasure today that \nI rise to recognize and honor her service to Arkansas and to the \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/01/senate-section/article/S6231-2", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO DON BAKER\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I wish to honor Don Baker, who \nwill retire as the Pike County Judge after 17 years of honorable \nservice to the citizens of Arkansas in this elected position.\n  As Pike County Judge, Don can be credited with building 16 steel and \nconcrete bridges in the county, adding to and upgrading the road and \nlandfill equipment, paving and improving many miles of Pike County \nroads, and organizing the Intermodal Authority for Pike, Montgomery, \nClark, and Dallas Counties. In addition to his county judge duties, Don \nalso served as a member of the board of West Central Planning and \nDevelopment District and president of the Upper Southwest Solid Waste \nLandfill District.\n  Public service has always been an important part of Don's life. After \ngraduating from the University of Arkansas in 1963 and teaching school \nin Mt. Ida, Don worked to extend credit to local farmers, owned a \nGlenwood grocery business, and served as a member on the Glenwood \nChamber of Commerce, was a charter member of the Glenwood Lion's Club \nand served for 9 years on the Glenwood School Board. In addition, he \nwas active in the Glenwood industrial development and taught Sunday \nschool at Bethel Missionary Baptist Church.\n  Don Baker has displayed dedication, commitment, and an eagerness to \nserve his community we can all admire. My staff and I have enjoyed \nworking with Judge Baker on the projects important to Pike County. I am \ntruly grateful for his years of honorable service and dedication to \nPike County and the State of Arkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/01/senate-section/article/S6231-3", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. THOMAS TRUHE\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing my friend, Dr. Thomas Truhe, a generous supporter of the \narts who was recently honored with a Golden Palm Star on the Palm \nSprings Walk of Stars in recognition of his many contributions to the \ncivic and cultural life of his hometown.\n  This prestigious honor is well deserved. For more than 6 years, Tom \nTruhe has served tirelessly as chair of the Palm Springs Museum's \nAnnenberg Theater Council, ATC, which supports the museum through an \ninnovative program of music and theatrical performances. The ATC's busy \nseason includes an Opening Night Gala, a major fundraiser for the \nmuseum; the ``performance series,'' featuring outstanding Broadway \nartists; and the tremendously popular Cabaret 88, a series of nine \nsold-out shows with top musical talents. Tom introduced the Cabaret 88 \nconcept and is responsible for every aspect of its production, from \nselecting the talent and overseeing promotion to securing sponsors for \neach show.\n  In addition to his involvement with the Palm Springs Museum, Tom \ngives generously of his time and energy to numerous other area \norganizations and charities. He is a volunteer for ``One Night Only,'' \nMichael Childers' annual gala concert benefitting Jewish Family Service \nof the Desert, and he served on the event committee for a recent \nluncheon honoring Mr. Childers for his contributions to JFS. As a \ndedicated patron of the arts, Tom also makes a point of attending \ntheatrical productions, concerts, local performances, and other \ncharitable events in the community.\n  On November 16, 2014, Tom Truhe's Gold Palm Star was dedicated and \nMayor Stephen Pougnet officially proclaimed the date to be Dr. Thomas \nTruhe Day in the City of Palm Springs. As his friend and Coachella \nValley neighbor, I am pleased to join in honoring Tom Truhe for his \noutstanding service to the community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/01/senate-section/article/S6231-4", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6231-S6232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RECOGNIZING THE CENTER FOR CLOSING THE HEALTH GAP\n\n Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I attended a Martin Luther King, Jr. \nevent in Cleveland on a cold, snowy day earlier this year. The keynote \nspeaker said something that we have all heard, but so often do not \nthink about. He said, ``Your life expectancy is connected to your zip \ncode.''\n  Whether you grew up in a city like Cincinnati, a suburb like \nKettering, or in rural Appalachia, your zip code often determines \nwhether you have access to quality health care, great education, and \nthe social support necessary to succeed.\n  Ohio is fortunate to have many organizations, like the Center for \nClosing the Health Gap in Cincinnati, working to create zip codes where \nevery resident has the opportunity to succeed.\n  For the past 10 years, The Center for Closing the Health Gap under \nthe leadership of Dwight Tillery has worked to address health \ndisparities across Southwest Ohio through private-public partnerships. \nTheir work is invaluable in the Queen City, as we know health \ndisparities take both a moral and economic toll on our communities.\n  Today, more than 1.8 million Ohioans live in poverty and almost one \nin six families do not know where their next meal will come from. We \nalso know that the end of the school year does not mean an end to \nhunger.\n  That is why the work of nonprofits like The Center for Closing the \nHealth Gap and programs like the Summer Food Service Program are so \nimportant. They work together to ensure that Ohio families know about \nthese programs and ensure our students have enough food to keep growing \nand learning long after the final school bell rings for summer \nvacation.\n  As we work together to address child hunger and nutrition, we are \nalso working to eradicate infant mortality. Ohio ranks 48th in the \nnation for infant mortality, and we are the worst State for the \nsurvival of African American babies.\n  Each year, there are more than 4,600 sudden unexpected infant deaths, \nand there is no known cause for as many as half of the 25,000 \nstillbirths in this country.\n  No parent should ever have to grieve the loss of a child with no \nanswers and no help.\n\n[[Page S6232]]\n\n  My Sudden Unexpected Death Data Enhancement and Awareness Act would \nfill in the gap in how infant deaths are tracked by the Federal \nGovernment so that we can better understand and prevent these \ntragedies.\n  We can begin to address the disparities facing our communities--and \nour economies--by working together on the local, State, and federal \nlevels. Ohio is fortunate to have organizations like The Center for \nClosing the Health Gap working to make sure that all Ohioans have a \nchance to lead healthy, successful lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/01/senate-section/article/S6232-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SA-TECH'S 25TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Mr. Timothy \nJ. Adams, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Systems \nApplication & Technologies, Inc., SA-TECH, and all SA-TECH employees on \nthe firm's 25th anniversary. Since 1994, SA-TECH has been based in \nMaryland and has grown to be one of the largest privately held, \nminority-owned businesses in the Nation. Mr. Adams and each of the more \nthan 400 full-time employees at SA-TECH deserve recognition for their \nvaluable contributions supporting Department of Defense missions and \nthe Maryland community.\n  Twenty-five years ago, Mr. Adams founded SA-TECH in Oxnard, CA and \nthen moved the headquarters to Largo, MD in 1994. SA-TECH's services \noriginally focused on the high technology and technical support domain \nfor the Department of Defense, but have since evolved into other areas \nincluding program management, operations & maintenance, security, and \nlogistics support services. The company has grown from two employees at \none California location to more than 400 full time employees in more \nthan 20 domestic and international locations. SA-TECH is an example of \na successful minority-owned business and has been rightfully recognized \nas one of Maryland's Top 50 Diversity Owned Businesses and a Top 100 \nBlack Enterprise Industrial/Services Black Businesses in the Nation, \nand has received many other recognitions including the Prince George's \nBlack Chamber of Commerce Exemplary Business Recognition Award.\n  Over the past few years, I have toured my home State on a ``Made in \nMaryland Tour'' to visit Maryland businesses and highlight the diverse \nproducts and services being produced in our great State. The tour is \nalso designed to celebrate the hardworking Marylanders who make these \nproducts and provide the services, and the companies who provide those \njobs in our local communities. One common thread running throughout all \nof these successful businesses has been the business and business \nleaders' willingness to give back to their local community. SA-TECH is \nno exception. Under Mr. Adam's leadership, SA-TECH has grown to be a \ntrue community partner, supporting Department of Defense facilities and \nthe Maryland community at large. SA-TECH has worked with other partners \nto renovate the Maryland Room at Joint Base Andrews Malcolm Grow \nMedical Center for wounded servicemembers returning from deployment, \nbuild a Family Room at Joint Base Andrews' passenger terminal, and \nprovide academic scholarships to the top graduates of the United States \nAir Force's Airman Leadership School for enlisted personnel. In Mr. \nAdams' personal life as the former Chairman of the Board of the Bowie \nState University Foundation, he worked with the board to increase the \nendowment of the student scholarship fund to surpass $5,000,000. These \nscholarships play a key role in retaining economically disadvantaged \nBowie State students and ensuring that Bowie State maintains the \nhighest retention rate among Maryland's Historically Black Colleges and \nUniversities.\n  In closing, I am proud of this Maryland company, which provides good \npaying, full time work in service of our Nation's military mission and \nthe Maryland community. I offer my best wishes for the continued \nsuccess of SA-TECH, Mr. Adams, and all of SA-TECH's employees.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/01/senate-section/article/S6232-2", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO MAJOR LEWIS G. SORVILLO\n\n Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Maj. \nLewis Sorvillo for his exemplary dedication to duty and service to the \nU.S. Air Force and to the United States of America. Major Sorvillo \nspent the last year serving in my office as a congressional defense \nfellow, and it is my distinct pleasure to congratulate him as he \nconcludes an exemplary tour of duty in the Senate.\n  Major Sorvillo was born in Youngstown, OH. He enlisted in the Air \nForce in 1994 as a motor vehicle operator, ultimately advancing as a \nnoncommissioned officer and aide on the Vice President's military \nstaff. After his White House service across two presidential \nadministrations, Major Sorvillo earned his commission in 2002 as a \ndistinguished graduate of the Air Force Officer Training School at \nMaxwell Air Force Base, AL. For his superior performance at OTS, Major \nSorvillo was awarded the Top Hawk Award as his squadron's No. 1 \ngraduate.\n  Major Sorvillo subsequently qualified as a communications officer and \nwas assigned to Patrick Air Force Base, FL, in support of the 45th \nSpace Wing's mission of delivering assured space launch for the Nation. \nWhile at Patrick AFB, Major Sorvillo again distinguished himself by \nleading the Air Force Space Command's top information assurance unit of \nthe year. He subsequently served at Goodfellow Air Force Base, TX, \nwhere he was responsible for the critical communication infrastructure \nnecessary to train the Air Force's next generation of intelligence, \nsurveillance, and reconnaissance professionals.\n  From Goodfellow AFB Major Sorvillo joined the command staff of the \nU.S. Air Forces in Europe. As a senior officer in the USAFE \ncommunications directorate's plans and policy branch and subsequently \nforce management branch, he played an instrumental role in the \nmanpower, training, utilization, and readiness of 130 cyber operations \nofficers at 42 locations throughout 10 countries.\n  Across his two decades of service, Major Sorvillo has deployed to \nBosnia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, and just concluded his second tour \nto Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom prior to \njoining my Senate staff. From June 2012 to May 2013, Major Sorvillo \nserved as the principal adviser to the Afghan Ministry of Interior, \nDeputy Director of Information, Communication, and Technology, and led \na team of military, civilian, and contract advisers in the development \nof enduring, nationwide systems and processes critical to the long-term \nsustainment of communication capabilities for the Afghan National \nPolice. For his meritorious service, Major Sorvillo was awarded a \nBronze Star Medal.\n  Over the past year, Major Sorvillo has distinguished himself among \nhis fellowship peers as a leader in the Senate. From his legislative \ncontributions supporting my role on the Senate Armed Services Committee \nto his dedication to constituent services, Major Sorvillo deftly \napplied his military expertise to elevate the performance of my \npersonal office. He exemplifies the Air Force core values of integrity, \nservice, and excellence, and I am deeply grateful for his significant \ncontributions this year.\n  It is my great pleasure to congratulate Major Sorvillo, his wife Amy, \nand their three children, Jessica, Brandon, and Ivy, as they leave the \nSenate and continue to serve our great Nation. I wish them the very \nbest of luck.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/01/senate-section/article/S6232-3", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6232-S6233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n               Enrolled Bills and Joint Resolution Signed\n\n  Under the order of the Senate of January 3, 2013, the Secretary of \nthe Senate, on November 21, 2014, during the adjournment of the Senate, \nreceived a message from the House of Representatives announcing that \nthe Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Thornberry) had signed the following \nenrolled bills and joint resolution:\n\n       H.R. 4067.

Res. 592\n\n       Whereas the Montagnards, sometimes referred to as ``Dega'', \n     are the indigenous tribespeople living in Vietnam's Central \n     Highlands region;\n       Whereas the Montagnards were driven into the mountains by \n     invading Vietnamese and Cambodians in the 9th century;\n       Whereas French Roman Catholic missionaries converted many \n     of the Montagnards in the 19th century and American \n     Protestant missionaries subsequently converted many to \n     various Protestant sects;\n       Whereas, during the 1960s, the United States Mission in \n     Saigon, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and United \n     States Army Special Forces, also known as the Green Berets, \n     trained the Montagnards in unconventional warfare;\n       Whereas an estimated 61,000 Montagnards, out of an \n     estimated population of 1,000,000, fought alongside the \n     United States and the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) \n     forces against the North Vietnamese Army and the Viet Cong;\n       Whereas the Central Intelligence Agency, United States \n     Special Forces, and the Montagnards cooperated on the Village \n     Defense Program, a forerunner to the War's Strategic Hamlet \n     Program and estimated 43,000 Montagnards were organized into \n     ``Civilian Irregular Defense Groups'' (CIDGs) to provide \n     protection for the areas around the CIDGs' operational bases;\n       Whereas, at its peak, the CIDGs had approximately 50 \n     operational bases, with each base containing a contingent of \n     two United States Army officers and ten enlisted men, and an \n     ARVN unit of the same size, and each base trained 200 to 700 \n     Montagnards, or ``strikers'';\n       Whereas another 18,000 Montagnards were reportedly enlisted \n     into mobile strike forces, and various historical accounts \n     describe a strong bond between the United States Special \n     Forces and the Montagnards, in contrast to Vietnamese Special \n     Forces and ARVN troops;\n       Whereas the lives of thousands of members of the United \n     States Armed Forces were saved as a result of the heroic \n     actions of the Montagnards, who fought loyally and bravely \n     alongside United States Special Forces in the Vietnam War;\n       Whereas, after the fall of the Republic of Vietnam in 1975, \n     thousands of Montagnards fled across the border into Cambodia \n     to escape persecution;\n       Whereas the Government of the reunified Vietnamese nation, \n     renamed the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, deeply distrusted \n     the Montagnards who had sided with the United States and ARVN \n     forces, and subjected them to imprisonment and various forms \n     of discrimination and oppression after the Vietnam War ended;\n       Whereas, after the Vietnam War, the United States \n     Government resettled large numbers of Montagnards, mostly in \n     North Carolina, and an estimated several thousand Montagnards \n     currently reside in North Carolina, which is the largest \n     population of Montagnards residing outside of Vietnam;\n       Whereas the Socialist Republic of Vietnam currently remains \n     a one-party state, ruled and controlled by the Communist \n     Party of Vietnam (CPV), which continues to restrict freedom \n     of religion, movement, land and property rights, and \n     political expression;\n       Whereas officials of the Government of Vietnam have forced \n     Montagnards to publicly denounce their religion, arrested and \n     imprisoned Montagnards who organized public demonstrations, \n     and mistreated Montagnards in detention;\n       Whereas the Government of Vietnam's restrictions on \n     foreigners' access to the Central Highlands region complicate \n     accurate reporting of human rights violations against the \n     Montagnards, including the hundreds of Montagnards who have \n     reportedly been imprisoned since 2001 and Montagnards who \n     have fled to Thailand seeking asylum in a third country;\n       Whereas some Montagnard Americans have complained that \n     Vietnamese authorities either have prevented them from \n     visiting Vietnam or have subjected them to interrogation upon \n     re-entering the country on visits;\n       Whereas the Department of State's 2013 Country Reports on \n     Human Rights Practices and 2013 International Religious \n     Freedom Report reference the mistreatment of Montagnards as \n     an example of the detention of ethnic minorities in Vietnam \n     and references reports from followers of the unsanctioned \n     Church of Christ that local authorities in the Central \n     Highlands provinces had harassed and persecuted them;\n       Whereas, in March 2014, the Unrepresented Nations and \n     Peoples Organization (UNPO) submitted an alternative report \n     to the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social, and \n     Cultural Rights summarizing the alleged violations of the \n     economic, social, and cultural rights of Vietnam's \n     Montagnard, Hmong, and Khmer Krom;\n       Whereas the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization \n     report states that the Government of Vietnam has denied \n     Montagnards of their right of self-determination; imposed \n     discriminatory policies; curtailed religious freedom; impeded \n     access to an adequate standard of living; limited access to \n     health care and education; infringed on the Montagnards' \n     cultural rights; and, in two recent cases, arrested and \n     imprisoned Montagnards purportedly for their religious \n     beliefs;\n       Whereas the United States Commission on International \n     Religious Freedom's 2014 Annual Report states that the \n     Government of Vietnam controls all religious activities \n     through law and administrative oversight, severely restricts \n     independent religious practice, and represses individuals and \n     religious groups it views as challenging its authority, \n     including independent Protestant house churches in the \n     Central and Northwest Highlands; and\n       Whereas the United States Commission on International \n     Religious Freedom recommends that Vietnam be designated as a \n     Country of Particular Concern (CPC) and that access to \n     Priority 1 refugee resettlement authority should be increased \n     for individuals from Vietnam facing a well-founded fear of \n     persecution: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the contributions of the Montagnards who \n     fought loyally and bravely with United States Armed Forces \n     during the\n\n[[Page S6236]]\n\n     Vietnam War and who continue to suffer persecution in Vietnam \n     as a result of this relationship;\n       (2) condemns actions taken by the Government of Vietnam to \n     suppress basic human rights and civil liberties for all its \n     citizens;\n       (3) urges the Government of Vietnam to allow human rights \n     groups access to all regions of the country and to end \n     restrictions of basic human rights, including the freedom of \n     religion, land and property rights, freedom of movement, and \n     access to an adequate standard of living; and\n       (4) urges the President and Congress to develop policies \n     that support Montagnards and other marginalized ethnic \n     minority and indigenous populations such as the Khmer Krom \n     and the Hmong in Vietnam and reflect United States interests \n     and commitment to upholding human rights and democracy \n     abroad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url":
