Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 368, S. \n2262, which is the Shaheen-Portman energy efficiency legislation.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 368, S. 2262, a bill to \n     promote energy savings in residential buildings and industry, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the \nRepublican leader, the time until 11 a.m. will be equally divided and \ncontrolled between the two leaders or their designees.\n  At 11 o'clock this morning there will be a cloture vote on the motion \nto proceed to the energy efficiency bill.\n  The Senate will recess, as we do on virtually every Tuesday, from \n12:30 p.m. to 2:15 p.m. for our weekly caucus meetings. I would advise \nall Senators that at 2:15 p.m. today we will do our congressional photo \nthat we do every 2 years. So I hope everyone will make sure they are \nhere on time so we have everyone in the photo.\n  Additionally, there will be a Members-only briefing, a closed \nbriefing, tonight at 5:30 regarding Ukraine. I hope everyone would come \nto that. There are some things going on in Ukraine we should all know \nabout.\n\n\n                           Slippery Progress\n\n  Mr. President, being from Nevada and having traveled the State, as I \nhave, in rural Nevada, we have rodeos. I have been to a few rural \nrodeos in my life. They are always a lot of fun, and it is a unique \nform of entertainment. It is good for everybody, for families.\n  One of the things a number of these rodeos have around the country \nare greased-pig contests. For all those who do not know what a greased-\npig contest is, here is what it is: The organizers get a little pig--a \npiglet--and they cover this little animal with tons of grease. It is a \ngreasy little pig. Then they turn the kids loose. They invite these \nchildren to chase one of these pigs. Pigs are a little slippery to \nbegin with, but if you cover them with grease, they are really \nslippery.\n  These kids run around the arena trying to grab this pig. They grab it \nand fall. They have a great time. The children run as fast as they can. \nSome of them get smart and do not run so fast. They wait until the pig \nturns around--and they do a lot of times. But they try to scoop up this \nscurrying pig. It is really quite a spectacle, and it is a lot of fun \nto watch. There is no pain to the pig. It is kind of a painless ordeal \nfor the pig. But it is a lot of fun, as I said.\n  It is obvious what happens every time they grab the pig. They slip. \nThe pig goes on about its business, running. They fall into the dirt. \nThey come out covered with grease and dirt. But eventually--\neventually--one of these kids will wind up with the pig. Sometimes two \nkids grab the pig. They understand what happens, and they put the pig \nin one of their arms, and someone comes and takes the pig. But they \nhave a good time.\n  The vast majority of the kids never touch the pig. They go away \nemptyhanded, for sure. And that is regardless of how hard they try.\n  The reason I mention this, ofttimes working with my Senate Republican \ncolleagues, it reminds me of chasing one of these little pigs in a \ngreased-pig contest. Regardless of all of our efforts, anytime we get \nclose to making progress, it seems as though we watch it slip out of \nour hands and the Republicans scamper away.\n  Take, for example, the legislation that is currently before the \nSenate--the Shaheen-Portman energy efficiency bill. This bill has \nbipartisan support. We tried to do the bill a year ago. Frankly, at \nthat time the bill was good, but not nearly as good as it is now. It is \na very substantive piece of legislation.\n  From the time last year to today, the committee--under the direction, \nthen, of Senator Wyden, who was chair of the committee, working with \nall the members on that committee--put other things in the bill, and \nthe bill that is now before the Senate is much stronger than it was a \nyear ago.\n\n[[Page S2682]]\n\n  This legislation will make our country more energy independent and \nprotect our environment. It will spur the use of energy efficiency \ntechnologies in private homes and commercial buildings, at no cost to \ntaxpayers. It is an energy efficiency bill, and it has bipartisan \nsupport.\n  This legislation will make our country more energy independent and \nprotect our environment. It will also save consumers and taxpayers \nmoney, and lots of it. It will do it by lowering their energy bills, \nsaving about $16 billion a year--that is what they tell us--and it will \ncreate up to 200,000 jobs that cannot be exported.\n\n  I have commended a number of times--and I will do it again--Senators \nShaheen and Portman for their persistence in bringing this bill to the \nfloor. This is a fine piece of legislation. But it seems, for the \nsecond time within a year, passage of this bipartisan legislation is in \nquestion because Senate Republicans keep changing their requests. This \ntime around the minority party seems intent on a repeat performance of \nlast year.\n  Remember last year. The same thing. We want this; we want this. But \nthe clincher we were told was that--last year--they would not vote on \nthe bill unless we brought a bill sponsored by the Senator from \nLouisiana--the name was not Landrieu; it would be the junior Senator \nfrom Louisiana--saying: I demand a vote, before we do this legislation, \non doing away with the health insurance Senate staff have. Can you \nimagine that. But that was his demand, and it is his demand again. He \ncalled to tell me that.\n  In order to allow us to vote on this bill, I was told before the \nbreak that the Republicans wanted a vote on Keystone--a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution. I thought about it, and I came back to them before \nthe recess and said: OK, we will do that. We come back after the break, \nand they come to me and say: Well, we have changed our mind. What we \nwant now is a straight up-or-down vote on the legislation. That is not \nthe agreement we had. But, anyway, I said: OK, we will do that.\n  Well, now we are told that there are up to five amendments they want. \nAnd yesterday--last evening--I was told there is another one I never \nheard of. This is something about geothermal, but the extent of it I do \nnot understand. But it is always something else.\n  We have these new provisions that have been added to the bill to make \nthis legislation even stronger than last year.\n  To add further to the absurdity of what we are doing here, again the \njunior Senator from Louisiana wants a vote on taking away health care \nfor our staffs. I said to him: But why would you do that? He said: \nWell, the higher paid employees, they can probably afford to get it \nthemselves. I am paraphrasing because I remember the telephone \nconversation. He said--no, I am sorry; here it is--the lower waged \nsalaried employees in the Senate, they will get subsidies--a lot of \nthem. I said: What about those who do not? He said: They could buy \ntheir own insurance.\n  These men and women who work in the Senate work very hard. They \nshould be treated as other employees around the country. Their employer \nshould help them with their insurance. But it appears as if it is a \nvirtual reenactment of last September. It seems as though this is \nnothing but a game of diversion and obstruction to many Senate \nRepublicans.\n  But it is not a game. Every time a group of Republicans feigns \ninterest in bipartisanship, only to scramble away at the last moment, \nit is part of a calculated political scheme.\n  We know on the very night of President Obama's first inauguration, a \ngroup of Republican political consultants--there is some dispute as to \nwho called the meeting, whether it was Frank Lutz or Karl Rove, but a \nmeeting was held--gathered, the Republicans gathered, to discuss their \nplans for regaining power after President Obama won the election.\n  They devised a plan to oppose all legislation and all nominees in \norder to make President Obama and Democrats look ineffective--to make \nour country, I assume, look more ineffective. But their No. 1 goal was \nto make sure President Obama was not reelected.\n  They failed with that, but they have not failed at obstructing, \nfilibustering, and stopping the legislative process. Instead of working \nwith us to pass meaningful legislation that helps American families, \nRepublican leadership has shown more interest in agreeing to nothing. \nSo as Senate Republicans continue to play hard to get with Democrats \nwho are working in good faith, the American people's frustration grows.\n  This bill presents a unique opportunity for all my Republican \ncolleagues--a chance to work with us in crafting and passing bipartisan \nlegislation that will help the country.\n  I and my 54 Democratic colleagues have been flexible throughout this \nprocess, and we hope to reach an agreement that gives both sides most \nof what they want. But time is running out on this good piece of \nlegislation--running out again.\n  So I invite all of my Republican colleagues to work with us in good \nfaith. Help us pass a bill which creates jobs, saves money, and puts \nour country on the track to energy independence.\n\n\n                   Recognition Of The Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker). The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have the floor.\n  Please go ahead.\n\n\n                           Energy Amendments\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me briefly make a few observations \nabout some of the majority leader's opening comments this morning.\n  As he knows full well, Senator Vitter dropped his request for an \nObamaCare amendment days ago, before the weekend. I think it is \nimportant for everybody to understand, the minority in the Senate has \nhad eight votes since July--eight votes since July--on amendments that \nwe wished to vote on.\n  We have not had a fulsome energy debate in the Senate since 2007--7 \nyears ago. What we are asking for here is four or five amendments \nrelated to the subject of energy--one of the biggest issues in our \ncountry. That is hardly obstructionism. It is laughable to suggest that \nit is obstructionism for the minority to be given four or five \namendments on issues related to the underlying bill, particularly since \nwe have only had eight amendment votes on amendments that we wanted to \nvote on since last July, and we have not had a fulsome, broad-ranging \nenergy debate since 2007.\n  So I would say to my friend, the majority leader, I do not think \nthere is anything at all unreasonable about what we are requesting. Far \nfrom obstructionism, it is about time we had a debate on energy. We are \nhaving an energy boom in this country. It is important to our \nconstituents all across the land. Forty-five Republicans represent \nmillions of Americans. We wish to have a chance to have our voices \nheard occasionally. Eight amendments for the minority since July? This \nis not the way the Senate ought to be run.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Responding to my friend, the reason we haven't had debates \nin the Senate on legislation is because Republicans won't let us get on \nbills.\n  Let's take the bill that we are talking about today. Could we step \nback just a minute and try to do something that is good for the \ncountry? Shaheen-Portman is a good bill for America from last year to \nthis year.\n  My friend can say all he wants about the junior Senator from \nLouisiana. Everyone knows what he has done on legislation in the past. \nHe called me and told me that we weren't going to move forward on this \nbill unless he got a vote--what I just talked about. But from the last \ntime we did this bill, these are the amendments that are incorporated \nin this bill: Collins-Mark Udall on energy efficient schools; Bennet-\nAyotte, Better Buildings; Franken amendment to require Federally leased \nbuildings to benchmark energy use data; Mark Udall-Risch, amendment to \npromote energy efficiency in data centers; Whitehouse-Collins--every \none of these bipartisan--on low-income housing retrofits; Landrieu-\nWicker amendment on Energy STAR third-party testing; Landrieu-Wicker-\nPryor amendment on Federal green buildings; Hoeven-Pryor amendment on \nwater heaters; Hoeven-Manchin and Isakson-Bennet amendments on energy \nefficiency in Federal and residential buildings; and the Sessions-Pryor \namendment on third-party testing.\n  Last month Shaheen and Portman introduced a new version of their bill\n\n[[Page S2683]]\n\nincorporating all of these changes. The bill has 14 cosponsors, seven \non each side. It is sponsored on the Republican side by Senators \nPortman, Ayotte, Collins, Hoeven, Isakson, Murkowski, and Wicker; and \non the Democratic side by Senators Shaheen, Bennet, Coons, Franken, \nLandrieu, Manchin, and Warner.\n  It will be hard to find a more bipartisan, consensus piece of \nlegislation. All of all of this is a bipartisan piece of legislation, \nbut always it is a shell game. OK, we have got it here. I am trying to \nfigure out where I put that shell. Is it here? Where is that dollar? Is \nit here?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will yield in just 1 second.\n  This is what I talked about earlier. We have been going 5 years with \nthis--5 years--trying to stop anything Obama wants to do. Obama would \nlike to see this passed and so would a bipartisan group of Senators. \nBut for 5 years we have put up with this. It doesn't matter what it is. \nIf Obama wants it, they are against it.\n  We can have all this sweet talk about how the Senate shall operate. \nThe Senate shall operate by allowing legislation to go forward. This is \na perfect example but, no, no--I have told them, if they want a vote on \nKeystone, they have a vote on Keystone. That is not good enough for \nthem. They add four or five other amendments.\n  It is never quite enough. So we can see what is going to happen. They \nare going to let us on the bill today, and they are going to say: \nBecause we don't get our amendments, we are not going to vote to get \noff the bill.\n  It has happened time and time again. We waste hours on this.\n  With all this happy talk about how the Senate should operate--\nremember, we changed the rules. Why did we do that? Because we had \nscores of judges that we had to wait for them to give us permission to \nmove to.\n  We changed the rules. We don't in any way apologize to anybody for \nhaving changed the rules.\n  This is where we are. Legislation is at a standstill, and we have on \nthe books now 140 nominations that are held up. They have held \neverybody up. We get a few here and a few there.\n  But the one thing I can't hold up any more are judges. We are moving \non the judges. We are going to get the judges done.\n  If they want to continue blocking ambassadors--we have the Secretary \nof State, the former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, who is going to Angola. We don't have an ambassador there. \nWe don't have an ambassador to Peru. In scores of countries we don't \nhave an American representative there.\n  There are some political appointments. We can talk about those \nseparately. Every President has political appointments, but I am not \npushing this. What I am pushing is the fact that we have these career \nForeign Service officers who have waited an entire lifetime. They have \nworked in these countries in very difficult situations. They have been \npolitical officers, they have been economic officers, and now they get \na chance to be an ambassador. It is like going to the Super Bowl in the \ndiplomacy world, and they are not going to get that.\n  I think that the American people understand what is going on. That is \nwhy, as a result of polls we have seen, people understand the game the \nRepublicans have played for 5 years. The people are going to have to \ndecide this November as to whether they want another 2 years of \nobstruction as we have seen it.\n  This is good legislative policy. The Shaheen-Portman bill would be \ngood for the country, but as usual we have a lot that is good for the \ncountry--and we have had it. We don't get much done in the Senate.\n  Give us some amendments. This is what they say every time because no \nmatter what we do, it is not good enough.\n  Shaheen-Portman is a good bill. We have 10 new provisions in it. That \nis not good enough.\n  We can give them a vote on Keystone--that is not good enough, and \nthat is the way it always is. So there are no surprises to me in what \nthey have done today and what they will probably do on Wednesday or \nThursday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. My friend the majority leader wandered rather far \nafield. The subject for today is whether it would be inappropriate at \n10:20 a.m. on a Tuesday for the minority to have four or five \namendments of its choosing, sometime during the course of the week.\n  It is great that some amendments have been accepted by Members on my \nside. I am happy about that. The majority picked the ones they were \nwilling to accept and accepted them. I think that is great.\n  But what about the rest of the Members of the minority, who are not \nsuggesting that we would drop unusual amendments or amendments on an \nentirely different subject--four or five amendments during the course \nof the week, with relatively short time agreements, related to the \nsubject of energy.\n  It strikes me that is simply not unacceptable. We have had eight \nvotes on amendments of our choosing since last July--eight. This is not \nthe way to run the Senate.\n  The minority represents a lot of Americans, millions and millions of \nAmericans. We are entitled to have our ideas debated and voted on in \nthe Senate as well, ones that we want to vote on, not ones that the \nmajority leader picks for us.\n  That is the point. We don't think what we are asking is in any way \nunreasonable. It is certainly consistent with the traditions of the \nSenate, particularly since we have only had 8 votes on amendments of \nour choosing in the last 7 or 8 months. I mean, goodness gracious. \nThere is a way to finish this bill. It does enjoy broad bipartisan \nsupport.\n  The majority leader mentioned the President. I don't know that his \nname has come up in connection with this. We are simply asking for the \nopportunity to debate and vote on important energy amendments on an \nenergy bill during the pendency of the week. That is all we are asking.\n  I wish to go on. I understand later the majority leader is going to \ndo some procedural matters, so let me go on and make my opening \nstatement.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Later today we expect the President to talk about the weather at the \nWhite House. Presumably, he will use the platform to renew his call for \na national energy tax, and I am sure he will get loud cheers from \nliberal elites, from the kinds of people who leave a giant carbon \nfootprint and then lecture everybody else about low-flow toilets.\n  But the vast majority of middle-class Kentuckians I represent \nactually have to worry about paying utility bills, putting food on \ntable, and finding a job in this terrible economy. They are less \ninterested in just doing something on energy. They want to do the smart \nthing.\n  What they want are practical solutions to the problems and stresses \nthey are dealing with every single day. That is what we should be \nfocusing on this week because this debate shouldn't be about \nalleviating the guilt complexes of the liberal elite. It should be \nabout actually achieving the best outcome for the environment, for \nenergy security and, most importantly, for the people we were sent here \nto represent.\n  One thing that seems clear is this. Even if we were to enact the \nkinds of national energy regulations the President seems to want so \nbadly, it would be unlikely to meaningfully impact global emissions \nanyway unless other major industrial nations do the same. That means \ngetting countries such as China and India on board.\n  The President knows that. The President also knows that much of the \npain of imposing such regulations would be borne by our own middle \nclass.\n  That is why this discussion has become so cynical, and it is part of \nthe reason the President's own party couldn't even pass a national \nenergy tax when it had complete control of Washington's Congress back \nin 2009 and 2010. If the American people weren't willing to go along \nwith considerable domestic pain for negligible global gain then, it is \nfoolish to think they would assent to a bad idea now.\n  Remember, even the President's own party in the Senate wouldn't bring \nup the President's proposal for a national energy tax despite their \novernight speeches and complaints about everyone else.\n\n[[Page S2684]]\n\n  Of course, none of this has stopped the President from trying to get \nhis way anyway. That is why we have seen this administration's attempt \nto do an end run around the legislative process to try to impose a \nsimilar agenda through executive fiat.\n  It needs to be stopped. The President's regulations are hurting \npeople, often people who are already struggling and vulnerable--the \nvery people the President claims he wants to help.\n  Our constituents are being hurt because of a cynical political \nagenda, because of a war on coal and other sources off American energy \nthat the far left like and the Democratic Party is simply demanding.\n  The middle class doesn't even have a meaningful say in this \ndiscussion because the President has decided the Congress the people \nelect doesn't really matter anymore. Republicans are trying to change \nthat this week.\n  We have asked the majority leader to allow votes on energy amendments \nthat would let our constituents have a say for once. My constituents in \nKentucky should be able to weigh in on an EPA rule that would \nnegatively impact existing and future coal plants. Kentuckians deserve \na real say on ongoing regulatory efforts to tie up mining permits and \nthe red tape that is stifling the creation of good jobs in coal \ncountry.\n  Our constituents should finally be truly heard on the Keystone \nPipeline they overwhelmingly support. The American people deserve a \nreal debate on how we can best tap our own extraordinary natural \nresources to achieve energy independence at home and how we can help \nour allies overseas through increased exports of American energy.\n  These are the proposals we should be voting on this very week, \nproposals that can help our economy, boost the middle class and jobs \nwhile strengthening our national security and lessening our dependence \non foreign sources of energy.\n  But we can't move forward if the Democrats who run the Senate keep \ntrying to protect the President at the expense of serving their \nconstituents. We know they are getting pressure from the White House to \nshut down a real debate on energy. One of the President's aides \nyesterday made it clear that it will be leaning on Democratic Senators \nto ``get the right outcome.''\n  In other words, this is to do the White House's political bidding and \nto once again ensure that struggling middle-class Americans get the \nshort end of the stick from the Democrats here in Washington.\n  The American middle class is hurting, absolutely hurting. By a 2 to 1 \nmargin Americans say the country's economic conditions are poor. Only \nabout one-quarter say there are enough jobs available where they live, \nand they have been suffering from years of spiking electricity prices \nthat would only get worse if the President's agenda were fully \nrealized.\n  These are the people who deserve our attention. They are the ones who \nare struggling, not the far left, not the activists who yell the \nloudest and appear to care the least about who their ideas actually \nhurt, and not the President's political fixtures in the White House. \nThese are not the people on whom we should be focusing.\n  It is time--way past time--to start paying attention to the people \nwho actually sent us to the Senate. They deserve a robust debate about \nhow to develop policies that can actually lead to lower utility bills \nthat can put coal families back to work, that can help create well-\npaying jobs, that can help increase energy security, and that can help \nprevent energy from being used as a tool of war and oppression by \nglobal adversaries.\n  That is why we were sent to the Senate to debate these kinds of \nthings.\n  If Democrats have good ideas on energy too, this is the time to share \ntheirs.\n  What is wrong with having amendments from both sides on this bill. We \nwant to hear everybody's serious ideas.\n  The American people have waited 7 long years, as I said earlier, for \na serious energy debate in the Democratic-run Senate--7 years. It is \nabout time they got it, and this is the perfect week to do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. To belittle the President of the United States for wanting \nto talk about climate change is pretty obviously wrong. One can \nmischaracterize all they want the fact that President Obama recognizes \nclimate is changing worldwide, but it is truly a mischaracterization if \nanyone thinks this is not something that is serious.\n\n  It always appears when we get into a serious debate about a subject, \nwhether it is energy efficiency or climate change, the Republicans want \nto change the subject, to divert or to obstruct. So what is the \nRepublican answer to this climate change, which is real: more oil \nproduction--that is one of their solutions--block regulations to \nprotect health and the environment, deny climate change is happening at \nall.\n  The senior Senator from Oklahoma says it is a hoax. It is not a hoax. \nIt is real, and I am very happy the President is saying something about \nthis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/06/senate-section/article/S2684-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF INDIRA TALWANI TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE \n                       DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I note on the floor the presence of \nSenators Moran, Cornyn, and Warren. May I enter into a consent \nagreement as to the sequence of speaking? I ask unanimous consent that \nafter I have spoken, Senator Warren be recognized next on the \nDemocratic side, and I ask which Republican Senator would like to be \nincluded and in what order?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, responding to the question of the \ndistinguished majority whip, through the Chair, it would help if we \ncould alternate between sides, if that is acceptable.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is agreed. Who would be first on the Republican side?\n  Mr. CORNYN. My understanding is Senator Moran would be first. Then we \nwould go to the Democratic side and then back to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I was going to ask for a specific time for \neach, but I am going to try to be brief and yield more time for \ncomments from others because I am sure time will be expiring.\n  The issue we are trying to move to is called the Energy Savings and \nIndustrial Competitiveness Act. Whenever we talk about energy and the \nenvironment, the Senate is up for grabs. There is a divided opinion as \nto what to do with the energy policy of America. There are sincere and \nprofound differences between the two political parties. We recently had \nan all-night session talking about the issue of global warming and \nclimate change and there was a real division between Democrats and \nRepublicans about this issue.\n  I had a statement early in the session, and I come to the floor and \nrenew it today in the hopes one of my two friends on the other side of \nthe aisle can respond to this. My statement is this: The only major \npolitical party in the world that denies the existence of global \nwarming and climate change is the Republican Party of the United States \nof America. I am waiting for some Republican to come forward and refute \nme. Someone said there is a small party in Australia that doesn't \naccept global warming and climate change. That may be true, but I am \nlooking for evidence of another major political party, other than the \nRepublican Party of the United States of America, which denies the fact \nthat our human activity on Earth and the pollution we are creating is \nchanging the world in which we are living.\n  I think there is ample evidence. Incidentally, 98 percent of the \nscientists\n\n[[Page S2686]]\n\nwho look at it conclude the same--that we are going through climate \nchange in this world. Look around. Glaciers are melting, the weather is \nchanging, we have more extreme weather events, and our planet is \nheating up. Some people say: That is just an act of God. It happens \nevery few centuries. That is the way it goes.\n  I don't think so. I think what we are doing on Earth has something to \ndo with it.\n  This debate could go on all day and there would be severe differences \nof opinion on each side of the aisle as to whether what I have said is \ntrue, but here is something we should not disagree on--the pending \nlegislation. This bipartisan piece of legislation steps aside from that \nhot issue--no pun intended--and asks if we can't all agree that energy \nefficiency is good. Well, sure. Whether one thinks there is an \nenvironmental impact of using energy or not, it costs less if you have \nenergy efficiency to heat a home or run a business.\n  What we are trying to do, thanks to the leadership of Senator Shaheen \nof New Hampshire and Senator Portman of Ohio, Democrat and Republican, \nis to have a bipartisan approach to it. What they have done is amazing. \nThey took a bill, which frankly was supposed to come up last year and \nfailed because of some problems on the floor, and made it even better \nand stronger and more bipartisan, with a long series of bipartisan \namendments added to the bill to make it better in terms of trying to \nencourage energy efficiency in the buildings across America, \nmanufacturing new techniques for energy efficiency, and requiring the \nFederal Government, when it builds a building, to think about energy \nefficiency.\n  All of these are bipartisan in nature. Yet we are tied up in knots on \nthe floor of the Senate as to whether we can even consider this \nbipartisan bill. That is a shame because, quite honestly, when we have \na good bipartisan measure on an issue such as energy efficiency, which \nsteps aside from underlying controversial issues, we should move on it. \nI worry about that. There are some on the other side who say: We don't \nhave enough amendments. There are more we want to add. There is more we \nwant to debate. There is nothing wrong with that, but let us not \nsacrifice this bill this time.\n  What is at stake with this bill? It is not just the good ideas of \nenergy efficiency but 190,000 jobs in America. When we start putting in \nbetter windows in buildings, when we start putting in better HVAC \nsystems, and all the other things that are going to create energy \nefficiency, it puts Americans to work. If the Republicans stop us from \nmoving to this bill today, if they stop us from considering this bill \nthis week, it will be at the expense of American jobs. That is wrong.\n  Now that we have a bipartisan bill, and a strong bill, for goodness' \nsake, let us put the procedural fights aside. There is a Republican \nSenator who stopped this bill last week from coming up because he wants \nto debate--are you ready--ObamaCare. Fifty times the House of \nRepresentatives has voted to repeal ObamaCare. It is going nowhere. Yet \nthey continue to come back to it. So this Senator said we can't take up \nenergy efficiency because he wants to debate one aspect of ObamaCare \nagain.\n  Please, save it for another day. Let us do something in a bipartisan \nfashion that can guarantee 190,000 people in America a good-paying job.\n  Wouldn't that be something we can talk about when we come home at the \nend of the week instead of the fact that the Senate once again broke \ndown into a partisan squabble.\n  I urge my colleagues on the other side, save some of these really \ngreat and not-so-great ideas for another day. Let's pass this bill. It \nis strong, it is bipartisan, and it really tries to get something done \nin the Senate, which, sadly, is a rare occurrence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                               VA Backlog\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, there is no group of Americans whom I hold \nin higher regard than our Nation's veterans. Their service and \nsacrifice have allowed us to live in the strongest, freest, greatest \ncountry in the world.\n  American veterans have fought tyrants and terrorists to keep our \ncountry safe and secure. Yet even after they return from war, veterans \ntoday continue to fight tough battles here at home. Many veterans find \nthemselves struggling to find a job, they face difficulties accessing \nquality health care services--especially in rural areas such as mine at \nhome in Kansas--and all too many veterans must wait long periods of \ntime for benefit claims to be processed by the VA.\n  As of April 2014 the backlog stood at 596,061 outstanding claims, and \n53 percent of those have been waiting longer than 125 days for an \nanswer from the VA. It takes approximately 266 days for most new claims \nto receive an answer.\n  If a veteran is unhappy with the outcome of their claim, they can \nfile an appeal. The backlog for appeals is more than 272,000--in \nbacklogs alone. Some have waited more than 1,500 days--more than 4 \nyears--to get a response on their appeal.\n  These numbers represent real people. They are not just statistics. \nThey are not just average, everyday Americans. They are our veterans \nwhom we claim we hold in the highest regard and esteem.\n  Americans who served our country are waiting to receive the benefits \nthey earned. At a time when more and more troops are transitioning out \nof the military--and the needs are clear for our aging veterans--I am \nespecially concerned that we are not keeping our promise to those who \nserved our country.\n  As I travel across Kansas and meet veterans in their communities \nacross our State, I hear the stories about their VA claims process--\nfrom systemic issues with the back-and-forth of how the claims are \nhandled, to absurd waiting times in Washington. I hear from veterans \norganizations that come from Kansas--the American Legion, Disabled \nVeterans of America, Concerned Veterans of America, and Veterans of \nForeign Wars--and they bring their stories of other veterans to me, \noutlining the problems the veterans back home are facing. The reality \nis that our veterans are losing hope that the VA will care for them.\n  Americans recently heard the story about a whistleblower in Phoenix, \nAZ, at the VA in which there was a secret waiting list of veterans who \nhad waited more than 7 months to see a doctor in order to avoid VA \npolicies on reporting extended delays. The VA hospital figured out how \nto hide those claims for 7 months so that they weren't reported.\n  Incidents of mismanagement and even death caused by the failures of \nthe VA are far more numerous than we see in the news. Reports continue \nto pop up across the country, from Atlanta to Memphis, from St. Louis \nto Florida. The claims backlog, medical malpractice, mismanagement of \ncases, lack of oversight, and unethical environment all contribute to \nthe VA's failure.\n  It has become abundantly clear that the dysfunction within the VA \nextends from the top to the bottom--at the highest headquarters and at \neach VISN and down to the local level in some medical facilities. \nCommunity-based outpatient clinics and regional benefit offices are \npart of the problem. The VA suffers from a culture that accepts \nmediocrity, leaving too many veterans without the care they need. Our \nveterans deserve better, and they deserve the best our Nation knows how \nto offer.\n  I highlight today the broken VA system and challenge the Department \nof Veterans Affairs to change. We need accountability and \ntransformation within the VA system and its culture, top to bottom, all \nacross the country. We must break the cycle of dysfunction today and \ntake the steps necessary to make certain our veterans are no longer \nvictims of their own government's bureaucracy.\n  Here are some examples from across our State:\n  Jack Cobos, a Kansan who sought medical attention at the Topeka VA \nhospital emergency room, is told his chest pains are related to muscles \naround his heart. He is sent home. A week later he returns and is \ntransported to another emergency room. Ultimately, Jack dies of a heart \nattack--he never recovers--and we now pay tribute to that veteran who \nfailed to receive the care he needed in a timely fashion.\n  One year later the same Topeka emergency room closed its doors to\n\n[[Page S2687]]\n\nveterans seeking emergency treatment. And I am still waiting on a \nresponse from the VA to explain the closure of an emergency room at the \nVA hospital in Topeka, KS.\n  An outpatient clinic in Liberal has been without a primary care \nprovider for more than 3 years. While others try to fill in the gap, \nthere is nothing to date that the VA has done to solve the underlying \nproblems. There is still no primary care provider.\n  I recently spoke about claims backlogs with a Kansas veteran involved \nin the American Legion named Dave Thomas from Leavenworth. He has \nwaited since he filed his claim in 1970 and only this past year \nreceived an answer. He received a 90-percent disability rating from the \nVA, but it took 44 years for him to receive that answer.\n  A veteran with Parkinson's disease was told recently--he filed his \nclaim in March of last year. He was told this past week that it will \nnow be processed only because his claim is now over a year old. You \nhave to wait a year before you are in line in order for you to receive \nthe process of your claim that you deserved more than 1 year ago. How \ncan the VA establish a wait time benchmark of 1 year for veterans' \nclaims to get the attention they deserve?\n  It is so disappointing to hear these stories. I know it is \nunacceptable. Whether a veteran served in 1941, 1951, 1971, 1991, 2001, \n2011, or is currently serving, we owe the Nation's veterans our \nabsolute best after their military service is complete. Unfortunately, \nthe VA system continues on a glidepath of dysfunction and is only, at \nbest, playing defense.\n  The VA's failure is not a matter of resources. That is always the \neasy answer: more money. But just last week President Obama himself \nsaid:\n\n       We've resourced the Veterans Affairs office more in terms \n     of increases than any other department or agency in my \n     government.\n\n  VA funding levels have increased well more than 60 percent since \n2009. Each year there have been incremental increases of 3, 4, or 5 \npercent, and this year the request from the President's budget is for a \n6.5-percent increase over last year's spending. Yet our veterans \ncontinue to struggle and are not getting the treatment they earned and \ndeserve, and they are not getting their benefits.\n  Republicans and Democrats have agreed on fully funding the VA to \nserve year after year, but this increase in spending results in no \nbetter service from the Department. To date, these increases have not \nin any way increased the service or support our veterans deserve and \nneed. This is a problem with leadership and a lack of will to change.\n  I have been a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee for 18 years, \nboth in the House and Senate. I chaired the Health Subcommittee in the \nHouse. I have worked with nine VA Secretaries. This is an issue on \nwhich I always thought we were making progress. Today it is so \ndisappointing to report to my colleagues in the Senate that this \nDepartment is dysfunctional, and the services get worse, not better.\n  We need accountability at the VA. The 44-year-old claims process of \nDave Thomas and the untimely passing of Jack Cobos should not be \nforgotten, and the Department needs to make meaningful changes so that \nthese cases and cases like these will never happen again.\n  While we continue to push legislative action, it is time to hold \npeople accountable in order to enforce meaningful change. GAO reports, \ninspector general reports, and VA whistleblowers all call for action. A \nlist I find now of eight press and IG reports--from CNN, to FOX News, \nto military.com, to our IG, to the Washington Examiner--all report what \nwe would not believe could ever happen within the VA in the United \nStates of America.\n  Veterans are waiting for action. Yet the VA continues to operate in \nthe same old bureaucratic fashion, settling for mediocrity and \ncontinued disservice to our Nation's heroes.\n  It is clear that accountability at VA is absent. Oversight doesn't \nmean much. And I sincerely and seriously question whether the \nleadership of the VA is capable and willing to enforce change. There is \na difference between wanting change and leading it to happen.\n  Today I am demanding accountability and true transformation within \nthe VA system and its culture, from top to bottom, and all across the \ncountry. Secretary Shinseki seemingly is unwilling or unable to do so, \nand change must be made at the top. I ask the Secretary to submit his \nresignation, and I ask President Obama to accept that resignation.\n  We must never forget that our Nation has responsibility to its \nveterans. That means receiving the care and support they earned.\n  God bless our veterans and all those serving at home and abroad and \nall their families. We need a Department of Veterans Affairs that is \nworthy of your sacrifice.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Warren pertaining to the Introduction of S. 2292 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Introduction of Senate Bills and \nJoint Resolutions.'')\n  Ms. WARREN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am on the floor today to discuss the \nEnergy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act--which is why we call \nit Shaheen-Portman; it is a faster way to refer to it.\n  It is a bill I coauthored with Senator Rob Portman from Ohio, and it \nrepresents more than 3 years of meetings, negotiations, compromise, and \nbroad stakeholder outreach in an effort to craft the most effective \npiece of energy legislation with the greatest chance of passing both \nChambers of Congress and of being signed into law. My partner in this \neffort, Senator Portman, was here on the floor last night talking about \nwhy this is a bipartisan bill that can pass not only this Chamber but \nthe House and be signed into law.\n  It is a bipartisan effort that reflects an affordable approach to \nboost the use of energy efficiency technologies in our economy. \nEfficiency is the cheapest, fastest way to reduce our energy use. \nEnergy-saving techniques and technologies lower costs; they free up \ncapital that allows businesses to expand and our economy to grow.\n  In addition to being an energy bill, it is a jobs bill. We can start \nimproving our efficiency now by installing ready, proven technologies \nsuch as modern heating systems, computer-controlled thermostats, low-\nenergy lighting. Efficiency is no longer about putting on a sweater and \nturning down the thermostat. It is about making use of these \ntechnologies that are available today.\n  There are substantial opportunities which exist across all sectors of \nour economy that would allow us to conserve energy, to create good-\npaying private sector jobs, and to reduce pollution.\n  Our bill reduces the barriers to efficiency in the major energy-\nconsuming sectors of our economy. It does that through buildings, which \nconstitute about 40 percent of our use; through industrial efficiency, \nwhere we assist the manufacturing sector which consumes more energy \nthan any other sector of the U.S. economy--we help them implement \nenergy-efficient production technologies; and through the Federal \nGovernment, which as I think all of us know, is the single largest user \nof energy in the country.\n  The legislation encourages the Federal Government to adopt more \nefficient building standards, smart-metering technology, to look at our \ndata centers and see how we can reduce the costs there.\n  Again, this bill will help create private sector jobs. It will save \nbusinesses and consumers money. It will reduce pollution and it will \nmake our country more energy efficient.\n  A recent study by experts of the American Council for an Energy-\nEfficient Economy found that by 2030 Shaheen-Portman, if it passes, has \nthe potential to create 192,000 domestic jobs, to save consumers and \nbusinesses over $16 billion a year, and to reduce carbon pollution by \nthe equivalent of taking 22 million cars off the road. The bill does \nthis without any mandates, without raising the deficit. All \nauthorizations are offset and it even produces a $12 million deficit \nreduction, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n  I have had the opportunity over the last 3\\1/2\\ years as we have been \nworking\n\n[[Page S2688]]\n\non this bill to visit businesses across New Hampshire that are making \nuse of energy-efficient technology, and what I have heard from those \nbusinesses is they have adopted these energy efficiencies because it \nallows them to save money, it allows them to be competitive, it allows \nthem to add jobs in their sectors. I think that is why this legislation \nenjoys such strong support from industry, from trade associations, and \nfrom labor groups as well as efficiency and environmental advocates.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, it is not often that we have groups \nsuch as the National Association of Manufacturers and the National \nWildlife Federation supporting the same piece of legislation. I have a \nnumber of letters that have been sent by many of these organizations \nthat illustrate the ever-growing support for the bill. The signatures \non these letters go on and on, and they are signed by everyone from the \nEdison Electric Institute, the American Gas Association, the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, the Earth Day Network, and the National \nAssociation of State Energy Offices.\n  At this time, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have these \nletters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   April 30, 2014.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Majority Leader Reid and Republican Leader McConnell: We \n     the undersigned, representing hundreds of thousands of U.S. \n     jobs, write to request that The Energy Savings and Industrial \n     Competitiveness Act of 2014 (S. 2262) be considered by the \n     full Senate as soon as possible.\n       This sensible, bipartisan legislation enjoys broad support \n     in the business community. The bill's sponsors have worked \n     with industry every step of the way in crafting and vetting \n     this legislation. The reintroduced bill has generated even \n     greater consensus among a growing stakeholder coalition that \n     covers diverse economic sectors and environmental \n     organizations. The enhancements have only strengthened--and \n     broadened--the support of the U.S. business community, while \n     multiplying the energy security and environmental benefits \n     that will accrue from this landmark energy efficiency \n     legislation.\n       Energy efficiency enjoys broad, bipartisan support as a \n     recent study commissioned by the National Electrical \n     Manufacturers Association and the National Association of \n     Manufacturers demonstrated. Nine in ten of those polled \n     support using energy efficient products and believe it is \n     important to include energy efficiency as part of our \n     country's energy solutions. 74 percent of those polled \n     support investing taxpayers' dollars on energy efficient \n     technologies, innovations and programs if it would save \n     consumers more money. Finally, 69 percent of those polled are \n     more likely to support investing taxpayers' dollars on energy \n     efficiency if those investments will not raise taxes or add \n     to the federal deficit and do not involve government mandates \n     on consumers.\n       S. 2262 places no new mandates on U.S. businesses or \n     consumers. All new authorizations are fully offset. \n     Provisions in this legislation will promote energy savings in \n     commercial buildings and industrial facilities, which \n     together consume nearly 50 percent of the nation's primary \n     energy. The bill will also reduce energy costs within the \n     federal government, our nation's largest energy consumer, \n     saving taxpayers money.\n       S. 2262 will also boosts the competitiveness of U.S. \n     manufacturers and real estate by creating jobs in the \n     manufacturing, contracting, construction, installation, \n     distribution, design, and service sectors.\n       For these reasons, the Senate Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources roundly endorsed the legislation with a \n     strong bipartisan vote of 19-3. The legislation continues to \n     gain additional cosponsors with Sens. Landrieu, Coons, \n     Warner, Franken, Manchin, Collins, Ayotte, Wicker, Hoeven, \n     Isakson, Murkowski and Bennett. The House recently passed \n     several provisions contained in S. 2262 by a vote of 375-36, \n     another strong showing of support for energy efficiency.\n       Now is the time to act on this important legislation and we \n     ask that S. 2262 be brought to the Senate floor as soon as \n     possible.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   American Chemistry Council,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 5, 2014.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Majority Leader Reid and Republican Leader McConnell: As an \n     industry that creates many of the advanced solutions that \n     help society save energy, we support the Energy Savings and \n     Industrial Competitiveness Act (S. 2262) and urge the \n     Senate's consideration and adoption as quickly as possible. \n     Enactment of this bipartisan legislation can elevate the role \n     of energy efficiency in a comprehensive, ``all of the above'' \n     national energy policy.\n       American chemistry is a leader in energy efficiency. Our \n     companies invent and make materials and technologies that \n     empower people around the world to save energy and reduce \n     greenhouse gas emissions. High-performance building \n     insulation and windows, solar panels, wind turbines, even \n     lightweight packaging and auto parts that reduce energy needs \n     in shipping and transportation all start with chemistry.\n       In addition to supplying energy-saving products, we know \n     that being energy-efficient in our own operations helps \n     reduce costs and expand U.S. production and jobs. This \n     commitment has led to a 49 percent improvement in the U.S. \n     chemical industry's energy efficiency since 1974. ACC member \n     companies report on energy efficiency and other measures \n     through Responsible Care' an environmental, \n     health, and safety performance program.\n       S. 2262 will achieve energy savings across the economy, \n     including homes, buildings, industry, and the federal \n     government. We encourage the Senate to approve this important \n     legislation as a key step toward a strong, secure, and \n     sustainable energy future.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Cal Dooley,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   April 28, 2014.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, The Capitol,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, The Capitol,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell: As \n     a broad coalition of energy efficiency and environmental \n     organizations, small and large businesses, trade \n     associations, and public interest groups, we urge you to \n     bring the Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act \n     (S. 2074) to the floor for a vote as soon as possible.\n       S. 2074, introduced on February 27, 2014 by Senator Jeanne \n     Shaheen and Senator Rob Portman, would help meet America's \n     goals of increasing energy productivity, enhancing energy \n     security, reducing harmful emissions, and promoting economic \n     growth in a financially responsible manner. The new version \n     of this bipartisan bill addresses energy savings in the \n     federal government--the nation's largest energy consumer--and \n     includes new provisions that expand energy efficiency savings \n     and benefits to all sectors of the U.S. economy, from schools \n     and homes, to commercial buildings, industry, and \n     manufacturing.\n       Energy efficiency is the quickest, cheapest, and cleanest \n     way to tackle domestic energy demand. Wasted energy not only \n     weakens our national competitiveness on a global scale, but \n     also compounds the financial burdens of businesses and \n     consumers. An analysis of the new bill by the American \n     Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) estimates \n     that by 2030, the Energy Savings and Industrial \n     Competitiveness Act would create more than 190,000 jobs, save \n     consumers $16 billion a year, and cut carbon dioxide by the \n     equivalent of taking 22 million cars off the road.\n       Energy efficiency has always been a bipartisan issue. By \n     fully deploying the power of energy efficiency, we can help \n     create new jobs, save energy and money, and reduce carbon \n     emissions. This legislation affords Congress the opportunity \n     to assist the economy without undue cost or regulatory \n     burden.\n       For these reasons, we urge you to schedule the Energy \n     Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act for a vote in the \n     near future so that Americans can begin reaping the many \n     benefits of energy efficiency.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      Alliance to Save Energy,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 5, 2014.\n       Dear Senator: The Alliance To Save Energy strongly supports \n     S. 2262, the Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness \n     Act, also known as Shaheen-Portman. When the bill comes to \n     the floor this week, the Alliance urges you to vote for \n     cloture and to vote for the underlying bill.\n       Energy efficiency is the quickest, cheapest, and cleanest \n     way to reduce domestic energy consumption. Well-designed \n     programs such as those contained in the Energy Savings and \n     Industrial Competitiveness Act will help American families \n     and businesses lower their energy costs. Moreover, energy \n     efficiency policies offer Americans protection from rising \n     energy costs caused by political instability abroad, and move \n     us towards greater energy security.\n       This bipartisan bill addresses energy savings in the \n     federal government--the nation's largest energy consumer--and \n     includes provisions that expand energy efficiency savings and \n     benefits to all sectors of the U.S. economy, from schools and \n     homes, to commercial buildings, industry, and manufacturing.\n       More specifically, Shaheen-Portman contains provisions that \n     will create a national strategy to increase the use of energy \n     efficiency through a model building energy code; promote the \n     development of energy efficient supply-chains for companies; \n     encourage the federal government to adopt and implement \n     energy saving policies and programs; improve federal data \n     center efficiency; support the deployment of energy efficient \n     technologies in schools; improve commercial building \n     efficiency; and promote the benchmarking and disclosure of \n     buildings'\n\n[[Page S2689]]\n\n     energy use, among a number of other initiatives.\n       Rather than squandering taxpayers' dollars on needless \n     energy costs, S. 2262 implements practical, cost effective \n     measures to tackle federal energy consumption, while creating \n     jobs and reducing emissions. It is estimated that by 2030, \n     Shaheen-Portman will create more than 190,000 jobs, save \n     consumers $16 billion a year, and cut carbon dioxide \n     emissions by the equivalent of taking 22 million cars off the \n     road.\n       The American public wants bipartisan policies that will \n     spur economic growth and create jobs. There is consensus that \n     efficiency is the cheapest and fastest way to start reducing \n     demand for the energy we currently use. We believe the Energy \n     Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act represents our \n     best chance to improve our demand-side energy policy.\n       Again, we urge you to vote for cloture and to vote for the \n     underlying bill so that Americans can begin reaping the many \n     benefits of energy efficiency.

Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid and Senator McConnell: On behalf of \n     Advanced Energy Economy, a national association of businesses \n     and business leaders who are making the global energy system \n     more secure, clean, and affordable, I am writing to encourage \n     you to bring bipartisan energy efficiency legislation (S. \n     2074) cosponsored by Senator Jeanne Shaheen and Senator Rob \n     Portman to the Senate floor.\n       This bipartisan national strategy to increase energy \n     efficiency in the residential, commercial, and industrial \n     sectors of our economy reflects and accelerates the trend \n     toward greater energy efficiency many businesses are \n     embracing. Reducing costs for businesses and consumers and \n     increasing U.S. competitiveness by making our use of energy \n     more efficient is at the core of comprehensive energy policy.\n       The Senate has an opportunity to join the House in passing \n     bipartisan legislation that moves us toward a more energy-\n     efficient economy. S. 2074 highlights the many ways we can \n     increase energy efficiency. The bill addresses building \n     codes, financing, technical assistance, and rebate programs, \n     all positive steps toward saving money through improved \n     energy efficiency. All of these steps are important to our \n     business members, who stand ready to provide the technologies \n     and services that improve energy efficiency throughout the \n     economy. We strongly support the bill and look forward to \n     working with you as it continues through the legislative \n     process.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Graham Richard,\n     CEO, Advanced Energy Economy.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Rural Electric\n\n\n                                      Cooperative Association,\n\n                                                      May 5, 2014.\n       Dear Senator: The National Rural Electric Cooperative \n     Association strongly supports S. 2262, the Energy Savings and \n     Industrial Competitiveness Act sponsored by Senators Shaheen \n     and Portman. When the bill comes to the floor this week, \n     NRECA urges you to vote for cloture and the underlying bill.\n       Approximately 250 co-ops in 34 states operate voluntary \n     demand response programs using electric resistance water \n     heaters that allow co-ops to reduce demand for electricity \n     during peak hours. In parts of the country, these water \n     heaters also allow co-ops to integrate renewable energy \n     sources like wind and effectively store that energy.\n       In several major energy bills, Congress has declared the \n     promotion of demand response an important federal policy. A \n     2012 report by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \n     (FERC) recognized co-ops' leadership in demand response. It \n     is through the use of large capacity electric resistance \n     water heaters that co-ops are able to meet such federal \n     goals.\n       Electric co-ops have a straightforward mission: to provide \n     reliable electric service to their consumer-owners at the \n     lowest cost possible. However, on March 22, 2010, the \n     Department of Energy (DoE) issued a new efficiency standard \n     for water heaters that will effectively end our very \n     successful demand response programs beginning next April.\n       S. 2262 will allow us to continue to use water heaters in \n     money- and energy-saving demand response programs by \n     establishing a new category of efficiency standard for water \n     heaters used in demand response programs. We have worked \n     closely with Congressional leaders, DoE, other utilities, \n     energy efficiency and environmental advocacy groups, and \n     water heater manufacturers over the past several years to \n     develop this common-sense approach to help continue the \n     beneficial use of electric resistance water heaters.\n       Importantly, S. 2262 also includes consensus language to \n     resolve Section 433 of the Energy Independence and Security \n     Act of 2007, that if not addressed would prohibit federal \n     facilities from using electricity generated from the use of \n     fossil fuels.\n       Again, when the bill comes to the floor this week, we urge \n     your support. If you have any questions or need more \n     background information, please have your staff contact Julie \n     Barkemeyer at NRECA at 703-907-5809 or \n     julie.barkemeyer@nreca.coop.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jo Ann Emerson.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 National Wildlife Federation,\n\n                                                      May 5, 2014.\n       Dear Senator, On behalf of the National Wildlife Federation \n     (NWF), and our over four million members and supporters \n     nationwide, I urge you to support passage of the bipartisan \n     Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act (S. 2262) \n     and oppose any controversial amendments or associated \n     legislation that does not meet the broadly agreed upon goal \n     of this bill to save money, save energy, and cut carbon \n     pollution. This includes a vote to approve the Keystone XL \n     tar sands pipeline.\n       A product of cooperation and consensus under the leadership \n     of the bill's sponsors and Energy Committee leadership, S. \n     2262 applies a common-sense approach to adopting efficiency \n     measures for buildings, industry, and the federal government \n     that will promote significant cost-savings while helping to \n     protect the health of our communities and wildlife threatened \n     by climate change. Should amendments be adopted that do not \n     reflect the same consensus principle that went into producing \n     the current bill, or undermine current efforts by the federal \n     government to reduce carbon pollution, NWF will be forced to \n     oppose the legislation. We encourage you to oppose amendments \n     that would erode the Environmental Protection Agency's \n     ability to regulate carbon pollution, block federal agencies \n     from considering the social cost of carbon when assessing the \n     costs and benefits of major projects, or undermine the \n     National Environmental Policy Act.\n       The Shaheen-Portman energy efficiency bill would be a big \n     step in the right direction. Reducing energy consumption \n     through efficiency measures is not only an important part of \n     carbon reduction strategies, but also provides wildlife and \n     habitat benefits by reducing energy-production related \n     pressure on America's wildlife and pristine lands. These \n     benefits must not be undermined by including controversial \n     amendments or tying the passage of S. 2262 to the approval of \n     the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline.\n       The Keystone XL tar sands pipeline would force America's \n     wildlife and communities to accept all the risk of oil \n     spills, contaminated water supplies, and climate-fueled \n     extreme weather like superstorm Sandy, and for what reward? \n     Higher Midwest gas prices and a handful of jobs.\n       The Shaheen-Portman energy efficiency bill, on the other \n     hand, is estimated to create 136,000 new jobs by 2025. By \n     2030, the bill will also net annual savings of $13.7 billion \n     and lower CO2 emissions and other air pollutants \n     by the equivalent of taking 22 million cars off the road. \n     These clear benefits must not be eroded by harmful amendments \n     or a mandated approval of the polluting Keystone XL tar sands \n     pipeline.\n       Now is the time to implement common sense measures, like \n     efficiency standards, to create jobs, save money and reduce \n     carbon pollution. The National Wildlife Federation urges you \n     to support S. 2262, oppose any amendments or linked \n     legislation that will undermine the consensus and bipartisan \n     cooperation that the bill represents.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                     Jim Lyon,\n\n                           Vice President for Conservation Policy,\n     National Wildlife Federation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Business Roundtable,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 5, 2014.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leaders Reid and McConnell: On behalf of the more than \n     200 CEO members of Business Roundtable, who lead major \n     American companies operating in every sector of the U.S. \n     economy, I write to convey Business Roundtable's strong \n     support for the Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness \n     Act of 2014, S. 2262, and respectfully request that this \n     vital legislation be brought to the Senate floor for a vote \n     as expeditiously as possible.\n       America's CEOs have consistently called upon Congress and \n     the Administration to adopt a more strategic approach to \n     energy policy that would capitalize on U.S. strengths to \n     promote economic growth, job creation, and enhanced energy \n     security. In our report, Taking Action on Energy: A CEO \n     Vision for America's Energy Future, Business Roundtable laid \n     out a comprehensive plan to boost U.S. energy security and \n     ensure a steady supply of reliable, affordable energy to \n     power increased growth. As noted in that report, energy \n     efficiency improvements over the last quarter century are an \n     American success story and a win-win for the U.S. economy.\n       A Business Roundtable report released last month, Grow, \n     Sustain: Celebrating Success, highlights the sustainability \n     achievements of Roundtable member companies, including \n     remarkable progress in more efficient energy use. Private-\n     sector innovation and CEO leadership have helped yield a 1.9 \n     percent annual reduction in U.S. energy use per dollar of\n\n[[Page S2690]]\n\n     economic output (GDP) between 1992 and 2012. These steady \n     energy efficiency improvements are a major strategic \n     advantage for the United States.\n       Enacting S. 2262 would be an important step toward \n     accelerating U.S. energy efficiency gains and facilitating \n     America's emergence as a global energy superpower. Senate \n     passage of this vital legislation would be a victory for all \n     Americans. We urge you to support S. 2262.\n       Thank you for your attention to this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n     David M. Cote,\n       Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Honeywell, Chair, \n     Energy and Environment Committee, Business Roundtable.\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I think this nontraditional alliance \nclearly illustrates the sizable and diverse demand for this energy \nefficiency jobs bill and, simply put, the time is now for the Senate to \ntake up and pass this bipartisan, commonsense proposal to grow our \neconomy and create good-paying jobs for decades. We cannot let our \nextraneous debates about amendments or nonamendments, what amendments \nto include, which amendments not to include, to get in the way of \ngetting this legislation done, because this creates jobs, it saves \nconsumers money, and it saves on pollution.\n  One of the great things about the bill, which I hope we are going to \ntake up in a few minutes, is it includes 10 additional bipartisan \namendments. Since our bill was taken up and pulled back from the floor \nin September, Senator Portman and I have worked closely with Senators \nfrom both sides of the aisle to add 10 new bipartisan provisions that \nexpand current sections of our bill.\n  The new bill has a section that puts in place commonsense and \nconsensus-reached regulatory relief provisions that maintain the \nunderlying principle of advancing energy efficiency in the private \nsector. As a result of these provisions, the legislation has more \nenergy savings, more job creation, and more carbon dioxide reductions \nthan the previous version of the bill.\n  I want to briefly talk a little bit about some of the bipartisan \namendments, because I think they point out the improvements in the \nlegislation.\n  Tenant Star builds on the success of EPA's long-running voluntary \nENERGY STAR Program for commercial buildings and it creates a similar \ntenant-oriented certification for leased spaces. Again, it is \nvoluntary. Commercial building tenants who design, construct, and \noperate their leased spaces in ways that maximize energy efficiency \nwould receive the same kind of public recognition through Tenant Star \nthat ENERGY STAR has produced for so many buildings and businesses.\n  This bill also includes a provision for energy-efficient schools. \nSenator Susan Collins and Senator Mark Udall have an amendment included \nthat would help schools' energy efficiency and streamline the \ngovernment's programs to make them run more productively. This would \nhelp schools across the country that finance energy efficiency projects \nto make their buildings operate in a more sustainable fashion.\n  The legislation also includes Senator Bennet's and Senator Isakson's \namendment, called the SAVE Act, which would improve the accuracy of \nmortgage underwriting by including energy efficiency as a factor in \ndetermining the value and affordability of homes. It includes a \nproposal by Senators Hoeven and Pryor to create a regulatory exemption \nfor thermal storage water heaters so rural cooperatives and others \ncould continue to use certain large water heaters for their successful \ndemand-response programs.\n  In addition to what is in this legislation, we have seen in the last \nseveral months the House pass energy efficiency legislation, including \na number of the provisions that are in the bill we will be taking up \ntoday. In fact, the House recently passed an energy efficiency package \nby an overwhelming 375-36 margin. Those provisions passed by the House \nare in the version we are introducing of Shaheen-Portman, and it shows \nhow much support for energy efficiency there is throughout the \nCongress.\n  We have a real opportunity to pass this legislation. This is a \nbipartisan, affordable, widely supported bill and, most importantly, an \neffective first step to address our Nation's very real energy needs.\n  I thank Senator Portman for his partnership in bringing the bill to \nthe floor. I thank the majority and minority leaders as well as the new \nenergy Chair, Senator Landrieu, and Ranking Member Murkowski for their \nsupport, and thank former Energy and Natural Resources chairman, \nSenator Ron Wyden, for his support.\n  I also thank the legislation's additional cosponsors: Senators \nAyotte, Bennet, Collins, the Presiding Officer, Senator Coons, as well \nas Senators Franken, Hoeven, Isakson, Warner, and Wicker. I think the \nlist of bipartisan cosponsors indicates the breadth of support for this \nlegislation, that it shows the ideological breadth of support for it.\n  I look forward to working with Senate leadership and with all of my \ncolleagues in the Senate, because we can pass this legislation, we can \ncreate these jobs, we can save consumers money, and we can reduce \npollution.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 368, S. 2262, a bill to promote \n     energy savings in residential buildings and industry, and for \n     other purposes.\n         Harry Reid, Jeanne Shaheen, Michael F.

Mr. President, next week we are going to commemorate \nNational Police Week, a time when the Nation pays tribute to the \nsacrifices made by all those who serve in law enforcement, particularly \nthose officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty. These law \nenforcement officers risk their lives every day to protect our \ncommunities.\n  We often speak eloquently on both sides of the aisle here about \nsupporting law enforcement and their families. These tributes are \nimportant. They are well deserved. But the police officers in our \ncommunities deserve more than speeches; they deserve action and real \nsupport. We owe it to all who serve to help protect those who protect \nus. One important, tangible way to do so is to help provide them with \nlifesaving bulletproof vests.\n  For more than 15 years the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program \nhas helped to provide bulletproof vests to law enforcement officers \naround the country. Republican Senator Ben Nighthorse-Campbell of \nColorado and I worked across the aisle to design a program that helps \nlocal law enforcement agencies purchase bulletproof vests. We both had \na background in law enforcement, and we drew on that. Mr. President, \nlet me show you what has happened. Since 1987, this program has enabled \nover 13,000 State and local enforcement agencies to purchase over 1 \nmillion vests.\n  No one can dispute that this program saves lives. I will never forget \na law enforcement officer who testified before our committee. He had \nhis mother and father and his wife and children sitting behind him in \nthe Judiciary Committee. The distinguished Presiding Officer knows how \noften we have witnesses speaking and their families are there.\n  He said: I love law enforcement. I love law enforcement. The only \nthing I love more than law enforcement is my family. But there came a \nday as an officer when I thought I would never see my family again.\n  It was when he stopped somebody in a routine traffic stop. The man \ncame out of the car and shot him twice in the chest. He reached down \nunderneath the witness table and pulled up the vest. You could see the \ntwo bullets still stuck in the vest.\n  He said: I got a cracked rib out of it, but I saw my mother and \nfather and my wife and children. I saw them when I was at the hospital, \nwhere they were treating me for the cracked rib. I saw them there. They \ndid not have to go to the morgue to see me.\n  That story is repeated all the time. No one disputes that this \nprogram saves lives. That is why Congress has historically acted \nquickly and decisively to support the bulletproof vests program. \nBetween 2000 and 2010, the program enjoyed widespread bipartisan \nsupport. It was reauthorized three times by unanimous consent. This \ntime around, every single Democratic Senator supports passage of the \nbill. It is also cosponsored by Senators Hagan, Cardin, Landrieu, \nShaheen, Pryor, and Franken, to name just a few cosponsors. It has many \nother strong supporters of law enforcement, including the Fraternal \nOrder of Police, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the \nNational Sheriffs' Association, the Major County Sheriffs' Association, \nand the National Association of Police Organizations.\n  For reasons I still do not understand, the bill is being blocked on \nthe Republican side. Not a single Republican cosponsor has stepped \nforward. I cannot understand this. This has never been a partisan \nissue. It should not be a partisan issue. We are doing this to protect \nthe lives of police officers.\n  Senator Grassley and I developed a bipartisan reauthorization that \nincluded improvements to the program. One important change is that \nagencies are now given a grant preference for purchasing vests that are \nuniquely fitted to women officers. There are far more women as police \nofficers today than there were even when Senator Ben Nighthorse-\nCampbell and I first introduced this bill.\n  The program is now stronger than ever. I think the vast majority of \nSenators want to see this program reauthorized. I do not know why \nRepublican Senators have blocked it, especially when we are now \nprotecting, as we had not before, women police officers too. I do not \nknow how we can turn our backs on our police officers.\n  I would also urge support for the National Blue Alert Act, which was \nreported by the Judiciary Committee with a strong bipartisan vote. It \nis sponsored by Senators Cardin and Graham. I am a proud cosponsor. The \nbipartisan Justice for All Reauthorization Act, which I coauthored with \nRepublican Senator John Cornyn and which reauthorizes important \nprograms such as the Paul Coverdell Forensic Science Improvement Grant \nProgram--named after a former Republican Senator--is another important \nbill to law enforcement that we should approve without further delay. \nIt actually defies common sense that any Senator would object to these \npieces of legislation.\n  Next week I will attend, as I almost always do, the National Peace \nOfficers Memorial Service, and there will be a wreath-laying at the \nNational Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, which now contains the \nnames of over 20,000 fallen officers. I remember shortly after I became \nState's attorney going to the funeral of one of those fallen officers. \nI have never forgotten that--even though it was decades ago--the long \nline of police cars, with blue lights flashing. Snow was coming down, \nand the blue lights reflected off the snowflakes. The names, \nunfortunately, do not just stop with those over 20,000 fallen officers. \nThe names of 286 fallen officers will be added to its walls, serving as \nanother somber reminder of the brave men and women of law enforcement \nwho risk their lives each and every day. They work tirelessly to keep \nour communities safe. They deserve our best efforts to do the same for \nthem.\n  I am, in a moment, going to ask consent that the Senate pass S. 933, \nthe Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program Reauthorization Act of \n2013. It has always been bipartisan. We should not let ideology put \nofficers' lives at risk now. I commend the fact that every single \nDemocratic Senator supports it and we can honor the service of those \nwho keep us safe by protecting their lives with bulletproof vests.\n  Frankly, if somebody stands with law enforcement, now is the time to \nstand with them. I can assure you--and they will assure you--it matters \nhere, and it matters to them.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe consideration of Calendar No. 162, S. 933, the Bulletproof Vest \nPartnership Grant Program Reauthorization Act; that the bill be read a \nthird time and passed and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Thank you.\n  The most senior Member of our body understands the differences he and \nI have on a lot of issues. Most of what he said is true in his \nstatement about the sacrifices and the effectiveness. Where we have a \ndifference of agreement and a difference of understanding is in the \nenumerated powers of the Constitution of the United States.\n  The fact is that every individual in this country today owes $50,000 \njust on the debt, and every family is responsible for $1,100,000 in \nunfunded liabilities that your children and you will ultimately pay \nfor.\n  This is not about vests. This is about continuing to do the same \nthing that got our country in trouble. This is a $120 million \nauthorization with no offset, no cutting of spending anywhere else. If \nit is a priority, we ought to cut spending somewhere else. But, more \nimportantly, the Constitution lists the enumerated powers, and there is \nno role for the Federal Government in terms of funding local police \ndepartments. It would be nice to do if we were in surplus. We could \nignore the enumerated powers. But we are not in surplus. We are \nborrowing tons of money\n\n[[Page S2692]]\n\nevery year. We are going to borrow $580 billion this year--$580 billion \nagainst the future. And the small thing--this is small. It is only $120 \nmillion. I do not object to our police officers having vests. I want \nthem all to have vests. I want all the women to have vests. But it is \nnot a role for the Federal Government. It is a role for my hometown \npolice department in Muskogee, OK. The taxpayers there should protect \nour police officers.\n  Our Founders were very clear, and the reason this country is in \ntrouble is we continue to practice outside the parameters of a limited \ngovernment and take away the responsibility and obligations of State \nand local communities.\n  On that basis, I raise an objection and do not agree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Well, Mr. President, I am sorry to hear this. I hear \npeople who supported a useless war in Iraq, and they will talk about \nhow much money we spend. It was the first time in America's history----\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield for a moment, just for a question?\n  Is the Senator aware that I never voted for any of the money for that \nspending?\n  (Ms. HEITKAMP assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, if the Senator will go back to what I \nsaid, it did not refer to him.\n  I worry about those, however, who voted for that war and did not vote \nto stop that war and voted for the very first time that this country \nhas ever gone to war in its history without a tax to pay for it. We \nvoted for it on a credit card--an unnecessary war, a war that hurt the \ninterests of the United States, and it will eventually cost us $2 \ntrillion. Nobody--nobody--talks about paying for that. But to protect \nthe police officers, who are on the street every day protecting us, oh, \nwe cannot do that. We cannot do that, even though we have done so \nbefore.\n  I could name the six police officers who were killed in Oklahoma. I \nam not going to. I am not trying to make this personal. But the \nPresiding Officer understands law enforcement. She supported this. \nEverybody on this side of the aisle supports it. It is to protect our \npolice officers.\n  We will spend $2 trillion on a useless war, but we will not spend a \ntiny fraction of 1 percent--one one-thousandth of 1 percent--to support \nour men and women, especially when we now have a provision in here to \nprotect women police officers as well as men police officers. What \ncould be more--what could be more--nonpartisan than this? That is why \nSenator Ben Nighthorse-Campbell and I joined together, why Republicans \nand Democrats have joined together.\n  I am proud that every Democratic Senator is in favor of this \nlegislation. I wish the Republicans would lift their objection. We \nshould pass this bill. If you stand with law enforcement, then you need \nto stand with them when it matters most. I can assure you--and they can \nassure you--it matters here, and it matters now.\n  I yield the floor. I think I have expressed my dismay that the other \nside of the aisle would not stand up to protect these police officers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I come to the floor to speak about the \nissue that is before us now on the floor, the energy efficiency act, \nled by Senator Shaheen and Senator Portman.\n  The issue the Senators from Oklahoma and Vermont just spoke about is \nextremely important, and there will be, I am sure, appropriate time to \ndebate that issue. I thank Senator Leahy for his extraordinary \nleadership for the safety and support of our police officers, for the \nmany, literally dozens of years--decades--he has served, and he \ncontinues to do a magnificent job, and I will be supporting him in \nthose efforts.\n  But I came to the floor to speak today about the bill that is now \nbefore us, with a vote of 79 votes--a very strong bipartisan signal \nthat Republicans and Democrats would like to debate an energy \nefficiency bill that came out of the Energy Committee on a vote of 19 \nto 3.\n  I just became the chair of this committee, but I have served on it \nnow for almost 18 years and just a few weeks ago became the chair. I \nhave had the privilege to work with Republican and Democratic chairs of \nthis committee. I am excited about the opportunity to try to find a \npath forward with the Presiding Officer, who has been, although not a \nmember of the committee, an absolutely outstanding leader on energy \nissues since arriving in the Senate, and really look forward to working \nwith her and Members from both sides of the aisle to actually deliver \nwhat I think the American people want: a sensible mainstream energy \npolicy for America that increases domestic energy production, \nefficiency, and conservation; creates millions of jobs right here at \nhome; makes us more energy secure and energy independent; and works \nwith our friends, not our enemies.\n  I think we can get it done. I have been in the Senate long enough to \nknow that things aren't easy, but I refuse to be cynical. I refuse to \nbe, woe is me, the world is coming to an end, which I hear a lot around \nhere. I think there are a lot of positive things going on in the \ncountry.\n  In the Presiding Officer's home State, North Dakota, I think there is \nzero unemployment. I think we come in second at about 4.5 percent \nunemployment in Louisiana because we are busy working--not fighting but \nworking--together to produce energy jobs for the country.\n  I was very proud to support this efficiency bill in committee. I \nwould like, of course, to see some additional things added to it, but \nto move it forward--I voted for it to move this bill forward to the \nfloor.\n  When I became the chair of the committee, I had committed to Ron \nWyden, the former chair, and Lisa Murkowski, the ranking member--which \nit is really their work, along with Senators Shaheen and Portman, two \noutstanding members of the committee--to see what I could do to move \nthis bill forward.\n  I wanted to talk a minute about why this is important and frame this \nin a way that our Members can understand it.\n  First--I am going to talk about the bill itself in a minute, but let \nme just step back and say this: There have been 302 bills filed in this \nCongress that relate to energy that have been sent to our committee for \nreview. I am sad to say, and I think my constituents and others will be \ndisappointed to hear, that only 13 of those bills have become law. I \nwant to repeat that: 302 bills have been referred to the Senate \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources since the beginning of this \nCongress and only 13 have become law. One of the reasons I wanted to \nbring the energy efficiency bill to the floor is because I think we \nneed to make that 14.\n  I think this record is pretty dismal, and this is not a negative \nstatement to the leadership of the committee prior to my being there. \nIt is rather a reflection on the lack of cooperation that we are \ngetting either at the committee level or in the Senate. It most \ncertainly is not a reflection on the talents of the former chairman, \nRon Wyden, and Lisa Murkowski, who couldn't have worked--and this is \nsort of the sad underpinning. You couldn't find two leaders who tried \nto work together more than these two. I know because I have sat next to \nthem on that committee for 18 years and I have watched them. I am an \neyewitness to their cordial, respectful conversations, both on and off \nthe committee, when the cameras were on and when the cameras were off. \nNobody can question this or deny it because everyone knows it is true, \nand there are many eyewitnesses besides myself.\n  The question becomes, if a committee has two people who are working \nwell together, a committee that is as important in jurisdiction as \nEnergy and Natural Resources is in this country, how is it possible \nthat we can only get 13 out of 302 bills passed? That is a very \ninteresting question. Why couldn't we get 14 done this week? That is \nwhy I brought this bill to the floor or asked for it to come to the \nfloor, particularly because it is important to both Democrats and \nRepublicans.\n  Let's talk for a minute about how important this bill is. I have 10 \npages of a single-spaced list of businesses, organizations that support \nthis Shaheen-Portman bill, which I will submit for the Record. \nRemember, it came out of committee, one of the few of the 300 filed, on \na 19-to-3 vote.\n\n[[Page S2693]]\n\n  There are roughly 200 organizations and businesses. I am going to \nsubmit all of their names for the Record, but I just wanted to read a \nfew, to understand the breadth of support for this bill before I talk \nabout what this bill does. They are: Alcoa, American Air, Inc., Aspen \nSkiing Company, BAE Systems, Caterpillar Inc., Dow Corning, Eastern \nMountain Sports, Intel, International Paper, Owens Corning, Raytheon \nCompany--one of the largest in the world, Solar Turbines Incorporated, \nUniversal Lighting, American Jewish Committee, Christian Coalition, \nConservAmerica, Earth Day Network, the National Wildlife Federation, \nthe American Chemistry Council, American Lighting Association, Consumer \nFederation of America, League of Women Voters, the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, and the U.S. Conference of Mayors.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the list of \nendorsements.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nThe Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act (Shaheen-Portman) \n                              Endorsements\n\n\n                              Businesses:\n\n       A.O.

I could go on and on, but the point I think is clear. \nThere are organizations from the left, the right, the center, large and \nsmall, business coalitions, consumer coalitions, saying act now on \nenergy efficiency.\n  We may not be able to, and I doubt sincerely that in the next 4 days \non floor of the Senate we can draft an energy policy for America. That \nwould be a bar set a little too high for what we will be able to do \nbetween Tuesday and Friday.\n  But we could do two important things for the country: pass this \nenergy efficiency bill and pass the Keystone Pipeline, something I am \nproud to vote for. You will vote for it. It is a piece of the energy \ninfrastructure this country needs, this country deserves, and we need \nto move forward on it.\n  So in the spirit of balance, compromise, fairness, and common sense--\nwhich we are not finding around here very often--I thought: Let's see. \nWe have an energy efficiency bill that is supported by an \nextraordinarily broad and deep coalition of businesspeople and \nsupported by two of the most respected Members of this body.\n  May I remind everyone, Jeanne Shaheen was a Governor before she was a \nSenator. She has been serving for decades in public office and is well \nknown and well respected.\n  Bob Portman is not only a Senator from Ohio but was formerly the \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget, OMB, so he understands \nabout finance, cost, and savings. I don't think either he or Jeanne \nShaheen would have put their names on this bill,\n\n[[Page S2694]]\n\nwhich they have been working on now for 5 years. This is not an \nelection-year bill, as some would call it. This is a 5-year, very hard \neffort by these two wonderful legislators to provide a bill the country \nneeds. So why aren't we all jumping up and down voting for it? That is \na good question.\n  Rob Portman, who was also the U.S. Trade Representative under the \nBush administration and saw firsthand when Congress passed very poorly \nthought-out bills or made mistakes in bills we passed, and seeing so \nmany jobs leaving to go to China and India, probably jumped on a chance \nto create jobs in America. Thank goodness for Rob Portman. That is what \nour energy efficiency bill does. It creates jobs for America.\n  When I go home and I am out in my parishes, whether it is Tangipahoa \nParish or Richland Parish or De Soto Parish or Caddo Parish or East \nBaton Rouge or Orleans Parish, people look at me and say: Senator, I \ndon't know why everybody is yelling and screaming in Washington. I \ndon't know why everybody is yelling and screaming about the President \nor this or that. Would you please tell them we want high-paying jobs.\n  Yes, raising the minimum wage is important. I am voting for the \nminimum wage. People don't want to make the minimum wage. They want to \nmake $40-, $50-, $60-, $70,000 a year. They want an income for their \nfamilies so their kids can go to school, go to college, so they can \nlive in their homes and retire securely. Do you think you can do that \nat a minimum wage, whether it is $7 an hour or $10 an hour? No.\n  We have a bill on the floor that is going to create American jobs \nwith American manufacturers--maybe not all U.S. technology because \nfrankly we get good energy efficiency technology from around the world, \nbut Americans are very good at this--very good at it. In fact, it is so \ngood that in an old graph--which I am going to have updated and blown \nup because no one can see this but me, unfortunately, because it is so \nsmall. If the cameras can pick it up--and I am going to have it updated \nby this afternoon--we can see that it says, ``Energy Efficiency: \nAmerica's Greatest Energy Resource.''\n  Energy efficiency supplies 52 percent of our overall resources, \npetroleum is 35, natural gas is 23, coal is 19, and nuclear is 8.\n  Think about energy efficiency as our Nation's greatest resource. \nEnergy savings from efficiency are real and save Americans money. Since \n1970, energy efficiency improvements have reduced U.S. energy costs by \nabout $700 billion from what it would have been otherwise.\n  When we think about energy saved, it is the cleanest energy. It is \ncompletely or almost completely American because we are the ones saving \nit. We may import a little of that technology from other places, but it \nis all American, all day, all clean. Why aren't we doing it?\n  The other side--and I know Senator Thune is going to speak in a \nminute--said energy efficiency is not enough for us. We want to build \nthe Keystone Pipeline, so I agree. I agree. I think it is time to do \nboth; to do this energy efficiency bill, to build the Keystone \nPipeline. Why? Not because I don't respect the process but because the \nprocess is over--5 years, 5 studies as required by law. Five studies \nwere completed, the last of which was a State Department study that \nconcluded it is actually environmentally safer to transport oil from \nCanada, from the oil sands in Canada to the refineries along the gulf \ncoast to provide energy for this Nation and create anywhere from 30- to \n50,000 jobs, depending on conservative or liberal facts, talking \npoints, to create jobs and to put America and Canada closer together. \nWe already are together but even closer together to be a North American \nenergy powerhouse.\n  Canada has very high--as the Presiding Officer knows because she \nvisited the oil sands. I am looking forward to going as soon as I can, \nbut I do know, because she shared her experiences with me, that it is \nvery spectacular to see the environmental safeguards Canada has used to \nproduce this resource that is so important to them in the Alberta \nProvince and to us.\n  Why not have an energy efficiency bill that is very popular with \nDemocrats and supported by Republicans and then an energy piece, just a \npiece, not the whole energy policy of the world, not the whole energy \npolicy of the United States but two important pillars, efficiency and \nproduction, put them together, try to find compromise and move it \nforward on these two pieces of legislation. Then we can get it over to \nthe House, let the House decide if they will do it, and move it to the \nPresident's desk separately because the President has powers in the \nConstitution, and we have our own powers.\n  One would think that would make a lot of sense, and this is what I \nwas hoping to do by asking the leadership to allow the Shaheen-Portman \nbill to come to the floor. But evidently, as balanced, as fair as that \nsounds, I think it is unfortunately probably not going to be sufficient \nto move this issue forward. We shall see. We are going to open this for \ndebate.\n  I wish the debate could be about energy efficiency and the importance \nof this bill, things that might improve this bill relative to energy \nefficiency and not on other matters that both sides know do not have \nthis kind of broad-based support.\n  Some of the matters colleagues want to file as amendments that are \npending, or those I know of that might come to the floor, have not even \ncome through our committee. This bill did come through the committee on \na 19-to-3 vote. While the Keystone Pipeline has not yet come through \ncommittee, it can come to this floor and there may be enough votes to \npass it--very, very close. We have about 57 to 58 votes, as I stand \nhere. We need two or three or four more. We might get those votes as \nthe debate goes on and as people listen to the importance of promoting \nAmerica as an energy superpower.\n  I will talk more about that later in the week. I have a lot more to \nsay about the importance of the Keystone Pipeline. But for right now, I \nwant to ask colleagues on both sides of the aisle to really think about \nthe benefits to their districts, to their people, and to our country, \nto support the energy efficiency bill and to agree on a vote on the \nKeystone Pipeline in hopes of getting a balanced effort moving forward.\n  There will be time to talk about other issues that are much more \ncontroversial. Although I support many of them, they are much more \ncontroversial, if you can believe it, than these two. Even though \nKeystone is controversial, we still have almost 60 votes, so it is \nworth trying for. So that is my pitch--to try to be as cooperative as \nwe can.\n  I think Leader Reid has been extremely reasonable in allowing the \nefficiency bill to come to the floor, knowing there are lots--\nhundreds--of amendments that could be talked about and that are \nextraneous to this issue. Technically, he is agreeing to a stand-alone \nvote on Keystone, which is a big concession for the leader of a party \nwhere the majority of our Members, unfortunately, aren't supporting it. \nI support it, Senator Begich supports it, Senator Tester supports it, \nand Senator Heitkamp supports it. But my friends on the Republican side \nshould understand that when Boehner says he can't take up an issue \nunless a majority of his caucus is for it, they all jump up and down \nand say: Go Speaker Boehner, yes. That is the way to go. Yet when Harry \nReid stands up and says, listen, I am going as far as I can go here--\nthe majority of my caucus doesn't even support Keystone, but I am going \nto allow a vote on it--my Republican colleagues want to just push that \naside as if he is not cooperating. It is disingenuous, it is \nhypocritical, and it is unfair.\n  Now, Harry can fight his own battles. He doesn't need me to fight \nthem for him. But let me just say to the other side that I don't want \nto hear anything from you all: Well, we can't get that done because \neven though we have the votes in the House, we don't have a majority of \nRepublicans. This is about Republicans and Democrats sometimes crossing \nthe aisle to do what is right for our country and not being held \nhostage by the side wings of our parties. I wish I had a little more \nhelp around here doing that.\n  Anyway, we will give it the old college try and try to get this \nenergy efficiency bill through and get an up-or-down vote on the \nKeystone Pipeline. If people cooperate, we will get it done. If not, we \nwill have had only 13 bills passed out of this Congress from the\n\n[[Page S2695]]\n\nenergy committee, and we will have to roll up our sleeves and go back \nto work and figure out a better approach. This is the best one I could \ncome up with. It may work; it may not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of my remarks, the Senator from Wyoming Mr. Barrasso be \nrecognized, followed by the Senator from Arkansas Mr. Pryor.\n  Madam President, I modify the unanimous consent request and ask that \nSenator Pryor be recognized at the conclusion of my remarks, followed \nby Senator Barrasso.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, yesterday USA Today and the Pew Research \nCenter released a new poll that found Americans, by more than a 2-to-1 \nmargin, were dissatisfied with the direction the country is going. \nSixty-two percent of Americans rate their personal financial situation \nas poor or fair. A whopping 65 percent want the next President to \npursue policies different from those of the current President.\n  What I would suggest is that the American people are tired--they are \ntired of seeing their bills go up while their paychecks don't. They are \ntired of having to work harder just to stay in place--to say nothing of \ngetting ahead. They are tired of economic promises that are often \nrepeated but never fulfilled.\n  Our economy has supposedly been in recovery for years, but it is a \nrecovery that feels a lot like a recession to ordinary hardworking \nAmericans. More than 10 million Americans are unemployed, and more than \none-third of them have been out of work for more than 6 months.\n  While unemployment finally declined last month, the decline was \ndriven more by the fact that 806,000 Americans dropped out of the \nworkforce entirely than by any meaningful surge in the number of those \nwho are employed. Had the number of Americans participating in the \nlabor force stayed flat last month, the unemployment rate would have \nactually gone up, not down. In fact, if the labor force participation \nrate today were the same as it was when President Obama took office, \nour Nation would have an unemployment rate of 10.4 percent.\n  So what is happening is more and more people are leaving the labor \nforce. They are completely discouraged. But the labor force \nparticipation rate has fallen, and one of the main reasons it has \nfallen is because so many Americans have grown so discouraged that they \nhave given up looking for work entirely.\n  Our country has experienced recessions before, but we have always \nbounced back. But our recovery from this recession has been so slow--at \ntimes, seemingly nonexistent--that many are wondering if the last 5 \nyears of sluggish growth and recession-level unemployment could be the \nnew normal. And they are right; it could be, if we continue the \npolicies of the last 5 years.\n  The widespread dissatisfaction with the economy reflected in the Pew \npoll may not be what Democrats want to see, but it is the natural \noutcome of their policies. They have spent 5 years pursuing policies \nthat have not only been unsuccessful in creating jobs but have all too \nfrequently actually hurt job creation.\n  Take ObamaCare. It is hard to even know where to start when talking \nabout the damage ObamaCare is wreaking on the jobs and the economy. \nThere is the ObamaCare tax on lifesaving medical devices, such as \npacemakers and insulin pumps, which has cost thousands of jobs in this \nindustry already and is going to cost thousands more. There is the 30-\nhour workweek rule, which has forced businesses, State and local \ngovernments, and nonprofits to cut the hours of workers in this \ncountry. There is the employer mandate, which has caused many \nbusinesses to rethink their plans to expand and hire new workers. Then, \nof course, there is the burden the law places on small businesses.\n\n  The title of an article that appeared in the Las Vegas Review Journal \nover the weekend summed it up nicely, and the headline went like this: \n``Own a small business? Brace for ObamaCare pain.'' This article \npointed out something that is often overlooked in discussions of the \nlaw--that the people who will suffer the most from the small business \nhealth plan cancellations that ObamaCare will cause in Nevada and \naround the country are those who can least afford it--the kind of \npeople the law was supposed to help.\n  To quote from the article:\n\n       Some workers are at higher risk than others of losing \n     company-sponsored coverage. Professional, white-collar \n     companies such as law or engineering firms will bite the \n     bullet and renew at higher prices. . . . But moderately \n     skilled or low-skilled people making $8 to $14 an hour \n     working for landscaping businesses, fire prevention firms or \n     fencing companies could lose work-based coverage because the \n     plans cost so much relative to salaries.\n\n  That is right, Madam President. It is low-income workers in places \nlike Nevada who stand in the greatest danger of losing their employer-\nsponsored coverage. That is frequently the story when it comes to the \nDemocrats' so-called job-creating policies. Democrats like to suggest \nthat Republicans are indifferent to workers' plight, and that only \nDemocrats really have a plan to offer help. But in fact the Democrats' \nplans to help often pose the most danger to low-income workers.\n  There is ObamaCare, of course, as I mentioned, but there is also the \nminimum wage proposal, which the Congressional Budget Office says will \neliminate up to 1 million jobs. Those 1 million jobs that will be \neliminated are not doctors' jobs and they are not lawyers' jobs. They \nare positions held by low-income workers who will be the first to \nsuffer when employers have to cut back on hiring or on hours as a \nresult of the minimum wage hike.\n  Then, of course, there is the Keystone Pipeline, which we are talking \na little about today, and which the President has resolutely refused to \napprove, despite the fact that it would support, according to his own \nState Department estimates, 42,000 jobs without spending a dime of \ntaxpayer money.\n  The people who will be hurt the worst by the President's decision to \ncow to the relentless pressure of far-left environmentalists are the \nworkers who would actually build the pipeline and the restaurants and \nsmall businesses who would benefit from pipeline workers' business \nduring construction.\n  It is not just Keystone. Almost all of the President's energy \npolicies would do serious damage to our economy and to working \nAmericans. Take the restrictions on ground-level ozone levels the \nPresident's EPA is scheduled to release by December of this year.\n  In 2010, the EPA proposed lowering the permitted ozone levels from 75 \nparts per billion to 60 to 70 parts per billion. Energy industry \nestimates suggest that lowering the ground-level ozone concentration to \n60 parts per billion would cost businesses--get this--more than $1 \ntrillion per year--$1 trillion per year--between 2020 and 2030. Job \nlosses as a result of this measure would total a staggering 7.3 million \nby 2020, devastating entire industries--most especially U.S. \nmanufacturing. My own State of South Dakota would lose tens of \nthousands of jobs in manufacturing, natural resources and mining, and \nconstruction.\n  Take a look at what this would actually do. These are the areas under \nthese proposals that have been put forward. Today there are probably a \ncouple hundred counties in the country that are not in compliance, in \nwhat we call nonattainment areas--mostly urban, heavily populated \nareas. But if we take a look at what their proposal would do on this \nmap, this map represents those who would be affected if we went to 60 \nparts per billion as opposed to the 75 parts per billion today.\n  So instead of focusing on those counties in this country that are not \ncurrently in attainment and getting them to full attainment first, we \nare talking about expanding dramatically the impact this would have all \nacross the country.\n  Look at my State of South Dakota, for example. We have areas that \nwouldn't be in attainment. We don't think of South Dakota as being a \nplace where we have problems with clean air and ozone issues, but this \nis clearly a regulation which, if put into effect, would cost the \neconomy literally billions and billions of dollars--in one estimate $1 \ntrillion per year between 2020 and 2030.\n\n[[Page S2696]]\n\n  If we look at where this hurts people the most, again, it is the \npeople who are in the lower and middle-income range--people whose \nbudgets are more heavily affected by hikes in their energy bills.\n  Today the President will hold press events to raise the alarm about \nclimate change and push for more job-killing, industry crippling energy \npolicies, but it will be interesting to see if he spares a line or two \nfor the millions of Americans whose jobs will be lost and whose \nhousehold budgets will be shattered as a result of his proposals.\n  This week the Senate is going to be considering the Shaheen-Portman \nenergy legislation. I plan to introduce three amendments to check EPA \noverreach and to protect American workers from the devastating effects \nof the EPA's ground-level ozone and greenhouse gas proposal.\n  The first amendment will require Congress to vote up or down on any \nEPA regulation that has an annual cost of more than $1 billion. Pretty \nstraightforward. Let the people's representatives vote. If they are \ngoing to put regulations out there that are going to cost more than $1 \nbillion, let us have Congress vote on those.\n  The second amendment would prohibit the EPA from finalizing \ngreenhouse gas regulations for new and existing power plants if the \nDepartment of Energy and the GAO determine those regulations will raise \nenergy prices or cost jobs. So if the Department of Energy and the GAO \ndetermine the regulations will not impact jobs or energy prices, the \nEPA can go forward and finalize those regulations.\n  It is time to be honest with the American people about the cost of \nthese regulations. Taken together, these two amendments are a strong \nstep toward placing a check on EPA's regulatory train wreck.\n  The final amendment I will offer is specific to the administration's \nupcoming proposal on ground-level ozone, which as I just mentioned is \nthe most expensive regulation in EPA's history. The cost of this \nregulation is so great that when the EPA first proposed lower levels in \n2010, the White House delayed those regulations until after the \nPresident's reelection.\n  My amendment is straightforward.\n  First, it would require the EPA to consider the costs and feasibility \nof new ozone regulations. Many Americans would be surprised to know the \nEPA isn't even allowed to consider costs when setting these new \nregulations. My amendment would fix that.\n  Additionally, my amendment would force the EPA to focus on the worst \nareas for smog before dramatically expanding this regulation to the \nrest of the country. As I mentioned on the map here, 221 counties \nacross 27 States don't even meet the current standard of 75 parts per \nbillion. It makes sense to focus on these urban areas before expanding \nozone regulations to places such as western South Dakota, where we \nclearly don't have a smog problem.\n  Under my amendment, 85 percent of these counties would have to \nachieve full compliance with the existing standard before the EPA can \nmove forward with a lower level which dramatically expands the reach of \nozone regulations. I hope the Senate will get the chance to vote on \nthese proposals.\n  I also hope the Senate will get a chance to vote on the Keystone \namendment so we can get those 42,000 jobs opened to American workers.\n  It has been a long time since we have had a real energy debate in the \nSenate. But given our sluggish economy and the danger the President's \nenergy proposals pose to any future growth, I am hoping the majority \nleader will decide it is time for a debate.\n  The election-year agenda offered by Democrats and the President is \njust more of the same job-killing, growth-stifling legislation that \nDemocrats have been offering for the past 5 years. Like the legislation \nthe Democrats and the President have offered for the last 5 years, it \nwill do the worst injury to those Americans who can least afford it.\n  Pundits may warn that our current economic malaise is the new normal, \nbut it doesn't have to be that way. We can get the economy going again. \nWe can lift the heavy burden of government regulation and free \nbusinesses to grow and create jobs. We can make it easier, not harder, \nfor middle-class workers to find stability and for lower income workers \nto make it into the middle class.\n  According to the Pew/USA Today poll, 65 percent of Americans want the \nnext President to pursue different policies. It is still a couple more \nyears until the next Presidential election, but there is no reason \nCongress can't start pursuing different policies today. The American \npeople have been struggling for long enough.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                     Operation Razorback-Guatemala\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I thank my colleague who allowed me to \njump in front of him in the line. I appreciate that.\n  I am sorry for my voice today. I sound a little bit like Daffy Duck, \nbut I have a cold, and I am working through that right now.\n  I rise today to speak for a few minutes about something in this \ncountry we take for granted--and that is electricity.\n  Ever since the Rural Electrification Act back in the 1930s passed, \nfor the most part every person in this country has had access to \nelectricity. I know there are a few exceptions, but basically that \nprogram has worked extremely well and continues to work. As the \nPresiding Officer, who comes from a rural State, knows, sometimes we \nhave investor-owned facilities, sometimes we have these cooperative \ntype utilities, and sometimes we have even municipalities.\n  I rise today to focus on something the Arkansas electric cooperatives \nhave been involved in, and I thank 25 power linemen in the 12 electric \ncoops in Arkansas who recently completed a mission to electrify two \nremote Guatemalan villages. Combined with a 2013 project, Arkansas \nelectric cooperative linemen have assisted in providing electric \nservice to more than 770 rural Guatemalan residents who otherwise would \nnot have electricity. This is the first time these people have ever had \nelectricity in their lives.\n  This rural electrification initiative is part of Arkansas's Operation \nRazorback-Guatemala that started in 2012 in cooperation with the \nNational Rural Electric Cooperative Association International. After a \nyear of planning, the linemen arrived in Guatemala on March 26 and then \ntraveled approximately 9 hours to the remote villages of Las Flores and \nLa Hacienda to ``light up'' the land. I commend them for giving their \ntime, energy, and know-how to improve the lives of hundreds of \nGuatemalans who before this did not even know--because electricity is a \ncritical element to improving the quality of life--the quality of \nhealth care, the quality of education, and some of the basics that, \nagain, we often take for granted in this country--such as clean water \nand many other vital services.\n  This area in Guatemala processes and exports coffee beans that end up \nat companies such as NESCAFE, McDonald's, Starbucks, and other coffee \noutlets. This new reliable access to electricity will help these \nvillagers increase the quantity and quality of their locally grown \ncoffee, resulting in economic prosperity and a better quality of life \nfor present and future generations. So they will be even more connected \nwith the global economy because of what these people from the Arkansas \nelectric coops did to help these folks.\n  Senator Boozman could not be here today; otherwise, he would be here \nsitting at his desk saying a few words. But he did pass on for me a \nbrief statement he wanted me to read:\n\n       We are proud of Electric Cooperatives of Arkansas's \n     willingness to support people around the world who need safe, \n     affordable and reliable electricity. Operation Razorback has \n     been a real success that will result in improved economic \n     prosperity, a higher quality of life and more opportunities \n     for Guatemalans today and for future generations. Sharing our \n     knowledge, expertise and technology will make a lasting \n     impact. These Guatemalan villages will never be the same \n     thanks to the progress made by the volunteers of Electric \n     Cooperatives of Arkansas.\n\n  We have a few of those people with us today, and I wish to recognize \nthem: Duane Highley, who is the CEO; Kirkley Thomas, who is the vice \npresident of the Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corporation in Arkansas; \nMel Coleman, CEO of the North Arkansas Electric Cooperative; Paul \nGarrison, one of the linemen who actually went on the trip.\n\n[[Page S2697]]\n\n  I asked him earlier: What is the first thing these people will get? \nHe said: Lights. Naturally that is what they are going to try to get.\n  Again, we appreciate them. And also, Jo Ann Emerson, a long-time \nfriend and colleague on the House side, president and CEO of NRECA.\n  In addition to donating their time and raising more than $100,000 to \nsupport this electrification effort, the group also trained local \nlinemen, donated power infrastructure materials, and distributed \nhumanitarian aid items to these local villages.\n  I again thank the coops and acknowledge them for how they are making \nnot only Arkansas better but also making the world better.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                       Environmental Stewardship\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, today President Obama is doing \ntelevised events talking about climate change. According to press \nreports, the President is ready to pivot to the environment as an \nissue.\n  Well, I also want to talk about environmental stewardship today. I \nwant to talk about what is going on in some of our States, where they \nare actually doing something, not just talking about it.\n  Today the Senate and Congressional Western Caucuses are issuing a new \nreport called ``Washington Gets it Wrong--States Get it Right.''\n  The report shows how regulations imposed by Washington are \nundermining the work being done at the State level to manage our lands, \nour natural resources, and to protect our air and water.\n  More often than not, Washington regulations and one-size-fits-all \nmandates do get it wrong. In the West we take very seriously our \ncommitment to ensuring the health and viability of land, wildlife, and \nthe environment. That is at both the local and the State levels.\n  Federal agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the \nDepartment of the Interior like to think of themselves as the ultimate \nprotectors of our Nation's skies and open spaces. But we have seen time \nand time again that the work being done at the State level is more \nreasonable, more effective, and certainly less heavyhanded.\n  Thousands of people are working across the West to protect their \ncommunities. These are people who live in the West, not bureaucrats in \nWashington offices. Nobody is better qualified than the folks who \nactually live in the West, because they actually walk the land and \nbreathe the air--the land and the air they are trying to protect.\n  So our report looks at the work being done by State agencies to \nprotect not just the land they live and work on but also the people who \nrely on the health and safety of that land.\n  As this report demonstrates, extreme regulations imposed by \nWashington undermine the work being done at the State level, whether it \nis to manage lands and natural resources, protect air and water, or \nconserve species.\n  When we look at the work of these State agencies--as the Western \nCaucuses have done in this report--it is clear that when it comes to \nconservation and environmental efforts, the States do get it right. \nMore often than not, Washington gets it wrong.\n  It is time for Washington to stop its overreaching regulations and \nthe continual drip, drip, drip of mandates. It is time for Washington \nto stop getting it wrong and start recognizing how States get it right.\n  The report has details about specific things different States are \ndoing, but I want to mention four categories where States are leading \nthe way when it comes to environmental stewardship.\n  The first is protecting species on the ground. This includes \nconservation policies that States are developing, where they work with \nindustry and landowners to protect species without hampering multiple-\nuse policies; that is, multiple use of the land.\n  Second, States are showing the right way to protect our water, land, \nand air. They are putting in place ideas that are tailored to the needs \nof their own communities. They are actually looking at what is unique \nabout their State and the best way for people to solve problems \nlocally.\n  Third, States are promoting access to fish and wildlife. States \nunderstand they need to manage and protect lands and waters in a way \nthat allows for public spaces to be enjoyed. That means ensuring those \nspaces remain intact for future generations. These are called natural \nresources for a reason--they are meant to be enjoyed by all of us, not \nsealed off under Washington's lock and key.\n  Fourth, the report looks at what States are doing right when it comes \nto in-state scientific and support staff. State agencies are employing \nthousands of people who live in the communities they are trying to \nprotect.\n  Who has more incentive to protect the local environment? The people \nwho are living there, the people who are working there, and the people \nwho are raising their children in these communities, or some \nbureaucrats locked in a Washington, DC office? Who knows more about the \nspecific unique features of a State or local area and what will work \nbest there?\n  The Senate and Congressional Western Caucuses have put out this \nreport to highlight just a few of the State initiatives we believe are \nworking. I hope the President will take some time today to not just \ntalk but to actually listen and to read our report and see some of the \nways States are getting it right and Washington is getting it wrong.\n  If others are interested and wish to read the report, they can \ncertainly find it at my Web site, www.barrasso\n.senate.gov.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/06/senate-section/article/S2697-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, Americans understand the relationship \nbetween affordable energy and a stronger economy. They understand it. \nThey may not know all the numbers, but intuitively they know in their \ngut that affordable energy is critical to a sound and strong economy.\n  Between 2008 and 2013, America suffered through a financial crisis--a \ndeep recession, sometimes called the great recession. There was nothing \ngreat about it because it turned our country and our economy on its \nhead, and it resulted in the highest level of unemployment since the \nGreat Depression. Yet over the same period of time, U.S. production of \noil increased by 50 percent.\n  Meanwhile, from 2007 to 2012, America's production of shale oil \nincreased by an astounding 18-fold while our production of gas grew by \nmore than 50 percent. In fact, it is now projected that the United \nStates could well be a net exporter of natural gas. The terminals that \nwere built along the gulf coast and elsewhere to try to facilitate the \nimportation of natural gas are now being retrofitted and turned around \nso that the excess natural gas produced right here in the U.S.A. is \navailable to export.\n  As we have learned, among other things, this could change the \ngeopolitics of the globe. If America and the rest of the world no \nlonger depend on the Middle East--and if Europe and Ukraine are no \nlonger dependent on Russia--for their sole supply of energy and oil, it \ncould change the world as we know it.\n  Well, as I started out by saying people understand the relationship \nbetween affordable energy and a stronger economy, nowhere else do they \nunderstand it any better than in Bismarck, ND, or in the Permian Basin \nin Texas. Those are the two places, the last time I checked, that had \nthe lowest level of unemployment in the country, and it is not a \ncoincidence. These are places that are producing huge volumes of \nAmerican oil and natural gas, and it is creating a lot of jobs in the \nprocess.\n  In short, even amid a difficult period of economic stagnation, \nAmerica has\n\n[[Page S2698]]\n\nbeen experiencing a true revolution in domestic energy output. This is \na little bit inside baseball, but a few years ago people were talking \nabout peak oil, as if all of the oil that could be discovered had been \ndiscovered in the world; we were running out. Well, obviously, that has \nproven not to be true. But, as I said, all you need to do is to visit \nthe Permian Basin in West Texas, the Eagle Ford Shale region in South \nTexas or the Barnett Shale region in North Texas and see what happens \nwhen America is a good steward of the natural resources we have been \nprovided.\n  The numbers in my State are really amazing--in the great State of \nTexas. During the month of February, our State's average daily oil \nproduction hit a 28-year high--a 28-year high--as we produced more than \n2 million barrels of oil a day. What does that mean, if you do not come \nfrom an oil-producing State, an energy-producing State? That means, at \nminimum, that is 2 million barrels a day less we have to import from \nOPEC--the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries--in the Middle \nEast. That is 2 million barrels less a day that we are held hostage to \nthat volatile region of the world.\n  In Karnes County, TX, alone, which is part of the Eagle Ford Shale \nregion, total monthly oil production was nearly 4.9 million barrels. \nHow did this happen? Well, it happened because of the innovation of \nthis sector of our economy--the energy sector--and it has made it \ncleaner, safer, much more productive than it has been at any other time \nin the past.\n  In Midland, TX, which I mentioned a moment ago--part of the \nincredibly productive Permian Basin, which has been producing oil and \ngas for many decades now--monthly oil production grew from about \n842,000 barrels in February 2008 to 1.9 million barrels in February \n2014, for a total increase from 2008 to 2014 of 128 percent--128 \npercent. Incredible.\n  As I said, it is not surprising that this area of our State and our \ncountry has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the entire Nation. \nThere is a relationship between affordable energy and a strong economy \nand strong job growth. It is a place, for example, where a person with \na high school diploma or a general equivalency degree, a GED, can make \n$75,000 a year driving trucks. So if you can get a commercial driver's \nlicense in Midland, TX, and you have a GED or a high school degree, you \ncould make $75,000 a year. I was told yesterday that at the McDonald's \nrestaurants in the area, people are being paid $15 an hour. That is not \nbecause the Federal Government has raised the minimum wage to $15 an \nhour; that is because the market demands it because the economy is \nbooming.\n  As I said, people in my State have long understood--because we have \nbeen an energy-producing State--that U.S. energy policy is a critical \npart of U.S. economic policy. Thanks to this innovation I alluded to a \nmoment ago, you are seeing other parts of the country experience this, \nsome for the first time.\n  But we are all learning that maximizing domestic energy production \nwill create American jobs, and it will make America safer. They are \nalso beginning to understand better that misguided government policies \ncan destroy those same jobs and perpetuate our dependence on foreign \nenergy sources. For example, many people in my State are very concerned \nabout the regulatory process at the Federal level and particularly a \nproposal that will, in essence, enact a backdoor energy tax in the form \nof new greenhouse gas rules. The proposed rule would have a major \neconomic cost in return for meager or nonexistent benefits. The Obama \nEnvironmental Protection Agency itself admitted that its greenhouse gas \nrule would not have a notable impact on U.S. carbon dioxide emissions \nby 2022.\n  Speaking of which, I hope my friends across the aisle--who frequently \nargue that we must have government-imposed CO2 reductions, \neven if it kills jobs and raises the price of energy for consumers--\nappreciate that this same natural gas and energy revolution that we \nhave talked about has itself--all by itself--resulted in a significant \ndecline in CO2 emissions. That is by virtue of this same \ninnovation that has created all this natural gas--cheaper, more \naffordable energy--to help drive our economy and help create more jobs. \nAt the same time it has reduced CO2 emissions. Between 2005 \nand 2012, U.S. emissions dropped by more than 10 percent. Indeed, \nemissions dropped more in the United States than in Europe, which \nalready has in place some draconian measures, such as a cap-and-trade \nrule, a carbon tax, and those sorts of policies. It has dropped more in \nAmerica without those because of this innovation and this natural gas \nrenaissance.\n  I admit this natural gas boom was not the only reason our emissions \nwent down, but many experts believe it was the most important.\n  Despite this progress, the majority leader insists that we are still \nnot doing enough to curb CO2 emissions. But do you know \nwhat. He refuses to bring a bill to the floor that would actually, \naccording to his scenario, do something about it--the so-called cap-\nand-trade bill. I do not support that because I think it would raise \nenergy costs, it would have negligible benefits, and it is really just \nthrowing a bone to some of the most radical people in America when it \ncomes to our environment and exploring and producing American energy. \nBut cap and trade failed to command sufficient Senate approval even \nwhen our Democratic friends controlled 60 votes, which in the Senate is \nunassailable in the sense that you can do that purely on a party-line \nvote. But the reason it did not pass was pretty simple, and our \nDemocratic friends understand this as well. The costs of cap and trade \nvastly outweigh the benefits of cap and trade. It does not pass the \ncost-benefit test.\n  The same is true of President Obama's backdoor energy tax. Over the \ncoming decades, America's contribution to worldwide carbon dioxide \nemissions growth will be minuscule. Moreover, as I mentioned, the EPA \nitself--the Obama administration Environmental Protection Agency--does \nnot believe the greenhouse gas rule would have a significant impact on \nU.S. emissions by 2022--8 years from now. So the benefits of this \nbackdoor energy tax would be virtually nonexistent, while the costs \nwould be all too real, including higher energy prices and lost jobs.\n  The shale gas revolution, as it is called--shale because that is the \nrock it is produced from through this phenomenon known as fracking. And \nfor those who are scared about the concept of fracking, who do not \nreally understand it, this is a process that has been used for about 70 \nyears around the country. It is very safely regulated at the State and \nlocal level, and, if proper drilling practices are observed, casing is \nsubmitted in a hole in a way that protects drinking water and other \npossible contamination. So it can and has been done on a daily basis \nfor lo these seven decades.\n  But the shale gas revolution has been critical to America's economic \ngrowth during a time the rest of the economy has struggled, and it is \ngoing to be even more vital in the decades ahead.\n  According to one study, by 2035 unconventional oil and gas resources \nalone--that is what comes from shale; shale oil, shale gas--will \nsupport close to 3.5 million jobs in America and make $475 billion in \nvalue-added contributions to America's economy.\n  Where would we be this last quarter, when the gross domestic product \nof our economy grew at 0.1 percent, if it were not for what I am \ntalking about here, this energy renaissance in America? We would be in \na recession, in my judgment, because it has contributed so much that it \nhas essentially negated a lot of the other bad policies that have kept \nAmerican job growth nearly flatlined otherwise.\n  Given all of that, it would be my hope based on this evidence--not \nbased on my comments or my arguments but based on the evidence--we \nshould be doing everything in Washington to support this revolution, or \nsome have called it a renaissance. Call it what you will, but it has \nsupported American job creation and lowered energy costs and helped our \neconomy.\n  So why not embrace an energy policy that is progrowth, projobs, and \nproconsumer, an energy policy that is consistent with our environmental \ninterests but serves our economic interests as well and our strategic \ninterests. That means, in part, doing what I said earlier; that is, \nblocking regulations that do not pass a simple cost-benefit analysis. \nIt means streamlining the regulatory process here in Washington so \nthese projects can go forward on a\n\n[[Page S2699]]\n\ntimely basis. It means approving job-creating proposals such as the \nKeystone XL Pipeline.\n  Many of us have seen, in horror, some of the accidents that have \noccurred on the railways, where tanker cars have derailed, catching \nfire, only to learn that in the absence of adequate pipeline capacity, \nthat is the way the oil moves. It moves along the railroad lines in \ntankers, and sometimes accidents happen, unfortunately.\n  But we need the Keystone XL Pipeline, which will create tens of \nthousands of new jobs. It will mean we have a safe source for \nadditional oil, in addition to what we produce here in America, from \nour friends in Canada. For the opponents of the Keystone XL Pipeline \nwho think that somehow by denying approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline \nthis oil will not be produced and sold, well, it is going to be sold \nsomewhere. Canada is going to sell that oil abroad if it cannot sell it \nto the United States. That oil, when it comes down the pipeline, will \nend up in southeast Texas, in a lot of the large refineries there, and \nbe turned into affordable gasoline, fuel oil, and jet fuel, among other \nthings. We have offered amendments that will do that and more.\n  We will accelerate natural gas exports to our allies and trading \npartners. Think what Vladimir Putin might do if he knew he did not have \na stranglehold on Ukraine and Europe when it came to energy. Think what \nwould happen if they had an alternative--from American exports or \npipelines from other places--that could circumvent Russia and could \nheat homes, keep the lights on, and avoid this stranglehold Vladimir \nPutin and Russia have on so much of Europe. I think it would make him \nthink twice about his invasion of the Crimea and the threatening \nactions and the disruption which are taking place in Ukraine today and \nwhich could extend even further.\n  My point is that we have amendments to this underlying Shaheen-\nPortman energy conservation bill which are relevant to the topic of \nenergy production, albeit broader, which would do all these things. We \nare trying to offer some of these ideas, which I hope any fairminded \nobserver would say are constructive ideas. You may not agree with all \nof it--we may not even win a majority of the vote in the Senate today \non these amendments--but why in the world would the majority leader \ninsist on denying us an opportunity to have a fulsome debate on \nAmerican energy policy, not just conservation but on producing more \nenergy as well?\n  Unfortunately, though, he has given every indication that he will \nallow no votes on bipartisan amendments--and each of these amendments \nthat I have mentioned has bipartisan support. As a matter of fact, he \nhas indicated he won't allow votes on any amendments on this bill.\n  The distinguished Republican leader from Kentucky has pointed out \nthat since July this side of the aisle has only been allowed eight--and \nI think now we have gone back and looked at it--maybe nine votes on \namendments that came from the Republican side of the aisle.\n  Forget me, forget the prerogatives of an individual Senator, but \nthink about the fact that I represent 26 million people. What a \ntremendous honor and privilege it is but how unfair it is to my \nconstituents; how unfair it is to constituents--American citizens all--\nthat everyone on this side of the aisle represents to shut them out of \nthe process.\n  Someone called this the Harry Reid gag rule. That pretty well \ndescribes it when the minority is deprived of any right to offer \nconstructive proposals and to have votes and debate on these policies \nin the Senate. We used to call--well, I see the pages here, and I know \nthey go to school while they are pages. I bet if they go back and look \nin some of their history or civics books, it will tell them that the \nSenate is called the world's greatest deliberative body. No more. That \nis history.\n  If the minority can't offer constructive proposals that would \nactually improve the availability of American-produced energy, would \nhelp grow the economy, and would create jobs, no more is the Senate the \nworld's greatest deliberative body. Unfortunately, it is the result of \nthe decisions made by the majority leader.\n  When it comes to energy policy, I hope my friends across the aisle \nwill remember what I said about these back-door energy taxes hurting \nlower-income Americans, as well as our seniors who are on fixed income, \nbecause they are the people who can least afford paying higher energy \nbills or they are the ones who are least able to afford losing their \njobs.\n  We want to adopt on a bipartisan basis energy policies that are \nprogrowth, projobs, pro-environment, and proconsumer, but we will never \nget there as long as Majority Leader Reid decides to deny us an \nopportunity for a vote on relevant legislation.\n  This isn't just about inside Senate baseball, this is about one of \nthe Nation's most important governing institutions being able to \nfunction. This is about consent of the governed. That is the very \npremise upon which the legitimacy of the Federal Government exists; \nthat is, that the people--``We the People''--all 300 and some-odd \nmillion of us, have an opportunity to participate in the governing \nprocess by voting, by petitioning our elected representatives, and by \nadvocating that certain policies be embraced in Washington. You are not \npromised you will win every time, but you are guaranteed a right as an \nAmerican citizen to participate in the process. Yet that is being \ndenied at its most fundamental level when the majority leader decides \nto run this as an autocracy or a dictatorship or decides to impose his \nown gag rule on the proper functioning of what used to be called the \nworld's greatest deliberative body but is no more.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin).

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in the Record of May \n1, 2014, under ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, am I correct in assuming that we have now \nagreed to this resolution?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to thank my friends. It looks as \nthough the Chamber is empty here, but everyone had to sign off on this \nmeasure, and I want to explain what we just did. We passed a very \nimportant resolution expressing our support for the young girls who \nwere kidnapped in Nigeria.\n  As I think the world is learning, this is a horrific situation. \nKidnapping certainly has no place in any village, in any region, or in \nany country--not in our country. We know how we feel. We have seen \nkidnappings recently of\n\n[[Page S2700]]\n\nwomen held in captivity. There should be no room anywhere for \nkidnapping. Today we heard new reports that the suspected Boko Haram \ngunmen kidnapped eight more girls from the Nigerian village overnight. \nSo clearly the voices of the civilized world must rise and be louder \nthan the terrorists who are taking away basic human rights.\n  Senator Landrieu's resolution we just passed has many supporters on \nit, including myself. I am also pleased to hear today the \nadministration has committed to acting with the Nigerian Government.\n  As a mother and grandmother, my heart is with all those mothers and \ngrandmothers and dads and grandfathers who want their daughters and \ngranddaughters to come home safely. We cannot stay silent in the face \nof these unspeakable crimes. We are not silent today as a U.S. Senate.\n  I am so proud we have agreed to this resolution. I want to commend my \nfriend Senator Mikulski. She and Senator Collins have worked on a \nletter we are sending to the administration. I am about to go outside \nto be part of a vigil, an event that has been organized by the \nCongressional African Staff Association as well as the Congressional \nHispanic Staff Association and the Congressional Black Associates, and \nI am so proud of the Senate for standing for these girls. We will do \neverything we possibly can to get them home to their families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Boxer \nresolution calling for international action and aggressive action from \nour own government in terms of the rescue of 276 Nigerian girls who \nwere kidnapped from a boarding school their parents paid for them to be \nable to go to so they could learn.\n  It is an outrage that these 276 girls have been captured by the \nterrorist group Boko Haram. It is an outrage against these girls and an \noutrage in the international community, and we need to speak as a \nnation--women and men together--saying, what is this where a girl can't \ngo to school simply because she is a girl?\n  There is strong evidence that, as we speak, these girls are being \nsold into forced marriages and sexual slavery.\n  We, the women of the Senate, have written a letter on a bipartisan \nbasis calling for the President to have the Boko Haram group placed on \nthe international Al-Qaeda terrorist list and calling for sanctions to \nbe imposed against them. We are heartened by the fact that the \nPresident is sending a team to help the Government of Nigeria find \nthese girls, bring them home safely to their mothers and fathers, get \nthe bad guys, and send an international message: Leave girls and boys \nalone.\n  There are additional rumors coming out that schools where boys had \nbeen attending, simply because they are in Western-based education, are \nbeing burned down and that the boys' lives are in danger. What kind of \nworld is it where a parent, based on parental choice, can't send a \nchild to school without thinking they could be kidnapped, abused, sold \ninto sexual slavery, and so on?\n  We encourage the efforts by the U.S. Government to support the \ncapacity of the Government of Nigeria to provide security for these \nschools and to hold these organizations accountable. We urge timely \ncivilian assistance from the United States and allied nations in \nrescuing these girls.\n  Many of us believe there should be a regional African coalition to go \nin which knows the terrain to find these girls. But our President is \nsending military and law enforcement people to advise the Government of \nNigeria, which has been slow to respond. It is not my place to \ncriticize another President, but I wish they would have been more \naggressive in a more timely way. Now we are where we are, so I hope we \npass the Boxer resolution calling for international help.\n  I believe we in the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, should join the \ninternational voice calling for the rescue of these girls, the return \nof them home safely to their mothers and fathers, to capture and punish \nthe bad guys, and that there be an international effort to let children \nof the world be able to go to the school their parents choose for them \nto go.\n  I thank Senator Boxer. We are going to be working together. The women \nof the Senate are going to be meeting with Secretary Kerry, and I \nbelieve this is an issue worthy of our attention, worthy of our time, \nand worthy of our vote.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 6, 2014.\n     President Barack Obama,\n     The White House, Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: As the women of the United States \n     Senate, we are writing to you today deeply disturbed by the \n     abduction and mistreatment of more than 200 girls by the \n     terrorist group Boko Haram from the Government Secondary \n     School in Chibok, Nigeria. Boko Haram has threatened to sell \n     the girls as slaves, and some may have already been sold into \n     child marriages. We condemn these appalling actions in the \n     strongest possible terms, and we agree with you that the \n     abduction of these girls is an outrage. The girls were \n     targeted by Boko Haram simply because they wanted to go to \n     school and pursue knowledge, and we believe the U.S. must \n     respond quickly and definitively.\n       In the face of the brazen nature of this horrific attack, \n     the international community must impose further sanctions on \n     this terrorist organization. Boko Haram is a threat to \n     innocent civilians in Nigeria, to regional security, and to \n     U.S. national interests. The National Counterterrorism Center \n     (NCTC) has found that Boko Haram has engaged in multiple \n     attacks on Westerners and repeatedly targeted students at \n     schools and universities, threatening the ability of young \n     Nigerians, particularly women, to attend school.\n       While we applaud the initial U.S. condemnation of the \n     kidnapping, we believe there is much more that the U.S. \n     government should do to make clear that such an attack will \n     not be tolerated. We urge you to press for the addition of \n     Boko Haram and Ansaru to the United Nations Security \n     Council's al-Qa'ida Sanctions List, the mechanism by which \n     international sanctions are imposed on al-Qa'ida and al-\n     Qa'ida-linked organizations. Their addition to the List would \n     compel a greater number of countries to sanction Boko Haram, \n     joining several countries, such as the United States, which \n     have already done so. General David Rodriguez, Commander of \n     U.S. Africa Command, identified Boko Haram as an al-Qa'ida \n     affiliate, and the Department of State reported that the \n     group has links to al-Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb when it \n     designated Boko Haram as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter. We look \n     forward to working together until girls and women worldwide \n     can pursue an education without fear of violence or \n     intimidation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Barbara A. Mikulski,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Susan M. Collins,\n       U.S. Senator.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/06/senate-section/article/S2700-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2700-S2706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n ENERGY SAVINGS AND INDUSTRIAL COMPETITIVENESS ACT OF 2014--MOTION TO \n                           PROCEED--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                         College Affordability\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about one of the \ngreat crises facing our country; that is, the high cost of college, and \nthe fact that hundreds and thousands of young people who are bright and \nwish to get a higher education have now decided that, because they do \nnot want to leave school deeply in debt, they are not going to go to \ncollege. What a loss that is, not only to the individuals and the \nenhancement of their own lives, but it is a loss to our Nation because \nin a highly competitive global economy we need the best educated \nworkforce possible. The fact that college is becoming a distant dream--\nan unreachable dream--for millions of families is a horrendous \nsituation which this Congress must address.\n  Over the last 10 years, the cost of attending a public 4-year college \nhas increased by nearly 35 percent at a time when middle-class incomes \nhave remained flat and, in fact, many families have seen a decline in \ntheir incomes. Of the students who do go to college, hundreds of \nthousands graduate with significant debt--on average, over $27,000.\n  This morning I was talking to a staffer of mine who is $119,000 in \ndebt. And what was her crime? How did she accrue that debt? Did she go \non a spending spree? Did she lose her money in a gambling casino? Her \ncrime was that she wanted to go to law school, and she\n\n[[Page S2701]]\n\ncame out of law school $150,000 in debt. Today that is down to \n$119,000. I have talked to doctors and dentists who are now several \nhundred thousand dollars in debt.\n  The important point to make is there was once a time in the United \nStates when that kind of college and graduate school indebtedness did \nnot exist. Only a few decades ago this country made a commitment to our \nstudents that if you worked hard, if you studied hard, and if you \nwanted to pursue a higher education, you could do so at little or no \ncost. That was what we used to do. Unfortunately, in that very \nimportant area we have regressed, and regressed significantly.\n  Until the 1970s, at the City University of New York, one of the \nimportant and best educational systems in the country, the cost was \ncompletely free. The University of California system, one of the \nlargest and best university systems in the world, did not begin \ncharging tuition until the 1980s. In fact, in 1965, average tuition at \na 4-year public university was $243.\n  We know we are living in a highly competitive global economy, and if \nour Nation is to succeed, we need to have the best educated workforce \nin the entire world. But the sad truth is we are now competing against \nother nations around the world that make it much easier for their young \npeople to go to college and graduate school than is the case in the \nUnited States of America.\n\n  According to a report released last year by the OECD--the \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development--the United \nStates was one of the few advanced countries in the world that did not \nincrease its public investment in education over the last decade.\n  From 2008 to 2010, most advanced countries experienced significant \neconomic decline as a result of the Wall Street collapse. Despite that, \nthe vast majority of countries increased educational spending by 5 \npercent or more. The United States was one of the few nations to \ndecrease overall educational spending.\n  I live about 1 hour away from Canada in northern Vermont. In Canada, \naverage annual tuition fees were $4,200 in 2010--roughly half of what \nthey were in the United States--and yet the OECD says Canada is one of \nthe most expensive countries for a student to go to school.\n  Germany, an international competitor of ours, is in the process of \nphasing out all tuition fees. Even when German universities did charge \ntuition, it was roughly $1,300 per student.\n  According to the European Commission in 2012, the following countries \ndo not charge their students any tuition--and these are countries we \nare competing against. These are countries where young people go to \ncollege without any out-of-pocket expenses. Those countries are \nAustria, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Scotland, and Sweden.\n  In Europe, university systems enjoy a very high level of public \nfunding. The EU average is 77 percent. In other words, in countries \nthroughout Europe--Austria, Belgium, Denmark, and all of the rest--what \ngovernments understand is that investing in higher education is \nterribly important for the individual students and their families. But, \nin addition, it is enormously important for the competitive \ncapabilities of those countries.\n  So countries such as Austria, Belgium, Denmark, each put in more than \n88 percent of public funding into their universities. In the United \nStates, the number is 36 percent. Countries all over the world that \ndon't provide free higher education pump significantly more into their \nuniversity systems than we do.\n  The result is several very significant points. First, we have many \nworking-class and middle-class young people who are looking at the \neconomic picture we face as a nation and looking at their own lives, \nand they are saying: Do I want to go to college and leave school \n$50,000 or $60,000 in debt? How am I going to pay off that debt once I \nleave school?\n  Many of these young people, tragically, are saying: I don't want to \ntake that risk. I don't want to leave school deeply in debt. I will not \ngo to college.\n  What a tragic situation that is for our entire country, because we \nare losing the intellectual potential of all of those young men and \nwomen.\n  Second, those who do go to college are coming out of school with an \nincredible chain of indebtedness around their neck, which impacts every \naspect of their lives. It determines what kind of jobs they will get. \nWill they do the job they had hoped to do their whole lives--their \nlife's dream, the work they were looking forward to doing or are they \ngoing to gravitate to those jobs which simply pay them a lot of money \nand enable them to pay off their debt?\n  For the first time in our country's history, American families have \nmore student debt than credit card debt, and that is an extraordinary \nreality. All over this country families are struggling with debt in a \nway they never have before. The average loan balance for American \ngraduates has increased by 70 percent since 2004. Average student debt \nis now near $27,000. In Vermont, it is even higher at $28,000. One in \neight borrowers is carrying more than $50,000 in student debt. The \npercentage of families in the United States with outstanding student \ndebt increased from 33 percent in 2005 to 45 percent in 2010.\n  The bottom line here is we have a huge crisis which is impacting \nmillions of individual families and individual young people. But from a \nnational perspective, it is a crisis which is impacting our \ncompetitiveness in the global economy.\n  There was once a time, not so many years ago, when we had the best \neducated workforce in the world and we had a higher percentage of \ncollege graduates than any other country on Earth.\n  That is not the case today. I think we have got to do some very hard \nthinking about the crisis regarding college affordability and the \ncrisis regarding student debt. If this country is to remain \ninternationally competitive in the global economy, we need some bold \nideas in terms of how we address these crises.\n\n  I can tell you that in Vermont, as I speak to young people around my \nState, this is the issue foremost on their minds. The young people in \nhigh school are wondering about how they can afford to go to college. \nThe students in college are worried about how they are going to pay off \ntheir college debt. Our job must be to say to every young person in \nthis country that if you are a serious student, if you study hard, you \nare going to be able to get a higher education regardless of the income \nof your family, and you are going to be able to get the best education \nour Nation can provide you based on your ability and not on the income \nof your family.\n  This is an issue of enormous importance to individuals around the \ncountry, but it is an issue of huge consequence for the economic future \nof this country. So in the coming weeks I will be introducing \nlegislation--I know there is a lot of other good legislation that is \ngoing to be coming to the floor--because this is an issue of huge \nconsequence, and it is an issue that must be addressed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  We are on the measure again, the Shaheen-Portman energy efficiency \nbill, also known as the Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness \nAct--an efficiency bill. This should not be this difficult for us. When \nwe talk about the benefits of an all-of-the-above energy policy--the \nbenefits that can come to us as a nation when we are more resilient \nwith our energy sources, when we are able to access our domestic energy \nsources, whether they be our fossil fuels, our renewables, or nuclear--\nwe all talk about it in good, strong terms because, quite honestly, \nenergy makes us a stronger nation, having access to our energy \nresources.\n  I have defined a good, strong energy policy as one that allows energy \nto be more abundant, affordable, clean, diverse, and secure. An energy \npolicy is also about the energy we do not consume. It is about the \nenergy we save because we are more efficient.\n  It seems we have gotten to a point, at least with some aspects of \nthis discussion, where somehow or other the\n\n[[Page S2702]]\n\nefficiency side of the energy discussion is a partisan debate; that \nRepublicans do not support energy efficiency. I cannot think of a more \nconservative principle than conserving energy. This is something we \nshould be embracing, and it is something, in terms of legislation that \nis sound, that is good to move forward, something that I support.\n  This bipartisan efficiency bill has been refined. It has been \nstrengthened. It has been improved over the past 3 years. There have \nbeen plenty of eyes upon this legislation. There has been plenty of \ndebate about it. We have a total of 13 Senators who are now on board \nwith it, an equal number of Republicans and Democrats. So I am pleased \nwe have this legislation back on the floor again.\n  The last time this legislation came before us was in September. I \nspoke then about the importance, the relevance to today, the many good \nreasons the Senate should support it. I am not going to necessarily \nrepeat all of those points this afternoon, but I do want to highlight \nquickly a couple of the main points.\n  The first is going directly to the policy side of it. Energy \nefficiency should be a broader part of our Nation's energy policy. It \nis good for our economy. It is good for the environment. It enables us \nto waste less, to use our resources more wisely. Who can object to \nthis? Who could possibly say this is not a good thing we should \nencourage?\n  And there is more. Think about what it does to help create jobs and \ndeliver financial benefits. Study after study shows we can save \nbillions of dollars every year through reasonable efficiency \nimprovements. Whether we are talking about small appliances or large \nbuildings, there are opportunities for gains in efficiencies throughout \nthe system.\n  The second reason for support of the bill is it envisions a more \nlimited role for the Federal Government. When I think about efficiency, \nI think the Federal Government should seek to fulfill three key roles. \nIt can act as a facilitator of information that consumers and \nbusinesses need. It can serve as a breaker of barriers that discourage \nor prevent rational efficiency improvements. As the largest consumer of \nenergy in our country, it can lead by example by taking steps to reduce \nits own energy usage.\n  This legislation helps us make progress in all of these areas, but it \nis appropriately tailored as well. It has a number of voluntary \nprovisions. It does not contain any new mandates for the private \nsector. I think that is worthy of repeating. There are no new mandates \nin this bill.\n  When the legislation was first introduced some time ago, there was \nsome concern about impact on building codes. But the provision related \nto model building codes is voluntary. It is not mandatory. No one has \nto benefit from it if they do not want to.\n  The third reason to support the bill is the cost--or, really, the \nlack of cost. We all know we are operating in a time of high deficits \nand record debt. The good news is this efficiency bill actually \nsubtracts from our spending rather than adding to it. The CBO has \nindicated it will yield a modest savings of about $12 million over the \n10-year window. Again, this is good from a policy perspective. It is \ngood from a fiscal perspective.\n  Then the last point is one I want to make in support of process. We \nhave followed regular order, as well as ``regular order'' can be \ndefined around here, but we have done that from the beginning with this \nlegislation. Those of us who serve on the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee reported it on an overwhelming bipartisan basis back in 2011, \nand then again in 2013. So it has gone through a fulsome committee \nprocess. Improvements were suggested and have been thoughtfully \nconsidered and incorporated. Many, many of the ideas are now \nincorporated in the text we have in front of us.\n  Then, finally, a few words about the amendments that are being filed \nto this bill.\n  When we last had this bill before the Senate, we were unable to reach \nagreement on amendments. We got bogged down and the bill was pulled \nfrom the floor. The Senate moved on to other matters. We are back again \nnow, and I really do not want to see a repeat of that experience. Quite \nhonestly, we do not need to.\n  It is certainly true a lot of amendments have been filed to the bill. \nWe had more than 100 last September. That should not be evidence that \nsomehow this bill is flawed. But what it recognizes is there is this \npent-up demand for a discussion on the issue of energy. There is a \npent-up demand to bring forward ideas and concepts and innovation and \npolicy when it comes to energy debate.\n  It has been more than 6 years since we have had anything more than a \nbrief debate. When you think about what has happened in the energy \nsector in the past 6 years, I say to the Presiding Officer, you are \nsitting in the chair coming from a State that has seen an amazing--an \namazing--boom when it comes to natural gas production in your State. \nYou have seen technologies come in that are able to access areas where \nyou did not even know you had the resource.\n  Think about the changes we have seen in the energy sector in 6 years. \nSix years ago we were talking about building LNG import terminals--\nterminals so we could bring LNG in from other countries. Now we are \npressing the case for greater LNG exports. We are trying to build out \nmore facilities so we can move this abundant resource from our shores \nto help our friends and allies around the world.\n  Six years ago, if I had stood on this floor and suggested to you we \nwere going to have a debate about the export of our crude oil from this \ncountry, you would have laughed me off the floor. Nobody was talking \nabout it. But look at what is happening, coming out of the Bakken up in \nNorth Dakota, what is coming out of Texas and New Mexico and out of \nCalifornia, Colorado, out of States in the Midwest. We are producing \nlike we have not produced in ages. We are doing so because we have the \nbenefit of good, strong technologies that are allowing us to access a \nresource safely and making sure we are being good stewards of the land \nwhile we are doing it, and creating jobs and opportunities.\n  So when you think about what has happened in 6 years, and the fact \nthat we have not had a real debate and conversation about energy, it is \nno wonder people want to present amendments. But we are in a situation \nnow where there is real debate about whether we are going to have any \namendments at all.\n  We have been sitting here in the Senate since last July--almost a \nyear--and there have been nine amendments allowed of the Republicans' \nchoosing to be heard, to be entertained, to be taken up on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  We are not asking for an unreasonable number. Given everything that \nis going on in the world, everything that is happening in the energy \nsector, it is understood why we would want an opportunity to present \namendments. But we are not asking for the Moon here. Out of all the \namendments filed to the bill, we are seeking votes on four of them. If \nwe were to take just 15 minutes per vote, with a little extra time for \nstatements in support or opposition, we could work those out in an \nafternoon.\n  There is no reason we need to stretch this out. Our other option is \nto spend the next several days arguing about whether we are going to \nvote at all. We are sent to the Senate to do good work, and this is a \nvenue where the work is demanding attention, so let's get to it.\n  Let's advance these measures. Let's get to the debate about whether \nit is LNG export opportunities, whether it is the advantage from many \ndifferent perspectives about the Keystone XL Pipeline, and about what \nmore we can be doing as a nation to be a world leader with our energy \nresources, accessing our resources for the good of Americans, the \ncreation of jobs to strengthen our economy, to help our trade deficit, \nto help our friends, and to help our allies. We can be in a position to \ndo so much more, but we have to be able to get beyond the discussion, \nthe debate about whether we are just going to talk about whether we are \ngoing to talk about it or whether we are going to get to it.\n  I am hopeful that throughout the afternoon, throughout tomorrow, and \nthroughout the balance of the week we will have an opportunity to \ndiscuss and to vote on amendments that are energy-related amendments \nthat will help move this country in a more positive direction when it \ncomes to our energy policy and attach that to a fundamental anchor of a \ngood, strong energy\n\n[[Page S2703]]\n\npolicy, which is energy efficiency, and that is what the Shaheen-\nPortman bill allows us to do.\n\n\n                          National Police Week\n\n  I want to pivot for a moment and move off the issue of energy \nefficiency. I wish to speak for a few more minutes this afternoon about \nNational Police Week.\n  National Police Week is a week to honor our fallen law enforcement \nofficers. It occurs next week. Next week in Washington, DC, we will see \npolice vehicles from all over the Nation. We will see officers in \nuniform, perhaps some with young kids in tow, flooding the Metro \nsystem. The survivors of law enforcement tragedies will gather in \nAlexandria, VA, for the annual meeting of Concerns of Police Survivors.\n  On Tuesday night, tens of thousands will gather at the National Law \nEnforcement Officers Memorial, and they will read by candlelight the \nnames inscribed on the memorial walls this year. On Thursday, the \nNational Peace Officers Memorial Day Service will convene on the west \nfront of the Capitol. These are all very moving tributes to our fallen, \nthose who have served in the line of duty and who honor us all.\n  For the past 11 years, I have made it a habit of honoring the fallen \nduring National Police Week, regardless of whether any Alaska law \nenforcement agency suffered a line-of-duty death during that preceding \nyear.\n  At times I have made note of a sad coincidence, a sad coincidence \nthat law enforcement tragedies in the twos and threes often seem to \noccur in close proximity to the annual National Police Week observance.\n  About this time 8 years ago, the National Capital Region was grieving \nthe loss of Michael Garbarino and Vicky Armel, the first Fairfax County \npolice officers to die from gunfire in the line of duty. In April 2009, \nPittsburgh lost three of its finest.\n  This year, as we anticipate the arrival of National Police Week, \nAlaska carries that tragic burden. Last week my home State lost two \nmembers of the Alaska State Troopers in a single incident.\n  On May 1, Alaska State troopers Sergeant Scott Johnson and Trooper \nGabe Rich flew from Fairbanks to the village of Tanana. Tanana is an \nAthabascan Indian community and there are about 238 people. Tanana sits \nat the confluence of the Yukon and Tanana Rivers. It is a strong \ncommunity, it is a resilient community, but it is a community that is \ntruly suffering right now.\n  Similar to most of the Alaska Native villages, the only full-time law \nenforcement presence in Tanana is a single, unarmed village public \nsafety officer. Law enforcement backup, when they are needed and called \nin, will fly to Tanana. Tanana is not accessible by roads, so basically \nthe only way in and out is to fly in and out, coming in from Fairbanks, \nso it is about a 1-hour flight away.\n  The village public safety officer asked for trooper assistance to \nrespond to an individual who had been waving a gun in the village. With \nno backup, other than the unarmed village public safety officer, \nSergeant Johnson and Trooper Rich attempted to serve a warrant on the \noffender. Both officers were shot and killed. The 19-year-old son of \nthe individual who was the subject of the warrant is now charged with \nthe shooting.\n  This is a horrible tragedy for Tanana, a tragedy for Alaska, and a \ntragedy for the entire law enforcement community.\n  Tanana is, as I mentioned, a small village. It is an isolated \nvillage. It has been a very resilient village. It is a very proud and a \nvery kind-hearted community. The Athabascan word for Tanana, known as \n``Nuchalawoya,'' means ``wedding of the rivers,'' and the village has \nplayed a very central role in Athabascan culture for thousands of \nyears.\n  But like many Alaska Native villages, it suffers from drug and \nalcohol problems. Last October there was a group of young people from \nthe village of Tanana, and they traveled to the Alaska Federation of \nNatives convention.\n  It is the largest gathering of Alaska Natives in the State, and they \ndid a very brave and heroic thing. They assembled on stage in front of \n4,000 to 5,000 people to tell Alaskans that they had had enough of the \npain and the violence, and they were determined to make their community \na healthier place. It was an amazing moment. It was inspiring. There \nwas not a sound to be heard in the huge Carlson Center in Fairbanks as \nthese young people spoke.\n  So inspiring were the words of these young kids that I wrote Attorney \nGeneral Holder and I asked that his department invest prevention \nresources in the village and others like it that were trying to turn \nthings around, trying to face the ugly side of what happens in a small \ncommunity when we have domestic violence and child sexual assault \nbrought on by drugs and alcohol.\n  Tanana is absolutely devastated by what happened last week. In the \nwords of Cynthia Erickson, who is the youth leader of the young people \nI mentioned, last week's incident amounts to two steps back in Tanana's \neffort to heal itself, but the healing process must begin and now is \nthe time for it to begin.\n  We remember fallen law enforcement officers for the way they lived \ntheir lives. Vivian Eney Cross, who is the widow of a fallen U.S. \nCapitol police officer, said:\n\n       It is not how these officers died that made them heroes, it \n     is how they lived.\n\n  In that spirit I wish to share with the Senate a little about the \nlives of our two fallen Alaskan heroes.\n  Sergeant Johnson was born in Fairbanks, and he grew up in the small \ncommunity of Tok, which is 150-plus miles out of Fairbanks on the road \nsystem. He went to school in the Tok community, and he was a wrestler. \nHe joined the Alaska State Troopers in 1993 after serving as a North \nSlope Borough police officer.\n  Sergeant Johnson spent his entire 20-year trooper career in \nFairbanks, where he rose through the ranks to supervise the Areawide \nNarcotics Team and ultimately the Interior Rural Unit. Sergeant Johnson \nalso was an accomplished canine handler and a leader of the regional \nSWAT team. We call it SERT in Alaska, the Special Emergency Reaction \nTeam.\n  His final assignment was leader of the Interior Rural Unit, a team of \nfour who respond to incidents in 23 Native villages. Sergeant Johnson \nassumed that role this year. His territory covered hundreds of miles \nend-to-end. Again, these are hundreds of miles without road access.\n  Sergeant Johnson was 45 years old. He is survived by his wife, \ndaughters aged 16, 14, and 12, and also survived by his parents and \nsiblings.\n  Trooper Gabe Rich was born in Pennsylvania. He moved to Fairbanks \nshortly after he was born. He graduated from Lathrop High School in \n2006. He was 26 years old at the time of his death.\n  Trooper Rich spent 4 years working as a patrolman with the North Pole \nPolice Department before deciding to become an Alaska State Trooper in \n2011. He is survived by his fiance, their 1-year-old son, and his \nparents. He was in the process of adopting his fiance's 8-year-old boy.\n  Sergeant Johnson and Trooper Rich were known to those who watched the \npopular National Geographic series ``Alaska State Troopers.'' \nUndoubtedly, those who have watched the two in action are also grieving \nthe loss, along with the people of Tanana and all of Alaska.\n  I think I speak for all in this body when I say we are shocked and we \nare saddened by the events in Tanana last week. On behalf of a grateful \nSenate and a grateful nation, I take this opportunity to extend my \ncondolences to all who held Sergeant Johnson and Trooper Rich deep in \ntheir hearts.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. We are going to have, as indicated, a briefing on Ukraine \nat 5:30 this evening. I alert all Senators we will do our utmost to \nstart at 5:30, and we must end at 6:30. We need everybody on time. If I \nam there on time, I am going to start it on time, and I will do my \nutmost to be there on time. People can be called upon for questions in \nthe order they show up at the meeting.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that at 5:30 p.m., the Senate \nrecess until 6:30 p.m. tonight for the purpose of an all-Senators \nbriefing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection.\n\n[[Page S2704]]\n\n                  Kidnapping of Schoolgirls in Nigeria\n\n  Mr. REID. I have had a number of titles, as all we Senators have over \nthe years, but the title that means the most to me has always been \n``Dad,'' ``Father.'' It is so important that my five children recognize \nme as their dad.\n  My oldest child is a daughter, Lana, but I also have 12 \ngranddaughters. As a father and grandfather, I can't imagine the horror \nof having one of these girls abducted, kidnapped, and stolen--even \nthough Nigeria is thousands of miles away from where we sit today.\n  My nightmare, our nightmare--we are always worrying about our girls--\nis a reality in Nigeria.\n  On the night of April 14, more than 250 girls--I don't know the exact \nnumber--were stolen from a school by a terrorist group called Boko \nHaram. These kidnappers, a cowardly group of men--thugs and \nterrorists--have announced their attention to sell the girls in the \nmarketplace.\n  It was only yesterday the leader of this organization was on \ntelevision saying we have them and we are going to sell them. How would \nthat make a mother or dad, family member feel? It is sickening to think \nthese girls are at the mercy of these slavers. These are terrible \nreports. Some say--some of the reports we get--some of the girls have \nalready been sold into Chad and Cameroon. I hope that is wrong.\n  So I, with my colleagues, join with the rest of the world in \nrenouncing these heinous acts.\n  We must remember that this crime is only one of the many acts of \nterrorism of this awful group Boko Haram. They have done it before \nagainst children, against civilians.\n  Today the United States offered its assistance to rescue these girls. \nGreat Britain has done the same, and other countries have as well. \nNigeria, in my opinion, has been reticent to receive help. That is not \nmy opinion, but that is what the public reports say. We want to help \nrescue these girls. We have some assets the Nigerians don't have, as do \nthe Brits and others who want to help.\n  I am concerned the Nigerian Government's response to this crime and \nto dealing with Boko Haram is very tepid. Nigeria has missed \nopportunities to collaborate with international partners to fight \nterrorism in this instance and other instances. Instead of carrying out \nits own operation--which has been very clumsy, and there has been a \ndisregard for human rights--they should let us help. Let the world \ncommunity help.\n  The Nigerian Government has been disastrously slow in responding to \nthese incidents--not on this one but on others. I urge the Nigerian \nGovernment to use all of its resources and accept international \nassistance to bring the abductors to justice. The world is watching. \nReturn these daughters to their families.\n  Today we adopted S. Res. 433, which condemned this abduction, to add \nour voices to those calling for their release. I especially thank \nSenator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and all other cosponsors for their \nhard work on this legislation. The Senate, along with the rest of the \nworld, will continue to do all we can to help our Nigerian friends. We \ncontinue to hope and pray for the safe return of these girls to their \nmoms and dads.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time in recess count \npostcloture on the legislation that is now being considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I very rarely am motivated to come to \nthe floor simultaneously with current events, thinking that it is \nimportant to reflect and learn as much as possible about a subject \nbefore one begins to orate about it on the Senate floor. I am making an \nexception, however, because of the extraordinarily heinous acts that \nhave occurred in the country of Nigeria.\n  I think it takes everyone's breath away in the United States of \nAmerica that a terrorist organization--Boko Haram--would attack a \nsecondary school in northeastern Nigeria and kidnap 200 girls. Most of \nthese girls are not that much younger than my daughters. These were \nyoung women who wanted nothing more than to get an education. We are \nnow told these terrorists have proudly proclaimed they will enslave \nthese young women, they will sell them as slaves. They are proudly \ntaking credit for this despicable and inhumane act.\n  I thank Senator Mikulski and Senator Collins for organizing a letter \nto the President to urge him to include Boko Haram in the United \nNations Al Qaeda sanctions list. I thank the other Senators who \nintroduced the resolution we passed this afternoon condemning this \nattack. But we have to do more.\n  It concerns me, honestly, that this is occurring in a country where \nthe leader not too long ago signed into law a measure that anyone \nentering into a homosexual relationship can be imprisoned for up to 14 \nyears. In this same country we have a terrorist organization capturing \nyoung women and enslaving them for dollars to be child brides, proudly \nproclaiming that it is a sin for these young women to want to get an \neducation, that this action was necessary to purge them of their sins \nand marry them off.\n  I understand it takes all kinds of people to make up this great \nworld. I understand there are all kinds of beliefs. But it is very hard \nfor me to get my arms around the notion that there could be any faith \nthat would believe kidnapping young women by the hundreds and selling \nthem as indentured slaves to men could ever be part of any kind of \nfaith that we should recognize. These are not people of faith; these \nare heinous criminals. I believe our country should look at them as \narchenemies of who we are as a nation and what we stand for as a \ngovernment.\n  The name of this organization means ``Western education is a sin.'' \nRespect for young women is not a sin. Wanting an education is not a \nsin. The opportunity to better oneself is not a sin.\n  These incredible crimes that have been committed should not go \nunanswered, and I think it is incumbent on our Nation, with the great \nresources we have, to make sure we send the appropriate message to the \nworld that this is Al Qaeda and this is our enemy--not just to our \nvalues and our way of life but, importantly, an enemy to innocent young \nwomen.\n  I wanted to come to the floor to make this statement because I cannot \nimagine how the parents of these young girls must be feeling and how \nhelpless the feeling must be. I can only hope and pray that the \nGovernment of Nigeria realizes this is a moment of truth for them. Will \nthey stand up to this kind of extremism that is not faith? They do a \ndisservice to their professed faith by these actions. Can this country \nstand up to them, can we help them stand up to them and, most \nimportantly, can we do anything to save these young women?\n  When I go to bed tonight I will, in my faith, thank God for my family \nand my children, and I will also ask for prayers for these young women \nin hopes they can be rescued, that they can be reunited with their \ndesire to get educated, and that their families will not have to spend \ndays wondering if they will ever see their children again or if their \nchildren will even survive.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport S. 2262, the Shaheen-Portman Energy Savings and Industrial \nCompetitiveness Act of 2014. The reason I do so is because I have long \nfelt we can't be for an all-of-the-above energy policy if we aren't \npromoting state-of-the-art approaches in terms of energy efficiency.\n  I think the Presiding Officer and I both know it isn't even a speech \nhere in the Senate on energy policy unless the Senator says they are \nfor an all-of-the-above at least three times every 15, 20 minutes. So I \nthink what Senator\n\n[[Page S2705]]\n\nShaheen and Senator Portman are doing is making it clear right at the \nstart that an all-of-the-above energy policy is their approach and \ntheir effort to pull as many as possible colleagues into innovative \napproaches in terms of promoting energy efficiency.\n  Senators Shaheen and Portman have been tirelessly pursuing this \nlegislation for 3 years now. I had a chance as the former Chair of the \nEnergy Committee to watch what they have been doing. I will walk back a \nbit to make sure colleagues understand how constructive their efforts \nhave been, both substantively and in terms of promoting collaboration \nhere in the Senate, in hopes that these commonsense energy proposals \nfor creating good jobs and a cleaner and healthier environment will \nprevail on a bipartisan basis here in the Senate.\n  With our colleague from Alaska, Senator Murkowski, I have had a \nfront-row seat over the last couple years to watch Senator Shaheen and \nSenator Portman in action and support their efforts. I think we should \nall be very appreciative of the job our new Chair, Senator Landrieu, is \ndoing--again, in concert with Senator Murkowski--because the two of \nthem continue the committee's tradition, No. 1, of working in a \nbipartisan way but, No. 2, trying again to promote collaboration here \nwithin the Senate to promote an energy approach, which I think is not \nonly common sense but it is absolutely essential in order to be able to \ngo on to the other energy policy issues that surely are likely to be \nmore contentious than energy efficiency.\n  To walk back a bit through what has happened, I think our colleagues \nknow an earlier version of this legislation passed our Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee last year by an overwhelming bipartisan \nmajority. It was then considered on the floor this past September, but \nit was blocked by demands for a vote on a health care amendment which \nhad nothing to do with the premise of the underlying bill. I happen to \noppose that amendment, but however a Senator feels, it has nothing to \ndo with energy efficiency and productivity.\n  When the bill stalled on the Senate floor last fall, it looked pretty \ngrim for the cause of energy efficiency, and essentially people were \nquestioning the Senate's ability to consider an act on a range of \nenergy issues which confront our country. I think a lot of people would \nhave thrown in the towel at that point. They would have said: We put in \nall of this work and effort to win such a strong bipartisan vote in the \nSenate; then we were ready to go to the floor and faced unrelated \nissues. And I could see why the sponsors would give up. But Senator \nShaheen and Senator Portman are not throw-in-the-towel type of \nSenators, and in effect they doubled down and went back to work on some \nof the most challenging issues.\n  So at that point, after the unfortunate setback of last September, \nthey in effect doubled down and worked to bring an even broader range \nof Members and stakeholders together here in the Senate to form a \nconsensus and make this bill even better, improve the array of \ncommonsense approaches taken to promote energy efficiency, and increase \nthe chance of the best possible energy efficiency bill becoming law.\n  I wish to highlight at this point how challenging this work was and \nhow pleased I was the Senate was able to get together.\n  At that point one of the most challenging issues dealt with the \nquestion of the then-existing requirements that new Federal buildings \nbe designed to phase out their use of fossil-fuel-generated energy by \n2030. This is important for a variety of reasons. Of course, the \nFederal Government is a major property owner in our country, No. 1. And \nNo. 2, I think we all look to the Federal Government at a minimum to \ntry to set some examples in terms of trying to deal with these issues.\n  In other words, it is fine for Washington, DC, to say: Everybody else \nwould do X, Y, and Z. But if they come back and say the Federal \nGovernment is not willing to set an example, it is pretty hard to have \nany credibility in terms of that particular field of public policy. The \nreality was that while well meaning, the existing requirement that new \nFederal Government buildings be designed to phase out their use of \nfossil-fuel-generated energy by 2030 was not working particularly well \nby anyone's calculus.\n  We had folks in the natural gas industry raising questions about \nwhether they would be able to participate. They made the point--one \nthat I think certainly has validity--that natural gas is 50 percent \ncleaner than the other fossil fuels. They were saying: Well, how are we \ngoing to be able to play a role with heating in Federal buildings, \nwhich, of course, as I indicated, is very significant both because the \nFederal Government owns so much property and because of the example the \nFederal Government sets.\n  So reaching an agreement on how to balance repeal of this provision \nin existing law--well meaning, but not working very well--with the \naddition of provisions to enhance efficiency in Federal buildings \ninvolved innumerable meetings--meetings that I participated in \npersonally and others were involved in that went on literally for \nmonths with all of the stakeholders--the electric and gas utility \nindustries, the environmental advocacy organizations, the energy \nefficiency groups--all of them in discussions that took place over \nconference calls and in-person meeting after meeting.\n  I would submit that had those groups not been able to come together--\nand I believe they deserve great credit because they did--I think it \nmay have been right at that point very difficult to advance this bill \nbecause we would have generated, for the first time, significant \nopposition around the core issue. Whether it be environmental groups or \nelectric and gas groups, we would have had significant friction over an \nimportant public policy issue, which is how to promote renewable energy \nto the greatest extent possible in new Federal Government buildings.\n  I will say to colleagues who may be following this, a number of times \nin these discussions I thought things were going to blow up. I thought \none or more of these groups would walk out and say: We will take our \nchances on the floor; we believe we are going to win, and if it takes \nthis bill down, so be it. But they stayed at the table and they worked \nout an agreement.\n  As a result of their agreement--environmental organizations, those in \nthe advocacy of energy efficiency and a variety of industry groups--the \neffort produced a significantly better bill, and a bill that now \nincludes some very important and powerful additions.\n  For example, as a result of rewriting the provision that new Federal \nGovernment buildings be designed to phase out the use of fossil-fuel-\ngenerated energy, very substantial financial savings were generated so \nas to be able to include some very sensible and potentially far-\nreaching changes in the energy efficiency field. For example, as a \nresult of that agreement it is possible to take some of the financial \nsavings generated in that redo of the requirements for renewable fuels \nin Federal energy building and include in the legislation that is now \nbefore the Senate, the SAVE Act, a bipartisan proposal championed by \nour colleagues Senator Isakson and Senator Bennet. This provision would \nfor the first time facilitate the accounting of energy efficiency in \nresidential mortgages. A report by the American Council for an Energy-\nEfficient Economy and the Institute for Market Transformation estimates \nthat this proposal alone would create 83,000 new jobs in home \nconstruction, renovation, and manufacturing by 2020. These are jobs for \nAmerican workers that cannot be outsourced. The agreement on Federal \nbuilding efficiency would also extend the 3 percent-per-year Federal \nbuilding efficiency target through 2017 and expand the coverage of this \nefficiency target from new buildings to include major renovations as \nwell.\n\n  So what we have is a good bill that got out of committee. It was a \ngood bill last September that I would have liked to have seen pass this \nbody at that time. After it was not possible to move it forward, we had \nthe chief sponsors, Senator Shaheen and Senator Portman, work \ncontinually to try to advance this legislation and broaden its appeal. \nWhen they bumped up against a really serious problem, which was to fix \nthis policy with respect to the requirements for renewable energy in \nFederal buildings, they worked with a variety of groups and \norganizations and were able to make the bill better.\n  I wish to thank a number of Senators who were behind this effort to \nredo the\n\n[[Page S2706]]\n\nrequirements for new Federal buildings--in particular, our colleagues \non this side of the aisle, Senator Manchin and Senator Whitehouse, and \non the other side of the aisle I wish to thank Senator Hoeven. They \nwere very involved in the nuts and bolts of redoing this legislation. \nSuffice it to say that the three of them would be the first to say they \ndon't agree on every possible energy policy subject matter. Yet the \nthree of them came together, worked with this coalition of groups I \nhave described, and made significant improvements in the already good \nbill after September. As a result of their work, we have generated \nfinancial savings that made it possible to include the Isakson-Bennet \nlegislation on residential mortgages, which is a very significant and \npositive development in the energy efficiency field.\n  This is not a small matter, taking bold steps to improve energy \nefficiency in residential mortgages the way our colleagues Senator \nIsakson and Senator Bennet have done in a bipartisan fashion. The \nreason this efficiency legislation is back is because it is sensible \nand has bipartisan appeal. It is about cutting waste and creating jobs. \nPassing this legislation would be the biggest step in years toward \ntapping the enormous potential of energy efficiency, which is the most \nsensible and cheapest energy source America has.\n  Here are the most relevant figures with respect to the benefits of \nthis bill. The bill will save about 2.8 billion megawatt hours of \nelectricity by 2030, according to the American Council for an Energy-\nEfficient Economy. To translate this into something people can put \ntheir arms around, if we are going to generate 2.8 billion megawatt \nhours--and that is the projection for this bill--our country would have \nto build 10 new nuclear powerplants, at a cost of billions of dollars \neach, and run them for more than 20 years. An additional provision of \nthe bill updates and promotes voluntary model building codes, making \nresidential and commercial buildings more efficient through the \ninstallation of new equipment, insulation, and other efficiency \ntechnologies. There is money to be saved and there is energy to be \nsaved. That is the kind of work this legislation accomplishes.\n  What I have described is possibly not the most flashy of stories we \nmight be contemplating here in Washington. It might not be at the top \nof every single account on the nightly news, but businesses understand \nhow valuable this is. Businesses understand that there is money to be \nmade here. That is why more than 250 companies and associations endorse \nthe bill, including the chamber of commerce, which I think would be the \nfirst to state that they don't see themselves as a bleeding heart \nenvironmental organization. I was struck by a headline in forbes.com \nnot long ago that read ``The Shaheen-Portman Energy Savings Act: It's \nthe economy, stupid.'' Forbes, a prominent business publication, got it \nright.\n  If Congress can pass this bill, it would immediately become one of \nthe largest job-creating efforts the Senate will enact this year, \ncreating an estimated 192,000 new jobs by 2030. It can also make a \ntremendous difference in our country's economic competitiveness, \nbringing savings to businesses and families, reducing demands on our \nelectric grid, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Having watched the development of this legislation as the former \nchair of the Energy Committee and now chair of the Finance Committee, I \nthink every Member of the Senate understands how important it is to \nsecure a cleaner, more efficient, job-creating energy future. This \nlegislation provides that opportunity. It was a good bill when the \nSenate considered it last September, it is an even better bill tonight, \nand to a great extent it is made better because colleagues such as \nSenator Joe Manchin and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and Senator Hoeven \nhave worked together on a very contentious matter involving renewable \nenergy in Federal buildings. It is the latest demonstration of good \nwill and comity that has dominated this debate, at least as it relates \nto the substance of discussing energy efficiency legislation.\n  I thank our chair Senator Landrieu for the first-rate job she has \ndone not only on this but on the matters before the Energy Committee. I \nalso thank my good friend and colleague Senator Murkowski for the same \nsorts of efforts she made to work with me as the chair and Senator \nLandrieu. I think those efforts are going to pay off. Let's make sure \nthey pay off immediately with the Senate this week moving forward and \npassing the bipartisan Shaheen-Portman legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                      Tribute to Larry Walker, Jr.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a dear \nfriend of mine who last Friday, at the joint spring meeting in Las \nVegas, received the American Bar Association's Solo, Small Firm and \nGeneral Practice Division's 2014 Lifetime Achievement Award.\n  Larry Walker is a lawyer in Perry, GA. He is a lifetime resident of \nPerry and went back to his hometown of Perry to practice in 1965. I am \nso proud that Larry has been recognized by his peers--of which I am \none, as a practicing lawyer in Georgia before I came into government. \nLarry epitomizes what lawyers look to when you think of someone who is \na good lawyer.\n  The award he received recognizes solo and small firm attorneys who \nare widely accepted by their peers as having significant lifetime \ndistinction, exceptional achievement, and distinction in an exemplary \nway. Winners are viewed by other solo and small firm practitioners as \nepitomizing the ideals of the legal profession of solo and small firm \npractitioners.\n  Larry began his law career, as I say, in 1965 when he came back to \nPerry to practice law. He became a judge of the Perry Municipal Court \nat the age of 23. In 1972 Larry ran for the General Assembly of Georgia \nand won the seat that was formerly held by soon-to-be-Senator Sam Nunn. \nHe served in the General Assembly until 2005. In 1986 he was elected \nmajority leader of the Georgia House of Representatives and served in \nthat capacity for 16 years. He was the founding member of Walker, \nHulbert, Gray & Moore and served as chair of the State Legislative \nLeaders Foundation. Larry also represented Georgia's Eighth \nCongressional District on the Georgia Department of Transportation from \n2007 to 2009, and in August of 2009 he was appointed by then-Governor \nSonny Perdue to the University System of Georgia Board of Regents, \nwhere he continues to serve today.\n  Larry writes a weekly column for the Houston, GA, Home Journal and is \nthe author of a book entitled ``Life on the Gnat Line,'' a composition \nof Larry's widely read columns on family, everything southern, reading, \npolitics, and, of course, just folks. Larry is a frequent speaker at \nvarious community and State events, including continuing legal \neducation seminars.\n  Larry has been my dear friend for over 30 years. He is not just a \ngreat lawyer, he is a great guy. He and I have had the opportunity to \nknock down a quail bird or two in the woods of South Georgia. We have \nhad discussions late into the night over politics and life in general. \nLarry is one of those individuals who make life fun and who are a \npleasure to be around, and that is why I am so excited the American Bar \nAssociation has seen fit to recognize Larry's talents, his hard work, \nhis dedication, and his integrity to the law profession. He has been \nsuccessful not because he moved to his hometown where he was well \nknown; he has been successful because he is looked at as someone who \npossesses all the finest characteristics a lawyer can hope to have.\n  I am indeed privileged to call him a dear friend. I am indeed \nprivileged to have an opportunity to say to Larry and to his wife \nJanice, congratulations. This kind of award shows that people all \nacross this great country recognize you, Larry, for the great work you \nhave done in our profession for all of these years since you first hung \nout your shingle in June of 1965.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/06/senate-section/article/S2706-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2706-S2707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Sixty-nine \nSenators, including about half of our Republican caucus, 21 \nRepublicans, supported an 11-page bill--a rarity in this body--that is \nabout just two words, and the words are ``States rights.''\n  The Marketplace Fairness Act, simply described, gives States the \nright to decide for themselves whether to collect or not collect State \nsales taxes that are already owed. This ability to collect taxes that \nare already owed would give States the option to reduce existing taxes \nor to avoid a new tax or to pay for services without raising taxes.\n  The Marketplace Fairness Act closes a tax loophole that prefers some \nbusinesses over other businesses and some taxpayers over other \ntaxpayers. Out-of-State businesses are being subsidized because they \ndon't have to collect sales taxes--taxes that are owed--and local \nbusinesses do. As a result, some taxpayers are being subsidized because \nsome pay sales taxes and others do not even though they may owe the \ntaxes. That is not right, and it is not fair. This legislation, which \npassed the Senate 1 year ago, gives States the option to decide whether \nto change that.\n  One of the best ways to lower State taxes is for the Federal \nGovernment to allow States to collect State sales taxes from everyone \nwho owes the tax and not just from some of the people who owe the tax.\n  We have an honor roll of conservatives who do not think States ought \nto have to play ``Mother May I?'' with the Federal Government on this \nquestion. For example, Al Cardenas, chairman of the American \nConservative Union; Art Laffer, President Reagan's favorite economist; \nCharles Krauthammer; Representative Paul Ryan; Governor Mike Pence, a \nformer Member of the House of Representatives; Governor Chris Christie; \nformer Governor Jeb Bush; former Governor Mitch Daniels; and the late \nWilliam F. Buckley, not to mention Governor Bill Haslam of the State of \nTennessee, agree that recognizing the power of State legislators to \nmake these decisions for themselves is consistent with the 10th \namendment and our constitutional framework.\n  In our State of Tennessee, the Marketplace Fairness Act is an \ninsurance policy against a State income tax. We don't have a State \nincome tax and we don't want a State income tax.\n  The House of Representatives has not yet acted on this bill. The bill \nthat was passed a year ago today by the Senate was an overwhelming \nbipartisan vote. We are hopeful that the House will soon either enact \nour bill, which we have sent to them, or send us their version of the \nbill so we can confer and send a result to the President of the United \nStates.\n  State and local governments have been waiting on Congress to solve \nthis problem for more than 20 years--since 1992 when the Supreme Court \nsaid Congress has the ultimate power to resolve the issue. Now is the \ntime to act on this legislation. We are ready to work with the House to \nenact that legislation this year.\n  In conclusion, I will read the comments of Al Cardenas, chairman of \nthe American Conservative Union and former chairman of the Florida \nRepublican Party. When talking about the Marketplace Fairness Act, Mr. \nCardenas said,\n\n       When it comes to state sales tax, it is time to address the \n     area where federally mandated prejudice is most egregious--\n     the policy towards Internet sales, the decades-old inequity \n     between online and in-person sales as outdated and unfair.\n\n  Again, that was Al Cardenas, chairman of the American Conservative \nUnion, speaking in support of the Marketplace Fairness Act.\n  I am pleased that of the four Senators who will be on the floor \nduring this colloquy, two are already here. I see the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, and I see the Senator from Wyoming. If it is all right \nwith the Senator from Wyoming, I will defer to the Senator from North \nDakota. While the Senator may be a little modest about this--I hope she \nis not--she actually started it all. She has a better view of the \nMarketplace Fairness Act than just about anyone because of her service \nin the State government of North Dakota. She has an ability to explain \nin plain and simple language why the fair and right thing to do is to \nrecognize the rights of States to make these decisions for themselves. \nHer ability to do that has been a crucial part of our debate and is one \nof the reasons why we had such overwhelming bipartisan support in the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, first I want to say what an honor it has \nbeen for me to participate in any amount of leadership on this issue \nhere on the floor of the Senate with such incredible leaders as Senator \nAlexander, Senator Enzi, and Senator Durbin, who have long recognized \nthe injustice that is being done to Main Street businesses and the \nproblems we have in terms of States rights and making sure we maintain \na system that recognizes the value of States rights and the value of a \nState prerogative so they can make their own taxing decisions without \ninterference from the U.S. Senate or anyone in the Federal Government.\n  As Senator Alexander has explained, when I first came to this body, \nSenator Durbin suggested to his staff that they try to find out where I \nwould be on this issue because my predecessor, Senator Dorgan, had been \nvery active with this coalition of leaders on addressing this problem, \nand his staff suggested that he might want to read the caption on the \nQuill case since there was the name ``Heidi Heitkamp'' in that caption.\n  The reality is that back in the late 1980s and early 1990s, we saw \nthis phenomenon of increased catalog sales. I am not talking about \ncompanies such as Sears that had a physical presence in the community \nand could thereby collect sales taxes but more and more boutique types \nof catalogs. There was more and more competition coming from catalogs.\n  I had more and more Main Street businesses coming to me as the tax \ncommissioner asking: How is this fair? How is it fair that I started my \nlittle business--whether it was a wallpaper business or a fabric \nbusiness, whatever it was--and people come to my store and look at my \nsample books that I actually have to pay for, test out the quality of \nthe fabric, take a lot number, and leave and order it from the catalog?\n  That was a pretty horrible thing to happen to Main Street businesses \nback in the late 1980s.\n  Can you imagine walking into a Main Street business now and not only \ngetting advice and information on how the product operates and what the \nwarrantees are--not to mention all the training these Main Street \nbusinesses have given their employees--but then taking a snapshot of a \nbarcode so you can order it on the Internet right there in the store? I \ncan only imagine how discouraging this is for Main Street businesses. \nIt is unfair to Main Street businesses when they are asked to support \ntheir communities, such as putting the ad in the little high school \nnewspaper or contributing to a football billboard or the local fire \ndepartment so they can serve their communities.\n  If you think of all the things Main Street businesses do, they are \nnot just involved in retail, they are involved in communities. Yet \nthose Main Street businesses are not asking for an unfair advantage; \nthey are asking for fairness and equity. They are asking that when \nsales tax rates have gone up from 8 percent to 9 percent because the \nbase dwindles--you have to raise the rate in order to collect the same \namount of money--they are being basically taxed out of the marketplace \nthrough this\n\n[[Page S2708]]\n\nunfair advantage that remote sellers have against them by not having \nthe obligation to collect a tax that is honestly already owed.\n  I want to reiterate a couple of points Senator Alexander was making \nbecause I think it is so important. One of the arguments we hear \nconsistently about marketplace fairness is that it is a Federal \nimposition of a tax. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is a \ntax that is already owed. This is a tax that is owed to the States. It \nis owed by the people who make these purchases--a sales and use tax. We \nare doing nothing more than telling every State: If you want to pursue \nMain Street fairness, you have a path forward.\n  If a State doesn't want to tax or put a collection responsibility on \nremote sellers, there is nothing in this bill that requires them to do \nthat.\n  This is a States rights bill, but it is also a fairness to Main \nStreet businesses bill. It is a bill that would make sure that the \npromise of an equitable tax system in this country is fulfilled. This \nbill is a promise that if you play by the rules and do everything the \nway you should as a business, no one is going to get an advantage over \nyou, and we are going to level the playing field. There is no level \nplaying field when somebody has a 10-percent advantage over you simply \nbecause you actually invested in a community, put up bricks and mortar, \ntrained a sales force, and yet you are going to be the disadvantaged \none.\n  When we started this a year ago, we were joined by all manner of \nretailers, but I will never forget the story of a young woman who had a \ndream. She loves animals and pets. She trained herself in pet nutrition \nand opened a pet nutrition store in Missouri--it might have been Kansas \nor Missouri because it was in the Kansas City area. When you combine \nState and local taxes where her business is located, the tax rate was 9 \npercent. People would come to her store and explain the ailment or \ncondition of their pets, and her very excellent sales staff would tell \nthem what product was best for their cat or dog. She knew when they \nwalked out, they simply ordered it on the Internet because she could \nnot give them a 10-percent discount. That is what happened in her \nbusiness.\n  We told her that if she had a small Internet business with $1 million \nin sales, she would have to collect taxes too. She said: I would be so \nhappy to collect a sales tax if I had $1 million in Internet sales; \nthat would mean I was winning.\n  If you think about that and the mom-and-pop businesses--just a couple \nof kind of myth-breaking things about how this is truly going to affect \nsmall business. This is not going to have any effect at all on any \nbusiness if we pass the bill we passed that has gross sales below $1 \nmillion. We have a threshold.\n  The other myth is that they are going to be subjected to millions of \naudits and millions of tax rates. The streamlined process has proven \nover and over that this is not higher math. We can get this done.\n  I have a story from the time we did the original Quill case. It got a \nlot of national attention, and there was a lot of discussion about \nthis. I had a reporter from the Omaha World Herald call me. He said he \nhad just called a major retailer to order some new shirts, and the \nretailer he was talking to had been very active in opposing the Quill \ncase and very active in opposing what we were trying to do. One of \ntheir arguments was that they could not possibly know the tax rate on \nthat shirt in his jurisdiction. When he ordered his shirt, he told the \nperson on the other end of the phone his size, and that person said: \nYou know, maybe you want to check because last time you ordered, it was \na size 15.\n  This reporter said to me: If they can know my shirt size, they could \nprobably figure out the tax rate of the jurisdiction I live in.\n  Think about it. It has only gotten easier.\n  One of our major retailers, which is adamant about how this would be \nthe most horrible and onerous thing, offers a package for $15 if anyone \nwants to collect the tax.\n  The other fallacy here and one of the myths I want to break is that \nif I went to sell my old used lawnmower on the Internet, I would be \nsubjected to sales tax. I think it is only natural that this body \ndoesn't have a lot of experience in sales taxation. It is not what we \ndo. It is what State and local governments do. It is what people who \nhad my former job do. However, there is such a thing as casual sales. \nIf are you not in the business of being a retailer in every State, you \nhave no collection responsibility. It is only retailers, only people \nwho are in the business of retailing and only people who have retail \nsales over $1 million who would be affected. And we have streamlined \nthe process. We have made this possible. It is a small thing to ask for \nus to take an action in this body and in the House of Representatives \nto tell Main Street businesses that they still matter in the \nmarketplace and that we are going to listen to them and we are going to \ndo everything we can to get them fairness and justice in our tax \nsystem.\n\n  So, again, I congratulate the excellent leadership that has come \nbefore me on this floor on this issue. I pledge once again to do \neverything we can to get this marketplace fairness done in this \nCongress so that our Main Street businesses don't have to wait a day \nlonger for tax justice in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for her eloquent \nstatement and for her leadership. I am delighted that she has gone from \nbeing a caption on a lawsuit to a Senator who can help us pass this \nbill. In just a moment I will yield the leadership of this colloquy to \nthe assistant Democratic leader, but I wish to say a word about the \nnext Senator speaking and about Senator Durbin as well.\n  Senator Mike Enzi is the real pioneer on the Marketplace Fairness \nAct. He knows what he is talking about. He is a shoestore owner from \nWyoming. He knows what it is like for someone to come in and try on a \npair of shoes and then go home and order them on the Internet and \ndisadvantage a smalltown owner of a shoestore as compared with an out-\nof-State business. He has diligently and systematically lead this fight \nthe whole time, and it was due to that diligence that the Senate had \nthis overwhelming bipartisan achievement one year ago today. I thank \nhim for his leadership.\n  Now I recognize the assistant Democratic leader. The truth of the \nmatter is, the way the Senate works, we would never have been able to \npass this in the Senate with such fine fashion if it hadn't been for \nthe leadership of the assistant Democratic leader, Senator Durbin of \nIllinois. I thank him very much for his leadership and congratulate him \nfor it, and I am glad to turn the leadership of the colloquy over to \nhim.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Alexander for the leadership \nhe has shown on this bill. We had a much more extensive bill designed, \nand I worked on it for all of the years he mentioned, which is all the \nyears I have been here, 17 years. We made some progress every single \ntime it came up, but there were misconceptions with it. Senator \nAlexander suggested the solution that is the true solution for this \nbill. He changed it to a very brief States rights bill, not a Federal \nbill. This doesn't have any requirements for any State, but it has an \nability for States to make up their own mind.\n  So I rise today with my colleagues from Illinois, Tennessee, and \nNorth Dakota to recognize the anniversary of this significant event. \nOne year ago today, with a show of strong bipartisan support, the \nSenate took an important step forward to level the playing field for \nall retailers that collect sales taxes. But it is not really about the \nretailers; it is about the people who work in those stores. We are \ntalking about middle America. They can't afford to have the employees \nunless they make the sales, and if they just do the sales pitch and \nthen it is ordered online, there is no revenue the employee brought in, \nand if there is a prolonged period when there is no revenue, the \nbusiness doesn't need the employee. This bill is about supporting the \njobs we have in our towns. It is about the people who are our neighbors \nwho work in the stores and the people who have the stores that \nparticipate in all of the community events.\n  As the Senator from North Dakota said--and she is probably the only \none\n\n[[Page S2709]]\n\nwho has worked on this bill longer than I have because she was involved \nin it in State government when she was in North Dakota. I appreciate \nher expertise on this bill. Without some of the explanations she was \nable to give on the history of this bill, we wouldn't have been able to \nget it done.\n  Of course, Senator Durbin and I have been speaking for what seems \nlike years now trying to explain how this bill works, taking into \nconsideration any concerns people had and trying to overcome those \nconcerns. I couldn't guess how many hundreds of meetings there have \nbeen over trying to get this bill right and to get it fair, all so the \nStates still have the revenue they need to operate without imposing \nperhaps a personal income tax. In the case of Virginia, I think they \nare not going to raise the gas tax if this bill passes. So this is a \nStates rights bill. It takes money to the States, and it is money that \nis really owed right now.\n  I did a little checking. Wyoming started collecting their sales tax \nin 1935, and it has been virtually unchanged since that time. There is \na provision in the sales tax law that requires a form, so that if \nsomeone buys something from out of State and didn't pay sales and use \ntax on it, they are supposed to fill out this form before the end of \nthe month and send the sales and use tax with the form to the State \ngovernment to pay it.\n  One of the surprises I discovered is there is about $1\\1/2\\ million a \nyear collected in Wyoming that way--people obeying the law. But that is \npretty tough to keep track of and especially if one doesn't make out-\nof-State purchases every day. So the State, of course, imposed on local \nretailers the requirement that they collect sales tax, and then people \ndon't have to fill out that form. They don't have to send it in before \nthe end of the month.\n  So they made it a lot easier by making the retailers collect the \nmoney. Unfortunately, they weren't able to make all of the retailers \ncollect the money. Because of a court case, they aren't able to do it \nout of State, and that is very important because it is a huge loss of \nrevenue. I think Wyoming actually loses about $23 million a year \nbecause of purchases over the Internet where no sales tax is paid.\n  On May 6, 2013, this Chamber passed the Marketplace Fairness Act, and \nwe passed it with 69 votes. Some of the votes we had were as high as 76 \nvotes. That is very significant around here. Sixty-nine is an \nincredible number for the Senate to produce on any bill. It came from a \nmajority of both sides of the aisle, which is important. I wish to \nremind my colleagues that this bill is about fairness. It is about \nleveling the playing field between brick-and-mortar and online \ncompanies, and it is about collecting that tax that is already due. It \nis not about raising taxes. It isn't about taxing the Internet, and it \nisn't about taxing Internet access. I think we are all opposed to that. \nBut we are in favor of the States, if they wish, to be able to collect \nthe taxes they have imposed on the people who live in their State. So \nit is a States rights bill.\n  In a nutshell, the Marketplace Fairness Act is a straightforward, 11-\npage bill that brings clarity to a vexing area of sales tax collection \ninequity. Online sales often go without collection of the sales tax \nfrom the point of purchase, while the Main Street stores and the other \nbrick-and-mortar stores in town typically face established collection \nprocedures--no choice, regular reports.\n  Wyoming shouldn't subsidize online retailers that operate and sell to \npeople in our State. Neither should Illinois or North Dakota or \nTennessee or any other State that has sales tax laws. But right now, \nonline retailers can offer lower prices than the local businesses that \nhire the local people who pay the property taxes and that participate \nin the community events; the most important thing being those local \njobs, simply because they do not have to charge the same sales tax out \nof State that all our local merchants do.\n  Sales taxes are important. They pay for the roads we drive on. They \npay for the schools our kids go to. In Wyoming, with the particularly \nsmall towns, they rely on sales tax for the fire protection and the \npolice protection. When people ask me about the sales tax bill, I ask \nthem what county they are from and, if it is a small town, I say: Check \nwith your fire department and see if, without sales tax, they would be \nable to function. When people understand it is part of their fire \nprotection and part of their law enforcement protection, they are much \nmore interested in it and understand why the sales tax needs to be \ncollected. I don't want to see a situation where other taxes will have \nto be raised to cover basic local services because the online retailers \nare not collecting the sales taxes that are owed on the products they \nsell.\n  I remember going into a camera store--I try to get into some stores \non the weekend and find out what kinds of decisions they have to make, \nparticularly decisions that have to do with the Federal Government. I \nwas in the camera store and the fellow was explaining he had just lost \na sale. The sales tax rate in that town is 6 percent. A man came in to \nbuy a camera, and the camera was $2,000. But this owner of the store--\nthe only employee of the store--took the time to help him with all of \nthe different gadgets and how to operate it, and showed him what he \nneeded and how to do it. Then the customer took a picture of the bar \ncode and ordered it online because he saved $120. Technically, he still \nowed $120 to his State. Whether he filled out one of those forms and \ngot it in by the end of the month, I doubt it, but that is the law. If \na State meets the simplification requirements outlined in the bill, it \nmay choose to require collection of sales taxes that are already due at \nthe point of purchase, including sales conducted through e-commerce. \nCongress is not forcing States to do anything because the Federal \nGovernment should not have the role or authority in telling a State how \nto manage its finances. This bill specifically says that it is up to \nthe States to enforce the law, and it is 100 percent optional. If the \nStates do act, they are collecting taxes that are already due by the \nconsumers.\n  I have been working on this sales tax fairness or marketplace \nfairness issue--or any of the number of names we have had on it through \nthe years as we gained more and more support and as people came to \nunderstand more and more of what was involved--since 1997. As a former \nsmall business owner, it is important to ensure parity for all \nretailers by modernizing rules for sales tax collection in a way that \nrespects technology advances and the existing practices of large and \nsmall and more traditional businesses, and this bill accomplishes that. \nIt uniquely balances the interests of all businesses and respects the \nexisting laws and rights of states.\n  The Senator from North Dakota mentioned there is a $1 million \nexclusion. This is to help out small businesses, new start-up \nbusinesses. If you have a start-up business or a small business, until \nyou have sold $1 million online or through a catalog in a given year, \nyou don't have to comply with this. But once you hit that $1 million \nmark, you can consider yourself a success. We know that is a very small \npercentage of the Nation, but an important part of the total sales of \nthe Nation. I think that is why one year ago, 68 of our Senators joined \nme in supporting that Marketplace Fairness Act.\n  This evening, my lead cosponsors and I are again taking a stand in \nfavor of good public policy for our Nation's retailers while \nhighlighting the need to fix some long-standing sales tax system \ncomplexities. By balancing this collection inequity, the Marketplace \nFairness Act would help States ensure the viability of the sales tax as \na major revenue source for State budgets. We found in Wyoming that it \noften constitutes 40 percent of a municipality's revenue. It also would \nclose opportunities that encourage tax avoidance.\n  Beyond the walls of Congress, the Marketplace Fairness Act has \nreceived broad support. Trade associations, Governors, mayors, \nlegislators, and numerous businesses have expressed support for the \nlegislation.\n  But there is work still to be done. Our colleagues in the House need \nto pass the Marketplace Fairness Act. I know some Members in the other \nChamber are working on this issue. A companion Marketplace Fairness Act \nhas been introduced. A hearing has been held, and new Members are \nengaged in the issue. I appreciate those efforts, and I hope our \ncolleagues in the House will pick up the baton and complete the effort \nto guarantee sales tax fairness. This is the year to finish the work. \nOur States and businesses and\n\n[[Page S2710]]\n\nemployees in those businesses cannot wait longer. Enacting the \nMarketplace Fairness Act is the right thing to do.\n  In conclusion, I wish to thank everyone associated with this bill for \ntheir hard work and efforts in getting us to this point: our countless \nsupporters across the country, the 68 Senators who joined me to vote \nfor a bill a year ago, the 29 cosponsors of the bill for their support, \nand especially my colleagues who joined me tonight for their unwavering \nsupport of this bill. I can't thank Senator Alexander, Senator \nHeitkamp, and Senator Durbin enough for their efforts. I am going to \nyield the floor and turn it over to Senator Durbin who has been a real \nchampion and one of the best explainers of the parts of this bill that \nI have ever run into. I really appreciate his efforts and his help. We \nwouldn't be this far were it not for his efforts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Donnelly). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague from Wyoming. \nThe most frequently asked question, no matter where I appear in \nIllinois or at fundraising events, is, Why can't you folks get along in \nWashington. What is it like to be in a place where everybody is at one \nanother's throats and you can't accomplish anything? Why can't you do \nthings on a bipartisan basis? What is it like today, and how do you \ncompare it to what it was like a few years ago?\n  I say to them there are times when we do come together and do \nsomething important. This is one of those times--the Marketplace \nFairness Act.\n  It was 1 year ago that Senator Enzi led the fight on this. I do not \nknow exactly when he started it, but I was happy to join in, in his \neffort, when Senator Byron Dorgan retired. I called Senator Enzi and \nsaid: I would like to step in and help you with this bill. He said: \nLet's do it. We brought in Lamar Alexander, who made some valuable \ncontributions to it. Then along comes Heidi Heitkamp, the new Senator \nfrom North Dakota. Was she ever ready for this fight--a former sales \ntax commissioner in that State and a former attorney general. She knew \nthis issue inside and out. She has been a terrific ally.\n  So there were the four of us. What an odd grouping: two Republicans, \ntwo Democrats from literally all over the United States. We worked \ntogether, and 1 year ago today we passed this basic bill, the \nmarketplace fairness bill. The reason for passing it was just look at \nthe name of it: fairness.\n  I think about two people when I think about this bill. One of them is \nthe mayor of Normal, IL. His name is Chris Koos, a great friend of mine \nand a terrific mayor. Chris, in addition to being the mayor, runs a \nshop where he sells running shoes and bicycles and lots of running \nequipment and stuff.\n  So I visited his shop, a great little shop. He is a terrific \nbusinessperson. He told me a story, which I have heard over and over, \nabout people coming in, picking out the bicycle, picking out the shoes. \nThat is perfect. Let me try them on. Let me get out and ride this. Then \nthey say: I will get back to you. And he never sees them again. They \nturn around and buy the product on the Internet. So Chris is running a \nshowroom as much as a business. There is no fairness there.\n  When those sales are made on the Internet, instead of in Chris Koos's \nshop, there is no revenue coming back to the city of Normal, IL, or \nMcLean County. That is Chris's story, but it is the story of thousands, \nmaybe millions, of businesses across America that are losing out now to \nInternet competition that is not collecting the sales tax that is \nsupposed to be paid.\n  Then I met another man. I will not disclose the name of his company, \nbut he is a major retailer in the United States. He came to visit me in \nmy office in February or March, and he said: I want to tell you, in \nthis last Christmas season, which is the biggest time of the year for \nmy big-box business, we had a downturn of 8 percent in sales. Based on \nour projections, we thought for sure we would have more sales. We had a \ndownturn of 8 percent. He said: I lost them to the Internet. Senator, I \ncan't stay in business this way. I can't run a showroom for people who \nwant to sell things on the Internet.\n  What we are talking about is the basic collection of sales tax for \npurchases on the Internet. In my State--in virtually all the States \nwith a sales tax--there is a legal obligation to pay it. I did not \nrealize that until a few years ago. My bookkeeper was doing my family \ntax return for my wife and myself. She called and said: Senator, do you \nwant to pay the taxes you owe on Internet purchases? I said: Yes, I \nthink I want to pay the taxes I owe. She said: Well, how much did you \nbuy on the Internet? I said: I will try to put it together. I called \nher back, gave her a number. She said: Here is the calculation. On your \nState income tax return we will declare that you are going to pay X \ndollars that you owe for Illinois sales tax for purchases you made on \nthe Internet. When I said: Is that what I am supposed to do? She said: \nYes. We did it. We have done it every year since.\n  It turns out only 5 percent of Illinois taxpayers fill in that line \non a State income tax return. I am guessing more than 5 percent of \ntaxpayers make Internet purchases. But folks do not know their \nobligation, they do not follow through on their obligation, and the \nlosers are, of course, our State and local units of government.\n  This bill says, if Illinois, if Indiana, if Wyoming wishes, on a \nvoluntary basis, they may use this bill to start collecting sales tax \nwhen it comes to Internet sales into their State. It is voluntary. The \nStates have to decide to do it. It is not a new tax. This has been said \nover and over: It is the existing sales tax wherever it may be--in your \nState, county or city--existing sales tax.\n  The bill provides if you are an Internet seller and have less than $1 \nmillion worth of sales in a given year--whether it is Grandma \nDonnelly's applesauce or whatever it happens to be--you are not covered \nby this, but if you have more than $1 million, yes, you have to collect \nthe sales tax.\n  How can you collect it? First, the States have to provide you with \nthe software so your business does not run into the expense of how to \ncollect it. You say: I bet that is an elaborate undertaking. You can \nbuy the basic software to identify the sales tax based on the \nconsumer's address for about $15 for the basic package or maybe a \ncouple hundred dollars at the most.\n  But in this situation the States are going to help the Internet \nretailers in developing the software so that when someone makes a \npurchase from Chicago, IL, or Springfield, IL, whoever is selling to me \non the Internet will then forward that sales tax to the Illinois \nDepartment of Revenue. End of story. It is just that simple.\n  What it does, of course, is level the playing field for bricks-and-\nmortar businesses, providing a new source of revenue that should be \ncollected and is owed legally in these States to the local units of \ngovernment.\n  We passed this with enormous support from the retail community. It is \nnot surprising. And it just was not the shop owners. It is people who \nunderstand the importance of this. This has been said over and over: \nThese bricks-and-mortar shops around America do so much more than just \nsell a product. They are citizens in the community, corporate business \ncitizens in the community. They participate. When the local high school \nis having their graduation program and they want somebody to help \nsponsor it, they will go down to the local sporting goods store for a \nhelping hand on the program. That happens over and over. Whether it is \nKhoury League or Pop Warner, they are in there helping in the \ncommunities.\n  Isn't it important and fair that they be treated fairly here? Sixty-\nnine Members of the Senate thought so. Democrats and Republicans voted \nfor it--Senator Enzi and I, Senator Alexander and Senator Heitkamp. We \nhad 29 cosponsors of this bill who sat down and said: Let's pass it.\n  We passed it. We sent it to the House of Representatives, and nothing \nhas happened--nothing. There have been some statements made over there, \nand I hope those statements lead to action, but it is time for them to \npick up this bill and this responsibility. If they have a better \napproach, let's see it. Let's work on it. Let's do it on a bipartisan \nbasis. Let's come up with an approach that works.\n  I cannot tell you how many different businesses have come through my \ndoor--from Sears, Roebuck down to just basic mom-and-pop businesses--\n\n[[Page S2711]]\n\nand said: What are we going to do about the House of Representatives? \nThey just will not take up this measure.\n  I hope they will. They still have time to do it. We have waited 1 \nyear. I do not want to wait much longer. In an election year, it will \nbe almost impossible to do it.\n  So I hope we can get this done. It is going to mean that local \nbusinesses that are important and the backbone of our community are \ngoing to have the resources they need because the sales will take place \nthat otherwise are not taking place today, and the local units of \ngovernment will receive the proceeds from the sales tax that is \ncollected.\n  One of the major marketplace retailers on the Internet is Amazon. \nAmazon may be the biggest. They support this bill. If you ask them why, \nthey say: We don't want to fight this battle in 50 States and all the \ndifferent cities and counties as to how much sales tax. Let's just make \nit uniform across the country.\n  That is what the bill does. So Amazon supports this. They are \nprepared to collect that sales tax and remit it to the States. They do \nnot believe it is an onerous burden that they are going to face. I hope \nothers will join them.\n  As I have said, 1 year ago today Members of the Senate did something \nwe don't do enough. We put aside the partisan differences that cause so \nmuch gridlock around here and came together to pass bipartisan \nlegislation--the Marketplace Fairness Act. On this day last year 69 \nMembers of the Senate agreed that we need to help create jobs, invest \nin our communities, and keep Main Street alive and able to compete.\n  The Marketplace Fairness Act levels the playing field for retailers \nby allowing States to treat brick-and-mortar retailers the same as \nremote retailers in the collection of State and local sales and use \ntaxes.\n  Those that benefit under our current system--retailers that have a 5- \nto 10-percent price advantage over their competitors on Main Street--\nwant to continue the status quo. But it is not fair to the thousands of \nMain Street businesses that have worked hard to grow their businesses \nonly to become showrooms because of this price advantage. People come \nin, look around, even try on merchandise, and then leave and buy the \nproduct online.\n  This happens many times because sales and use taxes are not collected \nwhen a product is purchased online, so it seems cheaper. But we all \nknow the tax is still owed by the customer. In Illinois about 5 percent \nof customers end up paying that tax.\n  Abt Electronics, a retailer in Glenview, IL, knows about this \nchallenge all too well. It is president, Michael Abt, said that ``often \ntimes with consumer electronics, the profit margin is 10 percent or \nless . . . when an online competitor doesn't collect taxes and then \noffers free shipping, it's a huge advantage for the competition.''\n  Abt is one of the lucky ones--it is a fine example of a successful \nAmerican business that has continued to grow since opening in 1936 and \nsupports about 1,100 jobs. It also has an online presence so it can \nreach even more customers.\n  But there are others that haven't been so lucky.\n  Soccer Plus in Palatine is an example of what happens when it becomes \ntoo difficult to compete with online retailers that have a 5- to 10-\npercent price advantage.\n  A year ago when Soccer Plus went out of business we lost good-paying \njobs. And Palatine lost a business that was a part of our community.\n  There is nothing we can do now for Soccer Plus. But we can still help \nthousands of retailers avoid the same fate as Soccer Plus by leveling \nthe playing field for Main Street retailers.\n  Since the Senate passed the Marketplace Fairness Act 1 year ago, the \ninequity between Main Street retailers and online retailers has only \nincreased as e-commerce has grown.\n  Online retail spending grew 14 percent last year alone, to $263.3 \nbillion, and is estimated to reach over $300 billion in 2014.\n  Unlike 20 years ago, or even 10 years ago, we are no longer talking \nabout a few online retailers without access to the technology necessary \nto collect sales and use taxes. We are talking about hundreds of \nretailers, many of which are large billion-dollar businesses that have \na price advantage over small Main Street businesses because they don't \ncollect sales and use taxes.\n  It is time we update our laws so they match our 21st century \nmarketplace.\n  Retailers in Illinois can now reach customers all over the country \nthrough this new marketplace and software has been developed to \ncalculate sales and use tax for every jurisdiction in the country--yes, \nall 6,000 of them.\n  It is time to end this idea that technology can't handle calculating \nsales and use taxes. Many retailers are already using this technology \nto collect and remit these taxes and similar technology to calculate \nshipping costs. This is especially true when talking about online \nretailers who by their very definition use technology to sell their \nproducts.\n\n  The internet and e-commerce is no longer a baby in its crib. The baby \nis all grown up, running at full speed, and using outdated laws to \nthreaten Main Street businesses.\n  The Senate passed a bill to update our laws and correct this inequity \n1 year ago. The bill was supported by over 280 business, State, local, \nand labor organizations, both progressives and conservatives alike.\n  Yet the House has done little more than hold a hearing which was \nadded to the long list of hearings already held on this issue over the \nlast 20 years.\n  Each week that the House doesn't act is another week that Congress is \npicking winners and losers--the losers being Main Street retailers, the \njobs these retailers provide, and the communities these businesses \nsupport.\n  Recently, 1,064 of these businesses sent a letter urging Chairman \nGoodlatte to move legislation to address the inequity they face every \nday. Many of these businesses were from the chairman's home State of \nVirginia.\n  How long can we expect our small businesses that are partners in our \ncommunities to stay in business when we are tying one hand behind their \nback?\n  I urge them to hold on as long as possible, but the only real \nsolution is for Congress to act.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues in the House, Chairman Goodlatte, and \nothers, to give Main Street retailers a fighting chance by passing \nsales tax fairness legislation as soon as possible.\n  We welcome the opportunity to work with our House colleagues so that \none day soon we can offer businesses and States a solution to level the \nplaying field for retailers that is simple and fair.\n  In closing, I want to recognize the work Senators Enzi, Alexander, \nand Heitkamp have done on this issue.\n  Senator Enzi introduced the first bill more than a decade ago to \nlevel the playing field because he understands firsthand, being a \nformer retailer, how unfair this is for Main Street retailers.\n  Last year when we passed the Marketplace Fairness Act we came one \nstep closer to leveling this playing field by allowing States to \nrequire both brick and mortar retailers and online retailers to play by \nthe same set of rules.\n  It will ensure that Main Street businesses, like Abt, have a fighting \nchance and no more stores will have to close because of the current \ninequity they face.\n  Again, I urge the House to pass sales tax fairness legislation. I \nhope that the House Judiciary Committee will move forward in the coming \nweeks and offer any help I can give.\n  I am not going to take much longer. I think we have covered the \nsubject well, and I thank Senator Enzi from Wyoming, as well as Senator \nHeitkamp from North Dakota, and especially Senator Alexander from \nTennessee for kicking this off.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this article by \nDonnie Eatherly. Donnie is the president of P Distributors in \nTennessee. He is also a member of the Alliance for Main Street Fairness \nSmall Business Advisory Board. He wrote this article on May 6 that is \nentitled: ``It's Time To Level The Playing Field For Main Street \nBusinesses,'' and it is a good article. It says, in the simplest terms, \nwhat he, as a businessman, sees this issue to mean.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S2712]]\n\n                       (Commentary, May 6, 2014)\n\n    It's Time To Level the Playing Field for Main Street Businesses\n\n                          (By Donnie Eatherly)\n\n       Small-business owners like myself have for years urged \n     Congress to create a level playing field that will allow us \n     to compete with our online-only competitors. One year ago \n     this week, the Senate overwhelmingly passed legislation that \n     would accomplish this goal, and we're counting on the \n     Republican-led House of Representatives to do the same.\n       Thanks to an antiquated tax loophole, large out-of-state \n     online retailers can avoid collecting state sales tax on \n     purchases made by residents in my state, which gives them a \n     significant 9.75 percent competitive advantage over \n     traditional brick-and-mortar shops that follow the law and \n     collect those taxes.\n       To fix this unfair system, a bipartisan group of 69 \n     senators last year passed the Marketplace Fairness Act, a \n     common-sense reform that would ensure all businesses play by \n     the same rules. Unfortunately, the legislation has stalled in \n     the House.\n       As each week passes with no action, brick-and-mortar \n     businesses continue losing sales to a common practice known \n     as ``showrooming,'' in which customers browse and test items \n     at local stores and then head home to buy them online knowing \n     they will not have to pay state sales tax.\n       For many small businesses such as mine, every sale counts \n     and losing this revenue hurts our ability to grow our \n     businesses and hire new employees. We cannot wait any longer \n     for a federal solution to this problem.\n       Main Street business owners are not asking for a handout, \n     and we're certainly not afraid of competition from the big \n     guys. But it simply does not make sense for out-of-state \n     online retailers to enjoy such a big competitive edge over \n     local businesses that give back to their communities.\n       Despite what some have said about the Marketplace Fairness \n     Act, this is not a new tax, nor does it create any taxes. \n     These taxes are already on the books, and the legislation \n     would simply give states the necessary tools to collect them. \n     As conservative Republican Rep. Steve Womack of Arkansas has \n     said, ``It's not new, it's due!''\n       Not only does this level the playing field for all \n     businesses, but it would also put additional revenues in \n     state coffers to fund vital services such as education and \n     public safety. Importantly, the legislation also includes a \n     $1 million exemption on remote sales so to put that into \n     perspective, over 99 percent of all online sellers will not \n     be affected by this legislation in any way. In other words, \n     all the mom and pop stores who do business on the Internet \n     don't have to worry about it.\n       Additionally, for the less than 1 percent of online sellers \n     who will be subject to collecting sales and use taxes under \n     this bill, the legislation requires each participating state \n     to provide free tax software that will allow them to quickly \n     and efficiently calculate, collect and remit sales tax. The \n     proposal also includes liability protections for sellers and \n     limits against audits.\n       This reform is long overdue, and Main Street businesses \n     cannot wait any longer for help. For those who believe in \n     state's rights and the basic principle of limited government, \n     we should all agree that Washington, D.C., should no longer \n     be in the business of picking winners and losers in the \n     marketplace.\n       It's time for the House of Representatives to stand up for \n     the small businesses in their districts, follow the Senate's \n     lead and finally pass marketplace fairness.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. So let's get together. We did it in the Senate on a \nbipartisan basis, with a big vote--some 69 votes. We can do it in the \nHouse of Representatives. Let's get something done this year that is \ngoing to help businesses across America be profitable and hire more \npeople, put more folks to work across the United States.\n  At this time, I yield the floor to my friend from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Illinois \nfor his excellent explanation. I have been joining him and watching him \ndo that for several years. It would be nice to get this finished.\n  There are a few things we may not have mentioned that are sometimes \nraised when people ask me about marketplace fairness. One of them is \nfrom small towns. They say: We have to go on the Internet because there \nis not enough selection in our town and we can get things we cannot buy \nin town and some of the things we can get at a lower price by going out \nof town.\n  I always ask them, when they are figuring that lower price, are they \nfiguring it without sales tax or with sales tax, because it is not \ntruly a lower price if what you are doing is just cheating your local \nmerchant out of the right to collect the sales tax--which he does not \nget paid for anyway--and submitting it, when the out-of-State retailer \ndoes not have to do that.\n  As to the revenue that companies are voluntarily collecting now--and \nthere are a number of them that recognize it is difficult for everybody \nto keep track of their purchases, so they voluntarily collect it--the \nquestion I have had is, Does that money they voluntarily collect go \nback to the States? Yes, it absolutely does, and it will work that way \nunder the bill as well. It is not money that you are just sending to \nwherever you ordered it from. You are sending it to where it was \nordered from, and then they are sending it back to States.\n  That is what these programs the Senator from Illinois mentioned do. \nThey keep track of what State all the purchases were from. Here is how \ndifficult that is. When you call in your order or you do it online, at \nsome point you have to put in an address with a ZIP Code. That ZIP Code \nis all the program needs in order to be able to assess your tax. That \nis how those programs are designed. So if you have to give an address, \nyou have to give the ZIP Code. If you have to give the ZIP Code, they \nalready know what the tax is going to be. So there is no difficulty for \nany size retailer to be able to figure out what the tax is they are \nsupposed to be doing.\n  Another argument I hear is the online place provides free shipping. I \nwant you to know your local retailer provides free shipping and \nimmediate pickup. Somebody had to pay the shipping on it. It got to the \nstore, and you can pick it up right there, instantly. You do not have \nto wait 2 or 3 days or pay a special rate to get it overnight. You can \nget it right then.\n  One of the things that is discouraging for retailers is, if you \nwaited on somebody and they got the barcode and they ordered it online \nand it came in and it was not exactly what they wanted, then they come \nto you and say: Well, this is the brand you are selling. Won't you take \nit back?\n  Let's see, they did not make anything on it, they used a whole bunch \nof time, and now they want you to put it in your inventory. That is \nvery discouraging.\n  So think about those local clerks. They are your friends and \nneighbors who are being hired locally who really depend on a job. If \neverything gets ordered online, they will not have a job. Your friends \nwill have to move, and you will not have as much selection as you have \nright now in your local store.\n  Again, I wish to thank all those who voted for it, all those who have \nworked on it, and all those who are considering voting for it the next \ntime they get it because I know we have picked up some momentum since \nwe did it last time. There are people who have heard from their \ncommunities now who say: Well, I did not vote right last time, but I \nwill get it right next time. I am looking forward to that, and I am \nlooking for the House to finish it and send it to the President.\n  Thanks again, I say to Senator Durbin, for his tremendous effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor and recognize the \ncareer of Ken Dugan, center director of the Sierra Nevada Job Corps. \nKen is retiring this month after spending 39 years in the Job Corps \nprogram, 36 of which as a center director. Throughout this time, Ken \nhas worked tirelessly to help improve the lives of at-risk teenagers \nand young adults through vocational and academic training.\n  When Ken started his first assignment with the San Jose Job Corps in \n1975, he never envisioned that almost 4 decades later he would be \nretiring with the organization. However, Job Corps and its mission soon \nbecame a way of life for him. After stints as center director at the \nSan Jose and Hawaii Job Corps centers, we in Nevada were extremely \nfortunate to have Ken take over as center director for the Sierra \nNevada Job Corps, the only Job Corps center in the State. During his 19 \nyears\n\n[[Page S2713]]\n\nwith Sierra Nevada, Ken oversaw the relocation and new construction of \nthe center, the third time he had done so with a center. The new \ncenter, with Ken at its head, has greatly enhanced the living and \nlearning environment for thousands of students over the years.\n  During his unprecedented 36-year tenure as a center director, the Job \nCorps centers Ken has run have been honored with numerous performance \nawards from the U.S. Department of Labor, not to mention Recognition of \nPerformance and Community Value awards by the legislatures and \nCongressional delegations of California, Hawaii, and Nevada. On behalf \nof the U.S. Senate, I commend Ken Dugan on a lifetime of public \nservice, and wish him the best in all his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/06/senate-section/article/S2713-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AROOSTOOK ASPIRATIONS INITIATIVE\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I would like to engage my fellow Senator \nfrom Maine in a colloquy regarding a new citizen-led education \nenterprise in our great State, the Aroostook Aspirations Initiative, \nAAI.\n  Aroostook County, where I was born and raised, is defined by an \nextraordinary work ethic and the enduring spirit of its people. It is \nMaine's northernmost and largest county, and its economy depends on an \nable and educated workforce. Too often, the goals of hard-working \nstudents in Aroostook County are impeded by the costs of higher \neducation and the complexities of choosing a career. Thanks to the \nextraordinary commitment of Ray and Sandy Gauvin, those obstacles are \nbeing addressed in dramatic and dynamic ways.\n  Cognizant of the needs of students and indebted to a community that \nenabled their own success, the Gauvins have designed a multifaceted \nprogram aimed not only at educating but also empowering students in \nAroostook County. Through AAI, they have established a scholarship \nfund, launched by their own generous donation, for high school students \nseeking postsecondary education. These scholarships target economically \ndisadvantaged and first-generation college students throughout the \ncounty. AAI collaborates with the University of Maine at Presque Isle \nand at Fort Kent, the Northern Maine Community College, Husson \nUniversity, area businesses and entrepreneurs to offer seminars to \nguide students throughout their postsecondary education. Students can \nalso team up with Aroostook County employers through a cooperative \ninternship program that gives them practical experience in careers they \nwould like to pursue. These internships help lay the foundation for \ninvaluable relationships with professional mentors.\n  I am extremely proud of the Gauvins, the business leaders with whom \nthey have joined forces, and the accomplished students they have \nsupported and will continue to assist through this wonderful program. I \nam confident that this initiative will enrich Aroostook County, its \nfamilies, its future workforce, and its economy.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the comments \nof the senior Senator from Maine. I, too, am proud to commend the \nAroostook Aspirations Initiative, AAI, and the Gauvin County \nScholarship Fund for their efforts to increase educational and economic \nopportunity in Aroostook County. AAI's partnerships with all 16 of the \ncounty's high schools and all 4 of the county's institutions of higher \neducation serve as a model of what forward-thinking private citizens, \nschools, colleges, universities, and businesses can accomplish when \nthey set out to better their communities.\n  The initiative takes on the goal of increasing access to education \nfor first-generation college students and those from lower income \nfamilies, clearly critical in its own right as a matter of fairness and \npairs it with measures designed to harness the benefits these students \nwill bring to the local economy. Scholarship recipients are directed to \nlocal colleges and universities, allowing them to forge connections \nwith local business leaders through AAI-coordinated internships. As a \ncapstone, AAI matches scholarship recipients with mentors who help them \ncraft business plans in their senior year of college, ensuring that \neach graduate has a roadmap as they enter the workforce. The first \ngroup of scholarship recipients will graduate in 2015, and I look \nforward to observing their accomplishments and the added energy they \nwill bring to their communities.\n  None of this would be possible without the vision and generosity of \nRay and Sandy Gauvin, along with that of the businesses, schools, \ncolleges, and community organizations that have heeded their call in \nsupporting AAI. The Gauvins' personal experience, as a first-generation \ncollege student and a career teacher, respectively, clearly inspired \nthe effort they have spearheaded. As they noted in an interview with \nthe Bangor Daily News, they believe ``education is the great \nequalizer,'' and I could not agree more. I thank the Gauvins and the \ninitiative's business and education partners for stepping up to support \nthe county's next generation of leaders. I cannot wait to see, with \ntheir communities behind them, what these students will achieve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/06/senate-section/article/S2713-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, last week, Armenians and friends of \nArmenians around the world solemnly remembered the horrific dislocation \nand slaughter that began in 1915 and resulted in more than 1.5 million \ndeaths and another half million Armenians driven from their ancient \nhomeland. The Armenian Genocide was carried out by the Ottoman Empire \nin its waning years amidst the chaos of World War I. For what was an \nundeniably gruesome period in human history, Theodore Roosevelt called \nthe Armenian Genocide ``the greatest crime of the war.''\n  It is this terrible chapter, more than any other single event, that \nled to the Armenian diaspora, including in the United States and my \nhome State of Rhode Island. For generations, the Armenian community has \nbeen a strong and hardworking part of our Rhode Island family, \nproducing great leaders in both government and business. Whether at \nflag raising ceremonies, church festivals, the wonderful St. Vartanantz \nAnnual Bazaar at Rhodes on the Pawtuxet, or at commemorations of the \nArmenian Genocide at the monument in the North Burial Ground in \nProvidence, Armenians are part of the fabric of Rhode Island.\n  Since achieving independence after the fall of the Soviet Union, \nArmenia has at last established a foothold for democracy in the \nCaucasus after centuries of outside domination and totalitarian rule. I \nhave long supported foreign assistance to Armenia to help grow its \neconomy and strengthen its Democratic institutions, and I will continue \nto do so.\n  But perhaps the most meaningful thing we can do for Armenia and for \nArmenians in Rhode Island is to help cast a light on that brutal \ngenocide 99 years ago. To this day, too many people are unaware of this \ntragedy, due in part to the unwillingness of some to call it what it \nwas. But make no mistake; the slaughter of innocent Armenians was \ngenocide, plain and simple. Indeed, our modern term ``genocide'' was \nfirst coined to describe both the Jewish Holocaust and the plight of \nthe Armenians under Ottoman persecution.\n  Along with my Rhode Island colleague Senator Jack Reed, I have \nproudly cosponsored resolutions in the Senate condemning the genocide \nand calling on the President of the United States to ensure that U.S. \nforeign policy appropriately and without equivocation reflects the \nrealities of the Armenian Genocide. This solemn recognition is \nimportant not only to so many Armenians in Rhode Island and throughout \nthe world, but to our human obligation to the truth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/06/senate-section/article/S2713-3", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2713-S2714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IMMIGRATION RULE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, the Departments of Homeland \nSecurity and Commerce announced a proposed rule change that would \nextend employment authorizations to spouses of certain H-1B workers. \nThe rule says that spouses who have already begun the process of \nseeking legal permanent resident status through employment, or those \nwho have been granted an extension beyond their 6-year limit of stay in \nthe country, are eligible for employment authorizations.\n\n[[Page S2714]]\n\n  On a call with media today, Homeland Security Deputy Secretary \nMayorkas said that the intent of this regulation is to make it more \nattractive for foreign workers to come to and stay in the United \nStates. Under current law, Congress authorized 85,000 H-1B visas to be \navailable each year for high-skilled workers. Yet, with this sweeping \nrule, more workers will be allowed to come, work, and compete with U.S. \nworkers in high-skilled fields despite the well-documented fraud in the \nH-1B program. The Department believes that the rule change will allow \nmore than 97,000 people to obtain employment authorization in the first \nyear alone.\n  While we're all interested in attracting the best and the brightest \nforeign workers to the United States, the Obama administration clearly \ndoesn't seem concerned with the millions of unemployed Americans, and \nthose who have been forced out of their jobs because companies prefer \nto hire lower-paid workers from abroad.\n  In addition to their lack of compassion and understanding for \nAmerican workers, it is disturbing that the administration is once \nagain circumventing Congress and implementing their own rules. As with \nother unilateral actions this administration has taken, I question \ntheir legal authority to issue this rule.\n  In 2001, Congress explicitly laid out in statute that the Secretary \ncould provide work authorizations to certain spouses of foreign \nworkers. Congress said that work authorizations could be given to \nspouses of L1, intercompany transfers, and E, treaty traders/investors, \nvisa holders. Congress did not, at that time, give spouses of H-1B visa \nholders the permission to work. It could have, but it did not.\n  The administration may claim that it has broad authority to issue \nwork authorizations to anyone in the United States. If the executive \nbranch has such broad authority, then why would Congress explicitly lay \nout the category of visa holders and foreign nationals who could work \nin the U.S.?\n  And, what will come next? Where will this administration stop? What \nother categories of individuals will be granted work authorizations? \nThe rule allows spouses of ``certain'' H-1B visa holders to work. What \nabout the others? Why didn't the administration do a more comprehensive \nrule for all H-1B spouses? Maybe the Department realized they were \nalready pushing the envelope with its authority. Will the \nadministration push back against advocates of other nonimmigrant \ncategories, or refuse to expand the rule to all spouses of H-1B visa \nholders?\n  What is frustrating about this rule is that it flies in the face of \nthe immigration bill that the Senate passed last summer. The bill, if \npassed, would allow spouses of H-1B holders to work. Section 4102 of S. \n744 would give the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority to \nissue work authorization to those who are accompanying or following to \njoin a principal H-1B worker. Inclusion of this provision signals that \nthe Secretary does not currently have authority.\n  Originally, the bill written by the Gang of Eight, only gave that \nauthority to the Secretary if the home country of the foreign national \ndid the same for U.S. workers. The Gang of Eight's bill said, ``The \nSecretary of Homeland Security shall authorize the alien spouse to \nengage in employment in the United States only if such spouse is a \nnational of a foreign country that permits reciprocal employment.''\n  The intent of the authors of the Senate bill was to ensure that \nAmerican spouses were treated equally. The rule does not take this into \nconsideration.\n  The Obama administration claims it wants immigration reform, but they \ncan not wait for Congress. They act on their own. And, they do it to \nthe detriment of American workers. We need to get immigration reform \nright, and doing ad-hoc rules that fly in the face of the statute are \nnot helpful to the process. What is next? Will the President \nunilaterally legalize the undocumented population because he can not \nhave his way with Congress? President Obama has to prove that he can be \ntrusted. Otherwise, American workers and the American people will \ncontinue to lose out because of his policies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/06/senate-section/article/S2714-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DAVID THIBODEAUX\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor Southern \nUniversity located in Baton Rouge, LA, as it celebrates its 100th \nanniversary. Southern University at Baton Rouge was established on \nMarch 9, 1914, when Southern University moved from New Orleans to \nScott's Bluff, overlooking the Mississippi River in the northern \nsection of Baton Rouge. The University opened its doors just outside of \nBaton Rouge with nine professors and just one central building to 47 \nstudents. The original building, now called the Archives and \nInformation Center, housed the administration, all classrooms, and even \nserved as an all-girls dorm. The original campus is now a part of the \nLouisiana African American Heritage Trail.\n  Southern University remains the only land-grant school in the State \nof Louisiana and now has more than 200 buildings worth more than $200 \nmillion. This year's Southern University and A College at Baton \nRouge, SUBR, Centennial Celebration will honor Southern's historical \ncontributions as well as acknowledge exceptional alumni in a variety of \nfields, including its first president, Dr. Joseph Samuel Clark. The \nJaguar Nation of SouthernUniversity is well-known for its role in the \ncivil rights movement in the State of Louisiana and for its nationally \nrecognized marching band nicknamed, ``the Human Jukebox.''\n  Undergirding all of the centennial events will be an ambitious \nfundraising effort that will solicit financial support from \ncorporations, foundations, businesses, religious organizations, alumni, \nuniversity retirees, former and current board members, former system \npresidents and chancellors, former student campus leaders and athletes, \ncurrent faculty, staff and students, elected and appointed officials, \ncommunity leaders, and the public in general. The\n\n[[Page S2715]]\n\nfunds generated will be credited to a scholarship fund to assist \nqualified SUBR students.\n  Today, Southern University at Baton Rouge enrolls more than 7,000 \nacross 44 undergraduate degree programs. Southern also offers 30 post-\ngraduate degree programs including six doctoral programs and an ABA-\naccredited law school program. It is with my heartfelt and greatest \nsincerity that I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating \nSouthern University at Baton Rouge as it celebrates its 100th \nAnniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/06/senate-section/article/S2715-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           CLAY COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State. And it has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful farm bills. But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Clay County to build a legacy of a stronger local economy, \nbetter schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, safer \ncommunity.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to secure funding in Clay County worth over $20 million \nand successfully acquired financial assistance from programs I have \nfought hard to support, which have provided more than $997,000 to the \nlocal economy.\n  Of course my favorite memory of working together has to be their work \nthrough Main Street Iowa to renovate the Spencer Community Theater. In \n1982, this building was transformed from the vacant Spencer Grocer \nBuilding into the Spencer City Theatre, a center for arts, culture, and \ncommunity gathering. This funding has allowed for the space to again be \ntransformed. With these renovations, the Spencer City Theatre is now a \nfacility that can better serve the Clay County community.\n  Among the highlights:\n  Main Street Iowa: One of the greatest challenges we face--in Iowa and \nall across America--is preserving the character and vitality of our \nsmall towns and rural communities. This isn't just about economics; It \nis also about maintaining our identity as Iowans. Main Street Iowa \nhelps preserve Iowa's heart and soul by providing funds to revitalize \ndowntown business districts. This program has allowed towns like \nSpencer to use that money to leverage other investments to jump-start \nchange and renewal. I am so pleased that Clay County has earned $50,000 \nthrough this program. These grants build much more than buildings. They \nbuild up the spirit and morale of people in our small towns and local \ncommunities.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Clay County has received $797,135 in Harkin Grants. Similarly, \nschools in Clay County have received funds that I designated for Iowa \nStar Schools for technology totaling $110,000.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Clay County has received more than $14 million \nfrom a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Clay County's \nfire departments have received over $705,345 for firefighter safety and \noperations equipment.\n  Disability Rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf. But I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the \nADA Amendments Act, I have had four guiding goals for our fellow \ncitizens with disabilities: equal opportunity, full participation, \nindependent living and economic self-sufficiency. Nearly a quarter \ncentury since passage of the ADA, I see remarkable changes in \ncommunities everywhere I go in Iowa--not just in curb cuts or closed \ncaptioned television but in the full participation of people with \ndisabilities in our society and economy, folks who at long last have \nthe opportunity to contribute their talents and to be fully included. \nThese changes have increased economic opportunities for all citizens of \nClay County, both those with and without disabilities. And they make us \nproud to be a part of a community and country that respects the worth \nand civil rights of all of our citizens.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Clay County, during my time in Congress. In every \ncase, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in Clay \nCounty, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives. And, of course, \nthis work is never complete. Even after I retire from the Senate, I \nhave no intention of retiring from the fight for a better, fairer, \nricher Iowa. I will always be profoundly grateful for the opportunity \nto serve the people of Iowa as their Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/06/senate-section/article/S2715-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2715-S2716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SAC COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

I look \nforward to seeing how Fremont County has implemented this important \nfunding in their community.\n  Among the highlights:\n  Investing in Iowa's economic development through targeted community \nprojects: In Northwest Iowa, we have worked together to grow the \neconomy by making targeted investments in important economic \ndevelopment projects including improved roads and bridges, modernized \nsewer and water systems, and better housing options for residents of \nSac County. In many cases, I have secured Federal funding that has \nleveraged local investments and served as a catalyst for a whole ripple \neffect of positive, creative changes. For example, working with mayors, \ncity council members, and local economic development officials in Sac \nCounty, I have fought for funding for small airport funding at the \nFederal Aviation Administration, which allowed community leaders to \nsuccessfully acquire over $1.5 million in airport improvements, helping \nto create jobs and expand economic opportunities.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern.

Mr. President, I rise in remembrance of Joe Dini, \na true Nevada statesman and dedicated public servant.\n  Joe found his calling leading Nevada's citizens in the legislature \nthrough more than 20 years of public service. Elected for an \nunprecedented eight sessions, he is remembered as a friend and a \ngentleman by both his colleagues and me. His leadership and exemplary \ncontributions to the State of Nevada are, and continue to remain, \nunmatched.\n  A quiet and humble man with an aptitude for compromise, Joe \nunquestionably sustained our State throughout his long tenure. \nSupporting Nevada's economic backbone through his involvement in the \ngaming industry, Joe expanded Nevada's economy and presence among the \nNation. As a legislator, his focus was not only on issues of importance \nin his rural district, such as agriculture and water policy, but also \non issues of necessity in the entire State regarding education, health \ncare, and, of course, his legacy, the bistate Tahoe Regional Planning \nAgency.\n  Moreover, his loyalty and dedication to his community civics was \nexceptional. Knowing and fighting for his constituency's concerns, all \nwhile searching for what was best for Nevada, despite rifts in \npolitical ideologies, are two things Nevadans will never forget about \nJoe.\n  Born in 1929, rising from modest beginnings, Joe, the son of an \nItalian immigrant saloonkeeper, was raised in Yerington, a very small, \nrural community in Nevada. Yet through achievement of self and service, \nhe became one of the most influential Nevadans in our State's rich \nhistory. His motivation and selflessness embodies the ``Battle Born'' \nState. With his passing, Nevada lost a great man who is immortalized \nfor encouraging respect among his community and fellow assemblymen.\n  My entire family extends our thoughts and condolences to Joe's loved \nones, and we thank them for their service as well.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in remembering Assemblyman Dini for \nhis unwavering loyalty and dedication to Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/06/senate-section/article/S2716-2", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2716-S2717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMENDING NEW JERSEY HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS\n\n Mr. MENENDEZ.

A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide \nfor the refinancing of certain Federal student loans, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to announce the \nintroduction of emergency legislation to provide relief to students and \nyoung graduates who are drowning in debt. Make no mistake. This is an \nemergency. Student loan debt is exploding, and it threatens the \nstability of our young people and the future of our economy.\n  Outstanding student loan debt now totals $1.2 trillion, and each year \nstudents are taking on more and more debt. In 2012 an astonishing 71 \npercent of college seniors owed student loans. From 2004 to 2012 the \naverage student loan balance increased by 70 percent. Millions of young \npeople are struggling to keep up with student loan payments.\n  The economic impact is real. Federal watchdog agencies such as the \nFederal Reserve, the Treasury, and the Consumer Protection Bureau are \nall sounding the alarm. Every day this exploding debt stops more and \nmore young people from moving out of their parents' homes, from saving \nfor a downpayment, from buying a home, from buying cars, from starting \nsmall businesses, from saving for retirement, from making the purchases \nthat keep this economy moving forward.\n  It doesn't have to be this way. Congress set interest rates on \nstudent loans at artificially high rates that generate extra money for \nthe government. The GAO recently projected that the government will \nbring in $66 billion just on the slice of student loans from 2007 to \n2012. Those are the kinds of profits that would make a Fortune 500 CEO \nproud.\n  We should cut those interest rates and we should cut those government \nprofits. We should give our young people a break and boost our economy. \nThis morning two dozens Senators joined to introduce the Bank on \nStudents Emergency Loan Refinancing Act which will do just that. The \nidea is simple. With interest rates near historic lows, homeowners, \nbusinesses, and even local governments have refinanced their debts, but \nmany people who took out student loans before July 1 of last year are \nlocked into a rate of nearly 7 percent. Older loans run 8 percent, 9 \npercent, and even higher. We need to bring those rates down, and we \nneed to do it now.\n  Bank on Students would give student loan borrowers the opportunity to \nlower their interest rates on old loans to match the rates the \ngovernment offers to new borrowers today; that is, 3.86 percent for \nundergraduate loans, 5.41 percent for graduate loans, and 6.41 percent \nfor PLUS loans. I want to be clear--those rates are still higher than \nwhat it costs the government to run its student loan program. Our work \nwill not be done until we have eliminated all of the profits from the \nstudent loan program, but this legislation is an important step in that \ndirection.\n  Forty million borrowers in this country have student loan debt, and \nmany of those individuals could save hundreds or even thousands of \ndollars a year with this bill. They need this help now.\n  Last year nearly every Republican in Congress--in the House and in \nthe Senate--voted for the exact same loan rates that are in this \nlegislation. Republican leaders, such as Speaker of the House John \nBoehner, embraced 3.86 percent for new undergraduate borrowers as \n``consistent'' with Republican policy proposals. OK, it may not be my \npreferred rate, but if Republicans believe that 3.86 percent is good \nenough for new undergraduate borrowers, then it should be good enough \nfor existing undergraduate borrowers who also worked hard to get an \neducation and need to refinance their loans. Let's bring down this rate \nfor all our kids because there is no reason on Earth to say that some \nkids can get a better deal when they all worked hard to do exactly what \nwe wanted them to do--get an education.\n  This legislation won't add a single dime to our deficit. The Bank on \nStudents legislation adopts the Buffett rule, which limits tax \nloopholes for millionaires and billionaires, and it requires that every \ndollar we bring in as a result of that change go directly to supporting \nlower interest rates on existing student loans. It is simple: Invest in \nbillionaires or invest in students.\n\n  Refinancing won't fix everything that is broken in our higher \neducation system. We need to bring down the cost of college and we need \nmore accountability for how schools spend Federal dollars. Many of my \nDemocratic colleagues have introduced or are introducing legislation \naimed at lowering the overall cost of college, and I support those \nefforts.\n  The need for comprehensive reform must not blind us to the urgency of \naddressing the massive debt that is already crushing young people. This \nis a question of economics, but it is also a question of values. These \nyoung people are saddled with student loan debt not because they went \nto the mall and ran up charges on a credit card. They worked hard and \nlearned new skills that would benefit the country and help us build a \nstronger America. They deserve a fair shot at an affordable education.\n  This is personal for me. I was the first person in my family to \ngraduate from college. I went to a commuter college where the tuition \nwas $50 a semester, and it opened a million doors\n\n[[Page S2721]]\n\nfor me. I got a fair shot because I grew up in an America that made it \na priority to invest in young people.\n  I believe in an America that puts students ahead of billionaires, an \nAmerica that puts education within reach of every kid who works hard, \nan America that will give every kid a fair shot at building a future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KAINE (for himself and Mr. Cornyn):\n  S. 2294. A bill to require a survey of the preferences of members of \nthe Armed Forces regarding military pay and benefits; to the Committee \non Armed Services.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, today I am introducing, with Senator \nCornyn, the Servicemembers' Compensation Empowerment Act of 2014. This \nbipartisan legislation will direct the Department of Defense's (DoD) \nMilitary Retirement and Modernization Commission to formally survey \nmilitary personnel on pay and benefits, and to take relative \npreferences into account as the Commission prepares its \nrecommendations.\n  Virginia is more connected to the military than any other State. As I \nhave traveled throughout the Commonwealth, I have had the opportunity \nto meet and discuss military benefits with servicemembers, veterans, \nand their families. The overriding concern on the part of our military \nand their families is sequestration. It has forced the military to \nallow the budget to drive strategy, rather than strategy to drive our \nbudget. As a member of both the Senate Armed Services and Budget \nCommittees, I firmly believe that all budget proposals should be \nconsidered carefully in light of the need for deficit redaction, the \nneed to maintain a strong military, and the responsibility we have to \nsupport our servicemembers with resources to complete their mission.\n  The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission was \nestablished by the fiscal year 2013 National Defense Authorization Act, \nto conduct a review of military compensation and retirement systems and \nto make recommendations to enable the quality of life of our military \nand their families and achieve fiscal sustainability for the future. As \nof now, no official study has been conducted by the Commission to \ndetermine the relative value of compensation and benefit programs to \nthe military personnel who depend on them. Under my legislation, the \nCommission would be required to survey randomly selected members of the \nmilitary concerning basic pay, housing allowances, bonuses and special \npay, dependent healthcare and retirement pay and report its results to \nCongress.\n  Servicemembers deserve to have their voices heard as changes to the \npay and benefits packages they depend on most are considered. By \nformally surveying military personnel on the benefits they value most, \nwe can ensure the Military Retirement and Modernization Commission and \nmembers of Congress have the best possible understanding of how cost-\nsaving proposals would impact our servicemembers and their families, \nallowing them to make decisions with evidence-based analysis.\n  This bill gives servicemembers a voice in the process, and will \nassure that reforms will take a scientific study into account. We must \nbalance the competing needs to control rising costs with ensuring we \nmeet the needs of military personnel and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/06/senate-section/article/S2721-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 438--CONGRATULATING THE STUDENTS, PARENTS, TEACHERS, \n  AND ADMINISTRATORS OF CHARTER SCHOOLS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES FOR \nTHEIR ONGOING CONTRIBUTIONS TO EDUCATION, AND SUPPORTING THE IDEALS AND \nGOALS OF THE 15TH ANNUAL NATIONAL CHARTER SCHOOLS WEEK, TO BE HELD MAY \n                         4 THROUGH MAY 10, 2014\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Mr. Alexander, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Carper, \nMr. Durbin, Mr. McCain, Mr. Kirk, Mr. Bennet, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Rubio, \nMr. Coons, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Burr, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Graham, and Mr. \nScott) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to.:\n\n                              S.

Res. 439\n\n       Whereas each year, the underground utility infrastructure \n     of the United States, including pipelines, electric, gas, \n     telecommunications, water, sewer, and cable television lines, \n     is jeopardized by unintentional damage caused by those who \n     fail to have underground lines located prior to digging;\n       Whereas some utility lines are buried only a few inches \n     underground, making the lines easy to strike, even during \n     shallow digging projects;\n\n[[Page S2722]]\n\n       Whereas digging prior to locating underground utility lines \n     often results in unintended consequences, such as service \n     interruption, environmental damage, personal injury, and even \n     death;\n       Whereas the month of April marks the beginning of the peak \n     period during which excavation projects are carried out \n     around the United States;\n       Whereas in 2002, Congress required the Department of \n     Transportation and the Federal Communications Commission to \n     establish a 3-digit, nationwide, toll-free number to be used \n     by State ``One Call'' systems to provide information on \n     underground utility lines;\n       Whereas in 2005, the Federal Communications Commission \n     designated ``811'' as the nationwide ``One Call'' number for \n     homeowners and excavators to use to obtain information on \n     underground utility lines before conducting excavation \n     activities;\n       Whereas ``One Call'' has helped reduce the number of \n     digging damages caused by failure to call before digging from \n     48 percent in 2004 to 25 percent in 2012;\n       Whereas the 1,600 members of the Common Ground Alliance, \n     who are dedicated to ensuring public safety, environmental \n     protection, and the integrity of services, promote the \n     national ``Call Before You Dig'' campaign to increase public \n     awareness about the importance of homeowners and excavators \n     calling 811 to find out the exact location of underground \n     lines;\n       Whereas the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job \n     Creation Act of 2011 affirmed and expanded the ``One Call'' \n     program by eliminating exemptions given to local and State \n     government agencies and their contractors on notifying ``One \n     Call'' centers before digging; and\n       Whereas the Common Ground Alliance has designated April as \n     ``National Safe Digging Month'' to increase awareness of safe \n     digging practices across the United States and to celebrate \n     the anniversary of 811, the national ``Call Before You Dig'' \n     number: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Safe Digging \n     Month; and\n       (2) encourages all homeowners and excavators throughout the \n     United States to call 811 before digging.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/05/06/senate-section/article/S2722-1", "month": "05", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2985.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This division may be cited as the ``Weatherization \n     Enhancement and Local Energy Efficiency Investment and \n     Accountability Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2002. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the State energy program established under part D of \n     title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 6321 et seq.) (referred to in this section as ``SEP'') \n     and the Weatherization Assistance Program for Low-Income \n     Persons established under part A of title IV of the Energy \n     Conservation and Production Act (42 U.S.C. 6861 et seq.) \n     (referred to in this section as ``WAP'') have proven to be \n     beneficial, long-term partnerships among Federal, State, and \n     local partners;\n       (2) the SEP and the WAP have been reauthorized on a \n     bipartisan basis over many years to address changing \n     national, regional, and State circumstances and needs, \n     especially through--\n       (A) the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6201 \n     et seq.);\n       (B) the Energy Conservation and Production Act (42 U.S.C. \n     6801 et seq.);\n       (C) the State Energy Efficiency Programs Improvement Act of \n     1990 (Public Law 101-440; 104 Stat. 1006);\n       (D) the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 13201 et \n     seq.);\n       (E) the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 15801 et \n     seq.); and\n       (F) the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (42 \n     U.S.C. 17001 et seq.);\n       (3) the SEP, also known as the ``State energy conservation \n     program''--\n       (A) was first created in 1975 to implement a State-based, \n     national program in support of energy efficiency, renewable \n     energy, economic development, energy emergency preparedness, \n     and energy policy; and\n       (B) has come to operate in every sector of the economy in \n     support of the private sector to improve productivity and has \n     dramatically reduced the cost of government through energy \n     savings at the State and local levels;\n       (4) Federal laboratory studies have concluded that, for \n     every Federal dollar invested through the SEP, more than $7 \n     is saved in energy costs and almost $11 in non-Federal funds \n     is leveraged;\n       (5) the WAP--\n       (A) was first created in 1976 to assist low-income families \n     in response to the first oil embargo;\n       (B) has become the largest residential energy conservation \n     program in the United States, with more than 7,100,000 homes \n     weatherized since the WAP was created;\n       (C) saves an estimated 35 percent of consumption in the \n     typical weatherized home, yielding average annual savings of \n     $437 per year in home energy costs;\n       (D) has created thousands of jobs in both the construction \n     sector and in the supply chain of materials suppliers, \n     vendors, and manufacturers who supply the WAP;\n       (E) returns $2.51 in energy savings for every Federal \n     dollar spent in energy and nonenergy benefits over the life \n     of weatherized homes;\n       (F) serves as a foundation for residential energy \n     efficiency retrofit standards, technical skills, and \n     workforce training for the\n\n[[Page S2734]]\n\n     emerging broader market and reduces residential and power \n     plant emissions of carbon dioxide by 2.65 metric tons each \n     year per home; and\n       (G) has decreased national energy consumption by the \n     equivalent of 24,100,000 barrels of oil annually;\n       (6) the WAP can be enhanced with the addition of a targeted \n     portion of the Federal funds through an innovative program \n     that supports projects performed by qualified nonprofit \n     organizations that have a demonstrated capacity to build, \n     renovate, repair, or improve the energy efficiency of a \n     significant number of low-income homes, building on the \n     success of the existing program without replacing the \n     existing WAP network or creating a separate delivery \n     mechanism for basic WAP services;\n       (7) the WAP has increased energy efficiency opportunities \n     by promoting new, competitive public-private sector models of \n     retrofitting low-income homes through new Federal \n     partnerships;\n       (8) improved monitoring and reporting of the work product \n     of the WAP has yielded benefits, and expanding independent \n     verification of efficiency work will support the long-term \n     goals of the WAP;\n       (9) reports of the Government Accountability Office in \n     2011, Inspector General's of the Department of Energy, and \n     State auditors have identified State-level deficiencies in \n     monitoring efforts that can be addressed in a manner that \n     will ensure that WAP funds are used more effectively;\n       (10) through the history of the WAP, the WAP has evolved \n     with improvements in efficiency technology, including, in the \n     1990s, many States adopting advanced home energy audits, \n     which has led to great returns on investment;
