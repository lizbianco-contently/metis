Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the \nRepublican leader, the Senate will be in a period of morning business, \nwith Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each, \nwhich will run until 10:45. The time will be divided in the usual form \nbetween the two leaders or their designees. At 10:45 the Senate will \nproceed to a series of three rollcall votes: cloture on Andre Birotte \nto be a judge in California; Robin Rosenberg to be a judge in Florida; \nand John deGravelles to be a judge in Louisiana. Following the cloture \nvote on deGravelles, the time until 12:30 will be equally divided and \ncontrolled in the usual form. The Senate will recess from 12:30 to 2:15 \nto allow for our weekly caucus meetings. If cloture is invoked on any \nof the previous nominations, at 2:15 the Senate will begin a series of \nvotes on those nominations.\n\n\n                            Fair Shot Agenda\n\n  Over the past several months, Americans have heard Democrats speak at \nlength about giving working families a fair shot. What do we mean by a \n``fair shot''? A fair shot is about making sure Americans have jobs and \ngood jobs. It is about ensuring that workers receive fair, livable \nwages so they can put a roof over their heads and take care of their \nkids and actually put food on the table, make the rent payments, car \npayments. A fair shot is the idea that each hard-working American \ndeserves an opportunity to achieve a measure of prosperity. But it all \nbegins with a job.\n  As Senators, it is imperative that we not only promote job growth but \nalso protect the jobs constituents already have. That is why the \nlegislation before the Senate, the Bring Jobs Home Act, is so vitally \nimportant. It protects American jobs and encourages future job creation \nwithin our borders.\n  Over the last decade, the last 10 years, our country has been \nhemorrhaging jobs. American companies have outsourced 2\\1/2\\ million \njobs. Outsource--that means ship them overseas. Two and a half million \njobs that were here are now overseas, but these losses could \npotentially skyrocket if we do not address the disturbing trend of \noutsourcing. Twenty-one million Americans, including 7 million \nmanufacturing workers, are at risk of having their jobs shipped \noverseas at any time--the risk of losing their fair shot. Almost \n150,000 at-risk workers live in Nevada. The home State of my friend \nfrom Kentucky could also be on the chopping block to the tune of \n235,000 jobs. For the Presiding Officer's State of New Jersey, \noutsourcing means the loss of 588,000 jobs in New Jersey.\n  When millions of Americans are looking for work in a recovering \neconomy, few things could be more important than protecting good-paying \nmiddle-class jobs.\n  Every time an American company closes a factory or a plant in America \nand moves operations to another country, taxpayers pick up part of that \nmoving bill. It is hard to comprehend that, but that is the way our law \nnow exists. We want to change that. That is what the legislation before \nthis body is all about. The Bring Jobs Home Act would end senseless tax \nbreaks for outsourcers. It would end the absurd practice of American \ntaxpayers bankrolling the outsourcing of their very own jobs.\n  The Bring Jobs Home Act also seeks to bring jobs back to America. \nThis bill\n\n[[Page S4668]]\n\nwould offer a 20-percent tax credit to help with the costs of moving \nproduction back to the United States.\n  In the last few years major manufacturers, such as Ford and \nCaterpillar, have brought jobs back to the United States from Japan, \nMexico, and China. Why? Because we have such productive workers. There \nare a lot of other reasons, but that is the main reason. Smaller \nmanufacturers, such as Master Lock, have moved facilities home as well. \nThis is a trend we here in Congress should enthusiastically encourage--\nAmerican companies returning home to employ American workers. They \nshould get a tax break to do that. That is what this legislation does.\n  The Bring Jobs Home Act is a commonsense strategy to bring back \nAmerican jobs. To 21 million Americans whose jobs could be the next \nones to move to China or Japan, the Bring Jobs Home Act is as serious \nas it gets. To the 2\\1/2\\ million Americans whose jobs have already \nbeen offshored, the bill stands to right a terrible wrong: Bring them \nback and get a tax benefit for doing that.\n  I hope Republicans in Congress will finally see the light and join us \nin giving workers a fair shot at a good, stable job. On this \nlegislation, the Bring Jobs Home Act, I know Senators on the Republican \nside always say they want amendments; unless they get a guarantee of \namendments, they will kill the bill. On that, let me just say what I \nalways say: We want to do something; that is, get something done. We \nshould do what we have done on highway bills in the past, what we did \nrecently on terrorism insurance, what we did on the Workforce \nInvestment Act, and what we have done here for decades. We should work \non a list of amendments and a path on getting the bill done. If there \nis going to be no list, I have no alternative but to procedurally move \nforward and get this matter off the floor. That would not be good for \nAmerican workers. So everyone should know my answer: We need to get a \nlist of amendments and a path for getting the bill done.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                      Working For The Middle Class\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, later today the President will sign a \nbipartisan workforce training bill into law. It is commonsense \nlegislation that will help my constituents gain new skills to become \nmore competitive. I was proud to support it. I am glad to see that the \nPresident is going to sign it.\n  Unfortunately, though, bipartisan accomplishments such as this one \nhave become increasingly rare in the Democratic-controlled Senate.\n  Last week President Obama took to the campaign trail to urge Congress \nto pass a new highway bill. He really did not need to, though; the \nRepublican-controlled House of Representatives had already passed the \nhighway bill earlier in the week. In fact, it sailed through on an \noverwhelmingly bipartisan vote, 367 to 55. The President said he would \nsign it if Congress sent it to his desk. I expect the Senate will do \njust that in fairly short order but only if the Democrats who run the \nSenate can put their never-ending political campaign on hold for just a \nminute because rather than focus on passing bipartisan legislation, not \nto mention the dozens of job-creation bills the House has already sent \nover to us, the Democratic majority seems to spend all of its time on \nbills designed primarily to create jobs for campaign consultants.\n  We got an especially vivid glimpse of this earlier this year when \nSenate Democrats admitted they were working with their campaign \ncommittee to craft a so-called agenda that was more about saving their \nown seats than anything else. Ever since, they have pretty much \nabandoned governing to use the Senate floor as a campaign studio. We \nsaw the latest example last night when the majority brought up another \nrecycled, designed-to-fail bill that has already been rejected by the \nSenate. It is a bill that is designed for campaign rhetoric and \nfailure, not to create jobs here in the United States. That is not what \nit is about. But that is not stopping our friends on the other side \nfrom bringing it up yet again, just as they did right before the last \nelection.\n  So, look. We have seen this movie before. Everyone knows the \nDemocrats are simply not serious here. They specifically want the bill \nto fail.\n  What I am saying is let's just skip the campaigning and get something \ndone for the middle class instead. Let's focus on bipartisan bills that \ncan help families and create jobs here at home. Let's focus on things \nsuch as repealing the job-killing medical device tax and helping create \nenergy jobs and reducing the tax burden on small businesses and \nrestoring the 40-hour workweek and providing relief to Kentucky's coal \nfamilies.\n  If we are going to have a debate about creating jobs here at home, \nthen let's really have a debate about creating jobs here at home. This \nis not it. Senate Democrats, of course, know that. They also know all \nof their campaigning is getting in the way of focusing on passing \nbipartisan legislation--bipartisan legislation such as the highway \nbill.\n  Of course, we know the current highway bill is not perfect. Over the \nlong term, Republicans have a lot of good ideas for reforming the \nhighway trust fund in a more permanent way so it can be made \nsustainable for years to come, but for now we have to at least keep \nroad and bridge projects moving forward in the meantime. The extension \nof the highway trust fund could be used to fund projects such as the \nresurfacing of several parkways that many Kentuckians use to commute to \nwork, and it could be used to fund the widening of I-656 between \nBowling Green and Elizabethtown. The judge executive of Hart County \nTerry Martin knows this transportation safety project is important for \nthe Commonwealth, and he notes that the expansion to six lanes would \nallow for a smoother and safer flow of traffic for Kentuckians.\n\n  So let's focus on scoring bipartisan wins and jobs for our \nconstituents instead of scoring political points. If Democrats can do \nthat, then I am confident we will get this done because the American \npeople didn't send us to Congress to campaign 24/7. When Senate \nDemocrats do choose to work with us, there is a lot we can get done for \nthe people of our country.\n\n\n                      Remembering Jeremiah Denton\n\n  I wish to say a brief word about our former colleague Jeremiah \nDenton, who will be laid to rest today at Arlington National Cemetery.\n  Admiral Denton is best known for the extraordinary bravery he showed \nin 1966, when instead of playing along in a propaganda film for his \ncaptors in Vietnam, he blinked the word ``torture'' in Morse code to \nU.S. military leaders.\n  All told, Admiral Denton would spend 7\\1/2\\ years in the infamous \nHanoi Hilton and other camps, enduring terrible torture and barbaric \nconditions throughout. Later, after earning the deep admiration of \nRonald Reagan, he would enlist the future President's help as a first-\ntime political candidate, becoming the first-elected Republican Senator \nfrom Alabama since Reconstruction.\n  A staunch conservative throughout his time in the Senate, Admiral \nDenton was a man of deep and abiding faith who had an equally deep and \nabiding love for his country. This was never more clear than on the day \nhe stepped off a plane to freedom at Clark Air Base in the Philippines. \nWalking up to the microphone, the newly released POW said simply:\n\n       We are honored to have had the opportunity to serve our \n     country under difficult circumstances. We are proudly \n     grateful to our commander-in-chief and to our nation for this \n     day. God bless America.\n\n  Admiral Denton was predeceased by his beloved wife of 61 years \nKathryn Jane, and survived by their seven children: Madeleine, and Mary \nBeth, Jeremiah, William, Donald, James, Michael; and by his second wife \nMary Belle. We send Mary Belle and the entire Denton family our sincere \ncondolences today as Jeremiah Denton is laid to rest, and we honor the \nmemory of this great man and distinguished former Member of this body.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I came to the Senate floor in April to \nwarn my colleagues of a looming crisis in the highway trust fund. I \ntold them if Congress didn't act and the fund reached critically low \nlevels, it would cause construction shutdowns in communities across the \ncountry. It would cost jobs and threaten our fragile economic recovery. \nIt would hurt families who depend on safe and efficient roads and \nbridges.\n  I had hoped that we could address this issue sooner. I had hoped \nthose of us in Congress who understand the importance of strong \ninfrastructure investments could have come together, not just to avoid \na crisis but for a long-term solution. We weren't able to do that.\n  But today, after 4 months of warning of this looming crisis, I am \npleased to come to the floor as we work to do what should be easy but \ntoo often isn't in the Senate--to avoid a completely unnecessary and \ncompletely damaging crisis. This is a step in the right direction. As \nmany of us here know very well, it is a step that Congress has not \ntaken each time a crisis approached.\n  For far too many years, Congress has been lurching from crisis to \ncrisis, from debt limit scares to fiscal cliffs. That dysfunction hit a \npeak last October with a government shutdown over a misguided attempt \nto block the Affordable Care Act from covering millions of families and \nwith another Federal default scare. The lurching from crisis to crisis \nwith constant dysfunction and uncertainty hurt workers and our \nfamilies, and it shook the confidence of people across the country who \nexpect their elected officials to work together to get things done.\n  But when the government shutdown finally ended last year, I sat down \nwith House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan in a budget conference. \nWe worked together, we compromised, and we reached a 2-year budget deal \nthat prevented another government shutdown and rolled back devastating \ncuts from sequestration.\n\n  That bipartisan budget deal moved us away from these constant crises \nand showed the American people that we can do our jobs when we are \nwilling to work together. I believe it showed my Republican colleagues \nthat putting the American people through these constant artificial \ncrises is not only bad for the country overall, it is not good for \nRepublicans either.\n  Since that bipartisan budget deal, we have been able to build on that \nbipartisan momentum in some very important ways. I was proud to work \nwith the junior Senator from Georgia and a number of Democrats and \nRepublicans on a bipartisan bill to invest in workforce training.\n  Our legislation passed both the House and the Senate with \noverwhelming bipartisan support, and this week it will officially \nbecome law. That kind of bipartisan work to help our workers and the \neconomy wouldn't be possible if we were still in a constant crisis \nmode.\n  That is why I have been so hopeful we could avoid lurching toward yet \nanother needless crisis--this time in our highway trust fund. The \nconsequences of Congress failing to shore up the highway trust fund are \nclear. In fact, many of our States have already been bracing for a \nworst-case scenario. Arkansas, for example, has already put the brakes \non 15 highway projects that would have widened their highways and \nrepaired their bridges.\n  In Colorado, State officials are planning a project to ease \ncongestion to give some much-needed relief to drivers between Denver \nand Fort Collins, but a lapse in our Federal funding could have put \nthat project on hold.\n  Those are not isolated cases. Across the country more than 100,000 \nprojects would have been at risk next year and 700,000 jobs would have \nbeen on the line if Congress failed to replenish the highway trust fund \naccording to the Department of Transportation.\n  I am pleased Congress is finally coming together and working to avoid \na construction shutdown this summer. Republicans in the House have \npushed aside the tea party branch and passed a bill to avoid a \nconstruction shutdown this summer, with no ransom demands, no \nprogrammatic spending cuts, and no tea party policy riders.\n  I do support the bipartisan Senate proposal from the Finance \nCommittee, which includes provisions to improve compliance with tax \nlaws.\n  My colleague, the junior Senator from California, is right. We need \npressure on Republicans to come back before the end of this Congress to \nwork with us toward a long-term solution, but I am very pleased we are \nworking together to get this done and avoid this unnecessary crisis \nthat would have put jobs and our economy at risk.\n  This bill will be a step in the right direction, but then we need to \ntake the next step. We need to keep this bipartisanship going, and we \nneed to work together to find a long-term solution to the highway trust \nfund's revenue shortfall. That is the only way we can truly put an end \nto constant crises and short-term patches, and it is the only way we \ncan give our States and businesses the certainty they need and deserve \nto plan projects and invest in their economies.\n  Once again, I am pleased we are moving toward avoiding a completely \nunnecessary construction shutdown, and I am pleased that the House \nRepublicans seem to understand that it is better for them and our \ncountry to push the tea party aside and work with us--not to push us \ninto another crisis.\n  I am hopeful we can build on this bipartisan effort and keep working \ntogether to create jobs, economic growth, and a fair shot and true \nopportunity for families across our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, while the Senator from Washington is on \nthe floor, I think it is appropriate to note and congratulate her for \nher work on the Workforce Investment Act.\n  She and Senator Isakson of Georgia led the effort of Senator Harkin, \nme, and others in the Senate. Senator Scott of South Carolina was the \nprincipal sponsor of the House-passed SKILLS Act. Senator Enzi of \nWyoming had worked for a long time--and as the Republican leader said, \nthat bill is being signed today by the President of the United States.\n  It goes directly to the issue that most Americans care about. It is \ntoo hard to find a job. What this process showed was that Republicans \nand Democrats were able to take the nearly $10 billion that we \ncurrently spend on job training to give Governors the flexibility to \nhelp people develop skills and match job seekers with good jobs in \ntheir communities. I remember our former Democratic Governor from \nTennessee told me that when he came into office, he threw up his hands \nwhen he found out about the $145 million that came to Tennessee through \nthe Workforce Investment Act because it was too complicated.\n  Senator Murray, Senator Isakson, and others have worked together with \nChairman Kline in the House, and they produced a law that will be \nsigned today. The Senate is far from functioning the way it ought to. \nThere is too much talent in the Senate and too many pressing problems \nin the country for us to be anywhere close to satisfied with the result \nwe are getting. But the committee upon which the Senator from \nWashington and I serve has done a pretty good job in this Congress. We \nreported to the Senate 20 pieces of legislation; 18 of them have passed \nthe Senate, and 14 of them have been signed into law.\n  That may be more than the entire Senate put together.\n  The point is, those are big pieces of legislation. One is the jobs \nbill. That is the issue we care about more than any other.\n  Another was the track-and-trace legislation which makes medicines \nsafer for 4 billion prescriptions. Senator Burr and Senator Mikulski \nworked on that.\n  Another was on compounding pharmacies. It was a terrible problem \nwhere we had tainted, sterile injections not being sterile and causing \npeople to catch meningitis and die.\n  Last year another was the student loan program, where we took all the \nnew loans--that is $100 billion a year--and put a market-pricing system \non top and took it out of the political football stunt category.\n\n[[Page S4670]]\n\n  All of that has happened on a committee which has, on its left, 12 \nDemocrats, and on its right, 10 Republicans. We don't agree on \neverything by a long shot. But on these issues we came to a result, did \nthe job, and the Senator from Washington has been a conspicuous example \nof looking for opportunities for us to get a result.\n  People expect us to come to the Senate, stand on our principles, but \nnot stop there--not stop there--and then put our principles together \nwhere we can combine those and get a result for the American people. I \nam pleased to be a part of that action and I congratulate her for it.\n\n\n                              Human Rights\n\n  Today I am here to say the world is watching Venezuela. The Senate \nespecially is watching human rights abuse in Venezuela. I especially am \nwatching the case of Leopoldo Lopez, who has been in prison for 5 \nmonths. For what? For leading a political party and exercising his \nconstitutional rights.\n  Senator Menendez, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, \nhas spoken out about human rights abuse in Venezuela. Senator Corker, \nthe ranking Republican on Foreign Relations has spoken out about human \nrights abuse in Venezuela. Yesterday, Senator Cruz of Texas gave an \nimpassioned speech about Leopoldo Lopez in Venezuela and that \nconspicuous example of human rights abuse. Senator Rubio of Florida has \nbeen at the forefront of this discussion with his leadership on the \nForeign Relations Committee.\n  Today, I wish to speak about human rights abuse in Venezuela and to \nsay to President Maduro in Venezuela that the world is watching. The \nworld is watching him and his efforts to imprison his principal \npolitical opponent, Leopoldo Lopez.\n  Mr. President, many of us have visited Robben Island off South \nAfrica's coast. When my family and I did that a few years ago, there \nwas no moment that impressed me more in that visit than when some of \nthose who were imprisoned there with Nelson Mandela still give tours of \nRobben Island, about where he lived and where he exercised and how he \nconducted himself in the 27 years he was there before he came back and \nwas freed and became one of the most important persons in our world \nhistory.\n  It seems to me President Maduro of Venezuela is determined to turn \nLeopoldo Lopez into the Nelson Mandela of Venezuela by his \nunconscionable imprisonment of him principally because Leopoldo has \nspoken out and has expressed his political views about the country he \nloves.\n  Leopoldo was born in Venezuela and comes from a patriotic Venezuelan \nfamily, but he was educated in the United States which is where I met \nhim. I met him when he was a student at Kenyon College. In fact, I made \nthe graduation speech, when I was Secretary of Education, to the class \nin which he graduated, and he was a friend of my son who was also a \nstudent. I watched him over the years. He went on to Harvard and \nobtained a master's degree at the Kennedy School. He could have stayed \nin the United States and had a very successful career, but he chose \ninstead to return to the country he loved, Venezuela. He was elected \nmayor of a municipality at the age of 28 in an important area outside \nof Caracas. Four years later he was reelected with 81 percent of the \nvote. He is a rising star in Venezuela. There is no brighter star \nrising in the skies of Venezuela.\n  Hugo Chavez's government knew that someone like Leopoldo, who is well \neducated, charismatic, purposeful, and honest, with a desire to help \nhis fellow Venezuelans, would do nothing but cause problems for their \nsocialist government, so they barred him from running for public office \nand accused him of misusing public funds.\n  I suppose a lot of us would like to bar our principal opponents from \nrunning against us. The Senator from New Jersey and I are both in \nelections this year, but it hasn't occurred to us that in the United \nStates we could actually do that. Elections are the lifeblood of our \npolitical system and the lifeblood of this country and the lifeblood of \nour liberty and freedom, but in Venezuela if you don't like your \nopponent, you just say they cannot run for office. That is what they \ndid to Leopoldo.\n  Leopoldo fought back, taking his case all the way to the Inter-\nAmerican Court for Human Rights and he won. I had an opportunity to see \nhim in 2011 when he did that. I knew he would win his case. Anyone who \nlistened to it believed that. He then stayed in Venezuela. He faced \nassassination attempts, harassment, threats, but never wavered in his \ncall for the Venezuelan people to take action against the oppressive \nregime of Hugo Chavez and more recently Nicolas Maduro.\n  Venezuela is a rich country and has lots of money, but people cannot \nget toothpaste, people cannot get tissues. The inflation there is more \nthan 50 percent. You would expect there to be a leader demanding change \nfrom the government, someone who could express the views of the people. \nLeopoldo is that person, but he has been in jail for 5 months. He has \nbeen barred from running for public office because he is that leader.\n  He is a husband. He is the father of two young children. He chose to \nturn himself in to face trial. He could have come to the United States \nor some other country and said, ``I am in exile. I am a popular \nVenezuelan and I'll take the brave act of going into exile.'' No, he \ndidn't do that. He turned himself in, with a crowd of hundreds of \nthousands of people behind him, because he is in the tradition of \nGandhi, Martin Luther King, Mandela, and others is focusing his \nresistance in a nonviolent and a constitutional way. That is his lesson \nto the people of Venezuela.\n  However, he is in jail and has been for 5 months, and President \nMaduro keeps him there to silence the opposition. Or so the President \nthinks. Leopoldo's trial starts tomorrow. I say trial, although it is \nnot a trial that we would recognize.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee is on the floor \ntoday. He has been a leading spokesman for human rights across the \ncountry. He, too, is interested in human rights abuse in Venezuela. He \nwould not recognize this trial.\n  The defense team of Leopoldo has attempted to bring forward 60 \nwitnesses plus other experts to testify on their client's behalf. \nHowever, during a preliminary hearing every single witness for the \ndefense was disqualified.\n  There is the distinguished lawyer, the Senator from Massachusetts, on \nthe other side of the aisle. She knows what a trial is. She recognizes \nhuman abuse when she sees it, just as all of us do. So I think it is \nimportant for President Maduro, the people of Venezuela and the people \nin Venezuela who have been subjected to human rights abuse to know that \nis not going unnoticed in the United States of America, that there are \nSenators on the Democratic side and on the Republican side of the aisle \nwho are paying close attention to this; that our State Department is \nreviewing this very carefully; that this sort of human rights abuse in \nVenezuela--a country badly in need of political discourse and \nleadership--is something we should not ignore. We should say to \nPresident Maduro: Free Leopoldo Lopez. By locking him up for 5 months \nyou are not silencing him. You are helping to make him the Nelson \nMandela of Venezuela.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Tennessee who has \nsaid that the trial he described is not a trial. It is a sham, and no \nhonest and civilized country, no country that has even a pretense upon \nthe rule of law should accept that kind of a trial. So I applaud the \nsenior Senator from Tennessee for his comments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/22/senate-section/article/S4670-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4670-S4671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  JUSTICE FOR ALL REAUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have been on this floor many times to \ntalk about the need to support law enforcement and to ensure our \ncriminal justice system serves everyone fairly. I do so again in light \nof a very disturbing report issued by the Justice Department's \ninspector general last week which describes serious flaws in some of \nour Nation's crime labs. The report focused on 13 crime lab examiners \nwhose work was seriously flawed, but the worst part is that their \ntestimony contributed to the convictions of thousands of offenders, \nincluding 60 people on death row.\n\n[[Page S4671]]\n\n  The FBI launched an investigation. They discovered these mistakes, \nbut even after they discovered them, it took them 5 years to notify \nthose who were impacted--5 years that people were sitting in prison. \nDuring that time 3 of the 60 people on death row who were convicted and \nput on death row on potentially flawed evidence were executed and \nthousands more sat behind bars.\n  It is shocking and unacceptable. I mention this because even in a \ncountry such as ours, our criminal justice system is not infallible, \nand that is why I again urge the Senate to take up and pass the Justice \nFor All Reauthorization Act. It is a bill I introduced with Senator \nCornyn last year. It is a bipartisan piece of legislation which \nincludes the Kirk Bloodsworth Post-Conviction DNA Testing Grant \nProgram, which seeks to prevent travesties such as those described in \nthe IG report.\n  It is named for Kirk Bloodsworth, a man who has become a friend to me \nover the years. He was convicted and sent to prison and could have been \nexecuted. In 1993, he became the first person in the United States to \nbe exonerated from a death row crime through the use of DNA evidence.\n  Two hundred fifty additional people have been exonerated using this \ntechnology. Thomas Haynesworth was exonerated in 2011 after spending 27 \nyears in prison for crimes he did not commit, thanks to a grant \nprovided by the Justice for All Act. He was accused of rape in 1984, \nand wrongfully convicted. The real perpetrator went on to rape more \nthan a dozen women.\n  The Justice for All Act takes important steps to strengthen the \nrights of victims of crime and reauthorizes the Debbie Smith Act which \nhas provided significant funding to reduce the backlog of untested rape \nkits. The program is named for Debbie Smith, who waited years after \nbeing attacked before her rape kit was tested and the perpetrator was \ncaught. She and her husband Rob have worked tirelessly to ensure that \nothers will not experience such horror. I thank Debbie and Rob for \ntheir continuing help on this extremely important cause.\n  Just yesterday, a few blocks from here at the DC Superior Court, a \nman was exonerated by DNA evidence. Now that is the good news. He was \nexonerated. Kevin Martin was exonerated, but he spent 26 years in \nprison for the 1982 rape and murder of a Washington woman he had \nnothing to do with.\n  We know that in our criminal justice system mistakes are inevitable. \nBut the Justice for All Act reauthorization gives us the chance to fix \nsome of our most grievous errors.\n  Senator Cornyn and I believe that pursuit of justice is not a \npartisan issue, which is why we were pleased when our bill was \nunanimously approved by the Judiciary Committee back in October. Senate \nminority leader Mitch McConnell is also a cosponsor of the bill. Every \nsingle Senate Democrat has signed off on passing this. Senator \nGrassley, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, called the \ninspector general's report ``shocking.'' I agree completely, we all \nagree, which is why it is time for the full Senate to reach an \nagreement and consider the Justice for All Reauthorization Act.\n  I thank the many law enforcement, victim services and criminal \njustice organizations that have helped to pinpoint the needed \nimprovements that this law attempts to solve and I appreciate their \nongoing support in seeing it passed.\n  Let's pass the legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/22/senate-section/article/S4671-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO CFPB\n\n  Ms. WARREN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I am here today to say happy birthday to the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau. This week marks 4 years since Dodd-Frank was signed \ninto law and 3 years since the consumer agency opened its doors.\n  The consumer agency was built to be a new kind of regulatory agency, \none that would stand up for America's families, not for big banks or \ncredit card companies.\n  The consumer agency was not popular with big banks and their friends \nin Washington. The financial services industry spent more than $1 \nmillion a day fighting tooth and nail against financial reforms and \nthey vowed to kill the consumer agency before it was ever born. But \nthanks to the work of grassroots consumer groups across the country \nthat worked very hard and got organized, we pushed back against the big \nbanks' armies of lobbyists and lawyers, and we won. We succeeded in \nbuilding a strong independent consumer agency with the tools necessary \nto protect consumers against the tricks and traps hidden in the fine \nprint of mortgages, credit cards, and student loans.\n  Under Rich Cordray's leadership, the staff of the CFPB has made \namazing progress since it opened. This little agency has already forced \nbig financial institutions to return more than $4 billion to 15 million \nconsumers they cheated, and it has helped tens of thousands of \nconsumers resolve complaints about their financial institutions. It has \nput in place rules to protect consumers from a range of dangerous \nfinancial products and to make sure that companies cannot put out the \nkinds of deceptive mortgages that contributed to millions of \nforeclosures.\n  Recently the CFPB shared stories from people all across the country \nwho have reached out to the agency for help with financial issues. One \nof these stories is from Ari, an Iraq veteran from Hull, MA. Ari and \nhis father Harry told their story to CFPB. While serving in the \nmilitary, Ari took out a car loan advertised directly to \nservicemembers. The dealership promised Ari that he would be able to \nafford the loan, but after Harry read the fine print, he figured out \nthis was a terrible deal. So Harry filed a complaint with the CFPB and \nthe agency's investigation helped to uncover scams targeting men and \nwomen in uniform. Ultimately, the consumer agency ordered the auto \nlenders to refund about $6.5 million to the servicemembers they \ncheated, and to agree to stop these practices immediately.\n  This is just one example of how people are fighting back, using the \ntools of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It is also an \nexample of how the consumer agency is standing up for families who have \nbeen targeted by scams and unfair practices. Together families and the \nagency are starting to clean up the market for consumer credit.\n  Sure, there is a lot left to do. The consumer agency still has \nimportant rules to put in place regarding payday lending, debt \ncollection, and arbitration clauses. The biggest banks are dramatically \nbigger than they were during the financial crisis, and there is still \ntoo much risk in our system and too much need for reform. We need to \nkeep pushing for changes that will make our financial system more \nstable and more secure to protect consumers and to keep our economy \nsafe.\n  Stories such as Ari's and Harry's show that the consumer agency works \nand that the agency empowers people. In a badly tilted financial \nmarketplace, the agency is giving consumers a fighting chance. This \nweek is an opportunity to highlight these accomplishments and a \nreminder of how we can make Washington work for families all across \nthis country.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/22/senate-section/article/S4671-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                       Malaysia Airlines Tragedy\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I wish to comment on the tragedy of the \ncivilian airliner shot out of the sky by a Russian surface-to-air \nmissile, cutting short the lives of 298 innocent civilians. Parents, \nchildren and spouses of victims have expressed deep anguish, and we all \nfeel their grief.\n  All of us agree the images we are seeing from the crash site are \nheartbreaking and sickening. President Obama, Dutch Prime Minister Mark \nRutte, leaders throughout the world, and many others have expressed \ntheir outrage at the vicious, uncivilized act that took place at 33,000 \nfeet over the country of Ukraine. A few days ago, British Prime \nMinister David Cameron stated firmly:\n\n       For too long there has been a reluctance on the part of too \n     many European countries to face up to the implications of \n     what is happening in eastern Ukraine. . . . Elegant forms of \n     words and fine communiques are no substitute for real action. \n     The weapons and fighters being funneled across the border \n     between Russia and eastern Ukraine; the support to the \n     militias; the half-truths, the bluster, the delays. They have \n     to stop.\n\n  As the prime minister acknowledged: This is a moment when words of \ncondemnation and expressions of grief are simply not enough. This is a \nmoment when action must follow the outrage and rhetorical condemnation.\n  The tragedy of Malaysian Airlines 17 will be a defining event in \nhistory. It is a defining event for Russia, first and foremost, and for \nits President, Vladimir Putin. It is no secret that Putin has imperial \nambitions, motivated by his pathological insecurities, and a quest to \nrestore lost glory to Mother Russia. These are dangerous delusions. If \nthey are not confronted firmly, they will come to threaten us all.\n  But it is also a defining event for the United States and its \nEuropean allies. The festering danger in Ukraine is the result of the \ncivilized world's faltering half-steps as a meager, timid and all too \nminimal response to Russia's invasion of a neighbor in violation of \nsovereign borders. This is an opportunity for American leadership, in \nstep with our European allies, to spur the community of nations to act \ntogether and be a force for good and be a force for the right change \nthat needs to take place--not later, but now.\n  It is a defining event for President Obama and German Chancellor \nAngela Merkel. Today these two leaders, the two who are most able to \ninfluence this situation, can stand up and demonstrate leadership that \nwill shape history. So this is a pivotal moment--a pivotal moment for \nthe United States, for Germany, for the European Union and for the \nworld. Given the significance of this event in this moment, what are we \nto do? I do not have all the answers. I have been suggesting harsh \nsanctions, sanctions that bite, that hit Russia hard ever since their \ninvasion of Crimea.\n  As I have said earlier, what has been done is far too short of what \nneeds to be done to punish Russia for the breach of sovereignty and now \nthis brutal and terrible tragic result and consequence of what they are \ndoing in eastern Ukraine. So first we need to ask the entire civilized \nworld to join the United States, our European allies, and everyone in \ncondemning this outrageous act.\n  Events like this tragedy have no place in the modern world. This \nunassailable fact needs to be acknowledged globally and more than once. \nIt needs to be acknowledged repeatedly until it becomes so loud that \nPutin and the Russians can hear it in Moscow and in the Kremlin and see \nthat what has taken place is the direct result of their engagement in \neastern Ukraine.\n  Secondly, I think we need to demand complete cooperation with the \nongoing investigation. Positive steps are beginning to take place far \ntoo late, but at least they are starting to take place.\n  Our commitment to the rule of law, rules of evidence, and to the \ndemands of justice require that we go through this investigative \nprocess, and we must insist on the access to do so. We must demand \nfull, immediate, unhindered access to the site of the tragedy, \nincluding all parts of the aircraft, missile battery, site evidence \nand, most of all, proper treatment of the remains of the many victims. \nPresident Putin by himself can ensure that success and that access, and \nhe absolutely must be required to do so.\n  Third, we need to demand an immediate Russian stand-down in Ukraine. \nCrimes like Malaysia Airlines flight 17 can only happen in such a \nlawless wasteland--renegades and desperados with their fingers on the \ntriggers of the world's most advanced weapons. Lawlessness reigns in \neastern Ukraine because the government of that nation still does not \nhave sovereign control of its own territory.\n  The situation is greatly exacerbated as a result of President Putin's \noutrageous territorial aggression. He has already severed an arm of \nUkraine and threatened an entire country's disintegration.\n  Make no mistake, the Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine have been \norganized, motivated, trained, equipped, unleashed, guided, and \ncontrolled by the forces of the Russian Federation which are controlled \nthemselves--with totalitarian execution--by none other than President \nVladimir Putin. Now we see a new tragic result of this aggression, of \nsponsorship, of ruthless renegades--a blatant act of terrorism \ninflicted on innocent people. This problem will only get worse unless \nwe demand that Russian behavior change and Putin's aggression stop. It \nneeds to be a voice that resounds from every nation, civilized nation, \nin the world.\n  The only solution to the Ukraine problem is doing what is consistent \nwith our national law. The demands of order and civility and the \nrequirements of justice are what Russia must acknowledge and that the \nGovernment of Ukraine must have sovereign control over its own \nterritory.\n  No. 4, the United States and Europe must, at last, act vigorously and \nin unison if we are to succeed in this effort. Until now, President \nObama has sent largely weak signals to Putin about the seriousness of \nRussia's actions. Our European partners have been reluctant to act, \nsome hypnotized by anxiety about their economic dependency on Russian \noil and gas. Let us hope that after this horrific act of terror against \n298 innocent passengers on Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, this view is \nchanging and changing quickly.\n  History will see this event as a watershed moment. Some argue that \nthe Soviet downing of Korean Airlines flight 007 in 1983 was an event \nthat exposed the true nature of the Soviet regime and hastened its \ndecay. Similarly, Malaysia Airlines flight 17 reveals to any remaining \ndoubters the nature of Putin and his brutal ambitions and ruthlessness.\n\n[[Page S4674]]\n\n  With illusions stripped away, the inadequacy of half measures \nrevealed, we must now act and act together. We can respond to this \ntragedy by forming and forging a new unity. But only the most robust \nand concerted actions to impose economic sanctions on Russia have a \nchance to change Putin's behavior and end Russian support for the \nseparatist militants and, to be effective, we and the Europeans must do \nthis together, imposing these costs.\n  We need to target the fragile Russian economy through sanctions on \nRussia's energy sector and State-backed arms exporter. While it may \ntake time for Russia to feel the effects of sanctions on the energy \nsector, we can take action today that would have an immediate effect.\n  I have previously introduced legislation that prohibits all \ngovernment contracts with Putin's arms dealers. Taking steps to \nmeaningfully obstruct this agency's work and the revenue it provides \nthe Russian State is one of the most effective ways we can condemn \nPutin's aggression. Through these specific sanctions we can demand that \nPutin end his support for the separatists and accept and work toward a \nstable Ukraine. If not, I suggest we do whatever is necessary to bring \nRussia's economy to its knees. We need to see that stock market \nplummet. We need to see confidence and support for anything Russia \nmakes or exports denied by the civilized nations of the world. We need \nto put measures there to prevent their manufacturing and shipment of \narms to people such as Assad in Syria, to the Iranians, to the groups \nthat are creating havoc around the world. Russia's arms exports are a \nmajor source of their revenue. We need to stop them.\n  The decision is in their hands. Following this horrific, brutal, \ntragic event, they have the responsibility to the world's nations to \nstep up and address this issue.\n  This crisis has reached a point of high tension, great tragedy, and \nescalated consequences. These potential consequences are dangerous for \nall of us but, most of all, they are dangerous for Putin's Russia.\n  Russia's President holds in his hands the ability to de-escalate this \ncrisis or to pay a very steep price. We need to define and implement \nthat steep price if he doesn't take this action.\n  It is Putin's choice to bring this situation back from the brink. It \nis our obligation, along with our European partners, to make Putin's \nchoice crystal clear.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. What is the general order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time between now and 12:30 p.m. is equally \ndivided, and the Republicans control 5 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized for 8 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Global Warming\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Later this week we are going to have the EPA \nAdministrator Gina McCarthy come to our Environment and Public Works \nCommittee to testify about the greenhouse gas rule being developed for \nexisting fleets of powerplants. We know what the rule is for the new \npowerplants; this is for the existing.\n  In light of that, it is important to point out that the Senate has \nbeen debating global warming for well over a decade, actually around 14 \nyears. The first cap-and-trade bill the Senate debated was when \nRepublicans were in the majority. I was chairman at that time of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee.\n  The first bill was the McCain-Lieberman bill which would have set \nCO2 limits on all utilities that emit at least 10,000 tons \nof greenhouse gases per year. That was defeated October 30, 2003, by a \nvote of 43 to 55. That was when I was all alone. Actually, everyone \nthought eventually something was going to pass and they were all afraid \nof the issue.\n  Now times have dramatically changed. Since that time we have had \nother bills come up. In 2005 we had the same bill by the same authors. \nIt was defeated even at that time by a wider range.\n  Then in 2008 the Lieberman-Warner bill came up, and it failed also. \nThat was actually when the Republicans had lost the majority. So even \nwith the Democrats as the majority, they were not able to get it \nthrough.\n  Most recently, we debated the Waxman and Markey bill of 2009 which \nsaid emissions to facilities over 25,000 tons a year. That bill passed \nthe House, but it was never brought to the Senate for a vote because \nthey knew it would fail.\n  Each of these bills had one thing in common: Their cost was enormous. \nWe found out--and there was testimony quite some time ago--that if we \nwere to pass cap-and-trade, the cost would be in the area of $300 \nbillion to $400 billion a year.\n  I do calculations every time I hear a large number and I go back. In \nmy State of Oklahoma, I calculate the number of families who actually \nfile Federal tax returns and do the math. That would cost each family \nin Oklahoma about $3,000 a year. We know it doesn't make any \ndifference, because the testimony of the Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, the EPA, Lisa Jackson, who was \nappointed by President Obama, said in response to my question on the \npublic record that even if we were to pass something it would not have \nthe effect of reducing CO2 emissions worldwide, because this \nisn't where the problem is. The problem is in China and other places.\n  Since this time--and it is not me saying this--Nature magazine, The \nEconomist, and even the IPCC--the IPCC is the United Nations; they are \nthe ones who started this--they admit for the past 15 years there has \nbeen no increase in global temperatures. Meanwhile, the CO2 \nemissions have increased a lot. So obviously it is not warming and that \nis going back into a normal cycle.\n  Unfortunately, this hasn't deterred the President from making global \nwarming a key part of domestic policy. What he could not have \naccomplished through legislation he is now doing through regulations at \nthe EPA, but the American people don't want anything to do with this.\n  I can remember when the polls were something like the No. 1 or No. 2 \nissue. The last Gallup poll, this past week, had it as No. 14 out of 15 \nissues. The Pew Research Center--53 percent of Americans, when asked \nabout the cause of global warming, said they don't believe there is \nenough evidence to blame human anthropogenic gases or to believe that \nit is caused by natural variation.\n  This problem explains why it is difficult for Tom Steyer. On the \nfloor I showed his picture and read the comments he had made. He is \nraising $100 million to put into campaigns. He has already put up $50 \nmillion and has been unable to raise anything close to the next $50 \nmillion. So people are not rallying to pour money into this lost cause.\n  The international community is starting to give up too. I was with \nthe Secretary of Defense of Australia last night, and he was one of \nthem who was very strongly in opposition to the cap-and-trade they \nadopted in Australia and they have now, as of 1 month ago, repealed it. \nIf you look at other countries, and not only Australia but others that \nwere believing this at one time, are dropping off. So the Australian \npeople should thank the Prime Minister.\n  It is my hope we will be able to protect the American people from the \nsenseless global warming policies in the United States.\n  Tomorrow we are going to have a committee hearing, and the momentum \nhas actually gone from the other side.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, here we are--another day in the Senate--\nfacing another political gimmick. That is the way things seem to work \nin the Democratic Senate, and that is what is happening again this \nweek.\n  Yesterday Democrats introduced their latest designed-to-fail bill, \nthe Bring Jobs Home Act. It is a bill they\n\n[[Page S4675]]\n\nknow is not going to pass. The reason I say the bill is designed to \nfail is because it has already failed. It has been voted on here before \nin the previous Congress, but that is not stopping the Democrats.\n  The Bring Jobs Home Act would supposedly encourage American companies \nto bring jobs back home to the United States and to discourage \ncompanies from sending jobs overseas. But the bill completely ignores \nthe real problem and the reason American companies are sending jobs \noverseas: America's broken Tax Code and our sky-high tax rate on \nbusiness. America has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the \ndeveloped world and many companies simply can't afford to pay it and \nstay profitable.\n  If Democrats were truly serious about solving the problem of American \njobs going overseas, they would be sitting down with Republicans to \nhammer out reform of our Tax Code. We should be substantially lowering \noverall tax rates to allow American businesses to keep jobs here at \nhome while remaining competitive in the global marketplace. Instead of \nserious reform, however, Democrats have chosen to take up a bill that \nwould do nothing to address the real problem we are dealing with. \nDemocrats are not bringing up this bill in the hopes of actually fixing \nproblems. They are bringing it up in hopes of winning a few votes in \nthe November election. This is not a secret.\n  When Democrats first brought this bill up 2 years ago ahead of the \n2012 election, Reuters described it as an example of Members of \nCongress ``offering up measures they know will not pass but can be used \nto fire up their respective supporters in the run-up to November's \nelections.'' That was from 2 years ago, the last time this was brought \nup. That has been the Democrats' preferred method of operating in the \nSenate.\n  Back in March the New York Times reported that Democrats planned to \nspend the spring and summer on messaging votes ``timed to coincide with \ncampaign-style trips by President Obama.'' Again, that is from the New \nYork Times earlier this year.\n  The ``Democrats concede,'' the Times continued, ``that making new \nlaws is not really the point.'' ``Rather, they are trying to force \nRepublicans to vote against them.'' That is also a quote which was in \nthe New York Times story a few months ago. Making new laws is not \nreally the point. What we are talking about here is not fixing \nproblems; it is just creating political opportunities.\n  So 5\\1/2\\ years of Democratic policies have left American families \nhurting. Unemployment, which the President's advisers predicted would \nfall below 6 percent in 2012, is still above 6 percent 2 years later. \nAlmost 10 million Americans are unemployed, and 3.1 million have been \nunemployed for 6 months or longer. Those numbers would be even worse if \nso many Americans had not given up on finding work and dropped out of \nthe labor force all together.\n  Our current labor force participation rate is at lows we have not \nseen since the 1970s during the Presidency of Jimmy Carter. In fact, if \nthe labor participation rate were today what it was when the President \ntook office, the unemployment rate would not be a little over 6 \npercent, it would be 10.2 percent. That is how many people have \nentirely quit looking for work.\n  Household income has plummeted by more than $3,300 on the President's \nwatch. At the same time, prices have risen. Food prices have increased. \nThe price of gas has nearly doubled, college costs continue to soar, \nand family health insurance premiums have skyrocketed by almost $3,000, \ndespite the President's promise they would fall. And what do you get \nwhen you combine high prices, fewer opportunities for employment and \nadvancement and reduced income? You get a lot of struggling middle-\nclass families.\n  Instead of spending this year taking up serious legislation to help \nthose families, Democrats--by their own admission--have spent this year \non political show votes they hope will win them a few votes in the \nNovember election.\n  Last week the Congressional Budget Office issued its yearly long-term \nbudget outlet. The news on that front was grim. The Congressional \nBudget Office recorded that as early as 2039, under its baseline \nscenario, the Nation could see public debt reach 106 percent of GDP, \nwhich would be a level of debt seen only once before in our Nation's \nhistory.\n  By 2039, under an alternative fiscal scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio \ncould rise to more than 180 percent of GDP. By comparison, Greece's \ncurrent debt-to-GDP ratio is 175 percent. In other words, our economy \ncould go the way of Greece's in just a few short years if nothing is \ndone.\n  We have to take up significant budget reform and reduce the size of \ngovernment. We need to look for ways we can make government work more \neffectively and more efficiently by reforming programs that need to be \nreformed. Chipping away around the edges is not going to get the job \ndone. It is not going to cut it.\n  Even before the President came into office, our national debt \npresented a serious and pressing problem. But over the last 5\\1/2\\ \nyears of the current administration, the problem has gotten \nexponentially worse. If you look at our total debt--which includes the \npublic and intergovernmental debt--when President Obama came into \noffice, our national debt was $10.6 trillion. Today, just 5\\1/2\\ years \nlater, our national total debt stands at $17.6 trillion. That is a 66-\npercent increase on the President's watch. That is horrifying. Yet \nPresident Obama and his party continue to act as if our country is not \nhurdling toward a fiscal crisis.\n  Among the President's many fiscally irresponsible policies, ObamaCare \nstands out as one of the worst offenders. Former Congressional Budget \nOffice Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin has estimated that the President's \nhealth care law will increase the deficit by hundreds of billions of \ndollars in its first 10 years alone and by more than $1.5 trillion over \nthe next 10 years.\n  Politico reports that the Congressional Budget Office attributes the \ncoming growth of the debt to--among other things--``rising health care \ncosts'' and ``the expansion of subsidies offered through ObamaCare.'' \nSo much for the President's claim that the health care law would be \n``the largest deficit reduction plan in over a decade.'' But that is \npar for the course for the Affordable Care Act.\n  The President also promised that the law would reduce Americans' \nhealth insurance premiums by $2,500. Instead, as I mentioned, they have \nalready risen by almost $3,000, and they are still going up.\n  I have a few headlines from this past week that I will read into the \nRecord. Yesterday's Kaiser Health News reported: ``Florida's Biggest \nHealth Insurer Signals Rate Hikes Ahead.''\n  The Nebraska Radio Network had an expert who said: ``Nebraskans' \npremiums may bounce 30 percent under ObamaCare.''\n  Last Wednesday, the Nashville Business Journal reported, ``Here come \nhigher premiums: Tennessee's insurance providers request rate \nincreases.''\n  Last Tuesday, the Associated Press reported: ``Delawareans Could Face \nHigher Rates Under ACA.''\n  The New Orleans Times-Picayune reported: ``Some insurance carriers \nlooking for double-digit increases for Affordable Care Act policies.''\n  Those are just a few of the most recent headlines from newspapers \naround this country last week. I could go on about the health care \nlaw's broken promises. I could also talk about the fact that the \nPresident promised that Americans would be able to keep their doctors \nand hospitals, but Americans are now finding the new health plans \nexclude doctors and hospitals they have literally been using for \nyears or the fact that the health care bill was supposed to give more \nAmericans access to health care but that many Americans are struggling \nto find doctors who will take their ObamaCare insurance.\n\n  One doctor reporting on her patient's experience with the ObamaCare \nplan said: ``We are running into problems with coverage in the same way \nwe were when they were uninsured.'' Let me repeat that. This is from a \ndoctor talking about one of her patient's experiences with the \nObamaCare plan: ``We are running into problems with coverage in the \nsame way we were when they were uninsured.'' If that doesn't sum up the \nlaw's failure, I don't know what does.\n  Then there was the President's promise that shopping for health care \non the exchange would be like buying a TV on Amazon or a plane ticket \non Kayak. As\n\n[[Page S4676]]\n\nAmericans quickly found out or are still finding out almost 10 months \nlater, shopping on the exchanges is a lot more like the world's most \nnightmarish experience with the DMV.\n  ObamaCare is failing Americans, and so is the Obama economy. Instead \nof focusing on making things better, Democrats are focused on trying to \nget reelected in November.\n  Republicans have solutions to the challenges facing the American \npeople--solutions such as approving the Keystone Pipeline and the tens \nof thousands of jobs it would support; repealing the ObamaCare 30-hour \nworkweek provision, which is slashing employees' hours and wages; \nstopping the job-killing national energy tax which will eliminate \nhundreds of thousands of jobs and drive up Americans' energy bills; \nenacting trade promotion authority to open new markets to American \nfarmers, workers, and businesses; repealing the medical device tax \nwhich is costing American jobs and increasing the cost of health care; \nand passing real health care reform--the kind that will lower costs, \nincrease choice, and put Americans back in charge of their health care. \nIf Democrats were serious about helping American families, they would \nbe working with us on these priorities instead of tying up the Senate \nwith partisan legislation, and they would be taking up the 40 House-\npassed jobs bills currently gathering dust on the majority leader's \ndesk.\n  Every day the Senate spends on designed-to-fail bills, designed-to-\nfail legislation--bills we know aren't going anywhere--is a day the \nSenate is not spending on bills to provide real relief to the American \npeople.\n  It is high time for Democrats to stop wasting time on partisan \nlegislation and start working with Republicans on real reform. Middle-\nclass, middle-income families around this country have been squeezed \nfor long enough. The American people have been waiting long enough. \nThere are 40 House-passed jobs bills waiting for action here in the \nSenate. Instead, we are spending week after week of the Senate's time \nvoting on bills designed to fail and designed to do nothing more than \nscore political points heading into an election.

There is now 2 minutes equally divided prior \nto a vote on the Birotte nomination.\n  If no one yields time, time will be equally charged to both sides.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I urge my colleagues to support the \nnomination of Andre Birotte to be a U.S. district judge for the Central \nDistrict of California.\n  I recommended Mr. Birotte to serve as U.S. attorney for this district \nin 2009. I have been very impressed by his performance in that role \nsince his unanimous confirmation by the Senate in 2010. I believe he \nwill be an outstanding district judge.\n  Mr. Birotte received his law degree from Pepperdine in 1991 and his \nbachelor's from Tufts in 1987. He then served as a deputy public \ndefender for the Los Angeles County Public Defender's office. He later \nspent 4 years as an assistant U.S. attorney in the Central District of \nCalifornia, where he prosecuted violent crime, fraud, and narcotics \ncases.\n  In 1999, he spent a year in private practice before moving to the Los \nAngeles Police Commission, where he served as assistant inspector \ngeneral and later as inspector general until he became U.S. attorney. \nAs inspector general, Birotte built a strong reputation for fairness \nand earned the respect of all sides, including in the law enforcement \ncommunity. In 2009, then-LAPD Chief Bill Bratton--who is deeply \nrespected on both sides of the aisle in this body--wrote to me to \nexpress his ``strongest endorsement and support'' for Birotte. As Chief \nBratton said: ``In the approximately six years that I have known Andre, \nour working relationship has been one of transparency, cooperation, \ntrust, and respect.''\n  In 2009, as I said, I recommended him to the President for \nappointment as U.S. attorney. He earned high marks from my bipartisan \nadvisory committee and an outpouring of support from a broad spectrum \nof respected individuals in the Los Angeles community. The Senate soon \nconfirmed him unanimously and he has served in his current position \nwith distinction ever since.\n  When I introduced Mr. Birotte to my colleagues on the Judiciary \nCommittee, I went through the impressive work the U.S. attorney's \noffice has done under his leadership in a number of areas. I will not \ngo into each of those cases today, except to note that they cover very \nimportant areas of Federal law enforcement, including: national \nsecurity, gangs and organized crime, sex crimes and human trafficking, \npublic corruption, and civil rights.\n  Since his nomination was approved by the Judiciary Committee by voice \nvote, the U.S. attorney's office has continued its impressive track \nrecord of enforcing the law. In one case, a Los Angeles doctor who ran \nmedical clinics pleaded guilty to illegally prescribing addictive \npainkillers and laundering the cash payments, which amounted to \nhundreds of thousands of dollars.\n  Last month, the owner and employees of a Los Angeles-area immigration \nconsulting firm were arrested after being indicted for filing \nfraudulent green card applications. The office's press release states \nthat the defendants quoted fees for their services, but then more than \ntripled those fees and ``allegedly threatened to contact authorities \nand have the aliens deported'' after ``several of the foreign nationals \nsought refunds.''\n  Just 2 weeks ago, Mr. Birotte's office announced that two men from \nLong Beach, CA pleaded guilty to ``conspiracy charges arising from a \nsex trafficking scheme that exploited adult women for prostitution.'' \nBill Lewis, assistant director in charge of the FBI Los Angeles field \noffice, stated: ``In this case, the defendants defrauded victims and \nforced them to work as sex slaves under threat to themselves and their \nfamilies.'' The office's press release states that both men now face up \nto life imprisonment.\n  Let me conclude by saying that throughout his career Andre Birotte \nhas built a reputation for fairness and for a profound commitment to \nthe rule of law. He has earned the deep respect of people on all sides \nof difficult issues. In fact, Birotte is supported not only by State \nand Federal law enforcement, but also by the Central District's Federal \nPublic Defender, Sean Kennedy. Kennedy told my selection committee that \nBirotte has ``incredible judgment'' and would make a ``wonderful \nfederal judge.'' It says something very special about the chief Federal \nprosecutor for the second-largest district in the Nation when the chief \nFederal Public Defender for the district has such high praise.\n  This is a nominee I am proud to have recommended, and that the Senate \nshould be proud to confirm.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, all time is yielded back.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Andre Birotte, Jr., of California, to be United States District \nJudge for the Central District of California?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         deGravelles Nomination\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, it is truly my distinct privilege to be \nable to speak on behalf of John Weadon deGravelles, a nominee for the \nMiddle District Court in Louisiana. I am very gratified that my \ncolleagues gave him a very strong vote of approval--a unanimous vote--\njust a few minutes ago. President Obama nominated Mr. deGravelles \nearlier this year, and I am very pleased I was joined by Senator \nVitter, my colleague from Louisiana, in recommending him for his \nconfirmation today.\n  He is affectionately known to his friends and family as Johnny. He \nhas the support of a wide cross section of community leaders in \nLouisiana, and that support is based on an extraordinarily impressive \nscholarship he received to attend college at Louisiana State \nUniversity, where he majored in sociology and received his juris \ndoctorate from the law school. He excelled\n\n[[Page S4678]]\n\nacademically and has practiced law now for decades but is still fondly \nremembered as an extraordinary student.\n  After graduating from LSU, he served as a clerk at the firm Due & \nDodson in Baton Rouge and would later become a partner in that firm. He \nis now practicing under his own name at deGravelles, Palmintier, \nHolthaus & Fruge.\n  As a partner in his well-established firm in Baton Rouge, he has \nhoned his skills as one of the region's most capable litigators in both \nFederal and State court.\n  In addition to his work as a lawyer, respected by a broad cross \nsection of leaders, he also taught for 20 years at both Tulane Law \nSchool and Louisiana State University. He is very popular, I \nunderstand, as a teacher. He is always open to students and his advice \nis sought after on a regular basis.\n  He is a very active member of a variety of bar associations, \nincluding the American Bar Association, the Federal Bar Association, \nand the Louisiana State Bar. He was admitted to practice, of course, in \nthe U.S. District Courts for the Western, Middle, and Eastern Districts \nof Louisiana, the Southern District of Texas, the Fifth, Sixth, and \nEleventh U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeals, and the U.S. Supreme Court. He \nhas practiced for literally decades in front of the Federal bench.\n  He has also been recognized for his outstanding leadership by very \ndistinguished organizations, including the Louisiana Trial Bar, the \nLouisiana Trial Lawyers Association, and the Council for a Better \nLouisiana.\n  He has written dozens and dozens of articles for legal publication. \nHe is a sought-after speaker for seminars throughout the country.\n  Our former chief justice of the Supreme Court of Louisiana--also the \nfirst woman chief justice--Kitty Kimball described Johnny as ``an \nexceptional lawyer who enjoys the respect of both bench and bar.''\n  I think one of the most important aspects of his background is that \nafter the devastating storms of Rita and Katrina in 2005, Mr. \ndeGravelles was one of the real champions in helping to set up the \nLouisiana Association for Justice Hurricane Relief Committee which \nassisted many displaced attorneys who had no place to practice, clients \nwho were distributed all over the country, and courthouses that were \nclosed--to help the wheels of justice move forward during that very \ndifficult time of upheaval and destruction.\n  I have every confidence Mr. deGravelles will serve the people of the \nMiddle District as a fair, wise, and very experienced lawyer who will \nserve as a judge.\n  I am very proud that this body voted so overwhelmingly in favor of \nhis confirmation today. I know his wife Jan is extremely proud of him, \nand he and Jan are proud of both children who followed in their \nfather's footsteps. Kate and Neil are both practicing attorneys in \nLouisiana.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a \npiece of commonsense legislation the Senate is preparing to consider \nthis week. The bill, which is called the Bring Jobs Home Act, sets out \nto do just what that name implies--bring good-paying jobs back to \nAmerica.\n  Our Tax Code has a fundamental flaw. Right now a U.S. company can \ndecide to cut American jobs, move them overseas, and then claim those \nexpenses as a tax deduction, thereby lowering the amount of taxes the \ncompany pays.\n  If a company decides to move 75 good-paying U.S. manufacturing jobs \noverseas, not only do we lose good American jobs, but taxpayers in \nColorado and West Virginia and throughout the country are footing the \nbill for the cost of killing those jobs. American taxpayers literally \nget billed for the cost of shipping jobs overseas.\n  I don't think it is right to reward companies for cutting American \njobs, and I don't think it is right to ask taxpayers to subsidize the \ncost of moving those jobs overseas. That is why I am cosponsoring the \nBring Jobs Home Act in an effort to provide better incentives for U.S. \nbusinesses to bring good-paying jobs back to our country and keep them \nhere. Our country is at its best when we produce here in America.\n  Simply put, the Bring Jobs Home Act is about looking out for the best \ninterest of Coloradans and not the bottom lines of corporations that \nwant to ship their jobs to places such as China and India.\n  What is best about this legislation is that not only would it end \ntaxpayer subsidies for outsourcing, it would take the money that is \nsaved and invest it in America by offering a 20-percent tax credit for \nbusinesses that decide to bring jobs back to the United States.\n  This legislation is one piece of a larger conversation Congress ought \nto have about what the Tax Code should look like in the 2lst century \neconomy. What are the values it should reflect? What are the incentives \nit should provide? These are important questions we need to answer, and \nthe Bring Jobs Home Act is an initial step to achieve fair and \nreasonable reform.\n  I have been a long-time proponent of tax reform to streamline and \nsimplify the Federal Tax Code because I am convinced--as I believe the \nPresiding Officer is--that the certainty and predictability it will \ncreate will lead to job growth in our country.\n  Last week Colorado reported that its unemployment rate was 5.5 \npercent, the lowest since 2008. But we can do more, and this bill is \none of the best places to start.\n\n  So let's join together and support this commonsense legislation so \nthat we can reward companies that restore and create made-in-America \njobs--jobs that shore up our economy and bolster our global \ncompetitiveness.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to make my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Senate Dysfunction\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the unique and \nessential role of the Senate in our constitutional system of \ngovernment. In doing so, I am of course addressing the American people \nwhom we all serve, but my message today is intended especially for my \ncolleagues in this body.\n  I had the honor of serving here for more than three decades with one \nof my closest and dearest friends, the late Ted Kennedy. Our friendship \ninevitably invited others to describe us as the Senate's odd couple \ngiven the vast differences in our backgrounds and our outlooks and \nbecause of the many fights we had on the floor as well as the many \nsuccesses we had together. But my friendship with Teddy flourished, as \ndid our legislative partnerships. Even with polar-opposite political \nphilosophies, we were able to find significant areas of mutual \nagreement, and we both maintained a great affection for the Senate--an \ninstitution to which we had each devoted most of our adult lives.\n  Toward the end of his life, as Teddy suffered through the terrible \naffliction that eventually took him from us, he watched his beloved \nSenate with growing concern. He observed a growing dysfunction \nbeginning to overcome this body. He believed this institution, which he \nloved so dearly, was breaking down. The man rightly described as the \nliberal lion of the Senate concluded that this body was no longer \nworking as it must.\n  My friend Teddy was right, and the Senate has only gotten worse since \nhe diagnosed its ills several years ago. The Senate is more \ndysfunctional today than at any other point during my nearly four \ndecades as a Member of this body.\n  I am not alone in this assessment. Former colleagues from both \npolitical parties--from Chris Dodd to Olympia Snowe--have spoken out \nwith great passion about the breakdown of the Senate as an institution. \nIt would be hard to find a current Member of this body who, in moments \nof honest reflection, did not feel as if the Senate is in many respects \nbroken.\n  Most importantly, the American public has lost faith in this body and \nlargely views the Senate as an institution characterized by \ndysfunction. To say that today Congress is held in low esteem is an \nunderstatement. Our approval rating ranges from the teens to the single \ndigits. One survey found that the public has a higher opinion of\n\n[[Page S4679]]\n\nbrussel sprouts, root canals, and used car salesmen than of Congress. \nIn many respects, this popular assessment is justified. Throughout my \n38 years of service in this body, I have never seen it this bad.\n  For the sake of our country and the well-being of our fellow \ncitizens, we must restore order and function to the Senate so we can \nfulfill our constitutional responsibilities and once again conduct the \npeople's business.\n  In reflecting on the past four decades in the Senate, I have come to \nrealize that I possess an increasingly unique perspective. I have been \nin the majority for a total of 16 years and in the minority for a total \nof 22 years. I have served in this body with eight different majority \nleaders, four Republicans and four Democrats. By contrast, the majority \nof my colleagues--56, to be precise--have served in the Senate only \nduring the tenure of the current majority leader. Nearly as many have \nserved alongside only the current President. These numbers will \nincrease in the coming months with the retirement of six of our senior \ncolleagues and the potential electoral defeat of others.\n  To my colleagues who as a matter of firsthand experience don't know \nanything different, let me say this: The Senate has not always been as \ndysfunctional as it is today. Quite the opposite. Until recently, this \nChamber often lived up to its reputation as the world's greatest \ndeliberative body. We regularly worked together in an orderly and \nconstructive fashion to advance the common good, and we routinely \ndefended our institutional prerogatives against executive encroachment. \nUnfortunately, none of that is true of the Senate today.\n  I intend to speak in greater detail later this week about what I \nbelieve ails the Senate and how we can restore the health and dignity \nof this venerable institution. But to understand where we have come \nfrom and just how far we have strayed, we must begin at the beginning.\n  Remarking on the deliberations of the Constitutional Convention, \nJames Madison wisely observed that in determining the form the Senate \nshould take, it was necessary to consider the purposes it would serve. \nThe Framers were clear about these objectives. The Senate was to serve \nas a necessary fence against what they described as the fickleness and \npassion that drives popular pressure for hasty and ill-considered \nlawmaking--what Edward Randolph called ``the turbulence and follies of \ndemocracy.'' In fulfilling this purpose, the Senate was to be a place \nof thoughtful deliberation, an assembly dedicated to careful scrutiny, \nand a body with great concern for the sovereign States and the \nindividual liberties of all Americans. These were to be the purpose of \nthe Senate. Its institutional design followed directly from these \nprinciples.\n  The relatively small membership of the Senate would amplify the \nimportance of each individual Senator as opposed to Chamber leaders or \nlarge voting blocs. Unlike in the House of Representatives, where \nrobust participation by individual Members would be impossibly \ncumbersome, in this body each Senator could become intimately involved \nin all aspects of the Chamber's deliberation and debate. Longer terms \nwould allow Senators to resist initially popular but ultimately unwise \nlegislation and allow for vindication of this more measured approach \nprior to facing reelection. Staggered terms would create a continuing \nbody that could temper unwieldy swings of public passion. Statewide \nconstituencies would require appealing to a broader set of interests \nthan more narrow and homogenous House districts.\n\n  In addition, the Senate's authority to determine its own rules would \nallow the gradual development of traditions and precedents unique to \nthis body and essential to its ends. Building upon the Constitution's \ndefining institutional contours, these historic rules and traditions \nhave shaped the Senate into a body that Gladstone called ``the most \nremarkable of all of the inventions of modern politics.''\n  The Senate's most characteristic operating procedure became unanimous \nconsent, which requires the agreement of not just a majority or even a \nsupermajority but of all Senators.\n  As Senate Parliamentarian emeritus Robert Dove testified before the \nRules Committee in April of 2010, the two key features that have come \nto define to Senate through its history are ``the right of its members \nto unlimited debate and the right to offer amendments practically \nwithout limit.'' With these historic rules and defining modes of \noperation--unlimited debate and amendments--the Senate rightfully \nearned the title of the world's greatest deliberative body.\n  In his 1897 farewell address, the first Adlai Stevenson, then Vice \nPresident, captured the essence of the Senate:\n\n       In this Chamber alone are preserved without restraint two \n     essentials of wise legislation and good government: the right \n     of amendment and of debate. Great evils often result from \n     hasty legislation; [but] rarely from the delay which follows \n     full discussion and deliberation.\n\n  Stevenson went on to locate in the Senate's time-honored rules and \ntraditions the very foundation of our Republic:\n\n       The historic Senate--preserving the unrestricted right of \n     amendment and debate, maintaining intact the time-honored \n     parliamentary methods and amenities which unfailingly secure \n     action after deliberation--possesses in our scheme of \n     government a value which cannot be measured by words.\n\n  In keeping with its institutional design and longstanding traditions \nthroughout most of its history, the Senate has engaged in robust \ndiscussion and meaningful debate rather than being dominated by \npartisan grandstanding and cheap political theater; the Senate has \nsought to chart a path toward the common good rather than simply \nmessaging to particular interests or serving narrow constituencies; the \nSenate has acted to cultivate common cause and has enabled constructive \ncompromises and accommodations to advance national priorities even \nduring times of great ideological division; and throughout the Senate's \nhistory, individual Members have worked to develop meaningful and \nenduring partnerships with colleagues on both sides of the aisle rather \nthan marching lockstep with their respective parties and simply \nheightening the divisions in society.\n  This institution has served the Nation well when adhering to its \nenduring principles and characteristic practices. Indeed, for most of \nthe last four decades, as I have witnessed firsthand, the Senate's \nrobust deliberation and open amendment process has facilitated and \nenabled some of the greatest legislative achievements of the modern \nera.\n  One of the most historic of such debates in which I took part \noccurred in my fifth year as a Senator. President Reagan took office in \n1981 facing enormous challenges--stagflation, out-of-control spending, \na crushing tax burden, and an underfunded military. His first \nlegislative priority was to cut marginal tax rates, restrain Federal \nspending, and bolster our national defense. As part of the vanguard of \nthe Reagan revolution in the Senate, I steadfastly supported these \npolicies and campaigned tirelessly to enact these landmark reforms.\n  In the Democrat-controlled House, the drama unfolded predictably \nbetween party leadership and various voting blocs, with conservative \nDemocrats eventually joining Republicans to support what became the \nGramm-Latta budget. But in the Republican-majority Senate, while debate \nwas equally passionate, our deliberation was of a very different sort. \nWe discussed many of the legislative provisions at length and voted on \ndozens of amendments from Senators of both parties covering a wide \nrange of subjects. Many were tough votes on heart-wrenching issues--\nfrom child nutrition to cost-of-living adjustments for seniors--but we \ntook those tough votes and ultimately made the difficult choices \nnecessary to usher in unprecedented economic growth.\n  By allowing numerous votes on minority amendments, Democrats received \nthe hearing they deserved on the issues about which they cared most, \nand having had the opportunity to fight for their causes, many of these \nSenators rightly felt they had done everything possible to improve the \nunderlying bill. So when it came to final passage, the Senate's budget \npassed overwhelmingly by a vote of 88 to 10.\n  Given the nature of the reforms, that margin was striking. It \ndemonstrates that the opportunity for extended deliberation and an open \namendment process tends to yield a final product that can win broad \nsupport by giving Members confidence that the ultimate\n\n[[Page S4680]]\n\nresult represents the considered judgment of the whole Senate.\n  From the perspective of committed conservatives such as President \nReagan and myself, the final amended Senate bill was far from ideal. In \nthe end, while we won support for the tax cuts that spurred growth and \nfor the defense buildup that helped win the Cold War, we could not \nconvince Congress to make meaningful cuts to Federal spending or even \nto restrain the growth of Federal spending. But to have opposed the \nfinal package because it wasn't perfect, because it only achieved some \nof our goals, would have been madness. Absent passage of the final \nbill's reforms, the central accomplishments of the Reagan years would \nnever have come to fruition.\n  In reflecting on how the Senate can and should work, let me also \ncommend the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. I am struck by the \nsimilarities between the 1996 election and the 2012 election when \nvoters reelected a Democrat to the White House and a Republican \nmajority to the House. Back then, both sides understood the voters' \nmandate to seek areas of agreement and develop consensus wherever \npossible--in short, to set aside partisanship and work together for the \ncommon good on the critical issues of the day.\n  Republicans wanted significant tax cuts and spending controls that \nmany Democrats opposed. Democrats--led by my friend Senator Kennedy--\nhad for years sought an expansion of health care to uninsured children \nwho neither qualified for Medicaid nor had families who could afford \nhealth coverage. The debate that transpired over these measures seems \nalmost foreign in today's Senate. Rather than being presented with a \nfinal bill as a fait accompli, we had a truly deliberative committee \nprocess, a meaningful floor debate, and the opportunity to vote on \nnumerous amendments.\n  Ted Kennedy and I used the opportunity of an open process to make a \nkey step toward consensus. Teddy was wise enough to realize that I \nshared his desire to provide health care for uninsured kids who were in \nneed, and I recognized that he was open to innovative means of \ndelivering that care and did not insist on an inflexible, big \ngovernment bureaucracy to control it. Together, we crafted an amendment \nthat created the State Children's Health Insurance Program--fully paid \nfor, with flexible means of delivery and true State authority over the \nprogram. SCHIP is not beloved by ideological purists, especially on the \nright. But I believe its approach is fully compatible with my \nconservative principles and a model for a basic, efficient social \nsafety net run by the States.\n\n  More importantly, our partnership on this issue demonstrates how the \nSenate ought to work. This Chamber provides a unique environment--its \nconstructive character, its respect for individual Senators' \nparticipation in the legislative process, its forum for thoughtful \ndeliberation, and its open amendment process. Without these, we could \nnever have passed SCHIP and the larger 1997 budget--that was a budget \ncompromise--of which it was a part.\n  The same is true of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which has \nsince served to safeguard fundamental individual liberties, and the \nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, which is arguably the \nmost important law enforcement measure of the last half century, and so \nmany other landmark accomplishments of the Senate during my time here.\n  I am proud to have played a role in shaping each of these laws--as \npart of a constructive legislative process that was possible only as a \ndirect result of the Senate's longstanding rules and traditions. \nWithout this body's characteristic structure and mode of operation, \nwhich facilitates meaningful deliberation and ultimate cooperation \nbetween diverse viewpoints, such legislative achievements could never \nhave occurred.\n  Throughout its history, the Senate has advanced the common good--not \nsimply through refining public opinion and translating it into well-\nconsidered legislation but also because this body has defended its \ninstitutional prerogatives and essential role in our system of \nconstitutional government.\n  Senators of both political parties have often stood up to executive \nencroachment--not for partisan gain or political grandstanding but in \ndefense of Congress as a coordinate and coequal branch of government \nwith its own essential authorities and responsibilities.\n  Implicit in the constitutional design of separating the Federal \nGovernment's powers is the idea that each branch would have the \nincentive and authority to resist encroachments from the other \nbranches, ensuring that unfettered power is not concentrated in any one \nset of hands.\n  The Founders recognized this as indispensable to preserving the \nindividual liberty of all citizens. For as Madison counseled in \nFederalist 51: ``[T]he greatest security against a gradual \nconcentration of the several powers in the same department consists in \ngiving to those who administer each department the necessary \nconstitutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of \nthe others.''\n  Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia embodied this institutional \nideal as much as anyone with whom I have served. Although he helped \nlead this body for more than a half century and left us just 4 short \nyears ago, I was surprised and dismayed to learn that a full third of \ncurrent Members never served alongside him.\n  Senator Byrd fiercely defended this body's prerogatives and \nindependence against the encroachments of the executive branch. And he \nneither censored his criticisms nor weakened his defenses based on the \nPresident's political party. Even in his twilight years, when President \nObama took office with extraordinarily high approval ratings, Senator \nByrd was willing to hold the new President's feet to the fire to defend \nthe Senate's right to give advice and consent to nominees.\n  He publicly chastised the new White House for its excessive reliance \non czars, observing that unconfirmed policy chieftains ``can threaten \nthe Constitutional system of checks and balances. At the worst, White \nHouse staff have taken direction and control of programmatic areas that \nare the statutory responsibility of Senate-confirmed officials.''\n  In addition to defending the Senate against executive encroachments, \nSenator Byrd was a stalwart defender of the Senate's most \ncharacteristic and historic features. He regularly spoke to newly \nelected Senators, admonishing each of us before we even took office to \nlearn about the body to which we had been elected and in which we would \nserve. Senator Byrd was as good as anyone I have ever known at \nexplaining the direct connection between the design of the Senate and \nthe liberty that all Americans cherish.\n  In November 1996, for example, when speaking to the incoming freshman \nSenators, he stressed the two most critical and distinguishing features \nof the Senate's operation. Like so many other students of the Senate, \nhe steadfastly maintained that ``as long as the Senate retains the \npower to amend and the power of unlimited debate, the liberties of the \npeople will remain secure.'' That was Robert C. Byrd, one of the \nleading Democrats of all time. Throughout his time in this body, \nSenator Byrd never abandoned this message. He stood up for the Senate's \ndefining characteristics, no matter which party was in the majority and \nno matter who occupied the Oval Office. He even took on his own \nPresident from time to time.\n  A few months before his death in 2010, he wrote to his colleagues \nidentifying the right to amend and the right to debate as ``essential \nto the protection of the liberties of a free people.''\n  We need a renewed dedication to the special role of the Senate and \nits institutional prerogatives that Senator Byrd exemplified so well. \nHe was right to counsel incoming colleagues to ``study the Senate in \nits institutional context, because that is the best way to understand \nyour personal role as a United States Senator . . . [Y]ou must find the \ntime to reflect, to study, to read, and, especially, to understand the \nabsolutely critically important institutional role of the Senate.''\n  Many of my colleagues--even those with whom I rarely agree--have the \npotential to be great Senators and statesmen: worthy stewards of this \ninstitution, zealous guardians of its prerogatives, and true defenders \nof its role in our constitutional system of government.\n  But, sadly, whether blinded by partisan loyalty to the President or \ntoo inexperienced to understand the Senate\n\n[[Page S4681]]\n\nfrom any other perspective than having a like-minded Senate majority \nand President, too many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nhave allowed--even facilitated--the breakdown of the Senate's vital \ninstitutions and role.\n  From our right to debate and amend through regular order, to our role \ngiving advice and consent to the President's nominees, the Senate has \nemasculated itself. By doing so, we only abandon our responsibilities, \ndiscard our authorities, and lay ourselves prostrate before a \npolitically destructive President.\n  It is past time to restore the Senate's rightful place in our \nconstitutional order. I urge my colleagues--both Democrats and \nRepublicans--to join me, to stand and fight for the greatness of this \nbody and start standing for the rights and the powers of the \nlegislative branch. That is what we are here to do, in addition to \nenacting good laws. But you cannot enact really great laws without full \nand fair debate, without full and fair right to amendments. This is a \ngreat body, but it has gone downhill a long way over the last number of \nyears. No President deserves total fealty by this body or by his or her \nparty Members in this body.\n  All I can say is, it is time for us to start acting like the Senate. \nIt is time for us to have full and fair debate. It is time for us to \nhave open amendments. And that goes for Democrats and Republicans.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about something \nthat I think we should all be able to agree on; that is, every \nAmerican--every American worker--deserves a fair shot to get ahead. One \nof the great things about our country is that has been a fundamental \nvalue or belief, and we need to make sure that value still holds in \nAmerica right now: If you work hard, you have a chance to have your \nfair shot to get ahead.\n  American workers are the best in the world. I can tell you that \ncoming from Michigan, where we make things and grow things, and I am \nvery proud of it. They can outcompete anyone and will win in a fair \nfight. Unfortunately, too often the fight is not fair today. We see a \ntax system that is really rigged against jobs in America too many \ntimes, and we need to fix that.\n  Right now our Tax Code contains a shocking loophole that forces \ntaxpayers to foot the bill when companies move jobs overseas. I think \nmost Americans would say: What? Say that again. Companies are packing \nup and leaving the country, and the Tax Code is rewarding it and we are \npaying for it?\n  Workers are forced to pay to ship their own jobs overseas to China or \nMexico or other places around the world, and that is something that is \nvery difficult to understand and believe.\n  Not only do you get laid off, but then you turn around and through \nyour taxes, through tax writeoffs, you are forced to pay for sending \nyour own job overseas. Communities see a factory close, and through \ntheir taxes they end up paying for that empty factory in the community. \nOf course, we have seen way too many in Michigan. Our country sees \nthat.\n  This is outrageous. It is long past due to end. The good news is we \nhave a chance to fix it tomorrow together on a bipartisan basis. I hope \nwe will have 100 votes of people saying: We want to proceed to the \nBring Jobs Home Act.\n  I want to thank Senator Walsh from Montana for taking the lead. He \nhas very specific stories to tell about what has happened in Montana. \nSenator Mark Pryor from Arkansas is the same--very passionate about \nthis. I am very pleased to have the opportunity to join with them as we \nlead this effort to stand with American businesses that want to stay in \nAmerica, and workers, families, and communities, and that we send a \nvery strong message about what we think our Tax Code should incentivize \nby passing the Bring Jobs Home Act. We will have a chance to do that \ntomorrow.\n  It is very simple. It closes an outrageous tax loophole that forces \ntaxpayers to foot the bill for companies that move job overseas and \nreplaces it with a tax cut that rewards companies for coming home. In \nthe great State of Michigan we make things. We have always done that. \nIt is part of our identity and our source of pride. It is the backbone \nof who we are. It is the backbone of the middle class, quite frankly. I \ndo not think we would have a middle class unless we made things and \ngrew things, which is what we do in Michigan. I know that is done in \nWest Virginia and around the country. It is certainly what has created \nthe middle class of this country.\n  But here is what we have seen, because of a number of things. One of \nthose is the Tax Code that does not make sense in terms of keeping jobs \nhere. Between 2000 and 2009, in the last 10 years, 2.4 million jobs \nwere shipped overseas. We have a lot of different ways we want to turn \nthat around. In fact, it is being turned around for a number of reasons \nnow. We are beginning to see them come back. But 2.4 million jobs \nshipped overseas.\n  To add insult to injury, the American taxpayers were asked to foot \nthe bill. That is just the bottom line. So what you see is people who \nhave worked all of their lives for a paycheck get a pink slip instead. \nThey played by the rules, but they were left on the sidelines. The \ncompany takes the jobs overseas and gets a tax break for shipping jobs \noverseas.\n  When the Tax Code creates incentives to ship jobs overseas, it is a \nsign there is something seriously wrong. We have an opportunity to fix \nit. It starts tomorrow. Our Chair of the Finance Committee, Senator \nWyden from Oregon, believes this as fiercely as I do, that we need to \nfix this. I am so proud to be a part of his committee. I know he is \ncommitted to making our system more competitive in a global economy. We \nneed to do that. But right now we can close a tax loophole. We have to \nclose a tax loophole so we can stop the flow of jobs going overseas. \nThat is the least we can do. In fact, we should be adding to this first \nstep by stop paying for the move.\n  We ought to be closing the loophole that allows folks to act as \nthough they are moving on paper, an inversion, when they do not \nactually move the plant. We ought to be focusing instead on how we are \nall in this ship together in America paying our fair share and moving \nthe country forward, creating jobs, opportunity, strengthening the \nmiddle class.\n  We still have more jobs leaving than coming back, but we do have a \nnumber of companies that are doing the right thing. We need to support \nthem. The smart thing they are doing is bringing jobs back. They are \nbringing them back to Michigan and to States all across the country. We \nsay welcome back and we say thank you. We should reward these \ncompanies. For those companies that are still on the fence about \nwhether to bring jobs back to America, we should help them make up \ntheir minds by giving them new tax incentives.\n  The Bring Jobs Home Act will not only end the practice of allowing \ncompanies to deduct the expenses of sending a job overseas, it will \nalso allow companies coming back to deduct their expenses and give them \nan additional 20-percent tax credit for the cost of bringing jobs back.\n  This is very simple. Stop the subsidy that is paying for shipping our \njobs overseas. Allow the tax writeoff to bring jobs back. Add to it an \nadditional tax cut of 20 percent in order to be able to support our \ncompanies that are doing the right thing.\n  We have got a lot of examples of companies doing the right thing \nright now. For example, Whirlpool realized it needed to respond more \nquickly to customer requests in the United States and Canada, so they \nmoved their washing machine manufacturing operations back from Mexico \nand Germany into Ohio.\n  GE used to make its hybrid water heater in China. The company needed \nto trim international shipping costs and wanted more control of the \nproduct. They brought manufacturing of appliances back to the United \nStates.\n  But we are not just talking about manufacturing jobs, which of course\n\n[[Page S4682]]\n\nare so very important. Again, GE realized it needed the kind of IT \nengineering talent it could only find in Michigan. So work that was \nbeing done in India is now being done in Van Buren Township in \nMichigan, as they brought jobs home.\n  We know that because of the explosion in natural gas and the current \nlow prices, this is an incentive. I want to thank the Presiding Officer \nfor his understanding of that and the importance of supporting American \nmanufacturing, American businesses. We have a number of advantages \nright now to bring jobs home, to create jobs in America, including not \nonly low energy costs but the finest workers in the world.\n  We have creative minds with new ideas and hard work and innovation at \nuniversity labs, and public research and public-private partnerships \nthat are going on, forging technology, empowering world-class \ninnovation. So there is a lot we can be proud of. Manufacturing is, in \nfact, coming back.\n  I am proud that part of that is we stood with our American automobile \nindustry at a time when they needed America to be with them and keep \nmanufacturing jobs.\n  More than 12 million Americans are working in manufacturing today. We \ncreated 7,000 new manufacturing jobs in Michigan last month alone. So \nwe have the right policies. We can continue to keep that going. We are \nat such a tipping point. We are in a situation where we are saying: \nOkay, you can write off the move; hey, you do not even have to move; \nyou can just change the paperwork, going through these changes of the \ninversion, and still get all of the benefits of America: the cleanest \nair and water, and our innovation, education, and roads, and all of the \nthings that are great about America but you are allowed to just change \nthe paperwork and avoid contributing as Americans, to strengthening and \nbeing a part of our country.\n  We are at a tipping point. We have to make some changes that make it \nvery clear whose side we are on. If we want everybody to have a fair \nshot, part of that is starting with a Tax Code that actually \nincentivizes a fair shot, not a system that is rigged against the \npeople going to work every day, working hard, trying to get ahead, \nplaying by the rules, all of that which we have grown up believing was \nthe right thing to do in America. We have to make sure the Tax Code \nreflects the right values and the right policies.\n  So we are at a point now where we need to put in place the Bring Jobs \nHome Act. That is going to nudge some of those companies. We need to \nmake some other changes that are going to make it very clear that we \nwant and are committed to jobs in America, manufacturing in America, IT \ninnovation in America, all the other work we can do so well.\n  You know, if we do not speed this up, at the current rate of jobs \ncoming home, it is going to take us 100 years to bring back all of the \njobs we have lost throughout this time. We can do better than that. We \nhave to do better than that. The good news is, we have the power to \nspeed up this process by putting in place the right policies, giving \nthe companies that want to do the right thing the right incentives, the \nincentives to bring jobs home.\n  It is time for our Tax Code to stop working against workers, \nfamilies, communities, and the businesses that are in America, and \nstart working for Americans, for the American middle class. It is smart \ntax policy we are talking about. I think it is plain old common sense. \nPeople in Michigan kind of look at this and go: Why are you even \ndebating this? Why do you have to have a motion about proceeding to \nthis bill? Why is that not something everyone agrees to on a voice \nvote? People cannot believe we are doing this in our Tax Code. So this \nis a very important step. We can do this on a bipartisan basis.\n  I know we have colleagues who are concerned about what is happening \non both sides of the aisle. Now is the time to show we can come \ntogether and make sure we have the jobs we want for our children and \nour grandchildren, the next generation. I hope we see an overwhelming \nbipartisan vote tomorrow.\n  I cannot think of a single reason why anybody would be opposed to the \nBring Jobs Home Act. Why would anyone be opposed to giving every \nAmerican a fair shot, giving every worker a fair shot to a good job and \nthe ability to care for their families and get ahead? A strong \nbipartisan vote would send a wonderful message that we can work \ntogether, that we get it, that this country will not succeed if it is \njust about a privileged few and everybody else losing ground, losing \nthe grip to the middle class or having no chance to get into the middle \nclass.\n  This is an opportunity, with our vote tomorrow, to not only bring \njobs home but support the American middle class.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n             60th Anniversary of the Newport Jazz Festival\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the 60th \nanniversary of a Rhode Island institution, the Newport Jazz Festival. \nAt this time, I wish to yield to my colleague Senator Whitehouse for \nhis reflections on the Newport Jazz Festival. After he speaks, I will \ngive my statement on this remarkable Rhode Island event. I yield now to \nmy colleague.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I am delighted that Senator Reed organized for the \ntwo of us to come down to the floor today.\n  Newport, RI, is a venue for many wonderful and remarkable events, \nfrom the America's Cup of the old day, to the Volvo Around the World \nocean races now, to the Newport Folk Festival, and, of course, what we \nare here to celebrate today is the Newport Jazz Festival, celebrating \nits 60th anniversary.\n  Since 1954, this festival has provided generations of Rhode Islanders \nand visitors with the opportunity to experience some of the world's \nfinest jazz music, and it has brought countless visitors to our Ocean \nState to witness these performances and enjoy our other great Rhode \nIsland beaches and other amenities.\n  The Newport Jazz Festival began as the brainchild of Elaine and Lewis \nLorillard, who financed the first festival as a way to bring some \noutdoor excitement and activity to Newport in the summer. In what would \nbecome a historic partnership, they reached out to George Wein, a \nBoston jazz club owner, to help them organize the event. Their creation \nbecame one of the first dedicated jazz festivals in the United States \nand ultimately came to shape the genre in ways they never could have \nanticipated.\n  The first festival was held on July 17 and 18, 1954, and included \nsome of the finest performers ever to grace the stage, including Ella \nFitzgerald, Billie Holiday, and Dizzy Gillespie. Held at the Newport \nCasino in Newport's Bellevue Avenue Historic District, that first \nfestival included outdoor performances that allowed attendees to sit on \nthe lawn and enjoy a beautiful Rhode Island summer day while reveling \nin the music. The event garnered national media attention, and it drew \nover 13,000 people to Newport on its very first start.\n  In the 60 years since that first festival, Newport has served as the \nbackdrop for some of the most notable performances in the history of \njazz. It was at the Newport Jazz Festival that Miles Davis first \nintroduced the world to what would become known as hard bop jazz, \nmixing in sounds from the blues and gospel music. Duke Ellington's \nperformance at the 1956 festival of ``Diminuendo and Crescendo in \nBlue'' is considered one of the greatest single performances in the \nhistory of jazz and revitalized Ellington's career. A number of \nperformances at the festival have gone on to be released as independent \nalbums, including acts from Ella Fitzgerald, Ray Charles, Nina Simone, \nand Miles Davis. The list of legendary performances goes on, with every \nyear bringing a new crop of inventive jazz musicians to put their own \nmark on the festival's history and on their original art form.\n  Since his original partnering with the Lorillards in 1953, George \nWein has gone on to replicate his success in Newport throughout the \ncountry, while maintaining Rhode Island's event as\n\n[[Page S4683]]\n\nthe flagship in the industry. He will do so again this year, still \ngoing strong as he closes in on his 89th birthday.\n  Under his leadership, on Friday, August 1, Newport will welcome \nthousands of eager music lovers looking to hear the best performers in \nmodern jazz. The ticket this year includes Wynton Marsalis, Trombone \nShorty, David Sanborn, and many others.\n  Additionally, in commemoration of this 60th anniversary, the festival \nwill for the first time run for 3 full days, with shows lasting through \nthe weekend.\n  The festival no longer takes place at the Newport Casino, as it has \noutgrown that original home and it has expanded to three stages that \nare set up on Narragansett Bay at the historic Fort Adams State Park, \nlooking out on the Newport Bridge and the East Passage, with the ships \nsailing by. However, the Newport Jazz Festival still provides guests \nwith the same opportunity it did 60 years ago to come and enjoy the \nRhode Island summer and hear up close some of the finest jazz in the \nworld.\n  I join my senior colleague Senator Reed in applauding the city of \nNewport for its outstanding commitment to the arts, and I thank so many \ndedicated individuals who have worked so hard over those 60 years to \nkeep this wonderful tradition alive. I look forward to another 60 years \nof amazing jazz in Rhode Island. I once again thank my senior Senator \nfor organizing us to be on the floor together for this recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I thank Senator Whitehouse for his eloquent remarks about \nthe jazz festival, which is a great Rhode Island institution. Indeed, \nit is a great American invention.\n  The Newport Jazz Festival owes its beginnings to the vision and \nfinancial backing of Elaine and Louis Lorillard, who in 1954 wanted to \ndo something with jazz in their community in Newport. Through their \ncollaboration with George Wein, a jazz pianist and club owner with a \nvision, the jazz festival was born. Today the festival has grown to be \none of the largest and most well-known jazz festivals in the Nation--\nindeed, I would say the world--attracting a whole new generation of \nartists and music fans. It also helped pave the way for the creation of \nthe Newport Folk Festival--another pillar of the music festival \ncommunity.\n  George Wein, in producing the Newport Jazz Festival, did not set out \nto change the world; he set out to make great music. But, as history \nhas shown, great music and great art can change the world. What George \nWein did over many summers was produce something more than \nextraordinary festivals; he produced the soundtrack of freedom for a \ngeneration of Americans.\n  Since its founding, the Newport Jazz Festival has seen an eclectic \nrange of performers--emerging and established--many at the peak of \ntheir art--all embellishing their credentials through their \nperformances. From Duke Ellington, to Frank Sinatra, to Led Zeppelin, \nthe Newport Jazz Festival has seen them all. Its ongoing mission is to \ncelebrate jazz music and to make the case for its relevance.\n  The 60th anniversary festival stays true to its core mission. It will \nkick off on August 1, 2014, and is scheduled to feature a variety of \ntalent over 3 days, including Wynton Marsalis playing with the Jazz at \nLincoln Center Orchestra, Trombone Shorty, and Dr. John. It will also \ninclude one musician who played at the inaugural Newport Jazz Festival, \nLee Konitz.\n  Newport continues to attract top-notch performers and is still a \nmust-see event for jazz and music aficionados alike.\n  I would also like to recognize the impact the Newport Jazz Festival \nhas had and continues to have in our great State of Rhode Island. Each \nyear, the thousands who flock to Newport to witness the festival also \nhave an opportunity to experience the treasure of a Rhode Island \nsummer. In this way the Newport Jazz Festival has served as a major \nsource of tourism--an important industry for our State--and should be \nviewed as a model for other communities to follow.\n  I am proud to call the Newport Jazz Festival a home State event. On \nthis milestone anniversary, I wish to congratulate my dear friend \nGeorge Wein, the festival board, and all those who have worked and \nthose who continue to work to put this outstanding event forward each \nyear. Best wishes on a successful 60th anniversary festival and for \ncontinued success in the future.\n\n\n                Congratulating the Newport Jazz Festival\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 510, submitted earlier today by \nSenator Whitehouse and me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 510) congratulating the Newport Jazz \n     Festival on its 60th anniversary.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 510) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in today's Record \nunder ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. REED. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Border Crisis\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, today I wish to speak about a pressing \nissue--really, a crisis, and I don't use that word lightly--of some \n52,000 unaccompanied alien children streaming across our southern \nborder with Mexico, coming into our country, and that number is \ncontinuing to grow. In fact, the Obama administration itself says that \nnumber could reach 90,000 or more by the end of the fiscal year on \nOctober 1--in just a few months.\n  Again, this is a crisis on many levels. It is a border crises. It is \na national security crisis. It is a humanitarian crisis. It is a fiscal \nissue for our country. It is a very serious situation.\n  I talked about it on the floor last week and laid out, broadly \nspeaking, the policy response I think we need to have so this flow does \nnot continue to grow. Today I come back to the floor, and I wish to \nspeak about two things--specifics I have learned about how this crisis \nis specifically affecting Louisiana. I am really concerned about that. \nI am sure every Member here is concerned about the direct impact on \ntheir State.\n  No. 2, there is legislation I have introduced to directly respond to \nthis crisis. Again, it is a real crisis.\n  In Louisiana, just in the last week or so, I have learned a number of \nspecifics that are significant and continue to raise my concerns. I \nwrote the Secretary of Homeland Security asking a number of detailed \nquestions some time ago, including about impacts on Louisiana. \nUnfortunately, I have heard nothing from the Department. I have \nreceived no response yet to that letter. I will follow up and get a \nresponse. In the meantime, these are specifics I am hearing from other \nreliable sources:\n  First of all, the Hirsch Memorial Coliseum in Shreveport, LA, has \nbeen apparently contacted by the Department of Homeland Security about \nlocating space for the housing of illegal minors--setting up a camp, a \nfacility specifically for that. No Member of our delegation was \ncontacted. I had asked specific questions about any activity impacting \nLouisiana. I wasn't told, but they were contacted directly.\n  This isn't happening. It is impractical. It can't happen at the \nHirsch Memorial Coliseum. They have many commitments and a lot of \nthings they need to do there. So I don't think there is any chance of \nthis sort of detention facility being set up there. But they were \ncontacted.\n  In addition, there are thousands of new ICE cases regarding \nunaccompanied alien children. First of all, before the current crisis \nbegan there was a backlog of these UAC cases being sent to Louisiana \nwith family members or sponsors. So there is a backlog of about 2,000 \ncases. Apparently, since\n\n[[Page S4684]]\n\nthis crisis started developing in the last several months, we have \n1,259 new juvenile cases for Louisiana alone. That is a significant \nnumber for a State the size of Louisiana.\n  We believe these are folks being sent through the Chicago detention \nfacility to be united with family members or other sponsors in \nLouisiana. Again, this is exactly the sort of thing I had asked the \nDepartment of Homeland Security about. I haven't received any response \nto my letter. I haven't received any official formal response to my \nspecific questions. We have had to learn this through other sources, \ntalking to some ICE officials and others directly. This is really \nconcerning. If this is going on in Louisiana, this is going on in every \nState of the country, and it underscores what a serious situation and \nin fact a crisis on many different levels this is.\n  That is why last week I introduced legislation to try to address this \nvery serious situation, this border crisis. I introduced S. 2632 to \naddress specifically the UAC issue. I will outline broadly what it will \ndo.\n  Broadly speaking, it will make sure we detain these individuals, \ndon't release them to relatives, family members, sponsors--don't \nrelease them out into society but detain them, and have a much quicker, \nmore efficient process for deporting them and returning them to their \nhome countries. Specifically, we would have mandatory detention of all \nunaccompanied alien children--UACs--upon apprehension.\n  No. 2, we would amend TVPRA to bring parity between UACs from \ncontiguous and noncontiguous countries. As most Senators know, we have \na more streamlined, workable process for unaccompanied alien children \nfrom contiguous countries--namely, Mexico as well as Canada--but it is \nmuch more of an issue with Mexico. We would bring noncontiguous \ncountries--Central and South American countries apart from Mexico--into \nthe same category and treat those aliens the same way.\n  Third, those UACs that do not voluntarily depart--which is part of \nthe process dealing with Mexican UACs--will be immediately placed in a \nstreamlined removal process and detained by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. Currently, UACs are transferred to HHS and their Office of \nRefugee Resettlement, where they, quite frankly, disappear into the \nUnited States. They are reunited with parents or sponsors living in the \nUnited States, often illegally. What that means as a practical matter \nis they essentially disappear into our country.\n  Fourth, anyone with gang affiliations, whether those affiliations are \nrenounced or not, will be immediately placed in expedited removal \nproceedings under INA 235(b). Therefore, that would make them \nineligible for asylum status.\n  Fifth, we would raise the standard for asylum determinations, from a \nstandard where it is now ``credible fear,'' which is extremely \nsubjective and, quite frankly, a standard that is too easy for these \nfolks to meet, simply by repeating the right magic words which they \nlearn about as they come here. We would raise that standard from \n``credible fear'' to ``substantiated fear of persecution.''\n  Sixth, within 72 hours of an initial screening, all UACs found not to \nhave a claim for asylum will be given a final removal order and placed \non the next available flight to their home country, subject to \ndeterminations of cost, feasibility, and any repatriation agreements \nwith their home country.\n  Seventh, a final order of removal is not subject to review and sets, \nas a minimum, a 10-year bar to reentry.\n  Eighth, upon apprehension, biometric data--including, but not limited \nto, photographs and fingerprints--will be collected for future \nenforcement use.\n  Ninth, and finally, the Department of Homeland Security will report \nannually to Congress on the number of apprehensions, the number of \nremovals, the number of voluntary departures, et cetera. And \nspecifically, in no event shall a voluntary departure be counted as a \ndeportation.\n  Now, what does all this mean? It is a very detailed bill. We put \ngreat time and effort into the specifics of the legislation. We need to \nget the specifics right. But what does it mean? It means we are \nstopping catch and release. It means we are stopping simply releasing \nthese folks out into the country, to family members or to sponsors, \nwhere they are usually never heard from again. They don't show up for \ncourt dates and they don't respond to any enforcement actions. Catch \nand release is a complete failure because it essentially means being \nreleased in the country for an extended period of time, and it means we \nretain control and detention and then have a quick, efficient process \nfor removing them from the country. That is the only way we will stem \nthis increasing flow--still increasing. The number of unaccompanied \nalien children is still mounting and mounting and mounting.\n\n  I called this a crisis at the beginning of my remarks, and it is. It \nis a crisis on many different levels. It is a border crisis, it is a \nlaw enforcement crisis, and it is a fiscal issue. As many folks have \ncorrectly said--particularly on the left--it is a humanitarian crisis.\n  The biggest threat to these individuals in humanitarian terms is the \nfact that they are entrusted and put in the hands of outright criminal \ngangs, often drug lords and drug gangs, coyotes--folks who do not have \ntheir best interests in mind, and very often in that process they are \nabused in multiple ways. That is a humanitarian travesty and it is a \nhumanitarian crisis.\n  The problem is we have a policy right now that encourages that \ntreatment and allows for those numbers to grow and not to be brought \nback down to zero. We need a different policy that discourages and \nstops that. Fundamentally, the way to do that is to apprehend these \nindividuals, and instead of releasing them into the country--which \nmeans the illegal gang smuggling operation has been successful--quickly \nand efficiently deport them back to their home country. That is the \nonly action which will reverse the message that has gone out far and \nwide in Central and South America, which is to send your minors because \nPresident Obama has an Executive order that says we won't prosecute \nthem. That is the message that has been heard and the fundamental \nmessage we have to reverse, and you only reverse that message if you \nreverse the policy through specific actions such as what I have \ndescribed.\n  This is a graph which very clearly shows that deportations of this \nclass of illegal aliens have plummeted under President Obama. President \nObama often points to a change in the law in 2008 that was part of that \nequation. He complained about that for weeks and weeks when this crisis \nfirst hit the front page of the paper. The problem is when it comes to \nhis proposal which was sent to Congress about how to deal with the \ncrisis, he didn't ask to change the law. He didn't ask for any new \nauthority to expedite the removal process. All he asked for was $3.9 \nbillion, largely for the housing and feeding of these aliens and not \nfor expedited and effective removal. That is what we need to change. \nThis trendline is what we need to change in order to address the \nproblem and stop this mounting flow and crisis at our border.\n  I hope we act in a responsible way by adopting this sort of policy \nand catch and release and detain these folks. Of course we need to \ntreat them humanely and provide what we need to provide for them in the \nlimited period of time we have them detained, but don't release them \ninto the country with family members and often other illegals or \nsponsors. Detain them and deport them to their home countries. That is \nthe only appropriate response which will stop this crisis from \ncontinuing to grow and stop the abuses and humanitarian crisis from \ncontinuing to grow.\n  I encourage my colleagues to come around to this commonsense \nsolution. The American people have already done that. Have a townhall \nmeeting on this. I don't care what State you come from. Look at the \npolling on this issue. The American people have already reached this \ncommonsense consensus. The question is, is Washington going to catch up \nand follow? Are we going to reach the same commonsense consensus and \nrespond in a commonsense way that solves the problem rather than just \ngrowing it or throwing money at it?\n  I encourage all of us from both sides of the aisle to come around to \nthis sort of consensus approach. Of course I favor the specific \nlegislation I have filed, S. 2632, but it doesn't have to be exactly \nthat vehicle. It does have to be\n\n[[Page S4685]]\n\nthat general approach in order to stop this mounting flood of illegals \nat our southern border and to deal with this crisis--including the \nhumanitarian crisis--effectively rather than continuing to deal with it \nin a way where the numbers, the burden, the crisis, and the abuses \ncontinue to grow.\n  In closing, I will say I am, again, very concerned, as I am sure \nevery Member in this body is, about the specific impact to my State. I \nmentioned some of those impacts. I didn't get those details from the \nDepartment of Homeland Security even though I specifically asked for \nthat from the Department. I have had no real cooperation or information \nfrom the Department. I had to search out that information from other \nreliable sources. I will continue to do that, and I will continue to \nget the word out to Louisianans because they deserve to know what our \nState and communities may be dealing with.\n  In the meantime I hope the Department of Homeland Security will \nactually answer my letter, answer my questions, and give us the details \ndirectly so we all know exactly what we are dealing with as a country \nand in our individual States.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Supporting Disability Rights Milestones\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, this is a very important week for \nAmericans with disabilities. Just a few hours ago, at the White House, \nthe President signed the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act which \nincludes a reauthorization of the Rehabilitation Act. This will ensure \nthat young people with disabilities have the skills and experiences to \nenter into competitive integrated work settings and will be ready to be \neconomically self-sufficient--one of the key goals of the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act.\n  This bill received extraordinary bipartisan support from an \noverwhelming majority of Democrats and Republicans. The final vote in \nthe House was 415 to 6 and the final vote in the Senate was 95 to 3. \nThis is a great testament to the bipartisan support in Congress for \nadvancing the rights and opportunities of people with disabilities in \nthe United States.\n  Also this week, on Saturday, July 26, we will celebrate the 24th \nanniversary of the signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act by \nthen-President George Herbert Walker Bush. As the chief Senate sponsor \nof that law in 1990, I worked closely with Senate and House colleagues \non both sides of the aisle to advance the bill. Again, we couldn't have \nsucceeded without the strong and active support of a Republican \nPresident, George H.W. Bush, and key members of his cabinet.\n  When we passed the ADA, as it is known, 24 years ago, the vote was \noverwhelmingly bipartisan. In the Senate, we passed it by a vote of 91 \nto 6, and in the House it was 403 to 20. So not only were the votes \nbipartisan, the arduous work of crafting the ADA and getting it to that \npoint was also bipartisan. I worked shoulder to shoulder with \nindispensable partners, including Boyden Gray, President Bush's White \nHouse Counsel; Richard Thornburgh, Attorney General of the United \nStates at that time; and here in the Senate Senator Bob Dole, who was \nso key in helping us to move this legislation forward at that time.\n  Senator Dole was instrumental. In fact, I always remind my colleagues \nthe first speech Senator Dole ever gave on the Senate floor when he was \nelected to the Senate--his maiden speech--was on that topic, the topic \nof people with disabilities and their rights and how there should be \nmore opportunity for people with disabilities. It was a great speech.\n  I think it is also known that today is Senator Dole's birthday. So I, \nand I am sure my colleagues will join with me, am wishing Senator Dole \na very happy birthday today and asking to recommit ourselves, as he did \nat that time, to work in a bipartisan fashion to make sure people with \ndisabilities not only in this country but around the world have more \nopportunities to live a full and meaningful life. So happy birthday, \nBob Dole. We worked together for a long time on these issues.\n  Today is another interesting day. Today, the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, on a bipartisan vote of 12 to 6, passed out of the committee \nthe United Nations treaty on disabilities, formally known as the \nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. A major part of \nmy remarks today is about the United Nations treaty, now known as the \nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities--or the shorthand \nversion is CRPD as it is known here and globally.\n\n  For most of our recent history, support for disability rights, as I \nhave just mentioned, has been across the political spectrum. But now, \nas the full Senate looks ahead to the consideration of the Convention \non the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, we are beginning to see an \nunfortunate erosion of the bipartisan support for disability policy.\n  Now, again, I wish to make clear that the Foreign Relations Committee \nreported the bill out this morning on a 12-to-6 vote. It was \nbipartisan. A couple things are in order: first, a recap of the \nhistory; and secondly, a very profound thank you to Senator Bob \nMenendez, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, for his \ntremendous leadership in crafting and getting this bill through this \nCongress in his committee. I have spoken with Senator Menendez many \ntimes about this issue. He has been dogged in his pursuit of getting a \nbill and getting it through the committee and to the Senate floor. And \nit hasn't been easy, quite frankly. Again, I will recap a little bit of \nthat history for the benefit of my fellow Senators who may not follow \nthis as closely as I follow it.\n  Again, this convention came through the committee this morning. It is \nnow awaiting a 24-hour layover before it can go on the executive \ncalendar. As I said, there has been some erosion in the bipartisan \nsupport for disability policy, but it is limited because I think most \nRepublicans and Democrats agree there is no objective reason for \npartisan discord when it comes to disability rights. Senator John \nMcCain is a tremendous supporter of disability rights and was with us \nwhen we passed the ADA in 1990 and was, again, a strong supporter at \nthat time. He has been a strong supporter of the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act and other legislation dealing with \ndisability rights, including disability rights amendments we passed in \n2008. So Senator McCain has long been a strong supporter of enhancing \nand improving the rights of people with disabilities to have a full and \nmeaningful life--to be able to have the opportunity to go to school, to \nlearn, be educated, and to have people work and to live independently.\n  So here is what Senator McCain said this morning in support of this \ndisability treaty. He said: ``Ratifying this treaty affirms our \nleadership on disability rights and shows the rest of the world our \nleadership commitment continues.''\n  Senator Mark Kirk is not a member of the committee but he said this \nabout the disability treaty:\n\n       I want to say as a recently disabled American . . . how \n     important it is to adopt this Convention . . . Too often we \n     have a problem of thinking of our veterans as victims. They \n     are victors. . . . This convention allows people to become \n     victors instead of victims.\n\n  And again, one of the true giants of the Senate, former Senator Bob \nDole, who, as I mentioned, celebrates a birthday today--had this to say \nabout this disability treaty:\n\n       U.S. ratification of the CRPD will increase the ability of \n     the United States to improve physical, technological, and \n     communication access in other countries, thereby helping to \n     ensure that Americans--particularly, many thousands of \n     disabled American veterans--have equal opportunities to live, \n     work, and travel abroad.\n\n  The fact is this treaty is supported by many respected, thoughtful, \nconservative Republican leaders. I can cite many more statements from \ncolleagues and other Republicans. The simple truth is that Republican \nleaders who care deeply about our Nation's sovereignty are equally \nimpassioned in their support of this disability treaty.\n\n  So the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities does not \nneed to be and should not be a partisan issue, despite the misguided \nefforts of\n\n[[Page S4686]]\n\nsome to make it so. It is deeply unfortunate that narrowly focused \nopposition from groups with special interests that are far afield of \nthe bipartisan consensus in support of disability rights have tried to \ndrag this treaty into partisan warfare. These groups have spread fear \nabout some imaginary, hypothetical, unreal loss of U.S. sovereignty. \nThey try to scare parents into thinking they are going to lose control \nof the education of their children or that they won't be able to home \nschool their children or they have raised the issue of abortion, which \nhas nothing whatsoever to do with this treaty. None of these things are \nrelevant to or are embedded in the treaty.\n  What we are seeing here is an action by some narrow special interest \ngroups to advance their intentions by making utterly unfounded claims \nabout the disability treaty.\n  So, again, this is rhetoric we should not be listening to. We should \nlisten to the voices of the better angels of our nature. This is an \nimportant convention, an important treaty.\n  Even as recently as this morning I heard that in the Foreign \nRelations Committee someone raised the issue of sovereignty. Well, we \npassed a lot of treaties here in the past--lots of treaties over the \nlifetime of our Nation. Are we less sovereign today than we were 10 \nyears ago? Are we less sovereign than we were 30, 50, 100 years ago? I \nwould have to have someone prove to me how we have lost our \nsovereignty. We haven't--not at all. And in every treaty that we have \nsigned in the past, there is always a clause in the reservations, \nunderstandings, and declarations that attaches to the resolution we \npass here on the treaty. There is always one clause that is attached \nand I will read it to my colleagues. It says:\n\n       Supremacy of Constitution. Nothing in the Convention \n     requires or authorizes legislation or other action by the \n     United States of America that is prohibited by the \n     Constitution of the United States, as interpreted by the \n     United States.\n\n  That is it. That goes on every treaty we sign. It says, look, we are \nsigning the treaty, but our Constitution is supreme.\n  Continuing:\n\n       Nothing in this treaty requires or authorizes any action by \n     the United States prohibited by the Constitution as \n     interpreted by the United States of America.\n\n  Who interprets the Constitution? The Supreme Court. But then we can \nalways pass amendments and change it--by the United States of America.\n  So we have offered that this is the same language we ought to attach \nto this convention--the Convention on the Rights of Persons with \nDisabilities.\n  Someone said: We don't know what the United Nations is going to do in \nthe future. We don't know how they might want to change it.\n  It makes no difference. It makes no difference what the U.N. does in \nthe future. Our Constitution is still supreme, and this is the clause \nwe put on there to say so. We do it on every treaty.\n  We just passed a treaty here in 1999 that I was involved in--a treaty \non the convention on the worst forms of child labor. It has that clause \nin it. We didn't give up any of our sovereignty by agreeing to that \nconvention on child labor, and we won't give up any of our sovereignty \nhere. So for anyone who is saying they are concerned about our \nsovereignty on this convention, we can put that clause in, as we have \nwith every other treaty.\n  There are some Senators here who were here when we passed that treaty \nin 1999, and they didn't say anything about sovereignty or that they \nwere concerned about sovereignty. But now some are saying they are \nconcerned about sovereignty when it deals with people with \ndisabilities. Why? Why? Why?\n\n  In 1999 we passed a convention dealing with the worst forms of child \nlabor--a good treaty, by the way. No one here raised the issue of \nsovereignty. Today--what, 15 years later--we have a Convention on the \nRights of Persons with Disabilities, and a number of people say: Oh, \nno, we are worried about sovereignty.\n  Someone please explain this to me. It is not about sovereignty. \nAnyone who is hiding behind that issue does not want to vote for this \ntreaty for some other reason, but it cannot be the reason of \nsovereignty.\n  Now, again, we have to look a little bit at the history of this \ntreaty. The drafters of the convention modeled it after the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act. In fact, if you read it, and you look at the \nADA, we informed the United Nations--and I talked to people who have \nbeen involved in this in the U.N.--we, our laws, informed the U.N. as \nto what they ought to do in drafting this convention. Why shouldn't we \nthen be a part of it, take the expertise we have and apply it globally?\n  So it was drafted. It was sent out to the nations for their adoption. \nIt was sent to our President. Under our system, the President sends \nthis proposed treaty out to all of the Departments of the executive \nbranch, including the Office of Management and Budget to see what \nbudget impact it will have, and their charge is to see what laws do we \nhave to change in order to comply with this treaty or what budget \nimpact does it have.\n  Well, it takes about a year to get this through all the Departments \nand agencies. But then, when it came back to the President, guess what: \nWe do not have to change one law--not one--to conform to this treaty \nbecause the treaty is based on, basically, the Americans with \nDisabilities Act. So we do not have to change any laws. And, secondly, \nthere is no budget impact.\n  So then the President sent it down to the Senate for ratification \nunder our Constitution. Then Senator Kerry, who was the chair of the \nForeign Relations Committee, had hearings. In fact, the two leadoff \nwitnesses were Senator John McCain and me. Well, then there were other \nwitnesses from the business community, from the disability community--\nfrom all over.\n  The treaty was reported out of the committee, I believe, in July of \n2012. We were not able to get it on the floor until December 2012. \nThirty-eight Republican Senators had signed a letter saying we should \nnot vote on a treaty--on a treaty--in a lameduck session. Then there \nwere some other things that came up about home schooling and stuff like \nthat.\n  To make a long story short, when we brought it on the floor, and we \nthought we had the votes, we fell six votes short. We had 61 votes. We \nneeded 67. We fell six votes short. A lot of Senators told me at that \ntime we should not be voting on this in a lameduck session. In fact, if \nyou check the Record, you will see remarks made by a lot of Members on \nthe Republican side saying we should not vote on this in a lameduck \nsession.\n  Well, OK. That Congress dies. We now have a new Congress starting in \n2013. Then Chairman Kerry becomes Secretary of State and our new \nchairman is Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey. So we started working \nto bring it back. Now again, it all has to come right back from the \nWhite House. It has to go back through the hurdles. It has to go back \nto the committee.\n  I talked a couple times with the ranking member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, and he wanted to have some more hearings. So I \ntalked to Senator Menendez about it. Senator Menendez agreed, and he \nheld more hearings on it in this Congress--in this Congress--and a lot \nof voices were heard. A lot of people testified on it.\n  Then it has to work its way through the committee. The committee has \nbeen very busy on a lot of things, but Senator Menendez never gave up, \nand so this morning, as I stated earlier, the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee reported out the treaty. I am so grateful to Senator Menendez \nfor not giving up, for being dogged in providing that kind of \nleadership to get this treaty through. So now it is ready for us to \nbring up here.\n  Well, guess what. We are not in a lameduck session, so that excuse \nhas gone by the wayside. And we have answered, I believe, the questions \non sovereignty and other issues. Now we have to look at who supports \nthis.\n  Well, I know some people were kind of nervous about the treaty and \nvoting for it because they were concerned, quite frankly, for their \npolitical life. I guess some people in the tea party were making this \nsort of a litmus test, which I thought was kind of interesting. Why? \nWhy this, of all things?\n  So what we did was we wanted to see how broad the support was out \nthere. \nIt is immense. The support for this treaty cuts across all lines. The \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce--Tom Donohue--are strong supporters of it,\n\n[[Page S4687]]\n\nwrote a very strong letter and has been contacting Senators about the \nChamber of Commerce's support for this treaty.\n  I spoke a couple months ago with former Governor John Engler, who is \nnow the head of the Business Roundtable, and informed him about it. He \nsaid they would look at it, they would consider it. He took it to his \nBusiness Roundtable about a little over a month ago, I believe, if I am \nnot mistaken, and the Business Roundtable wrote a very strong letter of \nsupport.\n  So two of the leading business groups in America are supporting this \nstrongly. Every veterans group supports it. The American Legion, the \nVFW, the PVA--you name it--the Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans all \nsupport this. Every major religious group supports it. All the \ndisability groups support it.\n\n  So what are we afraid of? Some people say, well, they are concerned \nabout this sovereignty issue again. Are you telling me that former \nPresident George H.W. Bush is not concerned about our sovereignty? Are \nyou telling me that former President George W. Bush is not concerned \nabout our sovereignty? Are you trying to tell me that the Chamber of \nCommerce and the Business Roundtable are not concerned about our \nsovereignty or that Tom Ridge, former Governor of Pennsylvania, the \nfirst Director of Homeland Security, who strongly supports this \ntreaty--are you telling me he does not care about our sovereignty?\n  Are there just a few people on this side of the aisle who know what \nsovereignty means? Of course not. Former President George H.W. Bush, \nformer President George W. Bush, former Attorney General Dick \nThornburgh, Boyden Gray, former counsel of the President--Steve \nBartlett, former Congressman, a Republican from Dallas, a mayor of \nDallas, came back and ran the Financial Services Roundtable, is a \nstrong supporter--strong supporter--of this. Are you telling me Steve \ndoes not care about our sovereignty? I would like you to tell Steve \nthat. He cares very much about our sovereignty. That is why it is a \nphony issue--a fraudulent phony issue.\n  We have it within our power now to join the rest of the world. I \nthink \n148 nations--148 countries--have now signed this.\n  I was recently in China, and I was meeting with disability groups \nthere. China signed the convention. I met with some disability groups \nthat are not governmental, NGOs, which is interesting. This is now \nspringing up in China.\n  I also met with a person who is the head of the federation of \ndisability groups in China. Madam Zhang, Haidi Zhang, is a very \nprominent woman in China, known all over the country because she is a \nfamous author. She now heads this federation. They all told me they \nwant the United States to be a part of this because it would strengthen \nthem in working to change in their country, to make their country \nbetter and more supportive of disability rights.\n  I questioned that because some people said to me here: Well, we do \nnot need to join this treaty. We can work with countries one-on-one. \nYou are going to work with 100 countries one-on-one? I do not think we \nhave the personnel to do that.\n  But here is what someone said to me who brought it home to me. They \nsaid: Look, if you come to our country and you want to discuss \ndisability policy from the standpoint of your laws--the Americans with \nDisabilities Act--and we are a part of the CRPD, then we are talking \ntwo different languages. But if you are a part of the Convention on the \nRights of Persons with Disabilities, we speak the same language. Then \nwe can start talking about how we work together to enhance the rights \nand opportunities of people with disabilities, not just in China but in \nAfrica.\n  Earlier this year, 21 countries met in Malawi on this issue. I was \nasked to come to speak. I could not because I was here in the Senate. \nThey desperately want the Americans--us--to be a part of this, to lend \nour expertise, our leadership--not as a single country but with other \ncountries--to, again, advance the cause of the rights of people with \ndisabilities in accommodations, accessibility.\n  This spring I was in Colombia--Cartagena--on a trip with other \nSenators, Congressmen, and I remember our colleague Senator Johnson \nfrom South Dakota and his wife were there. I remember Mrs. Johnson--\nBarbara--saying: Boy, I can't wait to get back to the United States \nbecause it is hard for Tim using his wheelchair to get around anywhere.\n\n  This is what I mean. We have to start working with these other \ncountries to help them change their systems, their accessibility.\n  I have talked to many veterans who would like to travel with their \nfamilies or maybe even work overseas. They cannot do it. They are not \naccessible. I have talked to students who got a Fulbright scholarship \nor one of those things to go to another country, but since they were \ndisabled, they could not take advantage of it because there were not \naccessible places for them to live or to get around.\n  So if we are proud--and we should be--proud of the work we have done \nas a nation, bipartisanly--there has never been a partisan hint to \nanything we have ever done with disability policy in this country. So \nif we are proud of what we have done in this country to enhance the \nwell-being of people with disabilities, to make sure they have a full \nand meaningful life, that they contribute to the best of their ability, \nto get them out of institutions, living in the community, working in \njobs--not subminimum-wage, dead-end jobs, but I mean real jobs; and we \nhave come a long way--so if we are proud of it, why shouldn't we be \nproud enough to join with the rest of the world in saying: Let's work \ntogether. Let's work together to provide in other countries that same \nkind of support and accessibility for people with disabilities?\n  It is not going to happen overnight. I understand that. Sometimes \nthese things take a long time. This weekend will be the 24th \nanniversary of the signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  As I travel around, one thing that always catches my eye--when I see \nnew buildings, new housing, and stuff--is it accessible? I just saw \nsome this weekend--new housing, multifamily housing--not accessible. \nWell, someone said to me: Well, you know, maybe people with \ndisabilities can't live here, but there are plenty of other places. I \nsaid: Well, that is not the point. What if I want to live there and I \nwant to invite my nephew who is a paraplegic to come visit me and have \ndinner? He can't even get in the door. Oh, well, that kind of puts a \ndifferent color on it. I cannot even associate with people with \ndisabilities because they cannot even come over to my house.\n  So while we have come a long way, we have things we have to do. But \nwe have to, again, be a part of this global effort to advance the cause \nof people with disabilities. Other countries are starting to catch on. \nThey are starting to do things--some countries more than others. This \ntreaty, and our joining it, means that we join with them in common \neffort--in common effort--to make sure people with disabilities are not \nshunted aside any longer.\n  I think it is beneath us as Senators, beneath us as a nation, to \nsomehow not accede to this treaty because of phony issues such as \nsovereignty.\n  We can take care of that, as we have in other treaties. Or \nhomeschooling or abortion. We can take care of that. We can say our \nlaws are supreme. If someone says, ``Well, the U.N. might change it in \nthe future,'' so what? It does not make any difference what they \nchange. It does not affect our sovereignty whatsoever. So I think it is \nbeneath us if we do not adopt this treaty, if we do not become a part \nof this global effort.\n  Ronald Reagan referred to America as the ``shining city on a hill.'' \nWell, I think it is. Nowhere is America more of a shining city on a \nhill than in how we treat our citizens with disabilities. We have the \ngold standard. Now it is time to empower us to work throughout the \nworld, to assist countries as they implement the treaty founded on the \nrights and principles embedded in the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  It is time for us to reassert our global leadership in disability \npolicy. So let's rise above partnership. Let's rise above some unknown \nfear that something might happen in the future. Let's rise above those \nnarrow interests that say ``Well, we will lose our sovereignty'' or \nsomething like that or all of those other phony issues that are coming \nup because they want to undermine the treaty. We can rise above\n\n[[Page S4688]]\n\nthat, just as we have done many times in the past, just as we did in \n1999 when we became a part of a convention on the worst forms of child \nlabor. We put reservations and we put understandings and declarations \nin that convention, by the way. So we spelled out how we were adapting \nthat to our own Nation. We can do the same with this one too.\n  I have been told--I do not know if this is true--I have been told \nthat some say: Well, it does not make any difference what we put in \nthere; there are some people who will not vote for it, period.\n  Well, are those the same people who would not vote for the Americans \nWith Disabilities Act if we were to bring it to the floor today? Would \nthey say: No, we should not change our policies that people with \ndisabilities had to be institutionalized; that they do not deserve to \nwork in the workplace; that they do not deserve the freedom to travel \non buses that are accessible and trains that are accessible or subways \nthat are accessible; that we do not need curb cuts and we do not need \nwidened doors. No, we do not need to do any of that stuff.\n  Would that be what they would say today if the Americans with \nDisabilities Act were on the floor? Any Senator who says: I like the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, and I think it has done a good thing \nfor our country--anyone who says that ought to be voting for this \ntreaty. That is what we intend. That is what we would do--reject that \nkind of fear and be a part of this global effort.\n  Again, I commend Senator Menendez for his great leadership on this \nissue. I am hopeful that before we leave here next week, we might reach \na time agreement with the other side to have a meaningful debate, have \namendments. There is nothing wrong with having some amendments on this \nif people have amendments that are germane to the treaty. Let's debate \nthose in a timely fashion and then have a vote on it. We need to do \nthis. We need to do this to reassert America's leadership worldwide on \ndisability policy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, before I speak on a different topic, let \nme acknowledge my colleague and friend from Iowa and thank him for a \nlifetime of service in the House of Representatives and the Senate. He \nhas announced his retirement at the end of this year. That is a loss \nfor our great institution and for our country.\n  Tom Harkin, more than any other Senator today, as much as any other \nSenator, has been a clarion voice for the disabled across generations \nand across country borders for decades. He has changed America and he \nhas changed the world. There are not many people who serve in this \nChamber who can say that. But when he joined with Bob Dole, a \nRepublican World War II disabled veteran from Kansas--when this \nDemocratic Senator from Iowa, a Navy veteran himself, joined with Bob \nDole and passed the Americans with Disabilities Act, it held America to \na higher standard. It guaranteed that our values we express so often \nwould be values we live by.\n  Now he is calling on us to join a family of nations that have admired \nour leadership in disability rights and wonder why we have not approved \nthis basic treaty or convention on disabilities. I was honored today to \nvote for that in the Foreign Relations Committee again. We had \nbipartisan support. We are going to continue to strive for it.\n  I thank the Senator for his unmatched contribution when it comes to \nspeaking out for the disabled across America and around the world.\n\n\n                              The Tax Code\n\n  Dickens wrote ``A Tale of Two Cities.'' I come to the Senate floor \nthis evening to tell a tale of two Illinois corporations. One of them \nis a corporation which I visited recently called Wheatland Tube in \nChicago. It is a division of JMC Steel. It employs about 2,000 people \nnationwide, 600 in Chicago, which I represent. JMC Steel is a good \ncompany. It is more than good; it is a great company. The average \nstarting wage at Wheatland is $15 an hour. The company offers generous \nhealth care benefits with low deductibles. It offers various retirement \nbenefits. Newer employees get a 401(k) with a company match up to 6 \npercent.\n  I tell this story because I want to salute a company that takes its \nmission seriously and treats its employees fairly. I believe a company \nsuch as JMC Steel and Wheatland should be encouraged and rewarded when \nit comes to our Tax Code and our laws.\n  We are hearing a lot from our Supreme Court across the street. They \nhave come up with a new theory about businesses and corporations in \nAmerica. Time and again they have told us that they now view \ncorporations to be virtual flesh-and-blood citizens entitled to \nconstitutional rights. They decided corporations have freedom of speech \nunder the Bill of Rights and that corporations could spend unlimited \namounts of money in an effort to elect or defeat candidates. They even \nwent so far to say closely held corporations had religious freedoms \nthat needed protection to the point where the owner of a closely held \nfor-profit corporation could determine the contraception and birth \ncontrol programs available to the employees of that company under their \nhealth insurance plans.\n  So we are told over and over by this Supreme Court that we should \nview corporations in a human context. Well, I am going to stick with \nthat chain of thought for a moment and talk about another company that \nis much different from Wheatland Tube, which I have just described. It \nis a company known as AbbVie. That is the new name; it used to be known \nas Abbott Labs. It is roughly the eighth largest pharmaceutical company \nin America. It is headquartered in Illinois, in the city of North \nChicago. AbbVie recently made the news because its board of directors \nsat down and made a decision about the future of this company.\n  First, let me tell you a little bit about AbbVie as a pharmaceutical \ncompany. AbbVie is a company which, like virtually every other \npharmaceutical company, relies a great deal on our Federal Government. \nThe National Institutes of Health--the leading biomedical research \nagency in the world--does basic research that our pharmaceutical \ncompanies use to develop new drugs and products. We pray that they \nwill. When they find these drugs and products, pharmaceutical companies \nsuch as AbbVie go to the patent office run by our Federal Government to \nprotect their property rights in their discoveries and their drugs. \nWhen they turn around to sell these drugs in America, after approval by \na Federal agency, the Food and Drug Administration, they by and large \nsell them to programs such as Medicare and Medicaid--government-\nsupported insurance programs.\n\n  The reason I tell this background is that AbbVie recently made a \ndecision that they were going to renounce their American corporate \ncitizenship and, in fact, at least on paper, move their corporate \nheadquarters to an island off Ireland. Why would a great American \ncorporation, the eighth largest pharmaceutical company, want to pick up \nand move to an island off Ireland? To avoid paying U.S. taxes. To avoid \npaying U.S. taxes, AbbVie is engaging in something known as inversion--\nin other words, relocating their corporate headquarter offices and \ndeclaring themselves to no longer be an American corporation. Does it \nnot strike you as strange that a company that makes billions of dollars \nin profit based on America and the strength of our own system of \ngovernment now is deserting America?\n  This inversion is not unique to AbbVie. We estimate that 50 or 60 \ncorporations are doing the same. I think it is time for us as Members \nof Congress to put an end to this. These companies that are deserting \nAmerica and heading overseas to avoid paying U.S. taxes have to be \nstopped.\n  Allan Sloan, whom I have heard a lot on radio and other places, is a \nwriter for Fortune magazine. On July 7 he published an article in \nFortune magazine entitled ``Positively un-American tax dodges.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record \nafter my remarks.\n  Let me quote one paragraph from Allan Sloan about these ``Positively \nun-American tax dodges,'' such as the inversion planned by AbbVie of \nNorth Chicago. Here is what Sloan writes:\n\n       Inverters don't hesitate to take advantage of the great \n     things that make America\n\n[[Page S4689]]\n\n     America: our deep financial markets, our democracy and rule \n     of law, our military might, our intellectual and physical \n     infrastructure, our national research programs, all the \n     terrific places our country offers for employees and their \n     families to live. But inverters do hesitate--totally--when \n     it's time to ante up their fair share of financial support \n     for our system.\n\n  Exhibit A: AbbVie, a company that has been profitable and made \nbillions of dollars in America, now wants to lessen its American tax \nbill by moving overseas--on paper.\n  I think this has to come to an end. I think that when we sit down and \nmake decisions about a tax code and tax policy, we need to be rewarding \ncompanies such as Wheatland Tube. Wheatland Tube, with 600 employees in \nChicago, is an American corporation and proud of it. They are not \nplanning on moving overseas. They are not trying to cut corners when it \ncomes to their employees. They are treating them fairly. They are \ngetting a good work product for it.\n  What I propose is called a patriot employer's tax. If you have a \ncorporation that is, in my view, patriotic, with its headquarters in \nAmerica, that has not moved employees overseas, that pays its employees \nat least $15 an hour--why did I pick $15? Because at $15 an hour, most \nAmerican workers would not qualify for government benefits.\n  Perhaps the WIC program is one exception, but the only one I can \nthink of. But these are employees who are paid enough in the workplace \nthat they don't qualify for food stamps to supplement their income. So \nwe chose $15 an hour. We said if the company goes on to provide good \nhealth insurance, a good retirement plan, where the employer \ncontributes at least 5 percent of an employee's income toward \nretirement, and the company will give a preference to hiring veterans, \nI think that company is entitled to a patriot employer tax credit. \nWheatland Tube isn't the only company in Illinois that would qualify \nnor the only company in this country.\n  So should we be bending our Tax Code today so AbbVie and the other \ncorporate deserters get a break by moving overseas or should we be \nchanging our Tax Code to encourage good companies, such as Wheatland \nTube, to stay in America, to pay a fair wage, to make a good product \nand make us proud. It seems a pretty simple choice as far as I am \nconcerned. We are going to start debating that on the floor of the \nSenate this week--at least we are going to try.\n  There is going to be a bill coming before us that has been offered by \nSenator John Walsh of Montana and Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan \ncalled the Bring Jobs Home Act. It is a variation on the theme that I \njust spoke of, but the bottom line is the same--to create Tax Code \nincentives for companies to bring jobs back into the United States. I \ncan't think of a higher priority than to create and keep good-paying \njobs in America.\n  We are going to vote on moving forward on this bill, creating an \nincentive to bring jobs home.\n  Here is what it will do. If a company moves a production line, trade \nor business outside of the United States back into the United States, \nit is eligible for a tax credit under the Walsh-Stabenow bill--a credit \nfor the cost of moving the jobs back home.\n  To pay for it, companies that ship jobs overseas--jobs going in the \nwrong direction--will no longer be allowed to deduct the costs \nassociated with outsourcing U.S. jobs from their tax bill.\n  Why would we want to incentivize a company to ship American jobs \noverseas? Why would we want to create a deduction to make it easier and \ncheaper to do that? It defies common sense.\n  The Walsh-Stabenow bill reverses it and says we will no longer \nincentivize shipping jobs overseas; we are going to incentivize \nshipping jobs home from overseas. It is pretty simple.\n  I would like to take that basic question to any town meeting in any \ntown in my State and ask the folks sitting there whether they think \nthat makes sense. I am very confident they will agree that it does. \nThis is a commonsense approach to reward companies that are doing the \nright thing and eliminate tax breaks for companies that are doing the \nwrong thing.\n  The patriot employer tax credit I hope I can offer as an amendment. I \nwant to give a break to those companies that pay a good wage, keep the \njobs in the United States, and don't ship their headquarters overseas. \nI think they deserve an incentive to stay.\n  I guess I am old-fashioned, but a lot of Americans are old-fashioned \nthe same way.\n  I like walking into the store and seeing products that say ``Made in \nthe U.S.A.'' Sure, I buy things made overseas. It is hard to avoid \nthem. And I don't consciously avoid them. But given a choice, I would \nlove to see the ``Made in the U.S.A.'' label on these products so I \nhave a choice to make this country stronger. That is what the Walsh-\nStabenow bill does. That is what the Patriot Employer Tax Credit Act \ndoes. And that is what we need to do when it comes to these inversions.\n  There was an article that was printed in Fortune magazine after Allan \nSloan's article on July 15 the following week. It quoted a man whom I \nhave come to know and once worked with in Chicago. His name is Jamie \nDimon. Jamie Dimon is the CEO of JPMorgan Chase.\n  It turns out JPMorgan Chase is the investment adviser to AbbVie, the \ncompany I mentioned earlier. They have been advising them about moving \noverseas to avoid tax liability.\n  Mr. Dimon, in this Fortune magazine piece said: `` . . . it was \ninappropriate for anyone to moralize against deals in which U.S. \ncompanies seek lower tax rates through mergers.''\n  And then he went on to say ``an inversion.'' He characterized moving \nyour corporate headquarters overseas to avoid taxes as basically saying \nit is an acknowledgment how bad our Tax Code is today. It is a way of \nprotesting what the Tax Code is doing to corporations.\n  Our Tax Code today has resulted in the highest corporate profits in \nhistory. Our Tax Code today has resulted in paychecks for Mr. Dimon and \nother CEOs unparalleled in the history of the world. For Mr. Dimon and \nthe corporate CEOs to argue about this unfair Tax Code as a reason or \nrationale for picking up and deserting America doesn't square with the \nreality of corporate compensation or corporate profits.\n  Some people critical of what I have spoken to today will say: Well, \nnow, don't go picking winners and losers in the Tax Code.\n  I have news for you. The Tax Code is all about picking winners and \nlosers. Sadly, the losers too many times are working families in this \ncountry and the winners are the people in higher-income categories and \nthe largest corporations.\n  Look at what the Tax Code incentivizes. It incentivizes drilling for \noil, building wind turbines. It incentivizes holding stock for a longer \nperiod rather than a shorter period. It incentivizes saving for your \nretirement. It incentivizes buying health insurance. The Tax Code is \nfull of incentives.\n  So let's rewrite that Tax Code. Let's create an incentive to keep \njobs in America. Let's create an incentive to make sure that companies \nwhich pay a fair wage and make sure their operations are good for \nworking people get a tax break, and let's disincentivize the effort to \nmove American jobs overseas and to move American corporate offices \noverseas.\n  That to me is a Tax Code with the right incentives for building not \nonly a strong American economy with good-paying jobs here at home but \nbuilding our middle class and our working Americans into a strong \nentity, a strong force for progress and economic growth.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the articles I \nreferred to earlier.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From @FortuneMagazine, July 7, 2014]\n\n                   Positively un-American Tax Dodges\n\n                            (By Allan Sloan)\n\n       Bigtime companies are moving their ``headquarters'' \n     overseas to dodge billions in taxes . . . that means the rest \n     of us pay their share.\n       Ah, July! What a great month for those of us who celebrate \n     American exceptionalism. There's the lead-up to the Fourth, \n     countrywide Independence Day celebrations including my town's \n     local Revolutionary War reenactment and fireworks, the \n     enjoyable days of high summer, and, for the fortunate, the \n     prospect of some time at the beach.\n       Sorry, but this year, July isn't going to work for me. \n     That's because of a new kind of\n\n[[Page S4690]]\n\n     American corporate exceptionalism: companies that have \n     decided to desert our country to avoid paying taxes but \n     expect to keep receiving the full array of benefits that \n     being American confers, and that everyone else is paying for.\n       Yes, leaving the country--a process that tax techies call \n     inversion--is perfectly legal. A company does this by \n     reincorporating in a place like Ireland, where the corporate \n     tax rate is 12.5%, compared with 35% in the U.S. Inversion \n     also makes it easier to divert what would normally be U.S. \n     earnings to foreign, lower-tax locales. But being legal isn't \n     the same as being right. If a few companies invert, it's \n     irritating but no big deal for our society. But mass \n     inversion is a whole other thing, and that's where we're \n     heading.\n       We've also got a second, related problem, which I call the \n     ``never-heres.'' They include formerly private companies like \n     Accenture, a consulting firm that was spun off from Arthur \n     Andersen, and disc-drive maker Seagate, which began as a U.S. \n     company, went private in a 2000 buyout and was moved to the \n     Cayman Islands, went public in 2002, then moved to Ireland \n     from the Caymans in 2010. Firms like these can duck lots of \n     U.S. taxes without being accused of having deserted our \n     country because technically they were never here. So far, by \n     Fortune's count, some 60 U.S. companies have chosen the \n     never-here or the inversion route, and others are lining up \n     to leave.\n       All of this threatens to undermine our tax base, with \n     projected losses in the billions. It also threatens to \n     undermine the American public's already shrinking respect for \n     big corporations.\n       Inverters, of course, have a different view of things. It \n     goes something like this: The U.S. tax rate is too high, and \n     uncompetitive. Unlike many other countries, the U.S. taxes \n     all profits worldwide, not just those earned here. A domicile \n     abroad can offer a more competitive corporate tax rate. \n     Fiduciary duty to shareholders requires that companies \n     maximize returns.\n       My answer: Fight to fix the tax code, but don't desert the \n     country. And I define ``fiduciary duty'' as the obligation to \n     produce the best long-term results for shareholders, not \n     ``get the stock price up today.'' Undermining the finances of \n     the federal government by inverting helps undermine our \n     economy. And that's a bad thing, in the long run, for \n     companies that do business in America.\n       Finally, there's reputational risk. I wouldn't be surprised \n     to see someone in Washington call public hearings and ask \n     CEOs of inverters and would-be inverters why they think it's \n     okay for them to remain U.S. citizens while their companies \n     renounce citizenship. Imagine the reaction! And the punitive \n     legislation it could spark.\n\n\n   WATCH: Inversion: How some major U.S. companies are dodging taxes\n\n       Fortune contacted every company on our list of tax avoiders \n     and asked why they incorporated overseas. Four of them--\n     Carnival, Garmin, Invesco, and XL--said they were never U.S. \n     companies. In other words, they are never-heres. Five more--\n     Actavis, Allegion, Eaton, Ingersoll Rand, and Perrigo--said \n     they inverted mainly for strategic purposes. The tenth, \n     Nabors, refused to respond to our multiple requests.\n       Companies that have gone the inversion or never-here route \n     but that act American include household names like Garmin, \n     Michael Kors, Carnival, and Nielsen. Pfizer the giant \n     pharmaceutical company, tried to invert this spring, but the \n     deal fell through. Medtronic, the big medical-device company, \n     is trying to invert, of which more later. Walgreen is talking \n     about inverting too--it's easier to boost earnings by playing \n     tax games than by fixing the way you run your stores.\n       Then there's the ``Can you believe this?'' factor. \n     Carnival, a Panama-based company with headquarters in Miami, \n     was happy to have the U.S. Coast Guard, for which it doesn't \n     pay its fair share, help rescue its burning Carnival Triumph. \n     (It later reimbursed Uncle Sam.) Alexander Cutler, chief \n     executive of Eaton, a Cleveland company that he inverted to \n     Ireland, told the City Club of Cleveland, without a trace of \n     irony, that to fix our nation's budget problems, we need to \n     close ``those loopholes in the tax system.'' Inversions, I \n     guess, aren't loopholes.\n       Before we proceed, a brief confessional rant: The spectacle \n     of American corporations deserting our country to dodge taxes \n     while expecting to get the same benefits that good corporate \n     citizens get makes me deeply angry. It's the same way that I \n     felt when idiots and incompetents in Washington brought us to \n     the brink of defaulting on our national debt in the summer of \n     2011, the last time that I wrote anything angry at remotely \n     this length. (See ``American Idiots.'') Except that this is \n     worse.\n       Inverters don't hesitate to take advantage of the great \n     things that make America America: our deep financial markets, \n     our democracy and rule of law, our military might, our \n     intellectual and physical infrastructure, our national \n     research programs, all the terrific places our country offers \n     for employees and their families to live. But inverters do \n     hesitate--totally--when it's time to ante up their fair share \n     of financial support of our system.\n       Inverting a company, which is done in the name of \n     ``shareholder value''--a euphemism for a higher stock price--\n     is way more offensive to me than even the most disgusting \n     (albeit not illegal) tax games that companies like Apple and \n     GE play to siphon earnings out of the U.S. At least those \n     companies remain American. It may be for technical reasons \n     that I won't bore you with--but I don't care. What matters is \n     the result. Apple and GE remain American. Inverters are \n     deserters.\n       Even though I understand inversion intellectually, I have \n     trouble dealing with it emotionally. Maybe it's because of my \n     background: I'm the grandson of immigrants, and I'm \n     profoundly grateful that this country took my family in. \n     Watching companies walk out just to cut their taxes turns my \n     stomach.\n       Okay, rant over.\n       The current poster child for inversion outrage is Medtronic \n     Inc., the multinational Minnesota medical-device company that \n     once exuded a cleaner-than-clean image but now proposes to \n     move its nominal headquarters to Ireland by paying a fat \n     premium price to purchase Covidien, itself a faux-Irish firm \n     that is run from Massachusetts except for income-taxpaying \n     purposes. For that, it's based in Dublin. That's where the \n     new Medtronic PLC would be based, while its real headquarters \n     would remain on Medtronic Parkway in Minneapolis. Of course, \n     the company is unlikely to return any of the $484 million \n     worth of contracts the federal government says it has awarded \n     Medtronic over the past five years.\n       If the Medtronic deal goes through, which seems likely, it \n     will open the floodgates. Congress could close them, as we'll \n     see--but that would require our representatives and senators \n     to get their act together. Good luck with that.\n       Now let's have a look at some of the more interesting \n     aspects of the proposed Medtronic-Covidien marriage. I'm not \n     trying to pick on Medtronic--but its decision to become the \n     biggest company to invert makes it fair journalistic game.\n       Medtronic is one of those U.S. companies with a ton of cash \n     offshore: something like $14 billion. That's money on which \n     U.S. income tax hasn't been paid. Medtronic told me it would \n     have to pay $3.5 billion to $4.2 billion to the IRS if it \n     brought that money into the U.S.: That's the difference \n     between the 35% U.S. tax rate and the 5% to 10% it has paid \n     to other countries. Among other things, inverting would let \n     Medtronic PLC use offshore cash to pay dividends without \n     subjecting the money to U.S. corporate tax.\n       I especially love a little-noticed multimillion-dollar \n     goody that Medtronic is giving its board members and top \n     executives. Years ago, in order to discourage inversions, \n     Congress imposed a 15% excise tax on the value of options and \n     restricted stock owned by top officers and board members of \n     inverting companies. Guess what? Medtronic says it's going to \n     give the affected people enough money to pay the tax.\n       We're talking major money--major money that I'm glad to say \n     isn't tax-deductible to Medtronic. The company wouldn't tell \n     me how much this would cost its stockholders. So I did my own \n     back-of-the-envelope math, starting with chief executive Omar \n     Ishrak. Using numbers from Medtronic's 2014 proxy statement \n     and adjusting for its stock price when I was writing this, I \n     figure that his options and restricted shares are worth at \n     least $40 million, and the ``equity incentive plan awards'' \n     that he might get are worth another $23 million. Allow for \n     the fact that Medtronic will ``gross up'' Ishrak et al. by \n     giving them enough money to cover both the excise tax and the \n     tax due on their excise tax subsidy, and you end up with $7.1 \n     million to $11.2 million just for Ishrak. And something more \n     than $60 million for Medtronic as a whole.\n       Why does Medtronic feel the need to shell out this money? \n     The company's answer: ``Medtronic has agreed to indemnify \n     directors and executive officers for such excise tax because \n     they should not be discouraged from taking actions that they \n     believe are in the best interests of Medtronic and its \n     shareholders.''\n       But you know what, folks? These people are fiduciaries, who \n     are legally required to put shareholders' interests ahead of \n     their own. If they believe that inverting is the right thing \n     to do (which, it should be obvious by now, I don't) they \n     ought to pay any expenses they incur out of their own \n     pockets, not the shareholders'. It's not as if these people \n     lack the means to pay--the directors get $220,000 a year (and \n     up) in cash and stock for a part-time job, and Ishrak gets a \n     typical hefty CEO package.\n       One more thing: Normally, a company's shareholders don't \n     have to pay capital gains tax if their firm makes an \n     acquisition. But because this is an inversion, Medtronic \n     shareholders will be treated as if they've sold their shares \n     and will owe taxes on their gains. However, the deal won't \n     give them any cash with which to pay the tab.\n       The company asked me to mention that its executives and \n     directors, like other holders, will be subject to gains tax \n     on shares that they own outright, and Medtronic won't \n     compensate them for it. Okay. Consider it mentioned.\n       Second, the company contends that this deal will be so good \n     for shareholders that it will more than offset their tax cost \n     triggered by the board's decision to invert. Well, we'll see.\n       A major barrier to inversion used to be that companies \n     moving offshore were kicked out of the Standard & Poor's 500 \n     index. Given that more than 10% (by my estimate) of the S \n     500 stocks are owned by indexers, getting tossed out of the \n     index--or being added to it--makes a big, short-term \n     difference in share price. In 2008 and 2009, S, which has a \n     few never-heres, tossed nine companies off\n\n[[Page S4691]]\n\n     the 500 for inverting. But four years ago, S changed \n     course, for business reasons. Companies were angry at being \n     excluded, and index investors wanted to own some of the \n     excluded companies. Moreover, S feared that a competitor \n     would set up a more inclusive, rival index.\n       So in June 2010, S changed its definition of American. \n     Now all it takes to be in the S 500 is to trade on a U.S. \n     market, be considered a U.S. filer by the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission, and have a plurality of business and/or \n     assets in the U.S.\n       The result: S now has 28 non-American companies in the \n     500.\n       How much money are we talking about inverters sucking out \n     of the U.S. Treasury? There's no number available for the tax \n     revenue losses caused by inverters and never-heres so far. \n     But it's clearly in the billions. Congress's Joint Committee \n     on Taxation projects that failing to limit inversions will \n     cost the Treasury an additional $19.5 billion over 10 years--\n     a number that seems way low, given the looming stampede. But \n     even $19.5 billion--$2 billion a year--is a lot, if you look \n     at it the right way. It's enough to cover what Uncle Sam \n     spends on programs to help homeless veterans and to conduct \n     research to create better prosthetic arms and legs for our \n     wounded warriors.\n       Rep. Sandy Levin (D-Mich.) and his brother, Sen. Carl Levin \n     (D-Mich.), have introduced legislation that would stop \n     Medtronic in its tracks by making inversions harder. Under \n     current law, adopted in 2004 as an inversion stopper, a U.S. \n     company can invert only if it is doing significant business \n     in its new domicile and shareholders of the foreign company \n     it buys to do the inversion own at least 20% of the combined \n     firm.\n       The Levins propose to require that foreign-firm \n     shareholders own at least 50% of the combined company for it \n     to be able to invert and also that the company's management \n     change. This would really slow down inversions--but the \n     chances of Congress passing the Levin legislation are \n     somewhere between slim and none.\n       Conventional wisdom holds that companies are inverting now \n     because they've despaired of getting clean-cut reform that \n     would widen the tax base and lower rates. But John Buckley, \n     former chief Democratic tax counsel for the House Ways and \n     Means Committee, has a different view. Buckley thinks that \n     we're seeing an inversion wave not because there's no \n     prospect of tax reform but because there is a prospect of \n     reform. If reform comes, he says, there will be winners and \n     losers--and it's the likely losers-to-be that are inverting. \n     ``Even minimal tax reform would hurt a lot of these companies \n     badly,'' he says.\n       For example, Buckley says, a company that inverts before \n     reform takes effect will be able to suck income out of the \n     U.S. to lower-tax locales much more easily than if it were \n     still a U.S. company. ``A revenue-neutral tax reform requires \n     there to be winners and losers,'' Buckley says. ``But by \n     inverting, the companies that would be losers are taking \n     themselves out of the equation . . . They're taking advantage \n     of both U.S. individual taxpayers and other corporations.''\n       If you're a typical CEO who has read this far, about now \n     you're shaking your head and thinking, ``What a jerk! Just \n     cut my tax rate and I'll stay.'' To which I say, ``I wouldn't \n     bet on it.'' In the widely hailed 1986 tax reform act, \n     Congress cut the corporate rate to 34% (now 35%) from 46%, \n     and closed some loopholes. Corporate America was happy--for \n     awhile. Now, with Ireland at 12.5% and Britain at 20% (or \n     less, if you make a deal), 35% is intolerable. Let's say we \n     cut the rate to 25%, the wished-for number I hear bandied \n     about. Other countries are lower, and could go lower still in \n     order to lure our companies. Is Corporate America willing to \n     pay any corporate rate above zero? I wonder.\n       So what do we need? I'll offer you a bipartisan solution--\n     no, I'm not kidding. For starters, we need to tighten \n     inversion rules as proposed by Sandy and Carl Levin, who are \n     both bigtime Democrats. That would buy time to erect a more \n     rational corporate tax structure than we have now--bolstered, \n     I hope, by input from tough-minded tax techies.\n       We also need loophole tighteners along the lines of \n     proposals in the Republican-sponsored, dead-on-arrival Tax \n     Reform Act of 2014. One part would have imposed a tax of \n     8.75% a year on cash and cash equivalents held offshore, and \n     3.5% a year on other retained offshore earnings.\n       Another thing we need to do--which the SEC or the Financial \n     Accounting Standards Board could do in a heartbeat, but \n     won't--is require publicly traded U.S. companies and U.S. \n     subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign companies to disclose \n     two numbers from the tax returns they file with the IRS: \n     their U.S. taxable income for a given year, and how much \n     income tax they owed. This would take perhaps one person-hour \n     a year per company.\n       That way we would know what firms actually pay instead of \n     having to guess at it. Then we could compare and contrast \n     companies' income tax payments.\n       What we don't need is another one-time ``tax holiday,'' \n     like the one being proposed by Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), to \n     let companies pay 9.5% rather than 35% to bring earnings held \n     offshore into the U.S. It would be the second time in a \n     decade we've done that, and would signal tax avoiders that \n     they should keep sending tons of money offshore, then wait \n     for a tax holiday--presumably not on the Fourth of July--to \n     bring it back.\n       Until--and unless--we somehow get our act together on \n     corporate tax reform, companies will keep leaving our \n     country. Those that try to do the right thing and act like \n     good American corporate citizens will come under increasing \n     pressure to invert, if only to fend off possible attacks by \n     corporate pirates--I'm sorry, ``activist investors''--who see \n     inversion as a way to get a quick uptick in their targets' \n     stock price.\n       Now, two brief rays of sunshine: one in England, one here.\n       Starbucks, embarrassed by a 2012 Reuters expose showing \n     that it paid little or no taxes in England despite telling \n     shareholders it made big profits there, has recently \n     apologized and now makes substantial British tax payments. \n     And eBay, God bless it, decided to bring $9 billion of \n     offshore cash into the U.S. and pay taxes on it.\n       So I'm feeling a bit better about July than when I started \n     writing this. In any event, a happy summer to you and yours.\n                                  ____\n\n\n      Jamie Dimon: Companies Should Feel Free To Bail on the U.S.\n\n                          (By Stephen Gandel)\n\n       The JPMorgan CEO gave a thumbs up to inversions, the \n     growing practice where American companies buy smaller foreign \n     companies to relocate overseas and avoid paying U.S. taxes.\n       JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon says he's okay with \n     companies using a hot tax dodge that could cost the U.S. tens \n     of billions of dollars over the decade.\n       Dimon's public thumbs up for inversions--the growing \n     practice where American companies buy smaller foreign \n     companies to relocate overseas and avoid paying U.S. taxes--\n     came in response to a question from Fortune on a media \n     conference call after JPMorgan JPM 0.74% released its second \n     quarter results. He said the real problem was the tax code, \n     not CEOs trying to shirk their responsibilities.\n       ``You want the choice to be able to go to Wal-Mart to get \n     the lowest prices,'' Dimon said on a conference call with \n     reporters on Tuesday morning. ``Companies should be able to \n     make that choice as well.''\n       Dimon did not elaborate on the difference between choosing \n     where to buy your underwear and where a corporation calls \n     home. In a recent cover story for Fortune, Allan Sloan argued \n     that U.S. companies are ``positively unpatriotic'' when they \n     move their corporate headquarters overseas to pay lower taxes \n     because of the benefits they receive by being (except for tax \n     purposes) American companies. What's more, Sloan argued \n     undermining the U.S. tax base will be bad for all \n     shareholders in the long run.\n       Dimon seemed to brush aside those concerns. He said it was \n     inappropriate for anyone to moralize against deals in which \n     U.S. companies seek lower tax rates through mergers. No large \n     U.S. bank has proposed an inversion deal. Since the financial \n     crisis, there has been a debate about the size of the \n     subsidizes that large banks like JPMorgan receive from U.S. \n     taxpayers.\n       At least for now, inversions are good for Dimon and his \n     shareholders. The firm has been an advisor on 19 inversion \n     deals that have been announced since last year. The bank is \n     advising drug maker AbbVie on its $53 billion bid for Dublin-\n     based Shire, which was announced on Monday.\n       ``I love America. I'm just as patriotic as anyone,'' said \n     Dimon. ``But we have a flawed corporate tax code that is \n     driving U.S. companies overseas.''\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                               Tax Reform\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I was listening to my colleague from \nIllinois talking about the need for us to have economic patriotism and \nto keep people from moving jobs offshore.\n  I couldn't agree more, but the way to do it is to fix a broken Tax \nCode. It is frustrating to me that we have the President of the United \nStates, we have Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle who have \ntalked and talked and talked about the fact that we need to lower our \ntax rate and come up with a more competitive international tax system, \nand yet we do nothing about it. Instead, we are for these one-off \npolitical debates that we are going to have on the floor this week, \napparently, that unfortunately aren't going to make any difference to \nthe workers in America who are seeing this erosion of their wages, of \ntheir benefits, and often of their jobs because Washington is \nabdicating its responsibility. Washington is not doing what it has to \ndo in order to meet its fiduciary responsibilities.\n  There is a lot of talk about that with these corporations. Our \nresponsibility is to the people--to have the right tax system in place \nso that people can succeed so that if they work hard and play by the \nrules, the Tax Code is actually going to reward them and American \ncompanies can be competitive. That is simply not what is happening now. \nWe need to do a lot of things too, such as to be sure we have a \nregulatory system that works, to have an international trading system \nthat works for the workers of America, and to be sure we deal with our \ndebt, deficit, and other issues.\n\n[[Page S4692]]\n\n  But because the discussion of taxes is on the floor this week, I \nthought it would be helpful to talk just generally about where we are. \nWe had a hearing today in the Finance Committee on this topic. We had \nexperts in from across the spectrum. Although they disagreed on some of \nthe specifics about what we ought to do today, they all agreed with one \nthing, which is that our Tax Code is broken. It is not working.\n  By the way, the Congressional Budget Office, which is the nonpartisan \ngroup that advises us on the economic impact of things, has looked at \nthe Tax Code and said if you did deal with our high tax rates in this \ncountry and improved the corporate code, who benefits? It is the \nworkers, and it is in terms of higher wages, better benefits, a job. \nThis Congress has let the American people down, and it is time for us \nto deal with this issue and to deal with it in a way that can be \nnonpartisan.\n  We have, again, both sides of the aisle agreeing this is broken, and \nyet we can't seem to find that common ground to fix it. I would suggest \nthere is common ground out there if we just get off the politics and \nstart working on how we actually help people to be able to get ahead.\n  The issue that has come to the attention of all of us in Congress in \nthe past few months the most is companies that are--what they call--\ninverting. These inversions are when a company in the United States \nbuys a company overseas, merges with it, and then it becomes an \noverseas company. Often these companies they are buying are smaller \nthan the U.S. company, and they become a foreign company because they \nare trying to get as far away from our Tax Code as they can. They want \nto become domiciled--they want to have their headquarters--in a foreign \ncountry because that country has a better Tax Code for a corporation to \nbe able to succeed.\n  Again, there have been discussions on the floor recently about \nfiduciary responsibility. People do, if you are in corporate America, \nhave a fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders. So they are making \nthese decisions, and Washington sits by the sidelines and lets it \nhappen.\n  I think the answer is to reform the Tax Code. I think we know what we \nhave to do. I think we have to get busy on it.\n  Last week we saw another example of this. It was a Chicago drug \ncompany called AbbVie. Their bid to acquire a company called Shire \nlooks like it is going to go through, and their combined company is \ngoing to move its tax headquarters to the UK, to England. This is \nhardly the first company to do this, and it won't be the last unless we \nchange the code.\n  In fact, according to the Congressional Research Service, 35 \ncompanies have inverted in the past 5 years alone. I think the United \nStates is still the best place to do business.\n  Despite our bad Tax Code, we have the most productive workforce; we \nhave the best infrastructure; we have the rule of law; we have some \ngreat research institutions; we have a lot going for us; and we can \ncompete and attract business from around the world.\n  So why are these companies going to England? Why are they going to \nthe UK? Well, it turns out they have a tax code that was designed for \nthis century, this decade--unlike here in America, where our \ninternational Tax Code was actually developed back in the 1960s. Things \nwere a lot different then.\n  Our Tax Code itself and the rates of taxation were established in \n1986. That is 25 years ago. The international system back to the 1960s, \nthe rate we paid back to 1986--in 1986, ``Top Gun'' was the top at the \nbox office. People still communicated by telegraph. The Mets were World \nSeries champions. Pete Rose was playing for my hometown team, the \nCincinnati Reds. That is how long ago it was.\n  A lot has changed since then. The world has changed. The global \neconomy is far more competitive. It is very difficult for us in the \nUnited States of America to have a policy that is not affected by that \nglobal economy. And yet while every other one of our global competitors \nhas reformed their tax code, we have not. They all have.\n  By the way, after the reform, the United Kingdom has a 21-percent \ncorporate tax rate and they have a so-called territorial tax system. \nThat basically means it taxes income in the UK if it is made in the UK, \nbut otherwise it is taxed in the country where it is done. That means \nthey have a competitive global tax system. By the way, about 93 percent \nof the companies that American companies compete with have that kind of \nmore competitive international system. We have the old-style system.\n  We also have a higher rate. So we have a deadly combination--a higher \nrate, 39-percent tax rate, which is now the highest among all the \ndeveloped countries in the world--not a No. 1 you want to be--but we \nhave also got this international system that is not competitive.\n  So it is not a mystery why companies are leaving. When we look at the \nside-by-side, they are making decisions based on what is best for their \nshareholders. When we look at the changes in the tax rate since the \n1990s and 2000s, we can see the United States is falling further \nbehind.\n  Here is an interesting chart. This shows, just in 2004, what the tax \nrates were and now what they are in 2014. That is just 10 years ago. \nThe United States is the same, 39 percent. And that 39 percent includes \nthe Federal rate plus the State rate.\n  People say, well, the effective rate is less than that. Yes, it is \nless than that because people do take advantage of some of the so-\ncalled tax preferences. But even so, our rate is higher than these \nother countries.\n  We go from 39 percent to 39 percent; the UK, 30 to 21; Canada, 34.4 \nto 26, and they are going even lower at the Federal level; Netherlands, \n34.5 to 25 percent; Ireland, 12.5; Switzerland, 24 to 21. And they have \ngone to these territorial tax systems that we talked about.\n  What has happened? Well, these are the companies that have left the \nUnited States of America to go to these countries. We mentioned Abbvi. \nThat is the latest one last week. Medtronic, that was a couple weeks \nago. On and on. There are companies in here from the State of Ohio. \nThere is a company listed there from my home State of Ohio that chose \nto incorporate somewhere else because of the Tax Code. Guess what. They \nare going to save about $160 million on their tax bill this year. That \nis a pretty darned good savings, and that is wrong. We have to reform \nthis Tax Code.\n  In 1960, 17 of the world's largest 20 companies were U.S.-\nheadquartered. By 2010, only six were headquartered in the United \nStates. In 2012 alone, our global 500 companies, the bigger companies' \nshare fell from 36 percent to 26 percent.\n  I am not saying it is all due to taxes, but a lot of it is. If we \ntalk to these companies, we find that out.\n  Again, I don't think anyone in the Senate--or in the White House, for \nthat matter--disputes that tax reform is needed. I don't think so. Yet \nwe aren't seeing it. Instead, again, we are hearing about these one-\noffsies, these small things that seem politically popular but aren't \ngoing to make a difference in terms of truly bringing the jobs back and \nattracting more jobs--attracting companies that want to headquarter \nhere in the United States of America.\n  It is an admission that the United States is no longer the best place \nin the world to invest if we say we are going to require companies to \ndo certain things so they can't follow the Tax Code. I think it is a \nfutile effort to try to keep companies here with these new \nrequirements, because ultimately if we do that and make it more \ndisadvantageous to be an American company--so you have companies \ncompeting not just with one hand tied behind their back but with two \nhands tied behind their in a global economy--what will they do? Well, \nthey will probably sell, because foreign companies can come in and buy \nthem. And that has happened and is happening.\n  If you are a beer drinker, like I am, try to find an American beer \nthese days. The largest share is probably Sam Adams, with about 1.4 \npercent market share. The rest are all foreign-owned. Yuengling is up \nthere too at about 1.4 percent. But all of them. And foreign companies \nhave come in here and bought these companies because they can pay a \npremium for them, because their aftertax profits are greater because \ntheir tax code in their country is more advantageous. Who does that \nhurt? It hurts American workers.\n\n[[Page S4693]]\n\n  I am not saying they don't have facilities here. They do. But when \nthey move their corporate headquarters out of the United States, the \ntax headquarters out of the United States, the history is, when you \nlook at this, that jobs follow--including the higher paid executive \njobs.\n  Also, an intangible but really important thing to American \ncommunities is, when you have a U.S. company headquartered here, they \ntend to invest in the communities. So think of the nonprofits involved \nwith charities we help out with. There are probably some companies that \nhelp out there too and probably it is an American company.\n  So of course we have to keep up with the times, and we aren't doing \nthat. If we don't, we are going to see more and more companies leave \nour shores. I don't think these companies want to leave our shores. I \nthink they are doing it because Washington is letting them down.\n  Let's imagine for a second that a company did decide not to do one of \nthese inversions because we did some one-off things, including to say: \nYou ought to stay here. You ought to not take advantage of a company \nwith a $160 million a year benefit.\n  I think what is going to happen is we will see more and more \ncompanies become foreign companies. American workers and American jobs \nare going to be lost because we are going to see foreign companies come \nin and buy these U.S. companies.\n  If we are truly patriots, economic patriots, we need to look at tax \nreform, and we need it as soon as possible. This can't, by the way, be \njust a Republican or Democrat priority. It needs to be an American \npriority. And it should be, because as far as I can tell in talking to \npeople, the consensus is that it is broken. We have a pretty good sense \nof what we ought to do to try to fix it.\n  One, I think we have a pretty good sense that we ought to reduce the \nrate. So the corporate rate ought to be reduced. I think it has to get \ndown to at least 25 percent for us to be competitive. Back when we last \ndid this in 1986, we purposefully lowered the rate under Ronald Reagan \nto get it down to 34 percent so it would be below the average of the \nother developed countries of the world. That is what we have to do \nagain. So, at least 25 percent.\n  And we need to do this, by the way, at the same time we eliminate \nsome of these preferences, the deductions, the credits, the exclusions. \nI know that is tough, and some people are going to say: Well, gosh, I \nam going to lose my special preference or this is going to hurt my \ncompany. If they get a lower rate, one, they get a benefit. But, \nsecond, it helps the whole economy to have a lower rate.\n  Economists who look at this all agree, this will generate economic \ngrowth and will result, by the way, in more revenues coming in through \ngrowth as well. So we broaden the base by getting rid of a lot of the \npreferences, take those savings to lower the rate.\n  Then, finally, we need to do something about this international side. \nIf we don't, we are not going to be able to be competitive. Even if we \nhave a low tax rate, if we don't figure out a way to ensure we go to a \nsystem that is more like these other countries have all gone to--about \n93 percent of the companies that we compete with have this what is \ncalled territorial system where you tax income where it is earned. If \nwe don't do that, then I think we are going to end up making this \nproblem worse, not better, by some of these proposals that say let's \njust kick the can down the road and immediately do something to create \na requirement on companies to do this or that.\n  With regard to the anti-inversion rules, we are going to talk about \nthat now. Let's not reform the Tax Code; let's just do something on \ninversions to make it harder to invert. We did that back in 2004. We \nenacted anti-inversion rules that were supposed to stop companies from \nmoving overseas. As we saw in the first chart, that didn't work. \nCompanies did anyway. And I don't think it is going to work today. In \nfact, I think it could make the problem worse, again, because those \ncompanies could then be targeted for foreign acquisition.\n  So if businesses are more valuable overseas than the United States \nand businesses can't move under the U.S. themselves, I think the \nforeign corporations will step in and buy them.\n  The Bring Jobs Home Act is a great title, and that is legislation we \nare going to consider here on the floor tomorrow. I think we ought to \nhave a debate on it, so I am going to vote to proceed to have that \ndebate. It is a great title, but I don't think there is anything in the \nlegislation that is going to help to actually bring jobs back. I don't \nthink anything in this legislation is going to address the fact that we \nhave this high tax rate. I don't think there is anything in this \nlegislation that is going to address the fact that we have a worldwide \nsystem that is way out of step with all our competitors.\n\n  It claims to remove deductions and tax credits and incentivize \ncompanies to move overseas. Unfortunately, that is not as easy as it \nsounds because, according to the Joint Committee on Taxes, which is the \ngroup here that advises us, under present law there are no targeted tax \ncredits or disallowance of deductions related to relocating business \nunits inside or outside the United States. There aren't any. So it is \nsort of tough to say we are going to do something with regard to \ncredits or disallowances of deductions when there are none that relate \ndirectly to that.\n  There have been claims to the contrary that the media, looking at it \nroutinely, says that is just false or misleading.\n  Finally, when it comes to proposed deductions for bringing jobs back \nto our shores, the proposal would likely pose some really serious \nadministrative difficulties for an Internal Revenue Service that \nalready has plenty of problems. The legislation, as I read it, gives \nthe IRS authority to subjectively judge whether the IRS thinks that \nbusiness deductions were made specifically for the purpose of bringing \njobs to the United States or moving jobs overseas. Because there are no \nspecific targeted tax deductions for this, the IRS would have to \nsomehow subjectively determine whether that was true. That is going to \nbe tough, because multinational businesses create and close businesses \naround the globe every day, most times because it is the most \neconomically efficient thing to do from a business perspective. They \nstart a company, close a company, move them around. Asking the IRS to \ndetermine whether those decisions were made specifically to move jobs \nto the United States or to move jobs overseas I think is going to be \nimpossible. That is why this legislation, if passed, is not going \nanywhere.\n  I do appreciate my colleagues' hard work in trying to come up with \nreal legislation to address the problem. Senator Wyden, who is the \nDemocratic Chair of the Finance Committee, has been working on that, as \nhave others. But this particular one is just not going to help. It is \njust not going to help. That fact should serve as a stark reminder that \nthe only way we are going to stop these so-called inversions, the only \nway we are going to stop people from saying I would rather be a foreign \ncompany than a U.S. company is to make it more attractive to be here--\nto do what we should have done over the last couple decades--and the \nrest of the world has; all of our competitors have--which is to reform \nour Tax Code so that it is good for American workers and good for \nAmerican investors. If we do that, I think America's best days are \nahead of us. I really do.\n  There are a lot of things we need to do, as we talked about earlier, \nto make this country more competitive and to be sure we are creating \nthe best jobs and the greatest opportunities here for everybody. But \none thing we can do that will give the economy a shot in the arm right \naway is this comprehensive tax reform. When people have analyzed this \nfrom a macroeconomic basis, they say: If we did this--lower the rate by \nbroadening the base, go to this competitive international system--we \nwould generate a lot more investment and business in America. That \nwould in turn generate a lot more investments, a lot more business here \nin America. That would in turn generate more revenue.\n  So it is growth revenues, which is exactly what we want to see. We \nwant to see more jobs, and we want to see us being able to have the \nkind of growth and prosperity so we can help to get out of this debt \nand deficit, which is a real problem. And, going forward, it is\n\n[[Page S4694]]\n\na problem we are going to have to deal with, both because it affects \nthe economy and because it affects what we are doing to future \ngenerations.\n  As legislators, it is our job to fix this problem. That is what we \nwere hired to do. I know it is not easy. I know corporate tax reform is \ntough to do, because we would take away benefits from one company or \nanother by lowering that rate. But, by the way, when we do this--when \nwe do lower that rate and get rid of some of these preferences to do \nso, guess what. Everybody has to pay taxes.\n  People talk about it is unfair that some American companies in some \nyears, because they get a tax break, don't pay taxes. Well, if they \ncan't be as creative because there aren't all these deductions and \ncredits and exemptions to be able to use, they are going to have to pay \ntaxes. Everyone will pay. There will be a lower rate and they will be \nmore competitive, and they won't be having this incentive to move \noffshore. But everybody will be paying taxes. And I think that is part \nof what we ought to be doing.\n  To be able to compete and to succeed and to help American workers, it \nis time for us to make tax reform a reality. Let's not do things that \nmight feel good politically and do some of these one-offs and half \nsteps that in the end could inadvertently actually make it worse, not \nbetter--because, again, if we make it even more difficult to be an \nAmerican company, we are just not going to have as many American \ncompanies because they will be bought by foreign companies that can pay \nmore for them and pay a premium. Let's instead get busy doing what we \nwere elected to do, which is to work across the aisle to come up with \nsensible tax reform, lowering that rate, a competitive international \nsystem, and ensuring that we do create more opportunities for American \nworkers to be able to compete--not just survive but thrive in the \nglobal economy.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 minutes \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Malaysian Airline Flight 17\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I rise to talk about the \ndeteriorating situation in Syria and in Iraq. However, before I address \nthe situation in the Middle East, I wish to speak briefly about Russia \nand the downing of the Malaysian Airline flight 17.\n  Last week we all watched in horror as news came in of the almost 300 \ncivilians who were callously murdered. I have seen the intelligence on \nthis attack, and it is very clear Russia bears the responsibility for \nthe death of these civilians. Vladimir Putin should be held \naccountable, regardless of whether it was a Russian soldier or a \nRussian-sponsored separatist who pulled the trigger. Russia either shot \ndown the plane itself or directly gave separatists the order and the \nability to do so.\n  Russia and its proxy separatists in eastern Ukraine are well armed, \nas was clearly demonstrated last week, and they are also very \nirresponsible. President Putin continues to flout the international \ncommunity by sending heavy weapons and fighters into eastern Ukraine. \nIn addition, Russia is supporting Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria and \nfailing to comply with some of its international arms control \nobligations.\n  The limited sanctions put in place so far have done little to deter \nPutin. In addition to simply increasing sanctions, President Obama must \nshow strength and leadership and rally the international community to \nsecure the crash site, conduct a thorough investigation, and hold the \nRussians, and particularly Putin, accountable for this unthinkable \nattack. Now is not the time for half measures. Swift and decisive \naction is needed to deal with this situation.\n\n\n                            The Middle East\n\n  With regard to the Middle East, the rise of the al-Nusra Front and \nISIL--the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant--presents a serious and \ncredible threat to the security of the region, to the United States of \nAmerica, and to our allies. Yet despite repeated requests from me and \nother Members of this body on both sides of the aisle, the \nadministration has yet to present a compelling plan to counter this \ngrowing threat. The administration seems determined to keep its head in \nthe sand, but this threat simply cannot be ignored. This same wait-and-\nsee mentality is just more of what got us into this mess with Syria in \nthe first place.\n  ISIL is gaining strength, capturing arms and equipment, and closing \nin on Baghdad. ISIL in recent weeks has purportedly garnered hundreds \nof millions of dollars, thousands of fighters, and countless weapons. \nWe have seen ISIL parade around with 4 U.S.-made howitzers and MRAPs. \nIn the absence of resistance from MRAPs and other forces, ISIL is able \nto consolidate its gains, redistribute its captured material, and \nrecruit additional fighters. As ISIL has taken territory, it has also \nransacked several prisons, providing it with an even larger fighting \nforce, all of this in preparation for an assault on Baghdad.\n  ISIL is clearly preparing to attack Baghdad, which will inevitably \ninclude terrorist attacks against Western interests and possibly \nincluding the international airport and the U.S. Embassy. ISIL fighters \nhave plotted and conducted terrorist attacks in Baghdad over the past \ndecade and it is naive to think they will not continue. We can wait for \nISIL to descend on Baghdad with its newly acquired weaponry or we can \ntake the fight to them before they reach the Capitol.\n  In addition to closing in on Baghdad, ISIL has its sights set on \nJordan, Lebanon, Israel, and other parts of the region. On June 25 of \nthis year, we saw an ISIL suicide bomber detonate himself in a Beirut \nhotel after being discovered by security forces. This is not the only \nattack we have seen outside of Iraq and Syria. Lebanon in recent months \nhas been besieged by violence linked to the conflict in Iraq and Syria, \nand it is only a matter of time before these attacks spread to Jordan \nas well as to Israel.\n  ISIL not only represents a credible threat to the region but to \nEurope and the United States as well. Earlier this year we witnessed an \narmed attack on a Jewish Museum in Brussels. The attacker, a 29-year-\nold French national, had returned from fighting in Syria and was \narrested with an ISIL flag wrapped around his rifle. Alarmingly, the \ncell's leader had been arrested in Afghanistan in 2001 and was also a \nformer Guantanamo Bay detainee. Individuals linked to ISIL and Syrian \nextremist groups have been arrested in other parts of Europe, including \nGermany and France.\n  ISIL's aspirations don't end in Europe but extend to the United \nStates. The group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, has been clear about \nthe group's ultimate goal of confronting the United States, and as a \ncountry we must be prepared for this threat. Many of ISIL's leaders \nhave threatened the United States for years under the banner of Al \nQaeda and Iraq. These fighters have been planning attacks against \nBaghdad and are responsible for the deaths of many U.S. servicemembers \nover the last decade.\n  One of the biggest lessons we learned from the September 11 attacks \nwas that we cannot give terrorists a sanctuary from which to plan \nattacks against us. Arguably, ISIL now has control of the largest \nterritory ever held by a terrorist group. This safe haven provides ISIL \nwith the time and space they need to train fighters and plan \noperations. It also has provided them with access to weapons and a \nnetwork that can be used to support external operations. We knew about \nthe threat we faced from Al Qaeda prior to 9/11, but we failed to act. \nI just hope we don't make the same mistake again.\n  ISIL isn't the only threat we face in Iraq and Syria. Experienced \nfighters and jihadists have flocked to Syria, forming several groups \nthat could threaten the United States, including the Al Qaeda-\naffiliated al-Nusra Front. Several U.S. citizens and legal permanent \nresidents have traveled to Syria to join the al-Nusra Front and other \ngroups. In May we witnessed Moner Mohammad Abusalha, the first American \nsuicide bomber in Syria, carry out\n\n[[Page S4695]]\n\nan attack that is believed to have killed almost 40 Syrian personnel.\n\n  A Florida native, Abusalha was eulogized by a recruitment video \nfeaturing images of the September 11 attack on the World Trade Center \nand a burning American flag.\n  The White House recently announced plans to increase support for the \nSyrian opposition, including a $500 million plan to train and equip \nvetted elements of the Syrian opposition. Despite the announcement, few \ndetails are available on how this training would actually take place, \nand it may be quite some time before this program begins. It is also \nunclear how this new program to train Syrian opposition fighters will \nactually help counter the growing terrorist threat in Syria as opposed \nto simply countering the Assad regime. It is clear the administration \nhas not prepared any plan that will fit into a cohesive and compelling \nforeign policy in the region.\n  The Middle East over the last 3 years has been besieged by a \nresurgence of instability, violence, and terrorism. The administration, \nunfortunately, has done little to stop it. Instead of focusing on \ncountering rising groups in Iraq and Syria, the administration has been \nfocused on ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which appears to \nhave had the unfortunate consequence of letting America's enemies grow \nstronger.\n  Al Qaeda, its affiliates, and other terrorist groups are determined \nto attack the United States. We constantly face new plots and \noperatives looking for ways to murder Americans, such as the foiled May \n2012 AQAP plot to put another IED on a U.S.-bound commercial aircraft. \nThankfully, this plot and others have not materialized, but we are not \ngoing to always be so fortunate. Just this month TSA was forced to \ninstitute new security measures to mitigate the terrorist threat to \ncommercial aviation. The administration must come to grips with the \nterrorist threats we face and put policies in place that will \neffectively counter them. I would encourage the administration to act \nimmediately before another act of terrorism against our country occurs.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

ADAMS\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I rise today to recognize the career of \nthe Honorable Brent T. Adams, who is retiring from the Second Judicial \nDistrict Court of the State of Nevada.\n  For more than 25 years, Judge Adams has been the presiding judge in \nDepartment Six of the district court. Since being appointed to the \ndistinctive position by Governor Bob Miller on July 4, 1989, his \nconsistent leadership and responsiveness to the public and the court \nhave not gone unnoticed, as he successfully won four elections to \nmaintain his seat. Judge Adams' dedication to his profession was \nreflected in the Washoe County Bar Association's biennial surveys, \nwhere he consistently received exceptional judicial performance \nevaluations and high retention ratings.\n  Beyond his remarkable career at the district court, Judge Adams has \nhad a tremendous impact on the entire legal community.

Madam President, I served with Dick Clark and traveled \nwith him to different parts of the country, including a very cold day \nin the winter in Vermont. One of the finest Senators I served with was \nDick Clark from Iowa and I still think of all I learned from him. I was \nso happy to see David Rogers' article about him in Politico. I ask \nunanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Politico, Dec. 20, 2013]\n\n             A Nelson Mandela Backstory: Iowa's Dick Clark\n\n                           (By David Rogers)\n\n       Dick Clark was Mandela when Mandela wasn't cool.\n       A one-term Democratic senator from Iowa and for years \n     afterward a leader of congressional discussions on apartheid, \n     Clark is now 85 and long gone from the public scene. But the \n     ups and downs of his career are an intriguing back story--and \n     counterpoint--to the outpouring of praise for Nelson Mandela, \n     the black liberation leader and former president of South \n     Africa who died Dec. 5.\n       It wasn't always that way in Washington.\n       Indeed, Mandela turned 60 in South Africa's Robben Island \n     prison in the summer of 1978 even as Clark--chairman of the \n     African Affairs panel on the Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee--was fighting for his own re-election in Iowa.\n       It was a time when Republican challenger Roger Jepsen felt \n     free to taunt the Democrat as ``the senator from Africa.'' \n     Tensions were such that the State Department called in a \n     South African Embassy official in May for making disparaging \n     remarks about Clark in Iowa. And after Clark lost, South \n     Africa's ousted information secretary, Eschel Rhoodie, said \n     his government invested $250,000 to defeat Clark, who had \n     become a thorn in the side of the white regime.\n       Jepsen denied any knowledge of South Africa's alleged role. \n     Nor does Clark accuse him of such. But 35 years after, Clark \n     has no doubt that the apartheid government led by Prime \n     Minister B. J. Vorster wanted him out--and had a hand in his \n     defeat.\n       Clark's liberal record and support of the Panama Canal \n     Treaty, which narrowly cleared the Senate in the spring of \n     1978, also hurt his chances in Iowa. But the fatal blow was a \n     fierce wave of late-breaking ground attacks from anti-\n     abortion forces--something even conservative writers like \n     Robert Novak had not anticipated in a published column weeks \n     before.\n       ``Abortion was the issue, and how much effect this apparent \n     $250,000 had to do with promoting it more, I have no way of \n     evaluating it,'' Clark said in a recent interview at his home \n     in Washington. ``No question that they did it. They said they \n     did, and I think they did.''\n       Clark had made himself a target for South Africa with his \n     high-profile chairmanship of the Africa subcommittee. In \n     Washington as well, he was not without critics who accused \n     him of being too puritanical, too quick to fault U.S. policy. \n     But like no senator before him, Clark used the panel to raise \n     the visibility of human rights issues in the southern regions \n     of the continent.\n       The roster of prior Africa subcommittee chairs reads like a \n     Who's Who of national Democrats: John Kennedy in the late \n     1950s; Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore, father of the future vice \n     president; future Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield; and \n     former Vice President Hubert Humphrey after his return to the \n     Senate. But all stayed for just one Congress before moving \n     on. Clark stuck, challenging Cold War policies that he \n     believed hurt the larger struggle against apartheid that \n     Mandela symbolized.\n       ``He was the icebreaker here,'' says his friend Rep. George \n     Miller (D-Cal.). ``He was out breaking ice on Africa issues \n     for the country and certainly for the Senate.''\n       What's more, after losing his Senate seat, Clark didn't \n     stop. Instead, he found a new classroom via the Aspen \n     Institute, where the former professor began what amounted to \n     his own graduate program in 1983 to educate members of \n     Congress about different policy issues.\n       Russia had been Clark's early academic interest and was as \n     well in his first years at Aspen. But Africa tugged and he \n     set out ``to try to get a cadre of Congress who would know \n     about South Africa and what was going on in South Africa.''\n       These typically were nearly weeklong seminars--held at \n     choice locales overseas to lure members of Congress but also \n     to provide neutral ground for the warring parties inside \n     South Africa.\n       Bermuda, for example, served as a meeting place in 1989. \n     The island allowed officials from the South African \n     government to shuttle in and out before the arrival of \n     outlawed representatives for Mandela's African National \n     Congress, which was operating then from outside South Africa.\n       ``All of them were there, making their pitches,'' Clark \n     said. And once Mandela was released from prison in 1990, the \n     venue shifted to South Africa itself. ``We got Mandela, who \n     had just gotten out of jail not long before, to come,'' Clark \n     recalls of an April 1991 session in Cape Town a seminar that \n     also included F. W. de Klerk, South Africa's white president.\n       Most striking here was Clark's impact on Republicans--the \n     party that helped to throw him out of the Senate.\n       ``He is a wonder,'' says former Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.). \n     ``I had been told he was a lefty, the stereotype, but he just \n     drew out people. He never showed bitterness toward the right \n     or promoting one side.''\n       Just as ``Mandela made a difference, Dick Clark made a \n     difference in awareness'' at home in Congress, Simpson adds.\n       Former Rep. John Porter (R-Ill.) remembers an Aspen meeting \n     in Cape Town at which Clark surprised the participants on the \n     last day by sending them out to walk through the \n     neighborhoods of a black township to meet with families. \n     ``Dick Clark would do things like that,'' Porter said.\n       ``This was before all the big changes in South Africa when \n     we were debating sanctions,'' said former Sen. John Danforth \n     (R-Mo.). ``He was just so dedicated to it and knew all the \n     players.''\n       In fact, Clark says he knew very little about Africa before \n     coming to the Senate after the 1972 elections. But when a \n     seat opened up on Foreign Relations in 1975, he grabbed it \n     and fell into the Africa post just ahead of his classmate \n     Sen. Joseph Biden (D-Del.), the future vice president.\n       Timing is everything in Congress and it was Clark's good \n     fortune in this case. The legendary but very controlling \n     Foreign Relations Committee Chairman J. William Fulbright (D-\n     Ark.) had just left the Senate at the end of 1974 and this \n     allowed subcommittee chairs like Clark to act more on their \n     own.\n       ``Fulbright's attitude was the subcommittees couldn't do \n     anything. Everything ought to be done by the full \n     committee,'' Clark said. ``I was next to last on seniority. \n     When it got down to me, the only thing left was Africa about \n     which I knew very little. Some would say none. So I just \n     figured: Here's a chance to learn something and I spent a lot \n     of time doing hearings and learning about Africa.''\n       He also traveled venturing into southern, sub-Saharan \n     Africa which was then unfamiliar to many on the Senate \n     committee.\n       ``Humphrey told me that he got as far south as Ethiopia,'' \n     Clark said. ``It was new territory and interesting and of \n     course we were putting a lot of covert money in Africa, as \n     were the Russians.''\n       In the summer of 1975, Clark and two aides left Washington \n     for what was to be a trip to just Tanzania, Zambia and Zaire. \n     But that itinerary quickly expanded to include the two former \n     Portuguese colonies, Mozambique and Angola.\n       The Angola detour was pivotal and included face-to-face \n     meetings with Central Intelligence Agency personnel on the \n     ground as well as the leaders of the three rival factions in \n     Angola's post-colonial civil war. The Soviet Union and Cuba \n     were then actively backing the new leftist government under \n     Agostinho Neto. The CIA and South Africa had begun a covert \n     partnership assisting rebel factions: chiefly Jonas Savimbi \n     in the south, but also Holden Roberto, whose base was more in \n     the north and Zaire.\n       Soon after Clark returned, the debate broke into the open \n     after news reports detailing the U.S. and South African \n     operations. Congress cut off new funding in a December 1975 \n     appropriations fight. It then quickly enacted a more \n     permanent ban the so-called Clark amendment prohibiting \n     future covert assistance for paramilitary operations in \n     Angola.\n       Signed into law in February 1976, the Clark amendment was \n     repealed under President Ronald Reagan in 1985. Conservatives \n     long argued that it was always an overreach by Congress, \n     reacting to Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon's handling of \n     the Vietnam War.\n       ``The danger now is the pendulum will swing too far the \n     other way,'' Secretary of State Henry Kissinger warned \n     Clark's panel in a January 1976 hearing.\n       But for all the echoes of Vietnam, Clark says he saw his \n     amendment more as a way to separate the U.S. from South \n     Africa's apartheid regime.\n       ``The reason the amendment passed so easily in both houses \n     was because of Vietnam, so I certainly related the two,'' \n     Clark said. ``But my interest was really in Africa and South \n     Africa. We were aligning ourselves with apartheid forces. The \n     reason for my amendment was to disassociate us from apartheid \n     and from South Africa.''\n       ``Kissinger had really no feeling for human rights that I \n     could ever discern and certainly not in South Africa,'' Clark \n     said. ``His association with South Africa was obviously very \n     close.''\n       A year later, visiting South Africa, Clark got a taste of \n     how closely the white government under Vorster had been \n     watching him.\n       That trip included an important meeting in Port Elizabeth \n     with the young black leader, Steve Biko, who had just been \n     released from jail and would die 10 months later after a \n     brutal interrogation in the summer of 1977. Clark said he \n     became a courier of sorts, taking back a Biko memorandum to \n     Jimmy Carter's incoming administration.\n\n[[Page S4697]]\n\n       But while in South Africa, Vorster himself wanted to see \n     Clark and spent much of an hour quizzing the senator on his \n     past public comments--even down to small college appearances \n     in the U.S.\n       ``He spent an hour with me,'' Clark said. ``They obviously \n     had followed me to each of these, much to my surprise.''\n       ``He would quote me. And then he would say, Did you say \n     that on such and such a date and such and such a place?' ``We \n     went through this for an hour. He just wanted the opportunity \n     to tell me how wrong I was about everything I was saying.''\n       ``He was the last great Afrikaner president,'' Clark said. \n     ``In fact, he ultimately resigned over the embarrassment of \n     the Muldergate thing years later.''\n       The Muldergate thing--as Clark calls it--was a major \n     scandal inside South Africa in the late 1970s when it was \n     revealed that government funds had been used by the ruling \n     National Party to mount a far-reaching propaganda campaign in \n     defense of apartheid.\n       This went well beyond placing favorable articles or opinion \n     pieces in the press. Tens of millions of dollars were \n     invested to try to undermine independent South African \n     papers. There was even a failed attempt in the U.S. to buy \n     the Washington Star in hopes of influencing American policy.\n       Muldergate got its name from Connie Mulder, South Africa's \n     information minister at the time. But just as Watergate had \n     its John Dean, Rhoodie--a top deputy to Mulder--proved the \n     top witness: a suave propagandist who later gave detailed \n     interviews and wrote his own book on the subject filling 900-\n     plus pages.\n       Rhoodie, who was prosecuted for fraud but cleared by an \n     appeals court in South Africa, ultimately relocated to the \n     U.S., where he died in Atlanta in 1993. But by his account, \n     the Vorster government had used its contacts with a Madison \n     Avenue public relations firm, Sydney S. Baron & Co. Inc., to \n     undermine Clark's reelection.\n       Rhoodie describes a meeting early in 1978 in South Africa \n     attended by Mulder, Vorster and Baron at which Clark's \n     election was specifically discussed, and the $250,000 was \n     later moved into one of Baron's accounts ``to make sure that \n     Clark was defeated.''\n       As South Africa's information secretary, Rhoodie was in \n     fact the signatory of contracts with Baron, according to \n     filings with the Justice Department. These show the New York \n     firm initially received about $365,000 annually under a \n     contract signed in April 1976. This was increased to $650,000 \n     a year later. In August 1977, the same arrangement was \n     extended through January 1979, including a $250,000 payment \n     in April 1978.\n       Whether this $250,000 is a coincidence or what Rhoodie was \n     speaking on is not clear. At this stage, most of the major \n     players are dead and New York state corporate records show \n     Baron's firm was dissolved in 1993--the year that Rhoodie \n     died.\n       Watching it all is Clark's friend, old boss in the House \n     and later Senate colleague, John Culver. The two met in 1964, \n     when Clark signed on to help Culver win his first House \n     election and then worked with Culver in Washington until \n     1972, when Clark went back to Iowa to run for the Senate.\n       A Harvard-educated Marine Corps veteran, Culver said he had \n     his own fascination with Africa as a young man in the 1960s. \n     But he remembered that era as a time of greater optimism, as \n     new countries across the continent were emerging from \n     colonial rule.\n       ``Dick came to it when there was less political reward,'' \n     Culver said. ``But he stuck to it.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/22/senate-section/article/S4697-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN STEVEN J. RAIRDON\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to take a minute to \nrecognize CPT Steve Rairdon of Leslie County, KY. Captain Rairdon is a \nmember of the 173rd Airborne Brigade and participated in commemorating \nthe 70th anniversary of the D-day invasion in Normandy, France, last \nmonth.\n  As an airborne soldier, Captain Rairdon understands the indispensable \nrole his predecessors--the first soldiers of their kind--played in the \nD-day invasion. In the earliest hours of June 6, 1944, Allied \nparatroopers dropped behind enemy lines in advance of the amphibious \ninvasion to disrupt German lines of communication and to secure key \nroads and bridges. The success of their mission proved vital to the \nsuccess of the invasion as a whole.\n  By participating in the 70th anniversary ceremonies, which included a \njump into Normandy, Captain Rairdon and all those who joined him paid a \nwonderful tribute to our veterans who fought 70 years ago. It is these \nacts of remembrance that continue to illuminate the unimaginable \nsacrifices made by the members of the ``greatest generation''. \nTherefore, I ask that my Senate colleagues join me in honoring Captain \nSteve Rairdon.\n  The Leslie County News recently published an article detailing \nCaptain Rairdon's time spent in Normandy. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n              [From the Leslie County News, July 3, 2014]\n\n Telling the American Military Story . . . One Service Member at a Time\n\n       Normandy, France.--Army Captain Steven J. Rairdon stands on \n     hallowed ground, as he and hundreds of other American service \n     members are here commemorating the 70th anniversary of the \n     Normandy D-day invasion in 1944 that changed the course of \n     World War II and history. ``Honoring our history, securing \n     our future'' is the reason the American service members are \n     here today. Rairdon is a member of C Company, 173rd Brigade \n     Support Battalion from Vicenza, Italy, and spent \n     approximately a week in the Normandy region, participating in \n     ceremonies and representing the Americans who fought here 70 \n     years ago.\n       ``I'm extremely honored to have been given the opportunity \n     to jump here. It's very humbling. I'm proud of our American \n     World War II veterans. They made great sacrifices for our \n     nation, and paved the way for today's airborne community. \n     Thank you to all of our veterans and their families for their \n     sacrifices they've made to keep our country and our NATO \n     allies free,'' Rairdon said.\n       Soldiers such as Rairdon remain indebted to the veterans \n     whose service demonstrated the selfless actions of the \n     ``greatest generation'' who not only served to protect and \n     defend our nation, but were part of a global force to defend \n     peace and strengthen our ties with an emerging Alliance. The \n     selfless actions by all allies on D-day continue to resonate \n     70 years later as U.S. forces in Europe remain steadfast in \n     our commitment to our European partners and NATO Allies.\n       Rairdon is the husband of Myra Sizemore Rairdon, a 1992 \n     graduate of Leslie County High School and the son-in-law of \n     former Leslie County Superintendent Tommy Sizemore of Hyden, \n     KY.

Adkinson III\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I wish to pay tribute to Army SGT Vinson \nB. ``Trinity'' Adkinson III. Sergeant Adkinson and three other soldiers \ndied August 31, 2010, when an improvised explosive device blew up next \nto their vehicle near Forward Operating Base Shank, Logar province, \nAfghanistan.\n  Known by family and friends as ``Trinity'' because he was the third \nVinson in his family, he was born on December 13, 1983, and grew up in \nEmpire City, OK, before moving in his junior year of high school to \nlive with an aunt in Kansas. His father recalled interest in the Armed \nForces was stoked early for Trinity as the first toys his son played \nwith were G.I. Joes.\n  ``He played army outside, he trick or treated as an armyman,'' \nAdkinson Jr. said. ``Me and him spent a lot of time outside in the \nwoods. He was born to be a soldier.'' Trinity enlisted in the Army \nimmediately after graduating from Chaparral High School in Harper, KS, \nin 2003.\n  He started his career with the 82nd Airborne Division followed by \nserving with the Honor Guard of the 4th Infantry Division. Later \nassigned to the 173rd Brigade Support Battalion, 173rd Airborne Brigade \nCombat Team based in Bamberg, Germany, Trinity served three tours in \nIraq and was on his second tour in Afghanistan.\n  ``I begged him not to go back,'' said grandmother Mary Adkinson after \nseeing her grandson earlier this year. She said he told her he needed \nto return to Afghanistan so that the people of that nation could have \npeace in their lives.\n  He was preceded in death by his grandfathers, Vinson Bryon Adkinson, \nSr., and Robert Allen Morgan, Sr., and is survived by his wife \nVeronica, father Vinson Bryon Adkinson, Jr., of Comanche, OK, brother \nJacob Aaron Adkinson of Stillwater, OK, sister\n\n[[Page S4698]]\n\nMary Kay Adkinson of Wichita, KS, his paternal grandmother Mary Ellen \nAdkinson of Duncan, OK, and maternal grandmother Sharon Kay Morgan of \nWichita, KS.\n  SGT David Shearouse served with Trinity and was given the task of \nescorting his remains home. ``He always wanted to take point, he wanted \nto be the leader,'' he said of his fallen comrade. ``Everybody wanted \nto be like him. He was a good man. I lost my friend, my brother and my \nhero.''\n  The family held a funeral service for Sergeant Adkinson on September \n13, 2010, and he was laid to rest with full military honors in Fort \nSill National Cemetery in Elgin, OK.\n  Today we remember Army SGT Vinson B. Adkinson III, a young man who \nloved his family and country and gave his life as a sacrifice for \nfreedom.\n\n\n                      Sergeant Jason L. McCluskey\n\n  Madam President, I would also like to pay tribute to SGT Jason L. \nMcCluskey. Jason was tragically killed in action on November 4, 2010, \nof wounds suffered when insurgents attacked his unit with small-arms \nfire in Zarghun Shahr, Mohammad Agha district of Afghanistan.\n  Jason was born September 12, 1984, to Jimmy and Delores ``Darby'' \nMcCluskey in Stockton, CA, and later moved to McAlester, OK. As a \nwrestler at McAlester High School he went to the State championship \ntournament several times before graduating in 2004. Quoting James Dean \nin his senior quote, he wrote: ``Dream as if you will live forever. And \nlive as if you will die today.''\n  Upon enlisting in the Army in April 2006, he was assigned as a \nparatrooper to the 27th Engineer Battalion, 20th Engineer Brigade, \nXVIII Airborne Corps, Fort Bragg, NC. ``SGT McCluskey was a true hero \nto us all,'' said 1SG Randolph Delapena, his company first sergeant. \n``He was like my son that I saw come up the ranks to become an elite \nnon-commissioned officer. He was the edge of the sword, he led from the \nfront, and he cared deep down for not only his Soldiers, but every \nSoldier he came in contact with.''\n  His mother, Delores Oliveras, said shortly after her son's death that \nJason was dedicated to serving in the Army. ``I asked him plenty of \ntimes to leave the Army,'' she said. ``But all he would say was, `No, \nMom, I really love what I do.' '' Shortly before his death, he was \nnamed his battalion's Noncommissioned Officer of the Year.\n  McCluskey is survived by his son Landon McCluskey, mother Delores \nDarby McCluskey Oliveras and her husband Ray, father Jimmy McCluskey, \nbrother Joshua Stambaugh, stepfather Charlie Stambaugh, grandmother \nAnita McCluskey, grandmother Wilma Kohl and her husband Doyle, mother \nof his son, Cassie Wright, and many aunts, uncles, cousins, nieces and \nnephews, as well as many other relatives, friends, and loved ones too \nnumerous to mention.\n  A funeral was held on November 12, 2010, at Chaney Harkins Funeral \nHome, and he was laid to rest in Tannehill Cemetery in McAlester, OK.\n  ``Our Army and nation will be forever indebted to SGT McCluskey for \nhis service,'' said Major General Rodney O. Anderson from Fort Bragg. \n``SGT McCluskey laid down his life for his friends, his battle buddies, \nhis unit, our Army and our nation.''\n  Today we remember Army SGT Jason L. McCluskey, a young man who loved \nhis family and country and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.\n\n\n                       Captain David J. Thompson\n\n  Madam President, I am also honoring the life and sacrifice of a true \nAmerican hero, Army CPT David J. Thompson. Captain Thompson died on \nJanuary 29, 2010, at Forward Operating Base Nunez, Afghanistan, of \ninjuries sustained while supporting combat operations.\n  Known as John Paul--JP for short--by many, he was born on May 25, \n1970, and listed Hooker, OK, as his home of record. In 1989 he enlisted \nin the Army and completed basic combat training and advanced individual \ntraining at Fort Jackson, SC.\n  John Paul served in a wide variety of jobs during his military \ncareer. His first assignment was as a radio telephone operator and team \nchief for the Regimental Signal Detachment, 75th Ranger Regiment and \ncommunications sergeant for the Regimental Reconnaissance Detachment \nwith the 75th Ranger Regiment, Fort Benning, GA. From 1995 to 1998, he \nserved in AK as a rifle squad leader and platoon sergeant with the 1st \nBattalion, 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment. He later served as a \nstaff noncommissioned officer with the Command Operations Center, U.S. \nArmy AK.\n  From January 1999 to May 2002, while attending East Carolina \nUniversity, he served with the 514th Military Police Company, NC Army \nNational Guard. In May 2002 he completed a bachelor of arts degree in \nchemistry and was commissioned as a chemical officer. Following his \nofficer basic course, he was assigned to 10th Mountain Division, Fort \nDrum, NY, as the division chemical logistics officer. In March 2003 he \nwas assigned to 1st Battalion, 87th Infantry Regiment and served as a \nbattle captain and rifle platoon leader for his first deployment \nsupporting Operation Enduring Freedom. Then, from June 2004 to November \n2005, he served as the battalion adjutant and rear detachment \ncommander. From August to December 2008 he served as executive officer \nfor Company C, 3rd Battalion, 3rd Special Forces Group (Airborne) and \nheld that position until taking command of Operational Detachment Alpha \n3334, Company C, 3rd Battalion, 3rd Special Forces Group, Fort Bragg, \nNC, in January 2009.\n  Captain Thompson was laid to rest with full military honors at \nArlington National Cemetery in Arlington, VA, on February 15, 2010.\n  John Paul is survived by his wife Emily and their two daughters, \nIsabelle and Abigail of Pinehurst, NC; parents Charles and Freida \nThompson of Hinton, OK; and sister Alisa Mueller.\n  Today we remember Army CPT David J.

Madam President. I wish to commemorate the 250th \nanniversary of the Town of Boothbay, ME. Boothbay was built with a \nspirit of determination and resiliency that still guides the community \ntoday, and this is a time to celebrate the generations of hard-working \nand caring people who have made it such a wonderful place to live, \nwork, and raise families.\n  The year of Boothbay's incorporation, 1764, was but one milestone in \na long journey of progress, a journey that is inextricably linked to \nthe sea. For thousands of years the Boothbay Peninsula was a fishing \ngrounds of the Etchemin Tribe, and the extensive shell middens and \nother archeological sites are today a treasure trove of this ancient \nhistory.\n  Drawn by one of the finest natural harbors in New England, English \nsettlement began within a few years of the Pilgrims landing at Plymouth \nin 1620. The early English influence is underscored by the fact that \nsome of the first deeds granted to the settlers were signed by the \nEtchemin Sagamore, who was called Chief Robinhood by the newcomers. By \n1764, Boothbay was a growing town with an economy driven by\n\n[[Page S4699]]\n\nfishing, shipbuilding, and tidal-powered sawmills. The wealth produced \nby the sea and by hard work was invested in schools and churches to \ncreate a true community.\n  Boothbay was a vital center for revolutionary activity during \nAmerica's fight for independence. The strategic importance of the \nharbor put the small town under frequent enemy attack, and more than \n100 patriots rose to its defense. During the war Captain Paul Reed \nestablished himself as one of our young nation's ablest and most \ncourageous naval commanders. The Reverend John Murray was an eloquent \nand fearless voice for freedom, and his powerful words called many to \nits cause.\n  In the decades that followed, Boothbay became a place of industry and \ninnovation with such endeavors as fish processing, canning, and fish-\noil production. During the 1830s, Boothbay's bracing sea breezes and \ncrystal-clear waters made it an early health spa, and by the end of the \n19th century the town became a favorite destination for vacationers and \nsummer residents.\n  Today the people of Boothbay continue to build on those traditions. \nFishing and lobstering are mainstays of the economy. Fine hotels, inns, \nand restaurants support a thriving tourism industry. Boatyards build \nluxury yachts, fishing boats, and advanced vessels for military and \nlaw-enforcement purposes. Since its founding in 1974, the Bigelow \nLaboratory for Ocean Sciences has become a global leader in \noceanographic research. Lobster boat races, the annual Windjammer Days, \nand the Fishermen's Festival celebrate the town's maritime heritage, \nand the restored Opera House provides a beautiful venue for arts and \nentertainment.\n  This 250th anniversary is not just about something that is measured \nin calendar years. It is about human accomplishment, an occasion to \ncelebrate the people who for more than two and a half centuries have \npulled together, cared for one another, and built a community. Thanks \nto those who came before, Boothbay has a wonderful history. Thanks to \nthose who are there today, it has a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/22/senate-section/article/S4699-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO GENERAL WILLIAM L. SHELTON\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I wish to recognize Gen. \nWilliam L. Shelton, commander of Air Force Space Command, on the \noccasion of his retirement from the U.S. Air Force.\n  Over the course of his 38-year career in the U.S. Air Force, General \nShelton has served with great distinction and made countless sacrifices \nfor our country. I join with all Coloradans in commending his service, \nthe sacrifices of his family--including his wife Linda and their two \nchildren, Sara and Joel--and I offer my great personal appreciation for \nhis leadership and devotion to our Nation's security.\n  A graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy, General Shelton's selection \nas the commander of Air Force Space Command in January 2011 culminates \na distinguished career that began in 1976 at the Space and Missile Test \nCenter at Vandenberg Air Force Base, CA. In a career dedicated to the \nspace enterprise, he commanded units at Falcon-Schriever, F.E. Warren, \nOffutt, Vandenberg, and Peterson Air Force Bases. He also provided \nvaluable leadership and counsel to the Secretary of the Air Force, the \nChief of Staff of the Air Force, and the Joint Staff during multiple \nheadquarters U.S. Air Force assignments. His positive leadership had a \ndirect and positive impact on countless men and women in our Armed \nForces, and his legacy will benefit the United States and our space \npolicy for generations to come.\n  Throughout his career, General Shelton has been a vigilant advocate \nfor our national security space programs. As the commander of Air Force \nSpace Command, he was responsible for organizing, training and \nequipping more than 40,000 military and civilian personnel to assure \nspace and cyberspace capabilities for the combatant commands and for \nthe Nation. While those capabilities clearly contribute to our \nmilitary's technological and strategic superiority, they also have \nbecome essential in humanitarian and disaster relief efforts--and they \nare now vital assets for the global community and world economy. As a \nresult of his leadership, the Air Force has established a truly \nimpressive record of successful space launches while developing an \nacquisition regime that has led to greater mission assurance and \nsimultaneous cost savings across the Department of Defense. Further, \nhis vision of future space capabilities will position the military to \nprovide resilient, capable, and affordable space operations for the \njoint forces and the Nation well into the future.\n  General Shelton established and sustained an unmatched level of \nsuccess during a time of increasing challenges. He has worked closely \nwith the Senate Armed Services Committee, and the Subcommittee on \nStrategic Forces, which I am proud to chair. It has been our great \nprivilege to work with him. His frank and informed discussions of our \nspace systems, including the global positioning satellite system, have \nhelped leaders and citizens around the world appreciate the value and \nneed to protect our Nation's foundational space capabilities. I am \npersonally grateful for General Shelton's wise counsel and firm resolve \nto always do what is best for the Nation and for the airmen he has led. \nHe is a leader of exceptional intellect, candor, and integrity, and his \ndeeply held commitment to doing the right thing for the right reasons \nis clear to all who have been fortunate enough to work with him.\n  With nearly four decades of exemplary service to our Nation, Gen. \nWilliam L. Shelton deserves our most heartfelt gratitude and praise. He \nand his family have my very best wishes for a long, happy, and well-\ndeserved retirement. Our Nation and our Air Force are better for his \nleadership and distinguished service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/22/senate-section/article/S4699-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4699-S4700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          HOWARD COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State. And it has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful farm bills. But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Howard County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to successfully acquire financial assistance from \nprograms I have fought hard to support, which have provided more than \n$12.4 million to the local economy.\n  Of course my favorite memories of working together have to include \ntheir tremendous success in obtaining funds from a variety of programs \nI fought for including farm bill funding, public safety programs, and \nfirefighter safety equipment.\n  Among the highlights:\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal\n\n[[Page S4700]]\n\ndollars have served as the needed incentive to leverage local public \nand private dollars, so it often has a tremendous multiplier effect \nwithin a school district. Over the years, Howard County has received \n$91,360 in Harkin grants. Similarly, schools in Howard County have \nreceived funds that I designated for Iowa Star Schools for technology \ntotaling $35,000.\n  Disaster mitigation and prevention: In 1993, when historic floods \nripped through Iowa, it became clear to me that the national emergency-\nresponse infrastructure was woefully inadequate to meet the needs of \nIowans in flood-ravaged communities. I went to work dramatically \nexpanding the Federal Emergency Management Agency's hazard mitigation \nprogram, which helps communities reduce the loss of life and property \ndue to natural disasters and enables mitigation measures to be \nimplemented during the immediate recovery period. Disaster relief means \nmore than helping people and businesses get back on their feet after a \ndisaster, it means doing our best to prevent the same predictable flood \nor other catastrophe from recurring in the future. The hazard \nmitigation program that I helped create in 1993 provided critical \nsupport to Iowa communities impacted by the devastating floods of 2008. \nHoward County has received over $2.7 million to remediate and prevent \nwidespread destruction from natural disasters.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Howard County has received more than $7.6 \nmillion from a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as \nthe methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Howard County's fire \ndepartments have received over $1.5 million for firefighter safety and \noperations equipment and over $337,000 in public safety dollars.\n  Disability rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf. But I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, and the \nADA Amendments Act, I have had four guiding goals for our fellow \ncitizens with disabilities: equal opportunity, full participation, \nindependent living and economic self-sufficiency. Nearly a quarter \ncentury since passage of the ADA, I see remarkable changes in \ncommunities everywhere I go in Iowa--not just in curb cuts or closed \ncaptioned television, but in the full participation of people with \ndisabilities in our society and economy, folks who at long last have \nthe opportunity to contribute their talents and to be fully included. \nThese changes have increased economic opportunities for all citizens of \nHoward County, both those with and without disabilities. And they make \nus proud to be a part of a community and country that respects the \nworth and civil rights of all of our citizens.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Howard County, during my time in Congress. In every \ncase, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in Howard \nCounty, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives. And, of course, \nthis work is never complete. Even after I retire from the Senate, I \nhave no intention of retiring from the fight for a better, fairer, \nricher Iowa. I will always be profoundly grateful for the opportunity \nto serve the people of Iowa as their Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/22/senate-section/article/S4700-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4700-S4701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WRIGHT COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging the United \n     States Department of Veterans Affairs to follow Federal \n     Housing Administration guidelines as they apply to site \n     condominiums and view them as single-family homes as long as \n     they meet certain criteria; to the Committee on Banking, \n     Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 371\n\n       Whereas, Financing condominium ownership using government-\n     backed loans is challenging. Traditional condominium units \n     can be riskier for lenders because of the rights afforded to \n     condominium associations, how associations are structured, \n     and deed restrictions. This has made loans backed by the \n     Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and Department of \n     Veterans Affairs (VA) difficult to obtain unless the \n     condominium development meets occupancy requirements and is \n     approved by the agency; and\n       Whereas, Site condominiums are single-family condominium \n     developments that have the benefit of reducing some lending \n     risks. Here, condominium units are stand-alone structures \n     similar to single-family dwellings where owners are \n     responsible for the upkeep of the entire structure rather \n     than the interior alone and the association is responsible \n     for maintaining the grounds; and\n       Whereas, In 2009, the FHA began allowing site condominium \n     buyers in certain non-approved condominium developments to \n     receive FHA financing so long as the development met certain \n     criteria. This included requiring each unit to be a detached \n     single-family unit where the entire structure is considered \n     the condominium unit. The unit owner is also responsible for \n     all insurance and maintenance costs of the structure; and\n       Whereas, The VA has not yet adopted a similar policy. The \n     FHA's site condominium policy has been beneficial to low- and \n     medium-income home buyers and would be beneficial to veterans \n     as well. Allowing VA-backed loans to finance site \n     condominiums ownership without needing condominium \n     developments to be approved by the agency will help connect \n     elderly and disabled veterans unable to perform day-to-day \n     property maintenance with affordable housing in desirable \n     neighborhoods: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we urge the \n     U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to follow Federal Housing \n     Administration guidelines as they apply to site\n\n[[Page S4704]]\n\n     condominiums and view them as single-family homes as long as \n     they meet certain criteria; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-318. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan condemning certain \n     individuals for their violent attacks on civilian targets in \n     Nigeria, and supporting efforts by the President of the \n     United States and the United States Congress to assist the \n     Nigerian government in the safe return of the abducted women \n     and girls in Nigeria, to prevent further attacks, and to \n     promote the human rights of women and girls in Nigeria; to \n     the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 396\n\n       Whereas, Boko Haram is an acknowledged militant, terrorist \n     organization. Since 2011, it has claimed responsibility for a \n     series of bombings, killing nearly 4,000 innocent people in \n     Nigeria It has targeted schools, mosques, churches, villages, \n     agricultural centers, and government facilities in its \n     escalating armed campaign to create an Islamic state in \n     northern Nigeria: and\n       Whereas, On April 14, Boko Haram abducted at gunpoint 276 \n     teenage girls from the Government Girls Secondary School in \n     the Federal Republic of Nigeria. While as least 53 girls \n     immediately escaped, the remaining girls remain missing. Boko \n     Haram has a history of kidnapping girls in the past for use \n     as cooks and sex slaves, and there are reports that the \n     abducted girls have been sold as brides to Islamist militants \n     for the equivalent of $12 each: and\n       Whereas, In support of the Nigerian government, the United \n     States dispatched drones over Nigeria to search for the \n     abducted girls and deployed 80 soldiers to guard the drone \n     base in nearby Chad. Other nations have also pledged support \n     to help safely bring back the abducted girls. Despite these \n     cooperative efforts, the abducted girls remain missing, and \n     on June 9, Boko Haram abducted at least 20 additional women \n     and girls from a village just miles from the earlier \n     incident: and\n       Whereas, Boko Haram's increasingly bold attacks must be \n     countered by a strong initiative to recover the abducted \n     women and girls and prevent future attacks. This extremist \n     group represents a growing threat to peace and stability in \n     this region and to the United States' interests in this \n     region. There are legitimate fears that Boko Haram may be \n     emboldened to carry out attacks against Western targets, such \n     as the U.S. Embassy and hotels frequented by Westerners: Now, \n     therefore be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we condemn \n     Boko Haram for its violent attacks on civilian targets in \n     Nigeria and call for the immediate, safe return of the women \n     and girls abducted by them: and be it further\n       Resolved, That we express strong support for the people of \n     Nigeria, especially the parents and families of the abducted \n     women and girls, and encourage the Nigerian government to \n     strengthen efforts that protect children seeking to obtain an \n     education and to hold those who conduct violent acts against \n     them accountable; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we support offers of United States \n     assistance to the Nigerian government in the search for the \n     abducted women and girls and courage the U.S. Department of \n     State and the United States Agency for International \n     Development to continue support for initiatives that promote \n     the human rights of women and girls in Nigeria; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That we support our nation's efforts to hold \n     terrorist organizations, such as Boko Haram, accountable and \n     urge the President of the United States to provide a \n     comprehensive strategy to counter the growing threat posed by \n     radical Islamist terrorist groups in West Africa, the Sahel, \n     and North Africa; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-319. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan memorializing the \n     United States Congress to take such actions as are necessary \n     to pass the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act of \n     2013; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n     Pensions.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 388\n\n       Whereas, According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, mental illness is defined as ``health conditions \n     that are characterized by alterations in thinking, mood, or \n     behavior (or some combination thereof) associated with \n     distress and/or impaired function.'' The National Institute \n     of Mental Health states, ``While mental disorders are common \n     in the United States, the burden of illness is particularly \n     concentrated among those who experience disability due to \n     serious mental illness (SMI)''; and\n       Whereas, In a given year, approximately ten million \n     Americans experience serious mental illness, such as \n     schizophrenia, major depression, or bipolar disorder. \n     Furthermore, approximately four million Americans \n     experiencing serious mental illness do not receive treatment \n     in a given year. Laws, regulations, and misinterpretations \n     frequently shut out families attempting to get effective \n     appropriate treatment for their loved ones in a mental health \n     crisis; and\n       Whereas, There are ten times more individuals with serious \n     mental illness in jails and prisons than in state psychiatric \n     hospitals. Federal laws and billing policies restrict the \n     ability of persons on Medicaid to receive high-quality \n     inpatient and outpatient mental health treatment; and\n       Whereas, Current spending needs to be more focused on the \n     most effective services and most severe mental illnesses. \n     United States Congressman Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania has \n     introduced the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act \n     of 2013 (H.R. 3717). The act would create a new Assistant \n     Secretary for Mental Health and Substance-Abuse Disorders to \n     coordinate funding between agencies, collect increased data \n     on treatment outcomes, and drive evidence-based care. To \n     address issues regarding the shortage of psychiatric \n     professionals, the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis \n     Act of 2013 would advance alternatives to inpatient care and \n     prioritize early intervention: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to pass the Helping Families in Mental \n     Crisis Act of 2013; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n                                  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/22/senate-section/article/S4704-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4704]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. TESTER, from the Committee on Indian Affairs:\n       Report to accompany S. 1219, a bill to authorize the \n     Pechanga Band of Luiseno Mission Indians Water Rights \n     Settlement, and for other purposes (Rept.

A bill to modify the small business intermediary lending \nprogram; to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Small Business \nIntermediary Lending Program Act of 2014.\n  This bill would make permanent a successful small business financing \nprogram which provides startups and growing small businesses with \naccess to capital. As a long-time member of the Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship Committee, I have been a strong supporter of efforts \nto help small firms expand and thrive so they can create jobs and grow \nthe economy.\n  The need for creative and effective ways to expand access to capital \nfor small businesses is greater than ever. According to a study issued \nby the Brookings Institute in May, entrepreneurship is experiencing a \ntroubling decline in the United States, a trend the authors document \nover the last 30 years, across all 50 States and almost all \nmetropolitan areas. They conclude that we need to pursue policies that \nbetter foster entrepreneurship if we want to create more jobs.\n  One way we can foster entrepreneurship and address the lingering \nunemployment affecting so many of our communities is to make permanent \nthe Small Business Intermediary Lending Pilot Program.\n  I proposed and helped enact the Intermediary Lending Pilot Program \ninto law in 2010. Over the last three years, the program has provided \nloans of $1 million to nonprofit intermediary lenders to make small to \nmid-sized loans to small businesses. The program gets financing to \nsmall businesses that are not being served by banks or conventional \nloan programs currently available through the Small Business \nAdministration. Small businesses seeking this flexible debt financing \nmay have graduated from the Small Business Administration's Microloan \nProgram, and for a variety of reasons, especially lack of adequate \ncollateral, do not qualify for guaranteed 7(a) loans or other private \ncapital.\n  Given the slow economic recovery, high demand exists for the \nIntermediary Lending Pilot Program. In the short life of the program, \nintermediaries in 20 States across the country have already made more \nthan 300 small business loans, totaling more than $26 million. If not \nfor the Intermediary Lending Pilot Program, the small businesses \nreceiving these loans would have been hard-pressed to find this \nfinancing elsewhere. Almost 90 percent of the loans were in the \n$50,000-$200,000 range, making these loans larger than microloans. The \naverage loan size in the pilot has been about $88,000.\n  The loans facilitated by the Intermediary Lending Program have done \nmore than help small businesses; they have created or retained \nthousands of jobs. Building on this success and keeping the program \ngoing will strengthen our economy, get small businesses sorely-needed \ncapital, and catalyze job creation.\n  Merit Hall, a full service staffing firm located in downtown Detroit, \nprovides services and staffing to construction, landscape and facility \nmaintenance contractors throughout southeastern Michigan. In 2013, \nMerit Hall received a $200,000 ILP loan to support the company's \ngrowth. Merit Hall used those funds to retain and create 10 office jobs \nand 300 jobs in the field. In addition, this loan allowed Merit Hall to \ngrow their revenues to the point where they were bankable and were able \nto receive a $350,000 loan from a commercial bank and pay off their ILP \nloan.\n  Rubber Technologies of Coleman, Michigan, recycles tires to create \npremium recycled products such as playground surfacing and rubber mats. \nThe Intermediary Lending Program loan they received will help \nstrengthen their business, allowing them to add\n\n[[Page S4708]]\n\nequipment and retain 12 jobs. Roaming Harvest, a small business in \nTraverse City, Michigan, started out as a food truck and now thanks to \na loan from the Intermediary Pilot program has opened a cafe featuring \nlocal food, retaining two jobs and creating two new jobs.\n  These small loans can add up. An intermediary lender in the state of \nWashington, Craft3, has already made 34 loans through the program and \ncreated 98 jobs as a result.\n  Intermediary lenders do more than provide loans; they provide \ntechnical assistance and counseling which often does not accompany \nconventional loans, helping business owners start and grow successful \nenterprises.\n  The Intermediary Lending Program is modeled after the U.S. Department \nof Agriculture's Rural Development Loan Program, which has existed \nsince 1988. Like the USDA program, this SBA counterpart is a \ndecentralized initiative relying on the capacity and market expertise \nof local, nonprofit intermediary lenders, but it expands this approach, \nserving both rural and urban areas.\n  The legislation I am introducing today makes the Intermediary Lending \nProgram permanent and authorizes a funding level of $20 million for \neach of the next three fiscal years. The legislation authorizes \nnonprofit lending intermediaries, chosen on a competitive basis, to \nparticipate in the program. As in the pilot, each intermediary will \nreceive a loan of up to $1 million at a low interest rate to create a \nrevolving loan fund through which they will make small business loans.\n  The nonprofit lenders who participate in this program already tap a \nvariety of financing programs to meet the needs of the small businesses \nin their states and localities. SBA has observed that one of the \nbenefits of the Intermediary Lending Program as compared to the \nMicroloan Program is the longer repayment term, 20 years versus 10 \nyears, respectively. This patient capital helps to facilitate larger \nloans that some businesses need, up to $200,000, and it allows the \nrevolving loan fund to revolve about 2.5 times before the intermediary \nfully repays the initial SBA loan.\n  In addition to authorizing the program, this bill makes a technical \ncorrection to the language of the pilot program. While the pilot \nprogram limited the amount that an intermediary can borrow under the \nIntermediary Lending Program to $1 million, it did not intend to take \ninto account money an intermediary borrowed through other SBA programs. \nUnfortunately, SBA interpreted the language in a way that placed an \noverall cap on how much a participating intermediary can borrow from \nthe SBA under all SBA programs. The result was that more experienced \nlenders with higher loan volumes, especially many strong microlenders, \nwere unable to participate. That was simply not the intent of Congress. \nRather, this program was designed to complement the microloan and 7(a) \nprograms and add another tool to the portfolio of nonprofit community-\nbased lenders. The bill I am introducing today changes the language to \nclarify our intent, maintains the $1 million loan limit, and increases \nthe overall amount intermediaries can have outstanding from SBA under \nthe Intermediary Lending Program to $5 million.\n  The Intermediary Lending Program is a small program which has already \nmade a big difference. It is modeled on a program which has been \noperating successfully for almost 30 years, and it shields the \ngovernment from any risks involved in lending to small businesses by \nhaving experienced intermediaries take on that risk. As we all look for \nways to bolster our economy, we should build on this record of success. \nThe Intermediary Lending Pilot is addressing a lending gap and helping \ncreate jobs across the nation. If we adopt my legislation, this program \nwill continue to be an engine for small business growth. I urge its \nswift enactment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 2641. A bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act to provide that \nresidential mortgage loans held in portfolio qualify and qualified \nmortgages for purposes of the presumption of the ability to repay \nrequirements under such Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss the \nimportance of community banks to our financial system and economy. \nCommunity banks are critical to the economic recovery and success of \nour local economies and small businesses. As our Nation continues to \nrecover from the worst recession since the Great Depression, we need to \ndo everything possible to provide measured, targeted regulatory relief \nfor community banks, who were not part of the problem during the \nfinancial crisis.\n  America's nearly 7,000 community banks are the primary source of \nlending for our Nation's small businesses and farms. Though they \ncompose just 10 percent of the banking industry by assets, community \nbanks make over 57 percent of outstanding bank loans to small \nbusinesses. In Louisiana, we have approximately 140 community banks. \nThese institutions are vital parts of their local communities; their \nboards are often made up of local citizens who are personally invested \nin advancing the interests of the towns and cities in which they live.\n  Today I am offering a very simple, common sense provision that would \ncut back on some of the onerous regulations community banks are facing \nwithout compromising the safety and soundness of our financial system \nor important consumer protections. The Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau, CFPB, released its final rule on consumers' ability to repay \nmortgage loans under Dodd-Frank in January 2013. The final rule, \nimplemented in 2014, defines the qualities of a ``qualified mortgage'', \nQM, which presume that the lender has satisfied the ability to repay \nrequirements. While I was encouraged by many aspects of the rules, I \nfeel there is more to be done to ensure that community banks and Main \nStreet lenders are not stifled by onerous regulations.\n  My bill will allow any residential mortgage held in portfolio by \nlenders with less than $10 billion in total assets to qualify as a \n``qualified mortgage.'' A strong indication of a bank's view of the \ncredit risk of a loan is the decision to hold a loan in portfolio. When \na bank holds a loan in portfolio, rather than selling in on the \nsecondary market, it assumes 100 percent of the credit risk, so it has \nthe incentive to ensure that each and every loan is well underwritten \nand affordable to the borrower. Community banks are in the business of \nknowing their borrowers, understanding their ability to repay and \nstructuring loans accordingly. This protects the financial health of \nborrowers, lenders, and the economy as a whole.\n  I am proud to also serve as a cosponsor of S. 1349, the Community \nLending Enhancement and Regulatory, CLEAR, Relief Act, which was \nintroduced by my colleagues, Senators Moran and Tester and contains a \nnumber of other regulatory relief measures for small and community-\nbased lenders. I encourage my colleagues to support these provisions to \nhelp community banks serve their customers, protecting the well-being \nof borrowers, and spur economic growth in local communities across the \nNation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Ms. Warren, and Mr. Brown):\n  S. 2642. A bill to permit employees to request changes to their work \nschedules without fear of retaliation, and to ensure that employers \nconsider these requests; and to require employers to provide more \npredictable and stable schedules for employees in certain growing low-\nwage occupations, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to bring to our attention a large \nand growing problem laced by American workers today that has negative \nconsequences for working families and our national economy. They are \nhourly service workers holding jobs that we all rely on--the folks who \nare serving customers in stores and restaurants, who are cleaning our \noffices and hotels, who are making sure that shelves are stocked, food \nis cooked properly, and businesses run smoothly. They are also white \ncollar workers: professionals, managers, teachers, and more. All of \nthese workers want to go to work and be successful at their jobs. But \ntoday, too many do not have access to one of\n\n[[Page S4709]]\n\nthe most basic parts of a job: a stable, predictable schedule.\n  For hourly service workers, jobs are often scheduled on a ``just in \ntime'' basis. This means that schedules are given out last minute, \nworkers are often required to be on call, and schedules and the number \nof assigned hours vary week to week and month to month. Schedules are \noften made with no input from workers or consideration for family needs \nor even sleep time. A worker may have 8 hours of work one week, 24 \nhours the next week, and no hours for the next two weeks. A worker may \nhave the night shift followed by the day shift, or a split shift with a \nfew hours in the morning and a few more hours in the evening. A worker \nmay show up after arranging and paying for child care and taking a 2 \nhour trip by public transportation, only to be sent home for lack of \nwork. Assigned time on schedules is a perk, while being left off the \nschedule is a punishment.\n  These abusive scheduling practices mean that workers often can't \npredict their income, which makes it very difficult to budget and pay \nbills. It also wreaks havoc on family life. Working parents can't be \nhome for family dinner, help with afternoon homework, or put kids to \nbed. Workers with elderly parents or relatives who are in need of care \ncannot be available when they are needed. And the inability to predict \na schedule means that taking classes or getting a second job to further \none's career or increase income become difficult to impossible. And \nyet, because these practices have become so common among hourly service \njobs, moving to a different job is not an option. Workers are simply \nstuck.\n  Meanwhile, white collar workers are working longer than ever. They \nhave to stay late long into the night and come in on the weekends. If \nthey want a 40-hour workweek or time with family, they are too often \ncriticized as uncommitted to the job. They, too, miss family dinners \nand other family events. They, too, are unable to be with children or \nelders when their care is required.\n  What these workers have in common is their lack of control over their \nhours and their schedules. That is why I have joined with Senator \nWarren and Representatives George Miller and Rosa DeLauro to introduce \nthe ``Schedules That Work Act.'' This bill will help workers to meet \nscheduling challenges in ways that respect their needs and the needs of \nbusinesses.\n  First, the bill will allow all workers, both hourly and salaried in \nany job or industry, to make requests about their schedules, and it \nwill prohibit retaliation against them for doing so. Employers will be \nrequired to engage in an interactive process in response to scheduling \nrequests--much like that required to determine reasonable \naccommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act. An employer \nhas to consider a request, consider alternatives, and provide an answer \nto a worker's request. Certain requests will have some extra \nconsideration: if an employee makes a request because of caregiving \nduties, to deal with a serious health condition, to take a career-\nrelated training or education course, or to meet the demands of a \nsecond job in the case of part-time workers, then an employer must have \na bona fide business reason to deny the request. This ``right to \nrequest'' will open a line of communication that ensures workers have a \nvoice but respects employers' business needs.\n  Second, the Schedules That Work Act will ensure that workers in \nretail, food service, and janitorial and cleaning jobs are paid when \nthey are required to report in or be on call. If a worker is scheduled \nfor at least four hours and reports to work, the worker must be paid \nfor at least four hours, even if she is sent home early. An employer \nwill have to provide an extra hour's pay if he requires an employee to \nbe on call. If an employer schedules a ``split shift''--with non-\nconsecutive shifts within a single day--a worker will earn an extra \nhour's pay.\n  Finally, this bill will require 2 weeks' advance notice of schedules \nfor workers in retail, food service, and janitorial jobs. If changes \nare made with less than 24 hours' notice, employers will be required to \nprovide an extra hour's pay. While employers can continue to make \nchanges to schedules, we hope that this requirement will reduce the \nchaos that can be created by continual last-minute scheduling.\n  A schedule should be a basic part of almost any job. Predictability \nand stability in hours helps workers meet their personal and family \ndemands. In turn, workers are more likely to stay in their jobs, \nreducing the expensive turnover that can cost businesses dearly A \nsimple consideration like advance notice of a schedule goes a long way \ntoward creating good will, fostering loyalty, and raising morale among \nemployees.\n  What this bill is really about, at its heart, is respect. Respect for \nworkers' lives and businesses' needs. I encourage all of my Senate \ncolleagues to join me on this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2642\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Schedules \n     That Work Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The vast majority of the United States workforce today \n     is juggling responsibilities at home and at work. Women are \n     primary breadwinners or co-breadwinners in 63 percent of \n     families in the United States and 26 percent of families with \n     children are headed by single mothers.\n       (2) Despite the dual responsibilities of today's workforce, \n     workers across the income spectrum have very little ability \n     to make changes to their work schedules when those changes \n     are needed to accommodate family responsibilities. Only 27 \n     percent of employers allow all or most of their employees to \n     periodically change their starting and quitting times.\n       (3) Although low-wage workers are most likely to be raising \n     children on their own, as more than half of mothers of young \n     children in low-wage jobs are doing, low-wage workers have \n     the least control over their work schedules and the most \n     unpredictable schedules. For example--\n       (A) roughly half of low-wage workers reported very little \n     or no control over the timing of the hours they were \n     scheduled to work;\n       (B) many workers in low-wage jobs receive their schedules \n     with very little advance notice and have work hours that vary \n     significantly from week to week or month to month;\n       (C) some workers in low-wage jobs are sent home from work \n     when work is slow without being paid for their scheduled \n     shift;\n       (D) in some industries, the use of ``call-in shift'' \n     requirements--requirements that workers call in to work to \n     find out whether they will be scheduled to work later that \n     day--has become common practice; and\n       (E) at the same time, 20 to 30 percent of workers in low-\n     wage jobs struggle with being required to work extra hours \n     with little or no notice.\n       (4) Unfair work scheduling practices make it difficult for \n     low-wage workers to--\n       (A) provide necessary care for children and other family \n     members, including arranging child care;\n       (B) qualify for and maintain eligibility for child care \n     subsidies, due to fluctuations in income and work hours, or \n     keep an appointment with a child care provider, due to not \n     knowing how many hours or when the workers will be scheduled \n     to work;\n       (C) pursue workforce training;\n       (D) get or keep a second job that some part-time workers \n     need to make ends meet; and\n       (E) arrange transportation to and from work.\n       (5) Unpredictable and unstable schedules are prevalent in \n     retail sales, food preparation and service, and building \n     cleaning occupations, which are among the lowest-paid and \n     fastest-growing occupations in the workforce today. For \n     workers in those occupations, often difficult and sometimes \n     abusive work scheduling practices combine with very low wages \n     to make it extremely challenging to make ends meet.\n       (6) Retail sales, food preparation and service, and \n     building cleaning occupations are among those most likely to \n     have unpredictable and unstable schedules. According to data \n     from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 66 percent of food \n     service workers, 52 percent of retail workers, and 40 percent \n     of janitors and housekeepers know their schedules only a week \n     or less in advance. The average variation in work hours in a \n     single month is 70 percent for food service workers, 50 \n     percent for retail workers, and 40 percent for janitors and \n     housekeepers.\n       (7) Those are among the lowest-paid and fastest-growing \n     occupations, accounting for 18 percent of workers in the \n     economy, some 23,500,000 workers. The median pay for workers \n     in those 3 occupations is between $9.15 and $10.44 per hour, \n     and women make up more than half of the workers in those \n     occupations.\n       (8) Employers that have implemented fair work scheduling \n     policies that allow workers\n\n[[Page S4710]]\n\n     to have more control over their work schedules, and provide \n     more predictable and stable schedules, have experienced \n     significant benefits, including reductions in absenteeism and \n     workforce turnover, and increased employee morale and \n     engagement.\n       (9) This Act is a first step in responding to the needs of \n     workers for a voice in the timing of their work hours and for \n     more predictable schedules.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this Act:\n       (1) Bona fide business reason.--The term ``bona fide \n     business reason'' means--\n       (A) the identifiable burden of additional costs to an \n     employer, including the cost of productivity loss, retraining \n     or hiring employees, or transferring employees from one \n     facility to another facility;\n       (B) a significant detrimental effect on the employer's \n     ability to meet organizational needs or customer demand;\n       (C) a significant inability of the employer, despite best \n     efforts, to reorganize work among existing (as of the date of \n     the reorganization) staff;\n       (D) a significant detrimental effect on business \n     performance;\n       (E) insufficiency of work during the periods an employee \n     proposes to work;\n       (F) the need to balance competing scheduling requests when \n     it is not possible to grant all such requests without a \n     significant detrimental effect on the employer's ability to \n     meet organizational needs; or\n       (G) such other reason as may be specified by the Secretary \n     of Labor (or the corresponding administrative officer \n     specified in section 8).\n       (2) Career-related educational or training program.--The \n     term ``career-related educational or training program'' means \n     an educational or training program or program of study \n     offered by a public, private, or nonprofit career and \n     technical education school, institution of higher education, \n     or other entity that provides academic education, career and \n     technical education, or training (including remedial \n     education or English as a second language, as appropriate), \n     that is a program that leads to a recognized postsecondary \n     credential (as identified under section 122(d) of the \n     Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act), and provides \n     career awareness information.

Perkins Career and Technical \n     Education Act of 2006 (20 U.S.C. 2301 et seq.), or the Higher \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.), without \n     regard to whether or not the program is funded under the \n     corresponding Act.\n       (3) Caregiver.--The term ``caregiver'' means an individual \n     with the status of being a significant provider of--\n       (A) ongoing care or education, including responsibility for \n     securing the ongoing care or education, of a child; or\n       (B) ongoing care, including responsibility for securing the \n     ongoing care, of--\n       (i) a person with a serious health condition who is in a \n     family relationship with the individual; or\n       (ii) a parent of the individual, who is age 65 or older.\n       (4) Child.--The term ``child'' means a biological, adopted, \n     or foster child, a stepchild, a legal ward, or a child of a \n     person standing in loco parentis to that child, who is--\n       (A) under age 18; or\n       (B) age 18 or older and incapable of self-care because of a \n     mental or physical disability.\n       (5) Covered employer.--\n       (A) In general.--The term ``covered employer''--\n       (i) means any person engaged in commerce or in any industry \n     or activity affecting commerce who employs 15 or more \n     employees (described in paragraph (7)(A));\n       (ii) includes any person who acts, directly or indirectly, \n     in the interest of such an employer to any of the employees \n     (described in paragraph (7)(A)) of such employer;\n       (iii) includes any successor in interest of such an \n     employer;

A bill to require a report by the Federal Communications \nCommission on designated market areas; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Let Our \nCommunities Access Local TV Act, or the LOCAL TV Act.\n  I am pleased that I've had the opportunity to collaborate with my \nfriend and colleague, Senator Fischer, and I know we both look forward \nto working with our fellow colleagues on the Commerce, Science and \nTransportation Committee to see that this legislation is enacted.\n  The LOCAL TV Act directs the Federal Communications Commission to \nstudy the impact of media market areas and to assess their impact on \nthe ability of individuals to receive relevant, local news and \ninformation.\n  The current structure of media markets is one in which market areas \ncan sprawl across State lines, creating situations in which you can \nlive in one State, but be exclusively saddled in the media market of \nanother.\n  My state of New Jersey is particularly affected by this situation \nbecause\n\n[[Page S4714]]\n\nit is one of only two States in the entire Nation that is served \nexclusively by out-of-state media markets. We are served by New York \nand Pennsylvania--both great places but not New Jersey.\n  Why does this matter? When someone in Patterson, Freehold, or Cape \nMay, New Jersey turns on their local broadcast station--they are lucky \nwhen they find stories about their community's latest news, schools, \nand our local governments. This kind of New Jersey news, unfortunately, \ntakes a back seat to that of neighboring Philadelphia and New York.\n  These pre-determined media markets often stifle our ability to hear \nabout what's happening back home. We hear more about Philadelphia and \nNew York City than we do about Morristown, Montclair, Camden and Jersey \nCity.\n  To be sure, broadcast TV plays an important role in communities. It \nis particularly essential during emergencies and extreme weather \nevents--for instance during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Even while \ntechnology continues to grow and change the way we receive information, \nstill 74 percent of adults get their news from their local broadcast \nstations, or from their broadcasters' websites.\n  Because of the existing digital divide, the number of people who rely \non broadcast television is even higher when we look at low income \ncommunities. We owe them quality coverage of the local news and \ninformation they care about.\n  It is my hope that with further study and recommendations from the \nFederal Communications Commission we can continue the dialogue on how \nstations can best serve local communities, especially those who find \nthemselves in media markets that cross state lines. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the LOCAL TV ACT so that we can obtain more data \nand information on these markets.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/22/senate-section/article/S4714-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 510--CONGRATULATING THE NEWPORT JAZZ FESTIVAL ON ITS \n                            60TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Whitehouse) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Johnson, \n     founder of Black Entertainment Television (commonly known as \n     ``BET'') and of The RLJ Companies, and based on the Rooney \n     Rule from the NFL, similarly encourages companies to \n     voluntarily establish a best practices policy to identify \n     minority candidates and minority vendors by implementing a \n     plan to interview a minimum of 2 qualified minority \n     candidates for managerial openings at the director level and \n     above and to interview at least 2 qualified minority \n     businesses before approving a vendor contract;\n       Whereas, according to Crist-Kolder Associates as cited in \n     the Wall Street Journal, at the top 668 companies in the \n     United States, only 27 Chief Financial Officers are African-\n     American, Hispanic, or of Asian descent;\n       Whereas underrepresented groups contain members with the \n     necessary abilities, experience, and qualifications for any \n     position available;\n       Whereas business practices such as the Rooney Rule or the \n     RLJ Rule are neither an employment quota nor Federal law but \n     rather a voluntary initiative instituted by willing entities \n     to provide the human resources necessary to ensure success;\n       Whereas experience has shown that people of all genders, \n     colors, and physical abilities can achieve excellence;\n       Whereas increased involvement of underrepresented workers \n     would improve the economy of the United States and the \n     experience of the people of the United States; and\n       Whereas ensuring the increased exposure and resulting \n     increased advancement of diverse qualified candidates would \n     result in gains by all people of the United States through \n     stronger economic opportunities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate encourages corporate, academic, \n     and social entities, regardless of size or field of \n     operation, to--\n       (1) develop an internal rule modeled after a successful \n     business practice such as the Rooney Rule or RLJ Rule and, in \n     accordance with title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 \n     U.S.C. 2000e et seq.), adapt that rule to specifications that \n     will best fit the procedures of the individual entity; and\n       (2) institute the individualized Rooney Rule or RLJ Rule to \n     ensure that the entity will always consider candidates from \n     underrepresented populations before making a final decision \n     when searching for a business vendor or filling leadership \n     position.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/22/senate-section/article/S4714-3", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3575.
