Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 744, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 744) to provide for comprehensive immigration \n     reform and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Leahy/Hatch amendment No. 1183, to encourage and facilitate \n     international participation in the performing arts.\n       Grassley/Blunt amendment No. 1195, to prohibit the granting \n     of registered provisional immigrant status until the \n     Secretary has maintained effective control of the borders for \n     6 months.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, when Alfredo Castaneda crossed the border \nfrom Mexico into the United States two decades ago, he didn't climb \nover a fence. He didn't swim across a river. He didn't fly over the \nborder. He didn't walk through the desert. When Alfredo Castaneda \ncrossed the border, he was a 2-year-old little boy perched on his \nfather's shoulders.\n  The choice to leave Mexico wasn't an easy one for Alfredo's father, \nbut the rumble of hunger in his belly and in his son's belly convinced \nAlfredo's dad to leave behind the world he knew for a hopefully better \nlife in America. He wrote me a letter; it is addressed to me. Here is \nwhat he said:\n\n       I lived in a shack with one wall of my house leaning on my \n     neighbor's; the other three were made of sticks and mud \n     bricks. I wanted to give my family a better life, and so I \n     hear the U.S. is a land of opportunity. All I want is to have \n     a sliver of that opportunity for my family.\n\n  So with his wife by his side and his son on his shoulders, Alfredo's \nfather came to America illegally. Alfredo was a 2-year-old boy, as I \nmentioned, at the time. Today he is a 23-year-old man who appreciates \nthe privileges that come with life in America, but he is also conscious \nof the opportunities available only to U.S. citizens--opportunities \nthat aren't available to him because of his immigration status.\n  When his friends applied for part-time jobs in high school, Alfredo \nknew he could never work legally. When he was researching a paper for a \nclass, Alfredo was denied a library card because he had no \nidentification. When he filled out an application for his dream school, \nselecting ``noncitizen'' on an online form, Alfredo received an error \nmessage in bold red letters that said ``noncitizens cannot apply''--\ncannot apply for entry into this institution.\n  Alfredo's life in Nevada bears little in common with the shack of \nsticks and mud he left behind. For him, America truly is the land of \nopportunity his father envisioned. Yet, until recently, Alfredo could \nnot get a Social Security number, a driver's license, or even a full-\ntime job because he is an undocumented immigrant. But that hasn't \nstopped him from reaching for his dreams. This is what he wrote in \naddition to what we have already heard:\n\n       My parents constantly reminded me to be a good citizen and \n     volunteer in my community whenever possible. They said that \n     it would pay off and would help me acquire citizenship in the \n     future. I took that to heart.\n\n  So Alfredo worked hard in high school--really hard--volunteered in a \nlocal hospital, and became politically\n\n[[Page S4436]]\n\nactive. He enrolled in the College of Southern Nevada.\n  Since he can't find steady work, it has been difficult for Alfredo to \nafford tuition while he helps support his family. But he believes \nthings are about to change for the better.\n  Thanks to a directive issued last year by President Obama, Alfredo \nand 800,000 DREAMers just like him won't be deported and will be able \nto work and drive legally. Alfredo has already applied for several \njobs. He has even gotten a few interviews. He looks forward to learning \nto drive, going back to school, completing his associate's degree, and \none day owning a business.\n  But President Obama's directive isn't a permanent answer. The \nRepublican majority in the House of Representatives voted last week to \nresume deportation of outstanding young people just like Alfredo who \nwere brought to this country through no fault of their own. Remember, \nthis boy got here on his dad's shoulders. And the directive isn't a \nsolution for Alfredo's parents and 10 million people just like them who \nlive in the United States without the proper paperwork.\n  It is more important than ever that Congress pass a permanent fix for \nthis Nation's broken immigration system. Alfredo believes in us. He \nbelieves we will succeed. He believes we will find the political will \nto pass commonsense, bipartisan immigration reform and do it now.\n  His letter contained a reminder of what is at stake in this debate. \nThis is what he wrote:\n\n       It's not just a piece of legislation; that piece of paper \n     holds our dreams, ambitions, and potential in it.\n\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the immigration \nbill was reported, so we are on that bill right now; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. And the pending amendment is what?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is Grassley amendment \nNo. 1195.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in a brief moment I am going to move to \ntable that amendment, but I want everyone to understand that I talked \nto Senator Grassley yesterday and told him I was going to do this, and \nthe staffs have been advised of it as well.\n  So I ask unanimous consent to move to table the Grassley amendment \nand that the vote on the motion to table occur at 10 a.m. following the \nremarks of Senator McConnell; and that at a time following Senator \nMcConnell's remarks, there be 5 minutes for the opposition and 5 \nminutes for those supporting the motion to table. So the vote would \noccur a little after 10 a.m., but that depends on how long Senator \nMcConnell speaks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                            Young Americans\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Obama economy has been pretty rough \non our Nation's young people. If you are a teenager looking for work \nover the summer break or if you are a high-schooler looking for a part-\ntime job after school, good luck with that. The unemployment rate for \n16- to 19-year-olds is 25 percent--25 percent--which is near historic \nhighs. If you are a college graduate, things don't look much brighter. \nIn fact, the unemployment rate for 20- to 24-year-olds is over 13 \npercent.\n  It hardly needs mentioning at this point that many Americans are \nlikely to see their hours cut or their jobs disappear altogether as \nObamaCare continues to come online. That is because so far we know that \nthe President's new health care law will impose about 20,000 pages of \nonerous regulations and probably many more than that when all is said \nand done.\n  Many of these regulations will hit small businesses, which create the \nmajority of new jobs in our country. Many of these regulations will hit \npart-time workers very hard. For instance, the law punishes businesses \nif they allow employees to work too many hours. So it is no surprise \nwhen we read any one of the numerous stories about companies slashing \nhours. It also punishes businesses if they dare to give jobs to too \nmany people, so, of course, it will probably lead them to slash jobs or \nactually limit hiring.\n  I am sure the Washington Democrats who drafted ObamaCare thought they \nwere striking some blow for ``fairness'' with these job-crushing ideas. \nWell, now the youth of our country are finding out what Democrats' so-\ncalled fairness means for them. It means smaller paychecks or no \npaychecks at all. It must seem pretty unfair from where they stand.\n  It actually gets a lot worse. Many experts predict that ObamaCare \nwill also cause health care premiums to skyrocket, especially for \nyounger Americans. Some studies show that young men in particular could \nsee rate increases of 50 percent--50 percent--or more. Think about \nthat. You work your tail off in high school just to get into a good \ncollege. You spend 4 years pulling all-nighters and cramming for \nfinals, all for the privilege of putting on a gown, accepting your \ndegree, and potentially spending who knows how long frantically \nsearching to find work. Then, if you are lucky--if you are lucky--your \nhours get cut after you find a job or maybe your job gets cut \naltogether. You get a letter in the mail that says: Sorry, your premium \nis going up by double-digits. Can't pay the higher premium? Too bad. If \nyou don't, Uncle Sam slaps you with a penalty tax. And for all the talk \nof subsidies, the studies indicate these payments from taxpayers might \nnot even make up for the higher costs.\n  Look, I would be pretty disillusioned if I were in that position, and \nI think everyone else would be also. Well, it could get worse if \nWashington Democrats don't start getting serious about working with \nRepublicans on student loans too. As I mentioned last week, President \nObama and Republicans actually agree in broad terms on the way forward \nfor student loan reform. As the President's Secretary of Education told \nPolitico yesterday--this is the Obama administration's Secretary of \nEducation:\n\n       My strong preference would be for a longer-term solution, \n     and not to just keep solving it this year, and then the next \n     year and then the next year.\n\n  So it is time for Senate Democrats to stop blocking us from enacting \npermanent reform because Federal rates for new student loans are set to \ndouble--double--if we don't act soon.\n  Several Senate Democratic leaders have basically already admitted to \nthe media that they would rather have a failed bill they can morph into \na campaign issue than a signed bill that can help 100 percent of \nstudents.\n  It is time for that to change, and they should not assume younger \nAmericans will be that easily tricked one more time in 2014. These \nyoung men and women may be drowning in the Obama economy, but it is not \nbecause they are dumb or lazy or apathetic. It is because of policies \ndreamed up in Washington during the years of the Obama administration.\n  As the days go by, these young Americans are discovering just how \nunfairly Washington Democrats have treated them in the past few years.\n\n\n                          Keeping a Commitment\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, we have been discussing on a daily basis \nwhether the majority leader will keep the commitment he made at the \nbeginning of the last two Congresses that no rules changes would be \nmade other than by following the rules. In other words, the commitment \nwas: I will not break the rules of the Senate in order to change the \nrules of the Senate.\n  My friend the majority leader has made that commitment on two \noccasions. He made it in January of 2011 for the next two Congresses. \nWe are in the second Congress now. At the beginning of this Congress, \nwe had an extensive discussion about rules changes, after which the \nvast majority of Senate Republicans supported two rules changes and two \nstanding orders, and in return for those changes we made, the majority \nleader committed once again that\n\n[[Page S4437]]\n\nfor this Congress he would not pull the nuclear trigger, as we call it \naround here, use the nuclear option; in other words, turn the Senate \ninto the House.\n  So the majority leader will be confronted with his promise, his \ncommitment, on a daily basis until we understand fully that he intends \nto keep his commitment to the Senate and to the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, leadership time is \nreserved.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1195\n\n  Under the previous order, the time until 10 a.m. is equally divided \nbetween the proponents and opponents of the motion to table the \namendment offered by the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nproponents be given 5 minutes and the opponents be given 5 minutes and \nthen we vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the amendment \noffered by my friend and colleague, the ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  What does this amendment do? It is very simple. It says that the 11 \nmillion people living in the shadows cannot even get RPI status, the \nprovisional status by which they can work and travel, until--until--the \nSecretary of Homeland Security says the border is fully secure.\n  We all know that will take years and years and years, and that is why \nan amendment very similar to this came up in the Judiciary Committee \nand was defeated 12 to 6, with two Republicans joining the Democrats in \nvoting against it, Mr. Flake and Mr. Graham, who were part of our so-\ncalled Gang of 8.\n  The problem with the amendment is very simple: What do we do for 5, 6 \nyears until the border is fully secure? It is going to take a while to \ndo it. We need to bring equipment there. We need to build fences there. \nWe need to do all of the kinds of things that are in our bill. We \nprovide $6.5 billion to build $1 billion worth of border fence, to \ndeploy sensors, fixed towers, radar, drones that will cover the entire \nborder.\n  So what are we telling those 11 million? If you hide successfully \nfrom the police, then maybe 5 years from now you can stay here and get \nthe right to work and the right to travel. This clearly would undo the \nentire theme and structure of the immigration bill that has such \nbipartisan support that is before us today.\n  Again, let me repeat, as I understand it, it is opposed by all the \nMembers of the Gang of 8--the four Democrats and the four Republicans--\nfor the very reason it will take years and years until the border is \nsecure. To wait that long, we will have millions more come across the \nborders illegally, the number of illegal immigrants in America will \nincrease, and we may never get to real immigration reform that is \nneeded--so desperately needed--by the country.\n  I strongly urge that this amendment be defeated. The American people \nmade it resoundingly clear they want us to move forward with \nimmigration reform in a careful, balanced, and bipartisan way. They \nwant us to secure the border, and they want us to be reasonable about \nthe 11 million who are here and about future immigration so we can grow \nthe American economy. That is what our bill does.\n  This proposal would undo much of that without proposing any real \nsolutions as to what we do before that. It has bipartisan opposition, \nand I strongly urge that it be defeated.\n  I yield the rest of my time to the chairman of our Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this amendment offered by my friend from \nIowa would significantly delay even the initial registration process \nfor the 11 million undocumented individuals in the country.\n  We believe the pathway to citizenship has to be earned, but it also \nhas to be attainable. This amendment would further delay a process that \nalready would take at least 13 years.\n  Bringing these 11 million people out of the shadows is not only the \nright thing to do, it is the best thing to do. It keeps our country \nsafe. We would know who is here. We could focus our resources on who \nposes a threat.\n  This amendment is also unnecessary. We have been pouring billions of \ndollars into border security in recent years. We have made enormous \nprogress since the last immigration bills in 2006 and 2007, and this \nbill takes even more steps.\n  As I said yesterday on the floor, I am going to have to oppose this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to remind my colleagues that we \nwere promised an open and fair process on this legislation. The fact \nthat the majority is moving to table my amendment proves this so-called \nopen and fair process is a farce. The majority is afraid to have an up-\nor-down vote on my amendment. They are apparently afraid to have an \nopen debate and vote on a provision that ensures true border security \nbefore legalization, and that is what the people of this country want. \nThey claim to be open to improving the bill, but this motion to table \nshows they are not ready to fundamentally change the bill.\n  By tabling my amendment, the majority is stifling progress on this \nbill. They are refusing to have an amendment process to improve it. \nThis is not the right way to start off on a very important bill.\n  You know, we only do immigration reform once every 25 years. So what \nis the hurry? Surely, we need an amendment process in which true \nimmigration reform can succeed. There is a lesson to be learned from \nthe 1986 legislation that is now the law of the land. Then, we \nlegalized first and thought we were going to secure the border later, \nwhich we never did.\n  So this amendment is the first of many that will improve the bill and \ndo what the authors of the bill say they want to do, secure the border \nand do what the American people expect us to do. If the American people \nare being asked to accept a legalization program in exchange for that \ncompassionate approach, they should be assured that the laws are going \nto be enforced.\n  But as we read the details of the bill, it is clear the approach \ntaken is legalize first, enforce later, the same mistake that was made \nin 1986. My amendment would fundamentally change that. The amendment \nthat is now pending would require the Secretary to certify to Congress \nthat the Secretary has maintained effective control over the entire \nsouthern border for at least 6 months before processing applications \nfor legalization.\n  It is a commonsense approach: border security first, like promised, \nlegalize next. If the bill passes as is, the Secretary only needs to \nsubmit two plans before processing people through the legalization \nprogram. We do not need to pass any more legislation that tells this \nadministration to do a job that is already required of them that they \nare not doing. People want laws enforced. Nevertheless, the bill would \nstart legalization even if the strategies the Secretary submits to \nCongress are flawed and inadequate. What if this Secretary is not \ncommitted to fencing? What if this Secretary believes the border is \nmore secure than ever? Well, in fact, this Secretary told the committee \nshe thought the borders were secure. That should concern all of us.\n  Legalization status is more than probation. This RPI status is, in \nfact, legalization. Once a person gets RPI, they get the freedom to \nlive in the United States. They can travel, work, and benefit from \neverything our country offers. RPI status is de facto permanent \nlegalization.\n  We all know it will never be taken away. People who say 10 years down \nthe road if we do not have the borders secure, that they are going to \ntake\n\n[[Page S4438]]\n\nback and classify these people as illegal again, that is naive. Given \nthe history of these types of programs, we know it will never end.\n  My amendment improves the trigger and fulfills the wish of the \nAmerican people. My amendment ensures that the border is secured before \none person gets legal status.\n  If we pass this bill as it is, there will be no pressure on this \nadministration or future administrations to secure the border. There \nwill be no push by the legalization advocates to get that job done. We \nneed to work together. We need to secure the border for several \nreasons, so that we are not back here in the same position 25 years \nfrom now saying we made a mistake 25 years ago, like we know now we \nmade a mistake. We need to protect our sovereignty and to protect the \nhomeland and improve national security.\n  Under my amendment the Secretary would have to prove that we have \neffective control, as defined in the bill, for 6 months before the \napplications for registered provisional immigration status are \nprocessed. I agree with at least one of the authors of this bill that \nif the border security title is not improved this bill does not stand a \nchance of getting to the President.\n  So my amendment is a first and necessary step to fixing this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my dear friend--we have served together in \nthe Congress for more than three decades--I care a great deal about \nhim. He is a good legislator. But I think the only criticism I have is \nhe must be reading my speeches because the speech he just gave is \nalmost a carbon copy of what I have been saying for a long time: that \nwe should not have this 60-vote threshold on everything the Republicans \ncreated.\n  For him to come now and say we are going to have 50 votes, he should \ngo back and reread my speeches, which maybe his staff has done.\n  I move to table the Grassley amendment. I ask for the yeas and nays \non my motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote and to lay that motion on the \ntable.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for the benefit of Members, we have had a \nnumber of amendments filed, and I would like to move forward on trying \nto move this legislation along. That is what this is all about.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \namendments be in order and be called up in the order I offer them here: \nThune No. 1197, Landrieu No. 1222, Vitter No. 1228, Tester No. 1198, \nand Heller No. 1227; that the time until 11:30 a.m. be equally divided \nbetween the two managers or their designees for debate on these \namendments; that at that time; that is, 11:30 a.m., the Senate proceed \nto vote on the amendments in this agreement in the order listed; that \nthere be no second-degree amendments in order prior to the votes; that \nall the amendments be subject to a 60-affirmative vote threshold; that \nthere be 2 minutes equally divided between the votes, and all after the \nfirst vote be 10 minutes in duration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I have a suggestion: that we agree to everything for \nthe first four amendments on the list.\n  I object.\n  Mr. REID. So you object to the whole thing?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I thought we had a deal there.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I therefore ask, because of the objection, unanimous \nconsent that the following amendments be in order to be called up: \nThune No. 1197, Landrieu No. 1222, Vitter No. 1228, Tester No. 1198, \nand Heller No. 1227.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Reserving the right to object----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest to the majority leader we can agree to what \nhe has suggested except for Heller amendment No. 1227.\n  Mr. REID. I am disappointed my colleague's amendment is not going to \nbe part of this, but maybe we can work on that at a subsequent time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request as modified?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while we are determining the best way to \nmove forward on these amendments that are now in order, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senator from New Mexico Mr. Heinrich be allowed to \nspeak for up to 15 minutes to give his maiden speech before the Senate, \nand during that 15-minute period of time we will try to figure out a \nway to proceed.\n  That is the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I also ask unanimous consent that following the Senator's \nstatement I be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                    Meeting 21st Century Challenges\n\n  Mr. HEINRICH. I thank the Chair for the opportunity to address the \nChamber today.\n  Mr. President, I am a strong believer that innovation is what America \ndoes best, that boundless wonder and curiosity can lead to \nrevolutionary discoveries, and that diligence and optimism can break \ndown barriers. I am a believer that technology and, more importantly, \nthe scientific method are how we can best meet many of our 21st-century \nchallenges. And this is, indeed, a time of great challenge for our \nNation.\n  There is no question that it is easier to legislate in a time of \npeace and prosperity than in a time of economic recovery and global \nconflict. But Americans, Mr. President, are no strangers to adversity. \nTime and again we have shown our ingenuity and our perseverance. In \nfact, the very character of our Nation has been shaped by hard work and \ninnovation. That is America's story. I am certain our capacity to deal \nwith the challenges we face rests heavily on our ability to make policy \nthat is driven by facts, by data, and, yes, by science.\n  Historically, America has responded to challenges with transformative \ninnovations--electricity, radio, television, transistors, silicon \ncomputer\n\n[[Page S4439]]\n\nprocessors, and the rise of the modern distributed Internet. In my own \nState of New Mexico, we have built our economy around some of the \ngreatest innovations of the modern era.\n  New Mexico Tech, the University of New Mexico, and New Mexico State \nUniversity offered advanced degrees in chemistry and engineering as \nearly as the 1890s. After World War I, Kirtland, Holloman, and Cannon \nmilitary bases in our State provided supreme training conditions for \nthe new flight wing of the Army that would eventually be called the \nU.S. Air Force.\n  During World War II, New Mexico was home to the Manhattan Project, \nwhich installed Los Alamos National Laboratory, White Sands Missile \nRange, and Sandia National Laboratories.\n  Through the collaboration of its major defense and research \ninstallations, New Mexico has become the birthplace of technologies \nthat have changed the world. Over time, our National Labs, our \nuniversities, and our defense installations have proven to be \ninvaluable to research and development not only for our State but for \nthe entire Nation. They led key research efforts during the space race \nand continue to develop modern defense and computer technology in the \ndigital age, often partnering with private sector innovators such as \nIntel Corporation.\n  As innovators in technology transfer, Sandia National Labs and Intel \ncame together on the development of radiation-hardened microprocessors \nfor space and defense applications. With the help of our State \nuniversities, New Mexico will continue to lead the way in low-carbon \nenergy technology.\n  The University of New Mexico Taos Campus is a prime example of the \npublic and private sectors working together to employ cleaner energy. \nTheir campus is home to one of the largest solar arrays in the State--a \nproject that was successful thanks to a partnership with Los Alamos \nNational Lab and Kit Carson Electric Cooperative.\n  On the research front, Santa Fe Community College and New Mexico \nState University are developing algal biofuels as a source of liquid \nrenewable energy. In addition to our universities benefiting from \ntechnology transfer, Los Alamos National Lab's Labstart Initiative is \nalso promoting growth in the private sector. This program encourages \nfuture entrepreneurs to start businesses using technologies first \ndeveloped within our National Labs. So far, the lab-to-market strategy \nhas brought $20 million in revenue for the 19 companies that have \nstarted under this initiative.\n  Today, the technology industry, both public and private, supports \nnearly 50,000 jobs in our small State at over 2,000 technology \nestablishments throughout New Mexico. It is our history of innovation \nand new technology that drive New Mexico's economy and our \ncontributions to this great Nation.\n  As our country faces the challenges of bringing our economy back from \na devastating recession and reversing the effects of climate change, we \nmust embrace the challenge and lead the world in innovation and clean \nenergy, using science as our guide to setting public policy. Yet during \nmy time in Washington, too often I have seen scientific integrity \nundermined and scientific research politicized in an effort to advance \nideological or even purely political agendas. I have watched as too \nmany of us in elected office moved from being entitled to our own \nopinions--something which our democracy relies upon--to embracing the \nbelief that somehow we are entitled to our own facts. None of us are \nentitled to our own facts.\n  As someone who began my adult life studying engineering, I believe we \nmust better use science as a guiding tool in our deliberations on how \nto set public policy. Whether for our national security, our energy \nindependence, or our Nation's ability to compete in the global economy, \nour efforts and our solutions should be rooted in fact and driven by \nthe best available science but also with a keen eye to the innovations \nthat are transforming our Nation before our very eyes.\n  By investing in education, in research, engineering, in our teachers, \nand in our professors, we will lead the world in scientific and \ntechnological innovation. Even in this challenging fiscal environment, \nwe must make the investments that have paid dividends for our Nation \ntime and time again.\n  My own path to scientific inquiry began in the first grade. I had a \nteacher named Mrs. Taylor, who saw in me a thirst for knowledge and \ndiscovery. She fed that desire, even when it meant considerable extra \nwork and planning a supplemental curriculum that wasn't part of her \nnormal work plan. She was the kind of teacher--and I hope some of you \nhave had one--who would take the extra time to make sure a student \nhungry to read never ran out of new books to explore or that a student \ninterested in fossils and dinosaurs had extra projects and materials to \nfeed their interest.\n  I can honestly say, if it weren't for Mrs. Taylor, my own life would \nhave taken some very different turns. When we ensure that every student \nhas a Mrs. Taylor, we ensure that our children will not just spend \ntheir afternoons playing on tablets and smart phones, but they will \nhave the education to grow up designing and building the next \ngeneration of technology and devices. We should harness their natural \nintellectual curiosity to solve humankind's greatest challenges.\n  From the classrooms of our elementary schools to the research labs of \nour universities, to the grounds of our National Laboratories and \nresearch institutes to the offices of venture capital firms and \ninnovative tech startups, the frontiers of human knowledge can be \nboundless. If we harness it, we will continue to fuel our Nation's \nprosperity.\n  No area of innovation and science will be more important in the \ncoming years than our Nation's ability to tackle climate change and to \nlead the world in clean energy technology. America can and must become \ntruly energy independent, and we must move from traditional carbon-\nintensive energy sources to ever-cleaner alternatives. Investing in \ncleaner energy will create quality jobs and protect our Nation from the \nserious economic and strategic risks associated with our reliance on \nforeign energy.\n  I must take the opportunity to say how impressed I have been with the \ncurrent bipartisan efforts to embrace energy efficiency.\n  Whether your goal is job creation, economic vitality, saving \nconsumers money, or lowering your carbon footprint, conservation is not \nonly conservative, it is effective. Getting the most out of every unit \nof energy we use should be a concern for all of levels of government--\nState, Federal, and local--and for community organizations as well.\n  I have spent a lot of time traveling across my home State of New \nMexico highlighting how innovation and investment in new energy \ntechnology can help create good jobs and grow our economy. New Mexico \nis home to innovators such as EMCORE Corporation, a leading provider of \ncompound semiconductor-based components, which recently deployed a \nsystem that uses solar cells with a conversion efficiency of sunlight \nto electricity of 39 percent, a remarkable feat; Sapphire Energy in \nColumbus, NM, which is producing drop-in crude oil from algae, \nsunlight, and CO2; and, energy storage projects in Los \nAlamos and Albuquerque that are demonstrating smart-grid technology \nwith solar PV storage fully integrated into a utility power grid. These \nare just a few examples. It is clear New Mexico is already capitalizing \non a diversified but rapidly innovative energy sector.\n  To help the Nation transition to cleaner sources of energy, I am \nsupporting efforts to streamline permitting for renewable energy \nprojects while still protecting access to our public lands for families \nand sportsmen to enjoy.\n  Another key to further development of clean energy is to alleviate \nthe bottlenecks in the electric power grid. New Mexico is an energy \nexporter, and I am working to spur substantial renewable energy \ndevelopment by adding the transmission capacity that will allow us to \nexport clean energy to markets in Arizona and California. Through \nAmerican ingenuity, we can unleash the full potential of cleaner \nhomegrown energy and put Americans to work while we are at it.\n  At the same time, we can, and we must, lead the world in addressing \nour climate crisis. Climate change is no longer theoretical. It is one \nof those stubborn facts that doesn't go away simply because we choose \nto ignore it. In New Mexico we are seeing bigger fires, drier summers, \nand less snowpack\n\n[[Page S4440]]\n\nin the winter. And as I speak these words, too many of our high \nelevation forests are burning. With humidity levels lower and \ntemperatures higher, we are dealing with fire behavior that is markedly \nmore intense than we have seen in the past. Over the last 3 years \nalone, we have seen two of the largest fires in New Mexico's history. \nWith elevated temperatures, studies at Los Alamos National Labs predict \nthat three-quarters of our evergreen forests in New Mexico might be \ngone as early as 2050.\n  At the same time we are experiencing our driest 2-year drought since \nrecordkeeping started in the mid-19th century. Flows in the Rio Grande \nare less than 20 percent of normal. Since the first of the year, \ncentral New Mexico, where I live, has seen less than 1 inch of rain. \nThis is a tragedy, and we must start taking active steps to reverse it. \nWe owe that to our children. We owe that to the next generation.\n  In 1961 President John F. Kennedy made a bold claim that an American \nwould walk on the Moon by the end of the decade. Eight years later, \nNeil Armstrong did just that.\n  Today we face a similarly audacious challenge when it comes to \naddressing climate change. We need to think big and we need to execute. \nWe did that when President Kennedy said we would go to the Moon--and we \nmade it happen as Americans. Climate change is our greatest future \nchallenge, and we must commit to solving it within the decade.\n  I am by nature an optimist. I have seen this great Nation defy the \nodds again and again. And, yes, I believe compromise and even \nbipartisanship are still possible. Our country is strong because of \nrigorous debate, but debate doesn't mean endless gridlock. Despite our \ndifferences, there are issues where both parties can come together and \nfind common ground. Using science to rise to our Nation's challenges, \nwhatever those may be, should be one of those areas. It is one I am \ncommitted to, and I look forward to working with my colleagues so our \nNation and my home State of New Mexico can achieve the greatness and \nfuture all of our children deserve.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am going to ask consent that we have a \nvote on some judges in an hour. But prior to saying that, I want to say \nthis. This is a very important bill. People want to offer amendments on \nthis bill. We have five amendments that are now pending. There are ways \nwe could move forward expeditiously, but sometimes that is not the \nright thing to do.\n  We have a number of issues I want to focus on for just a minute. No. \n1, we have a storm coming--we all know about that--in a couple of \ndifferent waves. We have meetings going on today in the Capitol with \ndifferent groups of people trying to figure out a way to go forward on \nthis important legislation. I think what we should do is have these \njudges votes, have people go ahead and do their meetings--for example, \nthere is one at the White House late this afternoon with some Senators.\n  But I do say this: We are going to finish the work on the floor soon \non this bill, but we are going to come back Monday and we are going to \nbe on this bill. I want to alert everybody that next weekend we will be \nworking on this bill. We are going to finish this bill before the July \n4 recess. Everyone should understand that. Everyone has had adequate \nwarning, notice, that we are going to work next weekend. That means \nFriday, Monday, and that includes Saturday and Sunday to get this \nlegislation done. If something comes up and we do not have to do that, \ngood, but as things now stand, I see that is something we have to do. I \nwant to make sure people know. They know because we have to move \nforward on this legislation.\n  We have a lot we have to finish during the July time period. We will \nbe on this legislation. I have had a couple of Senators say: Can we be \nnext? Mr. President, everyone is alerted. We are working. Both sides \nare working in good faith to get this bill done, and we are going to \ncontinue to do that. Hopefully we will not have to terminate all these \namendments with procedural votes. If we have to do that, we will, but I \nwould rather not do that.\n  I hope everyone will continue working to come to an agreement on how \nwe can improve this bill. I kind of like it the way it is, but I am not \nthe one who is going to make this determination. The ranking member is \nhere, and he will have plenty of time for speeches this afternoon on \nthis legislation. I also appreciate everyone being reasonable. My \nfriend the Senator from South Dakota is always very easy and pleasant \nto work with. I talked to him about how we should move forward on his \namendment, and we had a good conversation. Hopefully what I have said \nwill pacify everyone for the time being and hopefully for a long period \nof time so we can get this done.\n\n\n           Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Nominations\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 11:30 today the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider Calendar Nos. 47 and 49 under the \nprevious order. Therefore, under the order, the Senate would have one \nor two votes beginning at noon, beginning on the confirmation of Nitza \nAlejandro and Jeffrey L. Schmehl to be U.S. district judges for the \nEastern District of Pennsylvania. Both of these judges are from \nPennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. So people can plan, we hope the first one will be by voice. \nThis one vote after noon will be the last vote of the week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1197\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for trying to \nwork with us in a fashion that will allow us to get to some votes on \namendments. We have several amendments pending, one of which is the \namendment I have offered, amendment No. 1197. I spoke to this subject a \nlittle bit the other evening as we commenced debate on the immigration \nbill. I would like to, if I might, elaborate a little bit further on \nwhy I believe this amendment is important and why I think it \nstrengthens and improves the underlying bill.\n  I said the other evening that I am very convinced--I think we all \nare--that we need an immigration system that works. The immigration \nsystem we have today is broken, and it must be fixed. Unfortunately, \neach time Congress has tried to fix our immigration system, promises of \na more secure border have never held. The bill in front of us is well-\nintended, but it is following the same path as past immigration bills.\n  Under this bill, it is certain that 12 million undocumented workers \nwill receive legal status soon after the bill is enacted. However, the \nborder security provisions of this bill are nothing more than promises \nwhich, again, may never be upheld. I have said this before. When I talk \nto constituents back in my State of South Dakota, there are couple of \nquestions they ask. The first question is, When will our Federal \nGovernment keep its promises on border security? They also ask a second \nquestion; that is, Why do we need more laws when we are not enforcing \nthe laws that are currently on the books?\n  It is time that we follow through on promises of a more secure \nborder. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act \nof 1996 required 700 miles of reinforced, double-layered fencing along \nthe southern border. That goal was reaffirmed when Congress passed the \nSecure Fence Act back in 2006. To date, less than 40 miles--36, to be \nexact--out of the 700 miles of fencing required by law has been \ncompleted.\n  My amendment No. 1197 simply requires that when we implement current \nlaw prior to legalization--that is an indication that we are serious \nabout border security--as specified by this amendment, 350 miles of the \nfencing would be required prior to RPI status being granted. The \ncompletion of this section of the fence would be a tangible \ndemonstration that we are serious about border security. After RPI \nstatus\n\n[[Page S4441]]\n\nis granted, the remaining 350 miles required by current law would have \nto be constructed during the 10-year period before registered \nprovisional immigrants can apply for green cards.\n  There are still many problems with this bill that need to be \naddressed. I think that is what the amendment process is all about. But \nI say to my colleagues here in the Senate that if we want to show we \nare serious about border security and not just talking about it but \nactually making real changes to make our border more secure, then this \namendment is one way to show we are serious.\n  There has been a lot of discussion about the various costs associated \nwith building a fence. If we look at the different estimates about \nborder fence costs, there are quotes from private contractors \nsuggesting that the cost of constructing a double-layered fence is \nabout $3.2 million per mile. Putting that in terms of a 700-mile fence, \nwe are looking at about $2.2 billion. Remember, it would cost a lot \nless than that if we reach the 350-mile mark, which is what my \namendment calls for, prior to RPI status. But it is a reasonable cost.\n  There are dollars allocated in the legislation that are designed to \nstrengthen border security. I suggest to my colleagues that one of the \nbest, simplest, plainest, most straightforward ways of doing that is to \nbuild the fence--the fence that is required by law, that was required \nin the 1996 act and in the 2006 act and to date only 40 miles of which \nhas been built.\n  This makes a lot of sense. I suggest that as we talk about the \nvarious other elements of the immigration debate and the legislation in \nfront of us, we start with this. If we start with this, I think we can \nconvince the American people we are serious.\n  I think it is difficult for Americans to trust Congress, trust the \ngovernment to do the right thing on the border when past promises have \nnot been fulfilled. If we go back to the 1986 immigration reform \nlegislation, there were promises made about border security that were \nnever kept, and we allowed people to come in at that time. Since that \ntime, here we are many years later with the same set of circumstances \nin front of us today, trying to figure out how to deal with the \nundocumented workers who are currently here but absent anything having \nhappened that would ensure to the American people that the border \nsecurity requirements are being met.\n  I encourage my colleagues in the Senate to express our commitment to \nthe American people that before RPI status is granted, we are serious \nabout securing our border, ensuring that the commitments made about \nbuilding a fence there are fulfilled--again, 350 miles of which would \nbe constructed prior to RPI status, and the other 350 miles of that \n700-mile fence would happen subsequent to a green card being issued and \nmoving into that next status that is allowed for in this legislation.\n  This is not something that is complicated. I think if you are an \nAmerican citizen in this country, you ask a couple of very \nstraightforward questions. One is, why do we have to pass new laws if \nwe are not going to enforce the laws already on the books? The 700 \nmiles of border fence is on the books--in 1986, when it was first \ncalled for, and then in 2006, subsequent to that, it was again \nstipulated that a fencing requirement be completed on the southern \nborder.\n  Interestingly enough, I would add that at the time when that vote was \nheld in 2006, then-Senators Obama, Biden, and Clinton supported that \nbill, along with a lot of the current Members, authors of the \nlegislation that is before us today.\n  It makes perfect sense to the American people. I think it is a \nnecessary and essential, actually, requirement to be met not only for \nus to move on to the other elements of the immigration debate but, more \nimportant, to secure the American border.\n  I ask that amendment No. 1197 be made pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1222\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 1222, the Child Citizenship Act, for lawful adoptees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am going to speak about this amendment \nin just a minute, but first I want to respond to Senator Thune. I wish \nwe could get a vote on my amendment as well as this one because I would \nlike to vote and strongly express my objection to his amendment. I will \ncomment for just a minute.\n  I chair the Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee that is \nactually building the fence. The money that builds it comes through my \ncommittee. I have looked at the fence they are trying to build. It is \nshocking to me, and would be shocking to everyone in America if they \ncould see it. No matter if we build a single fence or double fence with \nspacing in between, it will be easy for people to get over it or under \nit.\n  I will vote against Senator Thune's amendment because I am not going \nto waste taxpayer money on a dumb fence, and that is what his fence \nwould be. We need to build a smart fence. A fence is not just a \nphysical structure which can be built out of a variety of different \nmaterials with or without barbed wire on the top.\n  A smart fence is what Senator McCain and I want to build. Since he is \nfrom Arizona, I think he knows a little bit more about this than the \nSenator from South Dakota who doesn't have a border with Mexico but \nonly with Canada, and that is quite different. If Senator McCain were \non the Senate floor, I think he would say we absolutely want to build a \nbarrier of security, and this would be a combination of a physical \nstructure that is built to the great standards we can with the \ntechnology that will actually shut down illegal immigration.\n  It is not correct for anybody listening to this debate to think that \npeople on the Democratic side of this aisle or people supporting this \nbill do not want to secure the border. Nothing could be further from \nthe truth. I may be overridden, and people may vote against it, but I \nam going to hold the position that we cannot waste billions and \nbillions of dollars building a fence that doesn't hold anybody on one \nside or the other. We have wasted enough taxpayer money.\n  While I didn't come here to talk about this at this moment, I am \ngoing to talk about it for just a few minutes.\n  This immigration bill is about fixing a broken system, not dumping \ntaxpayer money down a rat hole. And some people want to talk about \nbuilding a fence. I went to look at the fence. I have been in tunnels \nthat go under the fence. I watched people climb over the fence, and so \nhas anybody who actually lives along the border, which is why Senator \nMcCain's voice is so important in this debate.\n  No one should think that Senator McCain, who has been the leader on \nborder security in this Senate for 20 years, is not interested in \nbuilding a strong fence. His State gets affected--just like California \nand Texas--more directly than any of us.\n  The Presiding Officer knows geography well. So for my colleagues to \ncome to the floor and suggest that the eight people who put this bill \ntogether are not interested in border security is just truly false, \nmisleading, and unfortunate. That is what this debate is going to be \nabout.\n  I have respect for my colleague. I absolutely oppose his amendment, \nbut I am going to come back and give some more facts about how we are \nbuilding a smart fence, how we are going to keep using new technologies \nto keep people out that we don't want and keep people in we want to \nkeep in.\n  I want to say one thing about this immigration bill as well. We are \nthe most open society in the world. It is a great source of pride to \nour country. We are an open, transparent democracy that is trying to \ncreate a broad middle class not only here in America but around the \nworld, and trade and commerce are essential. We need secure borders \nthat open for trade and create jobs. As chairman of this committee, I \nam not going to waste more money building something that doesn't work \njust so some people can get a headline in their local press. It is just \nnot going to happen.\n  So we are going to put money in this bill to build a smart barrier \nthat is going to have all the new technology we need to track down \nillegal immigrants and close that off. Then we are also--which is in \nthis bill--going to use new technology, such as what we have seen on \ntelevision and these fancy shows, to find the 40 percent of immigrants \nwho came here under visas and overstayed, for the queue so they can pay \ntheir taxes, learn English, and become citizens.\n  I will come back and speak more on the record about this issue, and I \nam sure the Senator from South Dakota will have a response.\n  Happily, I don't think there is an objection to my amendment, the \ncitizenship for lawful adoptees. I am very happy I have the \ncosponsorship of Senator Coats, Senator Blunt, and Senator Klobuchar. \nThis amendment does not go to the heart of the immigration bill, but it \ndoes touch the hearts of many parents and children who have been caught \nup in a very unfortunate situation.\n  A couple of years ago Senator Nickles from Oklahoma, whom I had the \ngreat pleasure of working with across the aisle on many important \nadoption bills, and I passed a bill that is very important to the \nadoption community. The bill basically says when a child is adopted \noverseas--we mostly do adoptions in America, but we have anywhere from \n10,000 to 20,000 adoptions internationally.\n  When somebody adopts a child overseas, it is very expensive, time \nconsuming, and more bureaucratic than it needs to be. Several years ago \nour bill said once that process is over and the adoption is finalized, \nthose children will automatically become citizens. It was a great step \nforward because now we have at least 10,000 to 20,000 kids who are all \nvarious ages--infants, teenagers, all the way up to 18--who, once they \ncome to the United States, don't have to go through another process to \nget their citizenship; otherwise, we would obviously have a backlog of \nmillions.\n  This is sort of giving the adopted kids a little express lane, which \nis what we wanted to do, and we did. Unfortunately, when we pass bills, \nmany times the bureaucracy gets ahold of the law and starts to \ninterpret it in a different way than we wanted and starts throwing \nbarriers in the way.\n  Simply put, my amendment, which is supported by the Members I said, \nis going to fix three important provisions in that law. First, it says \nif a child is adopted into this country and later commits a misdemeanor \nor felony--just as if it was a biological child who committed \na misdemeanor or felony--that person would not be deported. Deportation \nis not an option for adoptees. It may be an option for illegal \nimmigrants but not children who have been adopted by American citizens. \nSo we are going to correct that. They are going to have the full \npenalties against them. They can go to jail for a long time. They can \ndo whatever the law\n\n[[Page S4443]]\n\nsays, but deportation is not one of the options.\n\n  There have been very sad circumstances where adults were brought here \nas children, but the parents failed to get their certification. Many of \nthem have been deported back to a country they never lived in a day, \nand they don't speak the language. As far as they know, in their mind \nthey are completely American, even if they did know their country of \norigin. It is very unfortunate, and it has happened. This is going to \nbring help to maybe dozens and hundreds--it is not going to be more \nthan that--of families to prevent any deportation of adoptees in the \nfuture.\n  Secondly, it will clarify the residency requirement. Over time the \nChild Citizenship Act has been misinterpreted so that the adopted \nchildren of Americans living abroad--particularly for military, \ndiplomatic, and other reasons--do not receive automatic citizenship \nupon entering the United States. We intended, when we passed our bill, \nfor this to apply to our military families and diplomats. As a result \nof serving in a foreign country, they have the opportunity to take in a \nchild who is completely homeless and has no parents. They are doing \nGod's work, and many times they end up in some bureaucratic haggling. \nSo we are going to try to correct that.\n  Finally, it clarifies that when parents are required to travel \noverseas to adopt a child--some countries require two parents, some \ncountries require one. Whether the country requires one or two parents, \none will be sufficient to meet our standard. If two are required, then \ntwo have to go; but if only one is required, one is enough to meet our \nstandard.\n  There have been months and months and years and years where parents \nwho go through all of this trouble to do something they really believe \nGod has called them to do--to adopt a homeless or unparented child or a \nsibling group--have come home to find that their own government, which \nwould be our government, is nitpicking this law to prevent them from \ngetting an easy path forward.\n  I hope there will be no opposition to this amendment. I am happy if \nwe are required to have 51 votes or 60 votes. I will take any vote of \nany number for this bill. I hope the Members will support it.\n  I am sorry I have to oppose Senator Thune's amendment, but I will be \nopposing all amendments that I don't think support the underlying \nnature of a smart barrier, which is a fence that is both physical and \nvirtual and has new technologies that will actually do the job.\n  I could not even express how shocking it was to go down to the border \nand see the number of tunnels that were built under the fence. If we \nbuild three fences, they will still build tunnels under those fences. \nThey could build four fences. I am very sorry, but I am not going to \nwaste people's money on that.\n  We are going to figure out a way to use technology to find these \nimproper entrances to our country and close them down. It may be an \nactual fence in some places. It is going to be a virtual fence in other \nplaces. It is going to be special technology, lasers, helicopters, \ninfrared, et cetera, et cetera.\n  Senator McCain actually had a list of the equipment that we intend to \nbuy with taxpayer money, and I am going to come to the floor and maybe \nspend some hours reading off the list so people know about this. We \nmost certainly are not saying no to a fence because we don't want to \nsecure the border. We are saying no to the fence because it is a waste \nof money, and we don't have any money to be wasted around here. We need \nsmart technologies.\n  Now, I am going to read Senator Thune's entire amendment because I \nhave not read the details of it. I do believe I will be opposing it. It \nmay be that his words did not appropriately say what his amendment \ndoes, but if it is an amendment that requires a complete fence and not \na virtual fence, I will oppose it. If his amendment says I want a smart \nfence and we need to build more of a smart fence, then I will support \nit.\n  I want everyone to know there are going to be amendments about the \nfence, and this is the position I will take. I will try to encourage as \nmany people as I can to assume the position I have because I think it \nis the right position, and I think the taxpayers will support this.\n  We want a secure border that is smart with the smartest technology \npossible, not one that just spends untold amounts of money decade after \ndecade and fail and fail again.\n  I yield the floor, and I see the Senator is still on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, if I might, I will make a response to the \nSenator from Louisiana. I understand that there is not going to be a \nbarrier that will be 100 percent effective, but the type of double-\nlayered fencing mandated by the law would be a significant physical \ndeterrent, demonstrating that we are serious. It would prevent some of \nthe pedestrian traffic but not all of it.\n  In the legislation of the fence that was required, we really don't \nknow all that much about how effective it has been. I think it has been \nsomewhat effective in States such as Arizona, but we have only built 36 \nmiles of it.\n  In response to my colleague from Louisiana, we all voted for this. \nShe described it as a dumb fence. She voted for the dumb fence. I guess \nI voted for the dumb fence. I didn't realize it was a dumb fence. I \nthought it was a commitment we made to the American people to secure \nthe border.\n  I will certainly concede that there are other ways in which we can \ncombine manpower, technology, and infrastructure along the border to \nmake it more secure. However, a border fence is a cost-effective \ncomponent.\n\n  I would say to my colleague from Louisiana, there are dollars in this \nbill, $6.5 billion for border security, some of which is dedicated--\n$1.5 billion is dedicated to fencing infrastructure and those sorts of \nthings.\n  The cost I mentioned in my earlier remarks, if we look at it on a \nper-mile basis to build the fence--$3.2 million per mile--we would be \nlooking at somewhere around $1 billion less than the amount allowed for \nand allocated in the bill for fencing and infrastructure and those \nsorts of things.\n  But this is not a new issue. The Senator from Louisiana voted for the \ndumb fence. I think many of us in the Senate at the time--and I \nmentioned earlier many of the Senators here, including Obama, Clinton, \nand Biden, all voted for that fence.\n  We made a commitment to the American people we would get serious \nabout doing this. We need to do it in the most cost-effective way, and \nthere are many components of that. I fully understand that. But I also \nthink a fence is a very serious and important deterrent and a \ncommitment we made to the American people.\n  So the amendment, again, is very straightforward. It simply asks \nCongress to follow through on the commitment we made in 1996 and in \n2006 and do more than 36 miles, which is what has been built so far out \nof the 700-mile commitment made to the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would just simply respond by saying I \nknow the Senator is quite sincere, and he is correct. I voted for the \ndumb fence once. I am not going to do it again because I learned from \nmy mistake. I went down there to look at it and realized we could build \ntwo dumb fences or three dumb fences and it would not work.\n  I am simply not going to waste the money to do something I know will \nnot work. So if somebody else wants to vote for the dumb fence for the \nsecond or third time, go right ahead. But I was raised such that when \nyou make a mistake, admit it and then fix it. I intend to fix it.\n  The fence we are going to build--Senator Carper, Senator Coburn, \nSenator McCain, and I--is a real and virtual fence that is actually \ngoing to work. We will have further debate on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S4444]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/13/senate-section/article/S4444-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4444-S4450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF NITZA I.

Schmehl, of \nPennsylvania, to be United States District Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 30 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask unanimous consent that all time be allocated equally as previously \nagreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I know we are going to be voting in a \nmatter of minutes on two judicial nominees for the Eastern District of \nPennsylvania, which is the eastern side of our State. Obviously, these \nappointments are critically important to justice and critically \nimportant to litigants who come before these courts, whether they are \ncivil or criminal matters.\n  These candidates go through an exhaustive review process. That is \nprobably an understatement. The process includes the nomination through \nthe White House under any administration and then the process continues \nthrough the Senate. There are all kinds of reviews. So we are finally \nto this point. It has been a very long road and we are grateful for \nthat.\n  One of the votes will be by voice potentially and one will be a \nrollcall vote. I wish to speak about both candidates. I spoke about \nthem yesterday, but I will speak briefly this morning.\n  First of all, Judge Quinones, who has served in the city of \nPhiladelphia, has served on the common pleas court in the city of \nPhiladelphia since 1991, in what is known as the First Judicial \nDistrict of Pennsylvania, which is the trial court in the city of \nPhiladelphia. One can just imagine, in a big city such as Philadelphia, \nall of the matters a judge such as Judge Quinones would deal with over \nthe course of more than two decades now, dealing with civil and \ncriminal cases, all kinds of difficult and complex matters that come \nbefore a judge. In essence, she has been performing the same functions \nas a county judge that she would on the Federal district court. So I \nthink she is more than prepared to take on this assignment.\n  In her case, this is also a great American story. Judge Quinones was \nborn in Puerto Rico, educated there, and came to the United States. As \nI said, since 1991 she has been on the court of common pleas in \nPhiladelphia. Prior to that, she was an arbitrator for more than a \ndecade. She worked in the Department of Veterans Affairs. She worked in \nthe Department of Health and Human Services. She did a lot of work in \nthe 1970s for Community Legal Services of Philadelphia. So that speaks \nto a broad range of experience and expertise dealing with litigants and \nrepresenting clients, which is so important in our system. She is \nsomeone who takes on the responsibility to represent someone in court \nso they may have their day in court, which is one of the foundational \nprinciples of our government. Then, of course, she later served as a \njudge, as I mentioned.\n  So it is not only a resume and a life story that speaks to experience \nand knowledge and insight when it comes to dealing with complex matters \nthat come before the Federal courts, but it is also in a very personal \nway a great American story. So I am particularly grateful that her \nnomination is now coming to the Senate floor and that we will be able \nto have a vote on her nomination today.\n  I have enjoyed working with Senator Toomey on both of these \nnominations. Both of us represent a big and diverse State, one Democrat \nand one Republican, working through this process together, these \njudicial appointments.\n  We will be voting as well on a second judge in the Eastern District \nof Pennsylvania: Judge Jeffrey Schmehl. I can say a lot of the same \nthings about his experience. Judge Schmehl is now and has been the \npresident judge of the Berks County Court of Common Pleas since 2007. \nSo for many years now he has been in the trenches, so to speak, or to \nuse an expression from the Bible, ``laboring the vineyards,'' dealing \nwith cases of complex issues. Berks County, just by way of geographic \norientation, is north of Philadelphia but on the eastern side of our \nState. It is a big county. It is a county that has a lot of matters \nthat come before it that are particularly complex.\n  He has served, as I mentioned, as the president judge of the court of \ncommon pleas, but then prior to that he was a judge on that same court \nfrom 1998 to 2007. So these are long periods of time, in both \ninstances, for Judge Schmehl and Judge Quinones to serve on a court.\n  For those who know something about our judicial system and know a bit \nabout the difference between an appellate court, where we are dealing \nwith appeals and legal arguments, as opposed to a trial court, which is \nwhere the action is in terms of litigants, trial judges have to preside \nover a trial as well as deal with and rule on evidentiary matters. They \nhave to deal with witnesses and lawyers and all the complexities of a \ntrial. As we all know, when your case is on trial, it is the most \nimportant case in the world.\n\n  So these judges have tremendous experience as trial judges, and we \nare so grateful they are willing to put themselves forward not just to \nbe nominated and today confirmed as judges, as I am sure they will be, \nbut to put themselves forward for that kind of public service in a \ndifficult environment, where the scrutiny and the review and the long \nroad from nomination to confirmation can be very challenging.\n  So again I will pay tribute to the work Senator Toomey has done \nworking with us. He is on the floor, and I wish to thank him for that \ngood work. And obviously I thank the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Leahy, who is on the floor as well. We appreciate \nhim working with our offices to move these nominations forward.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, does the other Senator from Pennsylvania \nwish to say something?\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I would like to speak for several minutes, \nprincipally about the two judicial nominees.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I just want to make sure I have time prior to the vote at \nnoon. How long does the Senator from Pennsylvania wish to speak?\n  Mr. TOOMEY. I think I could wrap this up in less than 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. OK. Then, Mr. President, I simply ask unanimous consent \nthat there be 4 minutes for the Senator from Vermont at the conclusion \nof the comments of the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Because these nominees are from his State, I will step \naside and let the Senator go forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  I do want to speak principally about the two nominees from \nPennsylvania, both of whom I strongly support, and I am delighted they \nare going to get their votes today. But before I do that, I do want to \nput just a little bit of context on judicial nominations and \nconfirmations as a general matter because I think it is important that \nwe understand this.\n\n[[Page S4445]]\n\n  In my own experience in the 2\\1/2\\ years I have been in the Senate, I \nknow I have voted to confirm the vast majority of judicial nominees \nwhom President Obama has proposed for us. In fact, since President \nObama became President, the Senate has confirmed 193 district court \nnominees and blocked 2. That is a confirmation rate of about 99 \npercent. In the last Congress, the 112th Congress confirmed more judges \nthan any Congress in 20 years. So by any reasonable measure, we are \nconfirming judges at a terrific rate. Republicans are cooperating and \nconfirming the nominees of a Democratic President, and this is as it \nshould be when the nominees are competent, as they have been.\n  So President Obama is enjoying a rate of confirmation of judges that \nis far greater than the rate President Bush, for instance, enjoyed or \nmost other previous recent Presidents, which is part of the reason why \nI am concerned when I hear persistent rumors that the majority leader \nis considering invoking the nuclear option and breaking the rules so he \ncan change the rules as to how nominees get confirmed. I do not \nunderstand why there is a problem that would require this. If he were \nto do this, this would be in direct contradiction to a commitment he \nmade to all of us very publicly that he would not do this. So I really \nhope that Senator Reid will keep his word and that he will not break \nthe rules in order to change the rules.\n  He stated very clearly in January of 2011 that--I will quote Senator \nReid:\n\n       I agree that the proper way to change Senate rules is \n     through the procedures established in those rules, and I will \n     oppose any effort in this Congress or the next to change the \n     Senate's rules other than through the regular order.\n\n  I would remind my colleagues that earlier this year Republicans went \nalong with a rule change about which I had real reservations. I \npersonally could not support it, but most Republicans did. It changed \nthe rules, forfeiting some of the power we have as a minority, granting \nthe majority greater flexibility to go to a bill without assuring us we \nwould be able to offer the amendments we would like. We granted that to \nthe majority in part because we got another explicit commitment that \nthere would be no nuclear rule change if we made that agreement. Well, \nwe did, at least as a party and as a body.\n  So, again, I certainly hope Senator Reid will honor the promise he \nmade that was part of that understanding, where he said in January of \nthis year, in an exchange with Senator McConnell--Senator Reid said:\n\n       Any other resolutions related to Senate procedure would be \n     subject to a regular order process including consideration by \n     the Rules Committee.\n\n  I would add, that means a 67-vote majority in the Senate because that \nis the way you change the rules in accordance with the rules.\n\n\n                            Sarah Murnaghan\n\n  Having said that, I want to also make a brief mention of some \nterrific news we got in Pennsylvania; that is, the opportunity for a \nlittle girl named Sarah Murnaghan to have a lung transplant she had \nbeen waiting for. I have spoken about this on the Senate floor. A \nFederal judge in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania issued a \ntemporary restraining order forbidding a rule that was keeping her off \nthe transplant list to be a potential recipient of a donor lung \ntransplant. Fortunately, by virtue of that restraining order, she was \nable to go on the list and receive the lung transplant. She had an \nemergency surgery just yesterday that seems to have gone very well, and \nwe are all delighted for that and wishing for her speedy and full \nrecovery.\n  Having said that, as I indicated to the chairman, I wanted to come \ndown principally to say how pleased I am that we are going to vote \ntoday and I believe confirm both Judge Jeffrey Schmehl and Judge Nitza \nQuinones, who are two nominees for the Eastern District of \nPennsylvania. Both are eminently qualified, terrific individuals who \ncome highly recommended.\n  I commend Senator Casey. He and I have worked together since I have \nbeen here. He has been terrific to work with. We have looked to \nidentify some of the most capable and talented people. I would like to \nmention a couple of the things I know Senator Casey mentioned.\n  Judge Schmehl is a terrific guy. He is the president judge of the \nBerks County Court of Common Pleas. His candidacy was approved by a \nvoice vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee. He is a graduate of \nDickinson College. He has his J.D. from the University of Toledo School \nof Law. He has served as a public defender. He has served in private \npractice. After 9 years at a law firm, he was elected to the Berks \nCounty Court of Common Pleas, where his colleagues made him the \npresident judge. He is a very bright individual. He has a keen \nintellect, a great judicial temperament. He has done a great job on the \nBerks County court, and he will make a great Federal judge. I hope my \ncolleagues will support his candidacy.\n  Nitza Quinones is a native of Puerto Rico. She is a graduate of the \nUniversity of Puerto Rico School of Business Administration. At the \nUniversity of Puerto Rico, she got her J.D. She has demonstrated a \nterrific commitment to the legal community and beyond that in \nPhiladelphia. She has been very active mentoring young people--law \nstudents in particular--and is a great advocate of civic education for \nhigh school students. She has served on the Philadelphia Court of \nCommon Pleas since 1991, presiding over a very large number of very \ndiverse cases. She has extensive experience in the courtroom. She has \ndemonstrated her ability, her commitment, her judicial temperament. \nYet, as it happens, she will be the first Latino judge on the Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania court.\n  I think it is terrific that we are able to vote today to confirm both \nof these judges. I look forward to continuing to work with Senator \nCasey to fill the remaining vacancies across Pennsylvania. I thank \nChairman Leahy for his work in advancing these nominees. I urge my \ncolleagues to support their confirmation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the words of both Senators \nfrom Pennsylvania. I would note there are currently three nominations \npending for vacancies in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. All \nthree have the bipartisan support of their home State Senators. All \nthree were reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee 3 months \nago. Yet Senate Republicans are permitting votes on only two of them. \nThey are forcing Judge Luis Restrepo to continue to wait for a vote \neven though he would fill a seat that has been vacant for 4 years.\n  I mention this because we talk about how things move during this \nPresident's tenure as compared to that of his predecessor. At the end \nof President Bush's second term, I was chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee and I expedited confirmations of three of his nominees to \nthis same court--three, not just allowing two to go through, as my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle are today--and not having to \nwait for months and months. Those three were confirmed by voice vote. \nSo you know how long it took, we had reported them out of the Judiciary \nCommittee the day before. They were confirmed along with 7 other \ndistrict court nominees for a total of 10 that day. We got them out of \ncommittee and voted them by voice vote. But now we have seven judicial \nnominees on the calendar, and Republicans are only allowing us to vote \non two of them.\n  This is just the latest example of Senate Republicans insisting that \nPresident Obama play by a different set of rules than they had for \nPresident Bush. It was perfectly fine to expedite President Bush's \nthree nominees to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and to confirm \nthem all on the same day, along with seven others. We had Democratic \ncontrol of the Senate, and we moved them that way. But now with \nPresident Obama they refuse to proceed with the seven nominees who are \npending on the Calendar. They will not even proceed with the three \njudicial nominees needed in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n  So let's not talk about how Presidents are treated. I am not sure \nwhat it is that is different about President Obama, but his nominees \nget delayed, delayed, and delayed, unlike--and I use Pennsylvania as an \nexample--where we vote out three, unanimously, of President Bush's \nnominees on one day and confirm them by voice vote the next day, along \nwith seven others. Here they are refusing to proceed with the seven\n\n[[Page S4446]]\n\nnominees on the Calendar. They will not even proceed with all three of \nthe judicial nominees for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. There \nare currently seven vacancies on that court--seven. The Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania needs judges.\n  Like the two nominees we will be permitted to vote on today, Judge \nRestrepo has the support of his Republican home State Senator as well \nas every single Republican member of the Judiciary Committee. So let's \nnot make him and the people of Pennsylvania wait.\n  Frankly, there is no good reason Nitza Quinones Alejandro and Jeffrey \nSchmehl should have waited this long for a vote. There is no good \nreason why, when half of President Bush's consensus district nominees \nwaited 18 days or fewer after being sent to the Senate by the Judiciary \nCommittee during his first term, these consensus nominees should have \nhad to wait almost 100 days. This contributes to the unprecedented \ndelays and obstruction of President Obama's consensus judicial \nnominees.\n  I read comments last week by Judge James Brady of the Middle District \nof Louisiana expressing concern about what has happened to the judicial \nconfirmation process. Shelly Dick was confirmed this year to that court \nafter months of delay, and the Advocate article noted the ``strain the \nempty judgeship had on a district overburdened with cases.'' Judge \nBrady was quoted saying of the confirmation process: ``It's just crazy, \nand we need to do something about that.'' I could not agree more. Judge \nBrady added that the delays in the process are ``driving away a lot of \nreally good folks that would make excellent judges because they're \nsaying, `I don't need to go through that process and be in limbo for \n18, 20, 24 months.' That's something I'm very, very concerned about.'' \nWe should all share that concern, especially Senators who are looking \nfor district nominees to recommend to the President. I ask that this \narticle, entitled ``Nomination Delays Hurting Courts, Federal Judge \nSays,'' be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.\n  The recent assertion by Senate Republicans that 99 percent of \nPresident Obama's nominees have been confirmed is just not accurate. He \nhas nominated 237 individuals to be circuit or district judges, and 193 \nhave been confirmed. That is 81 percent. By way of comparison, at the \nsame point in President Bush's second term, June 13 of his fifth year \nin office, President Bush had nominated four fewer people, but had seen \n214 of them confirmed, or 92 percent. That is an apples to apples \ncomparison, and it demonstrates the undeniable fact that the Senate has \nconfirmed a lower number and lower percentage of President Obama's \nnominees than President Bush's nominees at the same time in their \npresidencies.\n  I noted at the end of last year while Senate Republicans were \ninsisting on delaying confirmations of 15 judicial nominees that could \nand should have taken place then, and that we would not likely be \nallowed to complete work on them until May. That was precisely the \nRepublican plan. So when Senate Republicans now seek to claim credit \nfor their confirmations in President Obama's second term, they are \nfalsely inflating the confirmation statistics. The truth is that only \nseven confirmations have taken place this year that are not \nattributable to those nominations they held over from last year and \nthat could and should have taken place last year. To return to the \nbaseball analogy, if a baseball player goes 0-for-9, and then gets a \nhit, we do not say he is an all-star because he is batting 1.000 in his \nlast at bat. We recognize that he is just 1-for-10, and not a very good \nhitter. Nor would a fair calculation of hits or home runs allow a \nplayer to credit those that occurred in one game or season to the next \nbecause it would make his stats look better.\n  I was Chairman of the Judiciary Committee for 17 months during \nPresident Bush's first term, so I know something about how President \nBush's nominees were treated. During those 17 months, 100 of them were \nconfirmed. In the 31 months that Republicans controlled the Senate \nduring President Bush's first term, 105 of his circuit and district \nnominees were confirmed. That is, it took them almost twice as long to \nmake as much progress as I had as Chairman. Even when Senate Democrats \nwere in the minority, we worked with the Republicans to bring the \nnumber of vacancies all the way down to 28. Vacancies have remained \nnear or above 80 for 4 years during the Obama presidency. In the last 4 \nyears, Senate Republicans have never let vacancies get below 72. At \nthis point in the fifth year of the Bush presidency there were 44 \nvacancies. Today they remain almost double that amount. Despite Senate \nRepublicans who make self-congratulatory statements about ``progress'' \nthis year, we are not even keeping up with attrition. Vacancies have \nincreased, not decreased, since the start of this year.\n  If President Obama's nominees were receiving the same treatment as \nPresident Bush's, Judge Srinivasan would have been the 210th \nconfirmation, not the 193rd and vacancies would be far lower. The \nnonpartisan Congressional Research Service has noted that it will \nrequire 33 more district and circuit confirmations this year to match \nPresident Bush's 5-year total. Even with the confirmations finally \nconcluded during the first 6 months of this year, Senate Republicans \nhave still not allowed President Obama to match the record of President \nBush's first term. Even with an extra 6 months, we are still a dozen \nconfirmations behind where we were at the end of 2004.\n  In addition to the obstruction of circuit and district nominees, I am \ndeeply concerned about the impact of sequestration on our Federal \ncourts. I continue to hear from judges and legal professionals around \nthe country who worry about the impact of these senseless budget cuts, \nand I share their concern. A recent evaluation of sequestration \nconcluded: ``Its impact on the operation of the [F]ederal courts will \nbe devastating and longlasting.'' Sequestration will exacerbate the \ndelays our courts already face due to persistent understaffing, both \nfor civil and criminal cases. According to the Executive Summary of \n``FY 2013 Sequestration Impacts on the Federal Judiciary,'' ``Delays in \ncases will harm individuals, small businesses, and corporations,'' \nwhile the ``cuts to funding for drug testing, substance abuse and \nmental health treatment of federal defendants and offenders have also \nbeen made, increasing further the risk to public safety.'' I ask that \nthe full summary be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nstatement.\n  Judge Nitza Quinones Alejandro has served as a judge on the Court of \nCommon Pleas for the First Judicial District of Pennsylvania since \n1991. Prior to being a judge, Judge Quinones worked as a solo \npractitioner, a staff attorney with the U.S. Department of Veterans \nAffairs, an Attorney Advisor with the U.S. Department of Health and \nHuman Services' Bureau of Hearings and Appeals, and a staff attorney at \nCommunity Legal Services, Inc. When confirmed, Judge Quinones will be \nthe first openly gay Latina judge to serve on the Federal bench. Judge \nQuinones was also Pennsylvania's first Latina judge.\n  Judge Jeffrey Schmehl currently serves as the President Judge in \nBerks County, where he has been an active member of the bench since \n1997. Prior to becoming a judge, Judge Schmehl served in various \ncapacities in private practice, including as an associate and partner \nat Rhoda, Stoudt & Bradley and as a solo practitioner at the Law \nOffices of Jeffrey L. Schmehl, Esq. While working in private practice, \nJudge Schmehl was also a Berks County Solicitor from 1989 to 1997. In \naddition to his experience in private practice, Judge Schmehl has \nserved as an assistant district attorney and as an assistant public \ndefender for Berks County.\n  I want the Senate to make real progress on filling judicial vacancies \nso that the American people have access to justice. Before the recess, \nthe minority leader asked during a floor debate when Gregory Phillips, \nthe Wyoming nominee to the Tenth Circuit, would receive a vote.\n  Majority Leader Reid said: OK, let's vote on him right now.\n  They said: Well, we are not ready.\n  I hope the American people were watching, because there should be no \nambiguity about this: The only reason the Senate is not voting today on \nJudge Restrepo, Attorney General Phillips, or the other seven judicial \nnominees pending on the Calendar is because of Republican refusal to \nallow\n\n[[Page S4447]]\n\nsuch votes. They could be voted on today. We ought to do it. These \nnominees deserve better, and the American people deserve better.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         FY 2013 Sequestration Impacts on the Federal Judiciary\n\n\n                Sequestration and the Federal Judiciary\n\n       On March 26, 2013, the President signed Public Law 113-6, \n     the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of \n     2013, which provides full-year FY 2013 funding for the \n     federal government, including the Judiciary. The bill leaves \n     in place the government-wide sequestration cuts mandated \n     under the Budget Control Act of 2011.\n       Sequestration reduces Judiciary funding overall by nearly \n     $350 million below the FY 2012 discretionary funding. The \n     impact of sequestration on the Judiciary is compounded by the \n     fact that the Judiciary has no control over its workload--the \n     courts must react to the cases which it receives from the \n     Executive Branch, individuals and businesses--overall, that \n     workload has not declined. In addition, unlike most Executive \n     Branch entities, the Judiciary has little flexibility to move \n     funds between appropriations accounts to lessen the effects \n     of sequestration. There are no lower-priority programs to \n     reduce to transfer to other accounts.\n\n\n                 Impact of Sequestration on the Courts\n\n       Sequestration places unprecedented pressure on the federal \n     Judiciary's administration of justice. Its impact on the \n     operation of the federal courts will be devastating and \n     longlasting.\n       To mitigate the impact of sequestration on employees, the \n     courts have slashed non-salary budgets (training, information \n     technology, supplies and equipment), which is possible for \n     one fiscal year, but cannot be sustained into future years. \n     Even with these reductions, on a national level, up to 1,000 \n     court employees could be laid off, or thousands of employees \n     could face furloughs before the end of the year. These \n     staffing losses will come on top of the nearly 2,200 \n     probation officers and clerks office staff the courts have \n     already lost since the end of July 2011.\n       Cuts in staffing will result in the slower processing of \n     civil and bankruptcy cases. Delays in cases will harm \n     individuals, small businesses, and corporations.\n       Sequestration has also reduced funding for probation and \n     pretrial officer staffing throughout the courts, which means \n     less deterrence, detection, and response to possible resumed \n     criminal activity by federal defendants and offenders in the \n     community. In addition, law enforcement funding to support \n     GPS and other electronic monitoring of potentially dangerous \n     defendants and offenders has been cut 20%. Equivalent cuts to \n     funding for drug testing, substance abuse and mental health \n     treatment of federal defendants and offenders have also been \n     made, increasing further the risk to public safety.\n       Security systems and equipment in our Court Security \n     program have been cut 25% and court security officers' hours \n     have been reduced. These reductions come at a time of \n     heightened security resulting from the prosecutor murders in \n     Texas and the Boston bombings. A high level of security of \n     judges, prosecutors, defense counsel, jurors and litigants \n     entering our courthouses must be maintained.\n\n\n    Impact of Sequestration on Representation of Indigent Offenders\n\n       For Defender Services, incorporating enacted \n     appropriations, offset by sequestration, results in a $51 \n     million shortfall in funding below minimum requirements. This \n     program has no flexibility to absorb such large cuts. It is \n     almost totally comprised of compensation to federal \n     defenders, rent, case related expenses (expert witnesses, \n     interpreters, etc.), and payments to private panel attorneys. \n     The only way to absorb the $51 million shortfall is to reduce \n     staffing or defer payments to private panel attorneys.\n       The Executive Committee examined all aspects of the \n     account, scrubbed expenses where possible, and approved a \n     spending plan that will result in federal defender offices \n     having to cut staff and furlough employees an average of \n     approximately 15 days. The approved spending plan will also \n     halt payments to private panel attorneys for the last 15 \n     business days of the fiscal year. This will shift these \n     expenses to FY 2014, which were not considered as part of the \n     Judiciary's FY 2014 budget request to Congress, and add to FY \n     2014 appropriation requirements.\n       The uncertainty of the availability of federal defender \n     attorneys and the anticipated suspension of panel attorney \n     payments will create the real possibility that panel \n     attorneys may decline to accept Criminal Justice Act \n     appointments in cases that otherwise would have been \n     represented by FDOs. Delays in the cases moving forward may \n     result in violations of constitutional and statutory speedy \n     trial mandates resulting in criminal cases being dismissed.\n       Since all non-case related expenses in this account have \n     already been reduced, the only solution to avoiding these \n     impacts is for Congress to provide additional funds.\n\n\n                      Supplemental Appropriations\n\n       The Judiciary transmitted to the Office of Management and \n     Budget and the Congress an FY 2013 emergency supplemental \n     request that seeks $72.9 million to mitigate the devastating \n     impact of sequestration on defender services, probation and \n     pretrial services offices, court staffing, and court \n     security. The request includes $31.5 million for the Courts' \n     Salaries and Expenses account, and $41.4 million for the \n     Defender Services account.\n       Courts' Salaries and Expenses:\n       $18.5 million will be used to avoid further staffing cuts \n     and furloughs in clerks of court and probation and pretrial \n     services offices during the fourth quarter of FY 2013. This \n     funding will save the jobs of approximately 500 court \n     employees and avoid 14,400 planned furlough days for 3,300 \n     court employees.\n       $13.0 million will restore half of the sequestration cuts \n     to drug testing and substance abuse and mental health \n     treatment services for defendants awaiting trial and \n     offenders released from prison.\n       Defender Services:\n       $27.7 million is required to avoid deferring payments to \n     private attorneys for the last 15 business days (3 weeks) of \n     the fiscal year.\n       $8.7 million is needed to avoid further staffing cuts and \n     furloughs in federal defender organizations during the fourth \n     quarter of FY 2013. This funding will save the jobs of \n     approximately 50 employees and avoid 9,600 planned furlough \n     days for 1,700 federal defender organization employees.\n       $5.0 million is for projected defense representation and \n     related expert costs for high-threat trials, including high-\n     threat cases in New York and Boston that, absent \n     sequestration, the Defender Services program would have been \n     able to absorb.\n       Executive branch agencies with criminal justice \n     responsibilities have had the flexibility and resources to \n     address their FY 2013 post-sequestration requirements. As a \n     result, these agencies--which directly impact the workload of \n     the Judiciary--have been able to avoid furloughs. The \n     Judiciary has no such flexibility and instead must ask \n     Congress to approve a supplemental appropriation.\n\n\n                   Cost Containment in the Judiciary\n\n       Cost containment is not new to the Judiciary. In 2004, as a \n     result of an unexpected shortfall in funding, the Judicial \n     Conference endorsed a cost containment strategy that called \n     for examining more than 50 court operations for reducing \n     expenses. Since then, the Judiciary has focused on three that \n     have the greatest potential for significant long-term \n     savings: rent, personnel expenses, and information \n     technology. To date, the Judiciary has cut costs by $1.1 \n     billion.\n       The Judiciary's approach to cost containment is to \n     continuously challenge our ways of doing business and to \n     identify, wherever possible, ways to economize even further. \n     This can be a painful process as we are often proposing \n     changes to long established Judiciary customs and practices \n     and we sometimes face opposition from within. But we are \n     committed to doing everything we can to conserve resources \n     and be good stewards of the taxpayers' money.\n       While cost containment has been helpful during the last \n     several years of flat budgets, it will not come close to \n     offsetting the major reductions we face from sequestration.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          Nomination Delays Hurting Courts, Federal Judge Says\n\n                (By Jim Mustian, Advocate staff writer)\n\n\n                    Long delays drive away nominees\n\n       U.S. District Judge James J. Brady spoke out Monday against \n     the increasingly glacial pace of judicial nominations, \n     calling on U.S. Senate leaders to ``come to their senses'' \n     and recognize the toll a vacant bench has on the court \n     system.\n       ``It's just crazy, and we need to do something about \n     that,'' said Brady, who sits in the Middle District of \n     Louisiana in Baton Rouge. ``What's happening, in my mind, is \n     we're driving away a lot of really good folks that would make \n     excellent judges because they're saying, `I don't need to go \n     through that process and be in limbo for 18, 20, 24 months.' \n     That's something I'm very, very concerned about.''\n       Brady's remarks, made to more than two dozen people \n     attending a Catholic Community Radio luncheon, came less than \n     a month after Baton Rouge attorney Shelly Dick was confirmed \n     as the Middle District's first female federal judge more than \n     a year after being nominated by President Barack Obama.\n       Dick's nomination was initially blocked by U.S. Sen. David \n     Vitter, who had been holding out hope that Obama would lose \n     to Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. Vitter, R-\n     La., who said at the time he wanted to ``let the people \n     speak,'' later withdrew his block and backed Dick's \n     confirmation after Obama won re-election months later.\n       Brady did not refer specifically to the delays in Dick's \n     confirmation, but he alluded to the strain the empty \n     judgeship had on a district overburdened with cases. Dick \n     already has been assigned nearly a third of the district's \n     877 pending civil cases, Brady said.\n       The federal Middle District of Louisiana includes the \n     parishes of East Baton Rouge, West Baton Rouge, East \n     Feliciana, West Feliciana, Pointe Coupee, Iberville, \n     Ascension, Livingston and St. Helena.\n       ``Getting a third judge has been a real relief for us,'' \n     Brady said. ``It helps people get their cases decided much \n     more promptly and, I think, in a much better fashion.''\n       Delays in judicial nominations due to political differences \n     have become increasingly common in recent years. During \n     Obama's first term, the average wait time from nomination to \n     confirmation was more than six months for nominees to circuit \n     and district court judgeships, according to a recent report \n     by the Congressional Research Service.\n\n[[Page S4448]]\n\n       ``It's gotten to be now that it's almost like you're going \n     to paint a big bullseye on anyone who's nominated as a \n     federal judge,'' said Brady, whose own confirmation in 2000 \n     took a little less than a year.\n       Then-President Bill Clinton nominated Brady for the \n     judgeship.\n       Brady suggested that concerns over district court nominees \n     are often overblown, noting he and his colleagues adhere to \n     parameters set forth by the higher circuit courts and U.S. \n     Supreme Court.\n       ``I don't care if you're a Democratic appointee or a \n     Republican appointee, you're going to follow those laws, the \n     precedents that those courts have set,'' Brady said. ``I \n     don't know of anyone that deliberately goes out and tries to \n     rule against those precedents.''\n       Brady's remarks were unusual for a federal judge but were \n     prompted by the ``unusual times'' gripping the federal \n     courts, said Carl W. Tobias, a University of Richmond law \n     professor who is an expert on judicial nominations.\n       ``An increasing number of judges and other people are very \n     concerned about the (nomination) process and how long it \n     takes to move people through it,'' Tobias said. ``You have \n     Exhibit A with Shelly Dick right there in Baton Rouge.''\n       Tobias said he was glad to hear of Brady speaking publicly \n     about the issue.\n       ``I think it's important for people to understand what's \n     going on, and nobody knows better than the judges,'' he said. \n     ``They have to live with it.''\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote for the \nnominees who are before the Senate today.\n  At this point in President Obama's term, when we get done with these \ntwo today, we will have approved 195 of the President's judicial \nappointments, and we have only disapproved 2. That is a 99-plus percent \nvoting record.\n  It would help if the President would speed up getting his nominees to \nthe Senate. There are 81 vacancies now. The President has only \nsubmitted 29. That means there are 52 vacancies that could be filled by \nthe White House that the Senate would have an opportunity to work on as \nwell.\n  So far this year, the Senate has confirmed 22 lower court nominees. \nToday, after these nominees are confirmed, we will have confirmed more \nthan twice the number of district and circuit judges that were \nconfirmed at this point in President Bush's second term. In fact, we \nwill have confirmed more lower-court nominees than were confirmed in \nthe entire first year of President Bush's second term.\n  Think about that--I will repeat it. In the 5 months of this \nPresident's second term while we have been in session, we have \nconfirmed more district and circuit judges than were confirmed in the \nentire first year of President Bush's second term.\n  The bottom line is that the Senate is processing the President's \nnominees exceptionally fairly. He is being treated much more fairly \nthan Senate Democrats treated President Bush in 2005.\n  So I just wanted to set the record straight before we vote on these \nnominees. I expect they will both be confirmed and I congratulate them \non their confirmations.\n  Judge Quinones received her B.B.A. from the University of Puerto Rico \nin 1972 and her J.D. from the University of Puerto Rico School of Law \nin 1975. Upon graduation, she worked as a staff attorney with Community \nLegal Services in Philadelphia, where she focused on strictly civil and \nadministrative matters, appearing predominately in family court and \nbefore administrative judges.\n  From 1977 to 1979, Judge Quinones wrote opinions in support of \ndecisions rendered by an Administrative Judge at the Department of \nHealth & Human Services. From 1979 to 1991, she was a staff attorney at \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, where her practice involved the \ninterpretation and application of the VA's administrative rules and \nregulations. During this time, she also appeared in State court and \nadministrative agencies to represent the VA before the Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission and Merit Systems Protection Board. \nAdditionally, from 1980 to 1991, Quinones worked as an arbitrator for \nthe Arbitration Center at the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, \ndesigned to dispose of small civil cases. In 1991, Judge Quinones left \nthe VA and established a solo practice. During this time she \nrepresented a criminal defendant and sat as an arbitrator in insurance \nmatters.\n  As a practicing attorney, Judge Quinones appeared in court with \noccasional frequency. She estimates that over the course of her pre-\njudicial career, she tried 20 cases in family court, 300 commitment \nhearings before a Mental Health officer, pursuant to her work at the \nVA, and 600 administrative hearings.\n  In 1990, Judge Quinones was nominated by then Governor Robert Casey \nto a judgeship on the Court of Common Pleas for the First Judicial \nDistrict of Pennsylvania, a court of general jurisdiction. She was \nconfirmed, but also engaged in a judicial election, and secured the \nfirst of three 10-year terms in 1992. She won the later terms in \nNovember 2001 and 2011.\n  Judge Quinones has experience in both criminal and civil divisions, \nhas presided over both jury and nonjury trials, and has supervised \nnearly every step in the trial process. Judge Quinones has presided \nover approximately 1,500 criminal trials and 300 civil trials.\n  The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary gave her a Majority ``Qualified'' and Minority ``Not \nQualified'' rating.\n  Judge Schmehl received his B.A. from Dickinson College in 1977 and \nhis J.D. from University of Toledo School of Law in 1980. Early in his \ncareer, he focused on criminal law, first as an Assistant Public \nDefender, then as an Assistant District Attorney. In these capacities, \nhe tried all types of criminal cases, from DUI to murder. During his \ntime as Assistant District Attorney, Judge Schmehl also had his own \nprivate civil practice, handling wills, estates, real estate matters, \nworkers' compensation cases, and unemployment compensation cases.\n  In 1986, Judge Schmehl left private practice and the District \nAttorney's office to join the private law firm Rhoda, Stoudt, & \nBradley. There he worked on insurance defense work and plaintiffs' \npersonal injury cases. As a practicing attorney, he has tried \napproximately 200 cases to verdict, judgment, or final decision, \nserving as sole counsel or chief counsel in almost all of them.\n  In 1997, Judge Schmehl was nominated by both the Democratic and \nRepublican parties for a judicial position in the Berks County Court of \nCommon Pleas and later elected to the bench. In 2007, he was appointed \nto a 5-year term as President Judge in the same court and remains there \ntoday. Judge Schmehl has presided over approximately 180 cases that \nhave gone to verdict.\n  The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary gave him a majority ``Well Qualified'' and minority \n``Qualified'' rating.\n  I also am going to take a couple minutes to discuss something I would \nhave discussed in the Judiciary Committee meeting this morning, but \nbecause of our vote I was not able to do it.\n  First, I want to talk about the nominations hearing we had earlier \nthis week on B. Todd Jones.\n  There is an open investigation in the Office of Special Counsel \nregarding very troubling allegations that Mr. Jones retaliated against \na whistleblower in the U.S. Attorney's Office.\n  He is now up for confirmation for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and \nFirearms.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains until the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Last week Carolyn Lerner, the special counsel who leads \nthe office, wrote us a letter explaining the status of the matter. She \nwrote that the parties had agreed to participate in mediation. She also \nwrote, ``If mediation is unsuccessful, the case would return to the \nOffice of Special Counsel's Investigation Prosecution Division for \nfurther investigation.''\n  On Monday, she wrote us another letter confirming that the case was \nstill open. We were told the reason we had to move forward with the \nhearing was because an April letter from the Office of Special Counsel \nwas made public. The justification for holding the hearing was since \nthat issue was made public, the nominee should have had an opportunity \nto respond at the hearing.\n  But, of course, there was nothing confidential in the Office of \nSpecial\n\n[[Page S4449]]\n\nCounsel's letter. I am not about to hide this issue from the public. It \nis relevant to our inquiry as to the qualifications of the nominee. \nMoving forward under these circumstances is not consistent with past \ncommittee practices. Of course, there are sensible reasons for that \ncommittee practice.\n  First, none of us knows what the results of that investigation might \nbe. How are we supposed to make an assessment of the matter while it is \nstill open? Second, how are we supposed to ask the nominee about the \nresults of the investigation when the investigation has not been \ncompleted? And, third, how are we supposed to ask the nominee about an \nopen investigation when the nominee will claim he cannot talk about it \nfor that exact reason?\n  I would also note that an assistant U.S. attorney who filed the \ncomplaint against Mr. Jones gave his consent on Monday for the Office \nof Special Counsel to provide the complaint to the committee. I must \nsay the allegations in the complaint are extremely troubling. So I \nbegan my questions by asking Mr. Jones about these allegations.\n  Here is what he had to say:\n\n       Because those complaints are confidential as a matter of \n     law I have not seen the substance of the complaints nor can I \n     comment on what they are. I have learned more from your \n     statement today--\n\nmeaning, from this Senator,\n\n     than what I knew before I came here this morning about the \n     nature and substance in the complaints.\n\n  In other words, Mr. Jones said he could not answer questions about \nthe Office of Special Counsel investigation because it remains open. \nThis is precisely why it is imprudent to move forward with a hearing in \nthis way. At his hearing, I followed up with another question to Mr. \nJones, had he ever taken adverse personnel action? He responded:\n\n       I'm not familiar with the OSC complaint. I'm at somewhat of \n     a disadvantage with the facts. I can say that the privacy act \n     considerations do fit into the picture.\n\n  As another followup, I asked him how we were supposed to ask about \nthe complaint if he would not answer it. Here is what Mr. Jones said:\n\n       Well, quite frankly, Senator, I'm at a disadvantage with \n     the facts. There is a process in place. I have not seen the \n     OSC complaints.\n\n  So we have a problem.\n  So again, even though there is an open investigation, we were told we \nwere going forward with the hearing so that Mr. Jones had an \nopportunity to answer the allegations. But whenever he was asked about \nit, he said he could not answer our questions because he had not seen \nthe Complaint.\n  So, my point about the hearing being premature was overwhelmingly \nproven.\n  I also want to make a few comments about Tony West, nominated to be \nthe Associate Attorney General. He is currently the Acting-Associate \nAttorney General and has generally done a good job. However, I remain \nconcerned about his time serving as the Assistant Attorney General for \nthe Civil Division.\n  He was involved in the quid pro quo deal between the Department and \nthe City of St. Paul, Minnesota that was orchestrated by Assistant \nAttorney General Tom Perez. That quid pro quo involved the Department \nagreeing to decline two False Claims Act cases pending against the City \nof St. Paul in exchange for the City dropping a case pending before the \nSupreme Court.\n  Perhaps the most concerning part to me is that Mr. West essentially \nlet Tom Perez take control of the Civil Division and cut this deal \nwhich hurt the whistleblower, Frederick Newell, leaving him to fight \nhis case all alone. This is not how I expect the Department to treat \ngood faith whistleblowers.\n  On top of all that, I believe it is contrary to the assurances that I \nwas given by Mr. West that he would protect whistleblowers and \nvigorously enforce the False Claims Act when we held his confirmation \nhearing in 2009. If this nominee is ultimately confirmed, I sincerely \nhope he does not let politics within the Department control, instead of \nsupporting good faith whistleblowers who stick their necks out.\n  I also wanted to address the nomination of Ms. Caproni, to be a \nDistrict Judge. I have concerns over the fact that I made a request to \nthe FBI over 6 years ago, asking for documents regarding exigent \nletters. In March 2007, Chairman Leahy and I requested copies of \nunclassified emails related to the use of National Security Letters \nissued by the FBI.\n  I only received a few of these emails, and they were heavily \nredacted, so in 2008 I asked for the rest. Ms. Caproni, was general \ncounsel of the FBI at the time and told me that the documents I was \nwaiting for were on her desk, awaiting her review.\n  Well, it is now 2013 and as of her hearing, I had never received \nthese documents.\n  I asked Ms. Caproni about this in her hearing and she had no specific \nrecollection of this request. So, I asked her again in writing. This \nled to a set of FOIA documents being produced, which are a poor \nsubstitute for properly answering a committee request. It also raises \nfurther questions as to why it took 6 years and why Ms. Caproni told me \nyears ago that she was working on responding to our request.\n\n  I have followed up with the FBI with specific requests regarding Ms. \nCaproni's involvement in the matter. Therefore, while I did not hold \nMs. Caproni's nomination in committee, I reserve my right to do so on \nthe Senate floor.\n  Concerning S. 394, the metal theft bill that we reported out this \nmorning, I appreciate the changes that the sponsors made at my request \nto the criminal portion of the bill. The nature of the offense is \nclarified, and limited to the federal interest of critical \ninfrastructure.\n  The bill also now requires criminal intent as an element of the \nproposed offense. The negligence standard in the bill has been \neliminated.\n  However, I still have a number of concerns with this bill. The \nreality is that theft is already illegal everywhere in the country.\n  So is receipt of stolen goods. That raises questions about the \nnecessity of a new federal offense.\n  The civil provisions are also duplicative of many State laws. The \nregulatory elements of this bill apply to any transaction in specified \nmetal products exceeding $100. In my opinion, $100 seems to be a very \nlow threshold.\n  We should not impose federal obligations unless the transaction is of \na significant amount.\n  States can enforce their own laws if they have enacted a lower \nthreshold.\n  Some of the recordkeeping requirements are of questionable value. For \ninstance, the recipient must record the license plate number and make \nof the car used to deliver the metal.\n  Although the sponsors agreed to reduce the maximum amount, the dealer \nstill faces up to a $5,000 penalty if he knowingly commits a paperwork \nviolation, unless it is minor. This is true even if the metal is not \nstolen. That strikes me as excessive.\n  And the sponsors declined to accept the changes that I sought in the \ncivil provision, especially as enforced by the state attorneys general.\n  Those provisions effectively allow a private right of action, even a \nclass action, to enforce these paperwork violations at up to $5,000 per \nviolation.\n  Not only can federal authorities enforce the bill's civil \nauthorities, but so can the States. If metal theft continues, then that \ndiffuse authority undermines the ability of citizens to hold \naccountable the responsible level of government.\n  This would allow the States to bring these cases in friendly State \ncourts and expand the number of cases by outsourcing them to private \nlawyers paid under contingency fees.\n  This leads to more enforcement than would occur if these cases had to \ncompete for attention with other priorities that state attorneys \ngeneral would bring.\n  Excessive government can derive not only from broad laws, but from \noverzealous enforcement. The bill sponsors rejected my request that \nsuits by the State AGs be filed only in federal court, and that any \nfederal actions would supersede them.\n  There should be transparency and accountability for these lawsuits \nthat are brought under authority of federal law.\n  I had amendments to discuss in markup, but will not do that here. \nHowever, when the full Senate takes up the bill, I will not be able to \nsupport it in its current form. I hope to work with the sponsors to \naddress the concerns I have with this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I am proud to be joined by Senators \nMurkowski, Crapo, and Murray in offering this bipartisan amendment. \nBorder security is one of the most important aspects of this bill, and \non both sides of the border, especially the northern border, the only \nway to secure the border is to involve State, local, and tribal law \nenforcement in that effort. Native-American lands and people are a \nvital but, unfortunately, an often overlooked part of our border \nsecurity plan. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Right \nnow, drug smuggling and trafficking in persons is happening on Indian \nreservations on our border, moving virtually unnoticed into America. \nThe problem, as the GAO told me in a recent report on this very topic, \nis a lack of communication and coordination between tribal and U.S. \nborder officials.\n  This amendment adds four tribal voices to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity Task Force, two from the northern border region and two from \nthe southern border region. As drafted, this task force included border \nsecurity experts from various government entities and is responsible \nfor solving problems related to border security. But somehow the tribal \nperspective was left out. Yet in Montana, the Blackfeet Reservation is \nbigger than the entire State of Delaware and it directly borders Canada \nfor 50 miles. The Fort Peck Reservation sits less than 30 miles from \nthe Canadian border. This amendment will increase communication and \nimprove coordination between the Federal and tribal governments that it \nrelies on to secure these borders. Adding a tribal representative to \nthat task force is the right thing to do and it is just plain common \nsense.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1228\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I call up to my pending amendment No. \n1228.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The text of the amendment is printed in the Record of June 12, 2013, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.''\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this amendment was in the group of four \nthat was the subject of the previous unanimous consent so I look \nforward to an ongoing debate and vote on this amendment, hopefully \nearly next week, because we need to start voting on this topic and on \namendments to this bill. The amendment is simple and in my opinion very \nimportant. It would mandate finally that we have an operational US-\nVISIT system to track visas coming into the country and exiting the \ncountry to guard against visa overstays.\n  This is an important part of security and enforcement, but one that \nis not talked about enough. We always talk about the border, as we \nshould. We often talk about workplace enforcement, as we should. That \nis extremely important. This is the third leg of the stool that we do \nnot talk about enough but we need to focus on because this goes to our \nnational security as well as border security.\n  The 9/11 terrorists all were individuals who came into this country \nlegally, with a visa, but what happened? They overstayed their visa by \na lot and they plotted to kill and destroy, which unfortunately they \nsuccessfully did on 9/11. Because of that, one of the top \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission was to implement this visa \nentry-exit system using biometric data. We call the system that has \nbeen developed the US-VISIT system. The problem is full implementation \nof the US-VISIT system has never come close to occurring as the 9/11 \nCommission recommended that it be executed.\n  This amendment says simply we are finally going to do it. We have \ntalked about it for years. We have lived through actual terrorist \nattacks that go to the heart of this need. The 9/11 Commission has \nrated it as a top recommendation, so we are finally going to do it. We \nare not going to move on to changing the legal status of current \nillegals in this country under this bill until we do it and until we \nverify that it has been done. That is a very simple idea.\n  I look forward to a continuing debate on this need, on this \namendment, and a vote on this amendment early next week.\n  Second, I also want to mention a point of order I will be making on \nthis underlying bill as soon as possible, hopefully also early next \nweek. The point of order is simple. It is a point of order against the \nemergency designation provision contained in the bill in\n\n[[Page S4451]]\n\nsection (d)(1). It is pursuant to section 403(e) of the fiscal year \n2010 budget resolution.\n  We all consider spending and debt a big problem in this country. We \nput enormous focus and energy and debate and discussion on that issue. \nThe problem is so often, after we set budget caps, after we set these \nlimits with the very serious spending and debt issue in mind, whenever \na big bill comes up they bust the caps. We put a so-called emergency \ndesignation on the spending and all of a sudden, like that, with that \nsimple phrase we exempt that entire bill from the spending caps, from \nthe provisions we have put in place to try to get spending and debt \nunder control.\n  This immigration reform bill is another example of that because it \nwould spend $8.3 billion and it calls all of that spending emergency \nspending. That is a sleight of hand. That is avoiding the caps and the \nlimits we have tried to put in place to begin to rein in spending and \ndebt.\n  This is not an emergency in any reasonable sense of the term. This is \nnot an unforeseen storm. This is not an unpredicted earthquake. This is \nnot an unpredicted attack on our country from a foreign power. This is \na problem, for sure, but we have annual spending bills and a whole \ndepartment of government that is supposed to be about this problem--the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. We have an annual Department of \nHomeland Security appropriations bill, so this is not something \nunforeseen, a true emergency. To call this $8.3 billion emergency \nspending is a pure sleight of hand to avoid the discipline of the \nspending caps.\n  At least on my side of the aisle, when this exact same point of order \nhas been made before on many other bills, we have upheld it. We have \nsaid: You are right, this is a sleight of hand. You are right, this is \nan end run around those budget provisions. You are right, this is just \nbusting the budget cap by another name.\n  We should do the same here. We should respect the budget law. We \nshould not do an end run around the budget caps. We should not \nessentially lie to the American people and say this is unforeseen, this \nis a true emergency, when it is not.\n  I will be raising this very important budget point of order regarding \nthe emergency designation of $8.3 billion of spending in the bill at \nthe earliest possible opportunity, when it is in order. I expect that \nto be early next week as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his suggestion?\n  Mr. VITTER. Yes, I withhold the quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I believe hope and fairness lie at the \ncore of what makes our country great. Fifty years ago, President \nKennedy called on the country to embrace civil rights legislation that \nwould end the unfair treatment of millions of people as second-class \ncitizens. Congress responded, and the country is better for it. This \nweek, we in the Senate are debating comprehensive immigration reform \nlegislation that gives hope to the millions of undocumented people who \nlive in this country that they will be able to emerge from the shadows \nand live full lives. It is our time to act. We should pass this \nimportant legislation.\n  I thank the Gang of 8, and their staff, for their hard work \nnegotiating the bill and getting it through committee and onto the \nfloor. They have set an example of bipartisanship on a tough issue that \nis all too rare these days.\n  I also thank Senator Leahy, and his staff, for his able leadership \nduring the markup. It was a remarkably open and fair process, full of \nprincipled debate. That is how the Senate should work.\n  Their hard work, and that of others, has produced the bill that is \nbefore us.\n  Many senators have already spoken about what is in the bill: the \nbillions of dollars for border security, the tough employment \neligibility verification requirements, the pro-tourism policies, and \nthe path to citizenship.\n  Rather than cover that ground again, I want to talk about two \nproblems with the bill that I hope can be fixed: first, the system \ndesigned for future immigration is unfair to women; and second, the \npathway to citizenship is unfair to immigrant taxpayers.\n  The new merit-based point system for allocating visas to future \nimmigrants is the first problem. Simply put, the point system \ninadvertently makes it harder for women than for men to come to this \ncountry.\n  The new point system is based on an attractive economic idea, but \nunfortunately one that clearly disadvantages women. The idea is if we \nwant a stronger economy, then we should give immigration preferences to \npeople who hold advanced degrees or work in high-skill jobs.\n  This idea ignores the discrimination women endure in other countries. \nWomen in too many other countries do not have the same education or \ncareer advancement opportunities available to men in those countries. \nIn practice, the bill's new point system takes that discriminatory \ntreatment abroad and cements it into our immigration laws, making it \nharder for women to come to our country than for men.\n  While unintentional in this case, the idea that we want to attract \nthe most educated and skilled people but they just happen to be mostly \nmen is the same argument used for generations to protect gender \ndiscrimination in our work places. We all want a stronger economy, but \nwe should not sacrifice the hard-won victories of the women's equality \nmovement to get it.\n  By contrast, the current family immigration system treats men and \nwomen equally. The current system is based on keeping families \ntogether. That system reflects our shared values about the social \nimportance of family. My family and millions of others also know the \nfamily system makes good economic sense.\n  Anyone, whether an immigrant or natural-born citizen, has a better \nchance of being successful if they are surrounded by a strong family \nthat can pool its resources to help start a business or to help one \nanother during tough times. In many families aunts and uncles, parents \nand grandparents, even brothers and sisters, use part of their \npaychecks every week to help a young man or a young woman in their \nfamily pay for college and take one step closer to that American dream. \nThat is how it worked in my family.\n  My mother brought my brothers and me to this country to escape an \nabusive marriage at the hands of my father. My mother raised me and my \nbrothers as a single parent, and times were tough for us. But with the \nhelp of my grandparents, who later joined us, I was able to learn \nEnglish and succeed in school. The amazing thing about this country is \nmillions of families have stories like mine.\n  If I had not been able to come to this country, who knows where I \nwould be today. But I know I would never have had the kind of \nopportunities given to me by this great country of ours. I want other \nwomen to have those chances too.\n  The biggest losers in this bill's new point system will be unmarried \nsisters of U.S. citizens. Why? Because the new system not only makes it \nharder for women to immigrate here, but it eliminates visas for \nsiblings of U.S. citizens while allowing new immigrants to bring their \nspouses. What this means is a woman who aspires to live with her family \nand work in the greatest country in the world should not have to get \nmarried to do that.\n  The future immigration system in the bill needs to be modified to \ngive unmarried women more opportunities to come here. There is more \nthan one way to fix this problem. One solution could be to restore the \nsibling category. I will file an amendment to do that. Another solution \ncould be to modify the point system in the bill. I am working with \nother Senators on an amendment to do that, which I hope will be ready \nsoon.\n  The second problem in this bill that needs to be fixed is how it \ntreats immigrant taxpayers. Make no mistake, immigrants pay taxes. A \nstudy released in May by researchers at Harvard and the City University \nof New York found that immigrants contributed $115.2 billion more to \nMedicare than they took out between 2002 and 2009.\n  Even undocumented immigrants pay taxes. A 2006 survey by UC-San Diego \nshowed that 75 percent of undocumented immigrants had taxes withheld \nfrom their paychecks, filed tax returns, or both. The Social Security \nAdministration estimates undocumented immigrants have contributed \nbetween $120\n\n[[Page S4452]]\n\nand $240 billion to the Social Security trust fund.\n  I have a fact sheet with citations of several studies about immigrant \ntaxpayers, and I ask unanimous consent that this fact sheet be printed \nin the Record following my remarks.\n  The bill makes clear that immigrants on the pathway to citizenship \nhave to continue working, paying taxes and other penalties, and meeting \nother requirements. In fact, they have to do all of this before they \ncan even start on the path to citizenship.\n  The Social Security Administration estimates the tax requirements in \nthis bill will raise more than $300 billion in payroll taxes alone. The \ngeneral fund will also receive more in tax revenues. Although we have \nnot yet seen CBO's official score, in all likelihood the Treasury \nDepartment will collect billions more in revenue for the general fund \nfrom these immigrants.\n  In his written testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on April \n22, 2013, Grover Norquist pointed out that once immigrants have lawful \nstatus and work authorization, they will be able to get better jobs and \ncontribute even more to the funding of Federal programs. He wrote that \nafter the 1986 immigration law was enacted, ``their incomes rose by an \naverage of 15 percent just by gaining legal status. Those immigrants \ntoday are making much more than they did then and, as a result, paying \nmore in taxes.''\n  My point is immigrant taxpayers contribute to the funding of not only \nMedicare and Social Security, but of all Federal programs. No one \ndisputes that it should be this way. Immigrants on the pathway must pay \ntaxes, just like everyone else. The strict tax requirements in the bill \nare the right policy.\n  What is wrong are the policies in the bill that prohibit immigrant \ntaxpayers who are on the pathway from being able to use Federal safety \nnet programs for at least 13 years. Their taxes pay for these programs, \nbut they cannot use these programs; that is profoundly unfair. Imagine \na person buys homeowner's insurance, but the policy won't cover their \nhouse if it catches fire until 13 years after they started paying their \npremiums. That is obviously not fair, but that is exactly the situation \nin which we are putting immigrants who are on the pathway to \ncitizenship.\n  Yesterday, the senior Senator from Utah spoke on the floor about \nseveral amendments he filed to further restrict immigrant taxpayers' \naccess to the programs their tax dollars pay for. He said:\n\n       I don't want to punish these immigrants. I simply want to \n     make sure they are treated no better or no worse than U.S. \n     citizens and resident aliens with respect to federal benefits \n     and taxes.\n\n  I have the greatest respect for the senior Senator from Utah. I agree \nwith him that these immigrants should be treated no worse than U.S. \ncitizens and resident aliens, but they are not being treated that way. \nThey are being treated worse because of the restrictions in this bill.\n  Under current law, immigrant taxpayers who are resident aliens cannot \nuse the Federal safety net programs they pay into for 5 years. Their \ntaxes are paid into the system for 5 years, but they get no help during \nthat time if their kids get sick or if they lose their jobs. That is \nalready unfair, but the bill treats immigrants on provisional status \neven worse. They have to pay taxes for 13 years before they can use the \nprograms they are paying for.\n  The 13-year-long pathway to citizenship will be hard enough. If they \nlose their job, they risk losing their legal status and being deported, \nwork hard to save up money, not just for the kids' school supplies but \nto pay the penalties under this bill. The restrictions on Federal \nsafety net programs make their pathway even more treacherous.\n  We are saying to these immigrants: Pay your taxes, but if your kids \nget sick, don't come to us for help. We are saying: Pay your taxes, but \nif you have to work part time because of a recession, don't come to us \nif you need some help putting food on the table. We are saying: Pay \nyour taxes, but we are not going to help you. That is not fair.\n  I want to be clear: I am talking only about immigrants who will be \nlawfully present. Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for these \nprograms at all and no one is proposing to change that, but the pathway \nprovides a way for certain people to earn lawful status. Let's treat \nlawfully present taxpayers fairly, including those on the pathway. \nLet's do as the Senator from Utah suggests and at the very least make \nsure they are treated no worse than U.S. citizens or resident aliens.\n  Finally, not only are the prohibitions in the bill unfair to \nimmigrant taxpayers, they are also bad economics. Both Republican and \nDemocratic Senators say they want immigrants to be successful, start \nbusinesses, and continue contributing to the economy. We all do. But \nfew people would use their life savings to start a business if they \nthink their children will go hungry or go without health care if their \nbusiness fails. The safety net programs exist so people can take risks \nto improve their economic circumstances.\n  Immigrants come to this country to work. They don't come to get \nhandouts. They come here to work. Two papers from the Cato Institute \nshow that immigrants are more likely to be working or looking for work \nthan natural-born citizens. Immigrants are less likely to use Federal \nsafety net programs.\n  The title of one Cato article sums it up nicely: ``Evidence Shows \nImmigrants Come to Work, Not to Collect Welfare.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these two papers be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  Both political parties should be able to support the idea that \ntaxpayers who are lawfully present, working, and paying taxes should be \nable to use the programs their taxes are paying for. That is only fair. \nI will file an amendment that says precisely that.\n  In closing, during the debates on immigration reform, I hope we \nremember who undocumented immigrants are. Like other immigrants, they \nhad the courage and aspiration to leave their hometowns and all they \nknew to find work elsewhere in order to give their kids better lives \nthan they could dream for themselves.\n  The undocumented should pay penalties for the laws they broke by \ncoming here, but we should remember that our Founding Fathers were \nwilling to break up an empire to achieve their dreams.\n  We are a Nation of immigrants. Let's treat immigrants how we would \nhave wanted our immigrant ancestors to be treated--with dignity and \nforgiveness.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Fact Sheet about Immigrant Taxpayers and the Hirono Amendment\n\n       Imagine you buy homeowner's insurance, but the policy won't \n     cover your house if it catches fire until 13 years after you \n     start paying premiums.\n       That's the situation that millions of immigrants will find \n     themselves under the immigration bill. Immigrants pay \n     hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes that contribute to \n     the funding of federal safety net programs like Medicaid, \n     CHIP, and SNAP, but they are prohibited from using them. \n     Current law prohibits legal immigrants from using these \n     programs for five years. And the immigration bill prohibits \n     immigrants on the path to citizenship from using these \n     programs for at least 13 years. Thirteen years is an entire \n     childhood.\n       It is unfair that immigrants pay for these programs but are \n     prohibited from using them if they lose their job or if their \n     kids get sick. If they pay for it, they should be able to use \n     it. We should not treat immigrants as second class citizens.\n       The Hirono amendment simply states that a person who is \n     lawfully present, working, and paying taxes, shall not be \n     prohibited from using any federal programs or tax credits \n     because of their immigration status.\n       Here are some facts about immigrant taxpayers:\n       Immigrants pay taxes. A study released in May by \n     researchers at Harvard and the City University of New York \n     found that immigrants are paying billions in taxes. \n     (``Immigrants Contributed An Estimated $115.2 Billion More to \n     the Medicare Trust Fund Than They Took Out in 2002-2009,'' \n     Health Affairs, May 2013)\n       Undocumented immigrants also pay taxes, both payroll taxes \n     and income taxes. A 2006 study by UC San Diego found that \n     ``75 percent of undocumented immigrants had taxes withheld \n     from their paychecks, filed tax returns, or both.'' (CBO \n     report, ``The Impact of Unauthorized Immigrants on the \n     Budgets of State and Local Governments,'' December 2007). The \n     Social Security Administration estimated that undocumented \n     immigrants contributed a net $12 billion to the Social \n     Security Trust Fund in 2010.\n       The path to citizenship will increase federal tax revenue. \n     Immigrants will have to continue paying taxes, and legal \n     status will allow them to move out of the shadows into\n\n[[Page S4453]]\n\n     higher paying jobs. Grover Norquist's written testimony to \n     the Senate Judiciary Committee on April 22, 2013: ``After the \n     legalization of immigrants during the Reagan amnesty, their \n     incomes rose by an average 15 percent just by gaining legal \n     status. Those immigrants today are making much more than they \n     did then and, as a result, paying more in taxes.'' In a \n     letter to Senator Rubio dated May 8, 2013, the Social \n     Security Administration's Chief Actuary estimated the \n     immigration reform bill will increase payroll tax collection \n     by more than $300 billion between 2014-2024.\n       Immigrants use federal safety net programs less often than \n     natural born citizens, and when they use them their average \n     costs are less than for natural born citizens. Immigrants are \n     also more likely to be working or looking for work. See Cato \n     Institute papers ``Poor Immigrants Use Public Benefits at a \n     Lower Rate than Poor Native-Born Citizens,'' March 2013 and \n     ``Evidence Shows Immigrants Come to Work, Not to Collect \n     Welfare,'' August 2010.\n       Even Grover Norquist warns against believing ``Baseless \n     Criticisms'' in flawed analyses about the costs of immigrants \n     use of safety net programs. His written testimony cited above \n     cautions against analyses that ``exaggerat[e] public benefit \n     costs by citing household costs, rather than individual \n     immigrant costs'' or ``portray[] impossible levels of welfare \n     use.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Cato Institute, Mar. 4, 2013]\n\n Poor Immigrants Use Public Benefits at a Lower Rate Than Poor Native-\n                             Born Citizens\n\n                    (By Leighton Ku and Brian Bruen)\n\n       Low-income immigrants use public benefits like Medicaid or \n     the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly \n     the Food Stamp Program) at a lower rate than low-income \n     native-born citizens.\\1\\ Many immigrants are ineligible for \n     public benefits because of their immigration status. \n     Nonetheless, some claim that immigrants use more public \n     benefits than the native born, creating a serious and unfair \n     burden for citizens.\\2\\ This analysis provides updated \n     analysis of immigrant and native-born utilization of \n     Medicaid, SNAP, cash assistance (Temporary Assistance for \n     Needy Families and similar programs), and the Supplemental \n     Security Income (SSI) program based on the most recent data \n     from the Census Bureau's March 2012 Current Population Survey \n     (CPS).\n       Low-income (family income below 200% of poverty line) non-\n     citizen children and adults utilize Medicaid, SNAP, cash \n     assistance, and SSI at a generally lower rate than comparable \n     low-income native-born citizen children and adults, and the \n     average value of public benefits received per person is \n     generally lower for non-citizensthan for natives. Because of \n     the lower benefit utilization rates and the lower average \n     benefit value for low-income non-citizen immigrants, the cost \n     of public benefits to non-citizens is substantially less than \n     the cost of equivalent benefits to the native-born.\n\n\n             background on immigrants in the United States\n\n       About 40 million immigrants reside in the United States, \n     comprising 12.9 percent of the total population.\\3\\ Of those \n     immigrants, 43.8 percent are naturalized citizens and 56.3 \n     percent are non-citizens--including undocumented \n     immigrants.\\4\\ Immigrants are more likely to participate in \n     the labor force,\\5\\ lack a high school degree,\\6\\ and to have \n     incomes below the poverty line than the native-born.\\7\\ \n     Immigrants begin with lower earnings but over time their \n     incomes improve as they remain here.\\8\\\n\n\n          immigrant eligibility for public assistance benefits\n\n       Immigrants' eligibility for public benefits is based on \n     specific aspects of their immigration status and state \n     policies.\\9\\ Some key elements of the rules are:\n       Citizenship. Naturalized citizens and U.S.-born children in \n     non-citizen families are citizens. They are fully eligible \n     for public benefits like Medicaid, the Children's Health \n     Insurance Program (CHIP), SNAP, cash assistance, and SSI, if \n     they meet other program eligibility criteria.\\10\\\n       Refugees and Asylees. Immigrants granted refugee or asylee \n     status are generally eligible for public benefits if they \n     meet program eligibility criteria.\n       Lawful Permanent Residents. Lawful permanent residents \n     (LPRs) must wait at least five years before they are eligible \n     for benefits, but states have the option of providing them \n     earlier.\\11\\ After five years, LPRs are eligible for federal \n     benefits if they meet the program eligibility criteria. As \n     exceptions, LPR children have been eligible for SNAP benefits \n     since 2003 and states have been able to restore Medicaid \n     benefits for children and pregnant women since 2009.\n       Temporary/Provisional Immigrants. Temporary immigrants \n     (e.g., work or student visa holders) are generally ineligible \n     for public benefits, including the youth who are categorized \n     as ``Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.''\n       Undocumented Immigrants. Undocumented immigrants are \n     generally ineligible for the public assistance programs \n     mentioned above.\\12\\\n       Immigrant-related eligibility restrictions do not apply to \n     some programs, such as the National School Lunch Program, the \n     Women, Infants and Children Nutrition Program (WIC), and Head \n     Start.\n       The unit of assistance (benefits received on an individual \n     or family basis) and eligibility varies across programs. For \n     Medicaid, CHIP, and SSI, benefits are provided to individuals \n     and eligibility is individually determined. Thus many U.S.-\n     born children in immigrant families receive health insurance \n     through Medicaid or CHIP, but their non-citizen parents do \n     not. SNAP and cash assistance provide household-level \n     benefits. In many immigrant families, some family members are \n     ineligible non-citizen immigrants, so the household SNAP \n     allotment or cash assistance check is reduced. For example, \n     if a very poor three-person family is composed of two LPR \n     parents who have been here for two years and an American-born \n     child, the benefit level is computed only using the child, \n     not the ineligible parents.\n\n\n                                results\n\n       Medicaid/CHIP. Figure 1 shows that more than one-quarter of \n     native citizens and naturalized citizens in poverty receive \n     Medicaid, but only about one in five non-citizens do so. \n     Figure 2 shows that about two-thirds of low-income citizen \n     children receive health insurance through Medicaid or CHIP, \n     while about half of non-citizen children do so. Low-income \n     non-citizen immigrants are the least likely to receive \n     Medicaid or CHIP.\n       A major reason for these gaps is strict benefit eligibility \n     barriers for many immigrants. Benefit use by poor immigrants \n     was low even before the 1996 welfare reform, suggesting that \n     eligibility factors are not the only reason for low levels of \n     benefit use by non-citizen immigrants.\\13\\\n       Figure 3 shows that immigrants who receive Medicaid or CHIP \n     tend to have lower per beneficiary medical expenditures than \n     native-born people, reducing the government cost of their \n     benefits.\\14\\ Immigrant adults who received Medicaid or CHIP \n     benefits in 2010 had annual expenditures about a quarter \n     lower than adult natives. Immigrant children had average \n     annual Medicaid expenditures that were less than one-half \n     those of native-born children. Generally, immigrants have \n     lower per capita medical expenditures than the native-born, \n     regardless of type of insurance.\\15\\\n       Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Figure 4 \n     shows that among low-income adults, 33 percent of native \n     citizens, 25 percent of naturalized citizens, and 29 percent \n     of non-citizens received SNAP benefits in 2011.\\16\\ Figure 5 \n     shows that about half of poor citizen children in citizen \n     households receive SNAP, compared to about one-third of non-\n     citizen children and two-fifths of citizen children in non-\n     citizen-headed families. It is likely that the actual \n     percentage of SNAP eligible non-citizen immigrants is even \n     lower, but the gaps in the CPS data prevent us from knowing \n     how large the gap is. Figure 6 shows that the average annual \n     SNAP benefits per household member are about one-fifth lower \n     for non-citizens than native adults or citizen children with \n     citizen parents.\n       Cash Assistance and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). \n     Figure 7 shows that the SSI receipt was higher for native and \n     naturalized citizens than non-citizen immigrants.\\17\\ Figure \n     8 shows that children in households with non-citizen family \n     members are less likely to be in house-holds receiving cash \n     assistance or SSI than citizen children living in full-\n     citizen households.\n       Figure 9 shows that average annual cash assistance and SSI \n     benefits for the native-born, naturalized, and non-citizens \n     were very similar. In contrast, Figure 10 shows that the \n     value of these benefits per household member was lowest for \n     children living in non-citizen households. The cash \n     assistance benefit for citizen children in non-citizen \n     families was 13 percent lower, and the cash assistance for \n     non-citizen children was 22 percent lower compared to citizen \n     children with citizen parents. The average SSI benefit was 30 \n     percent to 33 percent lower for children in non-citizen \n     families and non-citizen children than for citizen children \n     in citizen families.\n\n\n                           comparing studies\n\n       A study by the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) found \n     that immigrant-headed households with children used more \n     Medicaid than native-headed households with children and had \n     higher use of food assistance, but lower use of cash \n     assistance.\\18\\ The CIS study did not examine the average \n     value of benefits received per recipient.\n       There are several reasons why our study differs from CIS's \n     study. First, CIS did not adjust for income, so the percent \n     of immigrants receiving benefits is higher in their study in \n     part because a greater percent of immigrants are low-income \n     and, all else remaining equal, more eligible for benefits. \n     Non-citizens are almost twice as likely to have low incomes \n     compared with natives.\\19\\ We focus on low-income adults and \n     children because public benefit programs are means-tested and \n     intended for use by low-income people. It is conventional in \n     analyses like these to focus on the low income because it \n     reduces misinterpretations about benefit utilization.\n       Second, CIS focused on households headed by immigrants \n     while we focus on individuals by immigration status. Our \n     study focuses on individuals because immigrant-headed \n     households often include both immigrants and citizens. Since \n     citizen children constitute the bulk of children in \n     immigrant-headed households and are eligible for benefits, \n     CIS's method of using the immigrant-headed household as the \n     unit of analysis systematically inflates immigrants' benefit \n     usage. For example, 30 percent of U.S children receiving \n     Medicaid or CHIP benefits are\n\n[[Page S4454]]\n\n     children in immigrant-headed families and 90 percent of those \n     children are citizens.\\20\\\n       Third, CIS focused on immigrants in general, including \n     naturalized citizens, while we also included non-citizen \n     immigrants. Naturalized citizens are accorded the same access \n     to public benefits as native-born citizens and are more \n     assimilated, meaning their opinions of benefit use are more \n     similar to those of native born Americans. Separating non-\n     citizens from naturalized Americans gives a clearer picture \n     of which immigrant groups are actually receiving benefits.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       Low-income non-citizen adults and children generally have \n     lower rates of public benefit use than native-born adults or \n     citizen children whose parents are also citizens. Moreover, \n     when low-income non-citizens receive public benefits, the \n     average value of benefits per recipient is almost always \n     lower than for the native-born. For Medicaid, if there are \n     100 native-born adults, the annual cost of benefits would be \n     about $98,400, while for the same number of non-citizen \n     adults the annual cost would be approximately $57,200. The \n     benefits cost of non-citizens is 42 percent below the cost of \n     the native-born adults. For children, a comparable \n     calculation for 100 non-citizens yields $22,700 in costs, \n     while 100 citizen children of citizen parents cost $67,000 in \n     benefits. The benefits cost of non-citizen children is 66 \n     percent below the cost of benefits for citizen children of \n     citizen parents.\n       The combined effect of lower utilization rates and lower \n     average benefits means that the overall financial cost of \n     providing public benefits to non-citizen immigrants and most \n     naturalized immigrants is lower than for native-born people. \n     Non-citizen immigrants receive fewer government benefits than \n     similarly poor natives.\n\n\n                               end notes\n\n       This is a condensed version of Leighton Ku and Brian Bruen, \n     ``The Use of Public Assistance Benefits by Citizens and Non-\n     citizen Immigrants in the United States,'' Cato Working \n     Paper, February 19, 2013, http://www.cato.org/publications/\nworking-paper/usepublic-assistance-benefits-citizens-non-\ncitizen-immigrants-united.\n       1.

CPS data do not indicate which particular household \n     members receive SNAP benefits, so all that can be determined \n     is that a household received SNAP and that some members of \n     the household are immigrants and some are not.

Ibid.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From the Cato Institute, Aug. 2010]\n\n     Evidence Shows Immigrants Come to Work, Not To Collect Welfare\n\n                          (By Stuart Anderson)\n\n       Some oppose immigration because they believe immigrant use \n     of welfare demonstrates immigrants do not assimilate in \n     America. Others argue the immigrant work ethic remains strong \n     and that immigrants do not come here to get on the dole. \n     Examining data and eligibility rules provides an answer as to \n     who is right on this issue.\n       Welfare and immigration is a combustible topic. In many \n     ways, the issue is less fiscal than emotional. Americans \n     treat the concept of newcomers arriving in America and \n     immediately receiving government handouts as akin to an in-\n     law moving into their basement and refusing to look for a \n     job. It's not so much the cost as the principle of the thing. \n     The good news is there is little evidence that immigrants \n     come to America to go on welfare, rather than to work, flee \n     persecution or join family members in the United States.\n       To evaluate whether immigrants come here to be on the dole \n     one has to examine several aspects of the issue. First, it is \n     necessary to look at the eligibility rules for immigrants, \n     which are complicated and were overhauled in 1996. Second, \n     one should evaluate their level of workforce participation, \n     since if immigrants are working, then they are not bursting \n     the welfare rolls. And third, we should compare native and \n     immigrant use of welfare programs. Similar benefit use rates \n     would indicate immigrants are not becoming fiscal burdens on \n     other residents of the country.\n\n\n          ELIGIBILITY RULES ARE TIGHT FOR ARRIVING IMMIGRANTS\n\n       Upon first arriving in the country, immigrants are \n     generally ineligible for federal means-tested benefits \n     programs. With the exception of refugees, eligibility for \n     programs usually requires immigrants to have been in the \n     United States for 5 years or more in a lawful immigrant \n     status.\n       In 1996, Congress changed the rules for immigrant benefit \n     eligibility as part of a broader reform of the nation's \n     welfare laws. The tighter regulations resulted in a decrease \n     in immigrant welfare use. ``There were substantial declines \n     between 1994 and 1999 in legal immigrants' use of all major \n     benefit programs: TANF or Temporary Assistance for Needy \n     Children (down 60 percent), food stamps (down 48 percent), \n     SSI (down 32 percent), and Medicaid (down 15 percent),'' \n     according to a 2003 report by the Urban Institute.\\1\\\n\n[[Page S4455]]\n\n       Even before the changes in the law, there was little \n     support for the view that individual immigrants were more \n     likely to be on welfare than natives.\\2\\ One of the \n     difficulties in measuring welfare use is that eligibility for \n     some benefits are geared toward individuals and others are \n     based on family, and families may live in households that go \n     beyond two spouses and their children. If one labels a \n     household as ``using welfare'' even when only one person in a \n     house is receiving benefits, then it is likely to inflate the \n     data on welfare use for immigrants, since the foreign-born \n     tend to maintain larger households. On the other hand, such a \n     calculation could capture data on a U.S. citizen child born \n     to immigrant parents.\n       At the state level, eligibility rules differ and can be \n     less restrictive than federal rules. Moreover, a child born \n     in America is a U.S. citizen and can receive benefits if he \n     or she meets a program's eligibility criteria, regardless of \n     a parent's immigration status.\n       If immigrants have been seeking states with lenient benefit \n     eligibility, then they're not doing a good job. Author and \n     Wall Street Journal editorial writer Jason Riley notes many \n     states with recent large increases in their immigrant \n     populations, such as Arkansas, North Carolina, South \n     Carolina, Utah and Georgia, are primarily states with low and \n     below average social spending.\\3\\\n       Prior to the 1996 reforms, there was concern that non-\n     citizen parents were making excessive use of SSI \n     (Supplemental Security Income). With the exception of \n     refugees and other ``humanitarian immigrants,'' veterans, \n     active duty military and their families, and certain Native \n     Americans born abroad, Congress enacted a complete ban on SSI \n     for non-citizens who enter the United States after August 22, \n     1996.\\4\\ Lawful permanent residents with credit for 40 \n     quarters of work history in the U.S. can receive SSI once \n     they have been in ``qualified'' status for 5 years or more.\n       In 1995, 3.2 percent of non-citizens used SSI, compared to \n     1.3 percent in 2006. Similarly, Congress barred most non-\n     citizens arriving after August 22, 1996, from using food \n     stamps, although this was modified in 2002 to allow non-\n     citizen children and certain other lawfully residing \n     immigrants to use food stamps. In general, a sponsor of an \n     immigrant can be ``required to reimburse the government for \n     any means-tested public benefit the alien has received,'' \n     notes attorney Susan Fortino-Brown.\\5\\\n\n\n         WORKFORCE PARTICIPATION RATES: IMMIGRANTS AND NATIVES\n\n       Immigrant men, ages 18 to 64, are more likely to work than \n     native-born Americans. According to 2004 Census data analyzed \n     by the Pew Hispanic Center, the labor force participation \n     rate for legal immigrant males in that age group is 86 \n     percent, compared to 83 percent for native-born males (see \n     Table 1.) The rate is even higher--92 percent--for illegal \n     immigrant males. Immigrant women are more likely to be \n     married and have children, according to Census data, and this \n     leads to a lower labor force participation rate--64 percent \n     for legal immigrant women vs. 73 percent for native-born \n     women.\\6\\\n\n\n                  NATIVE VS. IMMIGRANT USE OF WELFARE\n\n       An analysis of Census data released by the House Ways and \n     Means Committee indicate the proportion of natives, non-\n     citizens and naturalized citizens who use AFDC/TANF (Aid to \n     Families with Dependent Children/Temporary Assistance for \n     Needy Children), Medicaid and food stamps is similar for the \n     three groups. More important, the data show the vast majority \n     of immigrants are not receiving these types of public \n     benefits. Less than 1 percent of naturalized citizens and \n     non-citizens in 2006 received benefits under TANF.\\7\\\n       The data tell the story:\n       In 2006, 0.6 percent of natives used AFDC/TANF, compared to \n     0.3 percent of naturalized citizens and 0.7 percent for non-\n     citizens.\n       For Medicaid: 13.1 percent of natives used Medicaid, \n     compared to 10.8 percent of naturalized citizens and 11.6 \n     percent of non-citizens.\n       For SSI, which most natives would not use because they are \n     eligible for Social Security benefits, 1.6 percent of natives \n     used SSI (Supplemental Security Income) in 2006, compared to \n     3.0 percent of naturalized citizens and 1.3 percent of non-\n     citizens. (See Table 7.1.)\n       And 7.7 percent of natives used the Food Stamp program, \n     compared to 3.9 percent of naturalized citizens and 6.2 \n     percent of non-citizens.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n       Concerns about immigrant welfare use do not represent valid \n     grounds for supporting reductions in legal immigration. Nor \n     is it reasonable to oppose a better approach to addressing \n     illegal immigration, such as by instituting new temporary \n     visa categories. Historically, immigrants have come to \n     America not for a handout, but in search of opportunity. \n     There is no reason to think this will change.\n\n\n                                endnotes\n\n       1.

Mr. President, Monday was a sad day for my home State of \nNevada. This week we learned that Congresswoman Barbara Vucanovich \npassed away in Reno just a few weeks after her 92nd birthday. As the \nfirst woman elected to represent Nevada in Congress, Barbara was a \ndedicated and effective legislator, admired by her colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle. As the first person to represent Nevada's 2nd \nCongressional District--a district I was privileged to represent in the \nHouse of Representatives--Barbara was a role model to countless \nNevadans. She exemplified the highest standards of public service. \nMoreover, Barbara was a dear friend.\n  When I came to Washington for the very first time, Barbara invited me \nto join her for lunch, even though I was a total stranger. It was a \nkind and considerate gesture I will never forget. Even today, when \nconstituents come to Washington to visit, I tell them the story about \nBarbara and how I aspire to the high standards she set.\n  During her seven terms in Congress, she was a vigorous advocate for \nimportant issues, including breast cancer research and was herself a \nbreast cancer survivor. As chairwoman of the House Subcommittee on \nMilitary Construction--at the time one of only two women ever to serve \nas chairman of an appropriations subcommittee--she was a strong and \neffective voice for America's men and women in uniform, and she played \na pivotal role in protecting Nevada's vast resources while serving on \nthe House Interior Committee, helping to create the Great Basin \nNational Park.\n  Barbara served in Congress at a time when Members of different \nparties could come together and find solutions for the American people. \nShe served at a time when compromise and common sense guided \ndecisionmaking, when results were more important than petty \npartisanship, and the same was certainly true of Barbara.\n  Barbara was a devoted mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother. She \nwas an admired and beloved public servant, a patriot, a proud Nevadan, \nand a dear friend.\n  My heart goes out to her family and friends during this difficult \ntime. My wife Lynne and I join our fellow Nevadans in remembering the \ninspirational life and legacy of Barbara Vucanovich.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time to speak in strong \nsupport of the immigration bill currently on the floor of the Senate.\n  First and foremost, we need an immigration system that is fair. We \nare a nation of immigrants. My grandparents came to this country \nseeking a new life for their family. Our story is similar to the story \nof millions of other families in this country.\n  Immigration is very important for our country. It is important for \nour\n\n[[Page S4456]]\n\neconomy. We need highly skilled workers who can innovate, create, and \nmove our country forward. All of our workers should be protected under \nour laws and not just some.\n  We also need strong border security. We need to know who is coming \ninto this country, and we must make sure we have a legal system that \nprotects the homeland.\n  So we need a balance. For immigration reform we need a balance \nbetween border security and lawful employment and a pathway to \ncitizenship and the ability to lawfully remain in this country for \nthose who are currently undocumented. The legislation before us creates \nthat balance. I wish to compliment my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle who have brought forward this package. It is not what any one of \nus would have written, but it does balance the security of our country \nwith border security and a lawful system for employment with the \nrealities of 11 million people currently living in the shadows who will \nhave an opportunity to remain in this country in a lawful way, to be \nable to work and ultimately become citizens of America. But those \nindividuals have to earn their way. They have to pay taxes, learn \nEnglish, be law-abiding, and they cannot break into the line. They have \nto go to the end of the line.\n  This is a fair bill. This is a bill that at long last fixes the \nbroken system we have in this country.\n  Over the past months, I have held a number of immigration roundtables \nthroughout the State of Maryland. At the Lutheran Immigration and \nRefugee Service in Baltimore we discussed the importance of \nstreamlining the process in refugee and asylum cases and eliminating \nbarriers to family unification.\n  We discussed the need for strong provisions to prevent human \ntrafficking and to make sure the U.S. labor protections apply to all \nimmigrant workers. We talked about making sure we have a realistic 10-\nyear pathway to citizenship that can be both started and finished in a \nworkable manner by undocumented immigrants. All those issues have been \naddressed in the bipartisan bill that is currently before the Senate.\n  I held this similar discussion at CASA of Maryland in Hyattsville. We \ndiscussed the DREAM Act recently approved by the voters in Maryland and \nthe DREAM Act provisions that are pending in the bill before the \nSenate. The group stressed the importance of family reunification and \nthe need to create a workable pathway to citizenship for undocumented \nimmigrants. We discussed the need to clear up and eliminate the backlog \nof legal immigrants waiting in the system so the undocumented \nimmigrants do not have to jump ahead in line.\n  That is what this bill does. It provides the resources so we can \nprocess those who are currently in the system in a fair manner, which \nis in the best interests of this country and the best interests of \nthose who are currently caught in this backlog. The bill provides for \nan orderly way to consider legal immigration and to deal with those who \nare currently undocumented as they come into our system.\n  These roundtables were important for me to hold to hear directly from \nMarylanders who are affected by the immigration policy decisions we \nmake in the Senate. Maryland, as well as the United States, has a long \nand proud tradition of welcoming immigrants, and our Nation is truly a \nnation of immigrants. According to the Immigration Policy Center and \nU.S. Census Bureau statistics, foreign-born immigrants make up roughly \n1 in 7 Marylanders--14 percent of our population. More than a quarter \nof Maryland's scientists were foreign born, as were roughly one-fifth \nof our health care practitioners, mathematicians, and computer \nspecialists. According to the Migration Policy Institute, the number of \nimmigrants in Maryland with a college degree increased nearly 70 \npercent between 2000 and 2011.\n  My point here is that immigrants contribute to the growth of America. \nThey help us develop the innovations of tomorrow that will create the \njobs of tomorrow. They help solve the problems we have today. They help \nour economy grow. That is what has made America strong.\n  According to the Urban Institute, immigrant households paid nearly \none-fifth--or $4 billion--of all taxes collected in Maryland, including \nFederal income taxes, Social Security, and Medicare taxes; State \nincome, sales, and auto taxes; and local property, income, sales, auto, \nand utility taxes.\n  I hope we can keep these facts and statistics in mind as we enter \ninto this historic debate on how to overhaul our Nation's immigration \nlaws. We should avoid stereotypes and generalizations in this debate.\n  But more importantly, I want to put a human face on these facts and \nstatistics, so I am going to share two stories of individuals who came \nin contact with our office. These two are representative of literally \nmillions of people. We hear the numbers, but when we listen to the \nstories and look at the faces of people involved, we know we have to \nact.\n  The first is about Yves Gerald Gomes, 20 years of age, who was \noriginally from India. I quote him:\n\n       My own story started in 1994, when I came to this country \n     in the arms of my parents. I was only a year and a half. My \n     parents came from India and Bangladesh, hoping to provide me \n     with opportunities, something they didn't have growing up in \n     poverty in their homes. My earliest memories in life are \n     growing up in MD in the basement of my great aunt and great \n     uncle's house and learning English from their children (my \n     older cousins) by watching Fresh Prince of Bel Air and Full \n     House. Soon after, in 1995, my brother was born.\n       My parents had an ongoing asylum case, which was denied in \n     2006. But over that 12 year span, my father worked hard as a \n     hotel server in order to help my mother pay for her college \n     education and for us to live comfortably; growing up I felt \n     as though I was just like any of my middle-class, American \n     peers from school. But in 2006, we became ``undocumented.'' \n     Our work permits could no longer be renewed, so my father was \n     forced to quit his job at the hotel, and my mother had to \n     resign her tenure as a college professor, and surrender her \n     PhD studies in computer sciences. In 2008, our home was \n     raided by ICE, a few days after my dad was pulled over one \n     night for driving with a busted taillight in Baltimore. \n     Ultimately both of my parents were deported in 2009. I faced \n     my own deportation in 2010, but was able to remain in the US \n     because of the [hard] work of my lawyer . . . the support of \n     my friends, church community, [and] the media. . . .\n       It will be 5 years since my brother and I have last seen \n     our parents. Currently my brother and I live with the same \n     great aunt, great uncle and cousin with whom we resided when \n     my family first came to US. It was disheartening when my \n     parents missed my own high school graduation, and it will \n     again be disheartening when they will miss my younger \n     brother's high school graduation. . . .\n       Moreover, the pain of separation resonates to our extended \n     family too. My mother treated my great-aunt and great-uncle, \n     naturalized US citizens for 40+ years, like her own parents, \n     and she cannot be here to take care of them in their old age. \n     Their son, my cousin (a US citizen) has a degenerative muscle \n     disease which prevents him from traveling. If immigration \n     reform does not happen, it's possible he will never get to \n     see my father, whom he treats like his older brother, ever \n     again.\n       I will graduate from the University of Maryland College \n     Park in 3 semesters with my undergraduate degree in \n     Biochemistry, and I really hope that my parents will be there \n     to see me walk across the stage. For myself and millions of \n     others, immigration reform means a pathway to pursue our \n     dreams and give back to American society, our home; \n     personally, I want to enter into the field of medical \n     research or pharmacy. Moreover, for myself and so many \n     others, immigration reform means the hope of being reunited \n     with family members, and also it means no longer having to \n     wake up every morning with the constant fear of deportation.\n       I have lived in the United States since I was a year old. \n     This is the only country I have ever known as my home. \n     Despite all the challenges my family has faced, I still love \n     the United States, and have always considered myself to be \n     American at heart. I hope that after this year, I can be an \n     American on paper too.\n\n  Let me tell one more story. I could read from other letters we have \nreceived. I am sure the Presiding Officer has the same situation. We \nhave all heard from people in our communities.\n  Let me talk about Raymond, who was originally from the Philippines. I \nquote him:\n\n       My family and I came to the United States in hopes and \n     dreams of a better life; we left everything behind in the \n     Philippines in pursuit of the ``American Dream.'' At the age \n     of nine, assimilating to the American culture was not \n     difficult; naturally I felt as though I was just like \n     everyone else. Or so I thought. The harsh reality of being \n     undocumented hit me my senior year of high school when I came \n     home from an invitational track meet where I was scouted and \n     offered scholarships. I was so excited to tell my parents the \n     great news; to this day I still remember the proud look on my \n     father's face. My mother on the other hand suddenly broke\n\n[[Page S4457]]\n\n     down in tears. . . . I was confused as to why she was asking \n     for forgiveness, she began to explain that we were \n     undocumented and due to my immigration status I would not be \n     able to accept the scholarships. Finally hitting that wall \n     made me realize that all my hard work would amount to \n     nothing.\n       For as long as I could remember my family has constantly \n     faced financial struggles, but somehow we always found a way \n     to make ends meet. My father, who was once a successful \n     businessman, was forced to work odd jobs such as landscaping, \n     delivery, and driving a taxi. My mother, who was once a nurse \n     practitioner, works multiple jobs from cleaning houses, \n     babysitting, and taking care of the elderly. My sister who is \n     only two years older than me, made the sacrifice of not going \n     to college so that I would be able to, and she works any job \n     that comes her way. They all work day in and day out to make \n     sure there's food on the table, clothes on my back, and a \n     roof over our heads. I know that if my parents were able to \n     work legally in the US in business and nursing, we would not \n     struggle as much, and we would be able to contribute much \n     more to the US economy. Yet, because of our current broken \n     immigration system, our hard work does not pay dividends.\n       In 2011, I became involved in the campaign for the Maryland \n     DREAM Act . . . which involved grassroots organizing. At this \n     point I realized that no longer would I stay silent in the \n     shadows, I had to let my voice be heard and take a stand \n     against this injustice that my community and I faced. \n     Throughout the campaign I realized that even as youth we can \n     still bring forth change, which is why to this day I continue \n     to fight for my family and all 11 million undocumented \n     immigrants in the US.\n       In this year's push for Comprehensive Immigration Reform, \n     no one will be left behind; we must stand united and battle \n     this suppression. In the words of Martin Luther King Jr. \n     ``Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.''\n\n  I could bring up many other stories, put faces on these numbers, \nbecause I think we need to do that. This immigration bill is for the \ntwo persons whom I just talked about, their families, and the 11 \nmillion. It is for this Nation.\n  There is bipartisan agreement that our Nation's immigration and \nborder security system is broken and must be fixed. We must ensure our \nborders are secure and that we know who is coming and going from the \nNation. At the same time we must find a tough but fair process that \nallows the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United \nStates to come out of the shadows and sets reasonable requirements if \nthey want to stay in this country.\n  This legislation creates a fair path to citizenship for undocumented \nimmigrants currently living in the United States. This path to \ncitizenship must be earned and would require individuals to register \nwith the government, submit biometric data, learn English, pass \ncriminal background and national security checks, and pay taxes and \npenalties before they would be eligible for a provisional legal status. \nThis pathway to citizenship requires individuals to earn their legal \nstatus over a period of no fewer than 10 years.\n  In addition, the legislation addresses the need for improved border \nsecurity and requires a 90-percent effectiveness rate for apprehensions \nand returns in high-risk border sections before individuals in \nprovisional legal status can adjust to permanent residence. It also \ncreates an effective employment verification system--using the E-Verify \nsystem--that will prevent identity theft, end the hiring of \nunauthorized workers, and help stop future waves of illegal \nimmigration. And finally, this legislation establishes an improved \nprocess for future legal immigration that is responsive to the needs of \nAmerican businesses and supports reunification of families.\n  Despite fears that immigrants will take jobs from Americans, numerous \nstudies show that immigrants and U.S.-born workers generally do not \ncompete for the same jobs. In fact, a 2009 study by the Cato Institute, \na conservative think tank, found that immigrants have a positive effect \non the workforce.\n  The business sector strongly supports comprehensive immigration \nreform. That is because our economy is in need of highly skilled \nworkers who can help stimulate growth and keep our Nation at the \nforefront of innovation and invention. From 1990 to 2005, foreign-born \nnationals founded more than 25 percent of the technology startups in \nthe United States.\n  Immigration reform is about keeping families together and ensuring \nthat immigration laws are respected. I want to commend my colleagues \nfrom both parties for coming together in crafting a bipartisan bill \nthat creates a workable framework for comprehensive reform. Now the \nSenate needs to move forward in passing legislation that is both \ncomprehensive and fair.\n  This legislation enjoys broad support from a diverse coalition of \nlabor, business, civil rights, and religious groups. Polls indicate \nbroad support across party lines for comprehensive immigration reform, \nwith most Americans agreeing that immigration is a net positive for the \nUnited States. Most Americans want Congress to take action to fix our \nbroken immigration system. While this legislation is not perfect--it is \nnot what I would have drafted--I believe it is a strong step forward \nand a vast improvement over our current laws, and I urge my colleagues \nto support this balanced approach to immigration reform.\n  Article I, section 8 of the Constitution provides that ``Congress \nshall have power . . . to establish a uniform rule of naturalization.'' \nCongress last enacted a major overhaul of immigration policy in 1986 \nduring President Reagan's administration, over a quarter century ago. \nThe time is now for Congress to act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                       Tribute To Marcus Peacock\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I wish to take a moment to do \nsomething special. This week, the Senate community will say goodbye to \nMarcus Peacock, my staff director on the Senate Budget committee.\n  During his tenure with the committee, he has been a constant warrior \nfor sound finances and this country that he so loves. I am going to \nmiss his exemplary service, and the Nation will miss his service.\n  Marcus has been with me since I became ranking member on the Budget \nCommittee. During that time, he has helped my staff and me negotiate \nand navigate the intricacies, quirks, and arcana of the budget process, \nwhich, as anyone with budget experience will tell you, can be a most \ndaunting and frequently frustrating task, even for the most savvy \nbudgeteer. He has approached every task and every challenge with his \ntrademark sunny disposition, remarkable unflappability, and can-do \nattitude.\n  During his tenure with the Budget Committee, Marcus was instrumental \nin crafting the Honest Budget Act--we need that around here--\nlegislation that I introduced in 2011 that exposed some of the most \negregious budget gimmicks, gimmicks that are often utilized to get \naround budget requirements. Together we have achieved a string of \nvictories on budget points of order. I think as many as maybe seven \nconsecutive times the Senate has failed to proceed with spending bills \nthat exceeded our budget limits. That is a very significant \nachievement. He has been able to therefore expose, and frustrate, some \nof Washington's spendthrift ways.\n  I was very glad to have him at my side when the Senate finally \nproduced its first budget in 3 years. It had been so long since the \nlast budget that everyone was a little rusty, and I was grateful to \nhave his counsel.\n  Marcus brought invaluable experience to his leadership of the Budget \nCommittee staff because he's spent his professional career creating and \nimplementing ways to measure and improve the effectiveness and \nefficiency of government programs. Whether he was managing oversight \nefforts on the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, \nleading the Performance Improvement Initiatives at the Office of \nManagement and Budget under President Bush, or ferreting out waste and \ninefficiency as the Deputy Administrator at the Environmental \nProtection Agency, Marcus has always been a careful steward of \ntaxpayers' dollars. It is their money. It comes to us in trust. We have \nan absolute duty to show fidelity to it.\n  Marcus imposed those same principles at the helm of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, turning back 15 percent of his staff budget every year, \ncoming in 15 percent below the allocated amount--something I was very \nproud of.\n  I would be remiss if I also did not thank Marcus' wife Donna and \ntheir two lovely daughters, Iona and Mey,\n\n[[Page S4458]]\n\nfor loaning his time to public service. Hours on the Hill can be long \nand I know he's missed a recital or sports match here and there, and \nprobably several ``date nights'' too. So thank you Donna, Iona, and \nMey.\n  Truly, Marcus Peacock is one of the finest public servants I have \never had the honor to work with. His character and integrity are \nsterling. He honors his family. Surely he is a role model for a high \npublic servant.\n  Marcus, I know I speak on behalf of the entire staff of your Budget \nCommittee when I say that we will miss your wit, your leadership, and \nyour dedication to good government. I wish you the very best of luck. I \nknow our paths will cross again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                            Order for Recess\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, a number of people have said they did not \nknow what was going on with the intelligence situation that has \ndeveloped in the country. The programs have been around for 7 years. We \nhave had a number of briefings, both classified and unclassified. We \nare having another one at 2:30. General Alexander will be there. He has \nsome new stuff he wants to lay out for us. Everyone should go. If you \ndo not go, you have no excuse for saying you do not know what is going \non. This meeting has been scheduled all week.\n  Having said that, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate recess from \n2:30 to 3:30 p.m. I do not want anyone to have an excuse for why they \nare not going there.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 953\n\n  Ms. WARREN. Madam President, in less than 3 weeks the interest rates \non subsidized student loans will double if Congress fails to act. This \nis not only wrong, it is unnecessary. Senator Harkin and Senator Reed \nhave proposed a plan to hold the interest rate steady at 3.4 percent \nfor 2 years. This will give Congress time to develop a long-term plan \nto address the rising burden of student loan debt, a long-term plan \nthat keeps interest rates low and that addresses rising college costs.\n  Two weeks ago a majority of Senators in this body voted to approve \nthis temporary extension to provide a measure of relief to our \nfamilies. Unfortunately, Republicans have decided to filibuster this \nbill, blocking the measure that has majority support. That is not the \nway our democracy should work.\n  I met with students in Massachusetts earlier this week. They told me \nwe need to fix this problem. They said to me: Do not double my rate. Do \nnot double my rate. Dozens of Massachusetts universities have asked us \nto step in and help their students. Petitions urging us to stop \ninterest rates from doubling on July 1 have collected more than 1 \nmillion signatures. Students, parents, families are asking for help. \nThey do not have time for politics.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined by the \nmajority leader, following consultation with the Republican leader, the \nSenate proceed immediately to the consideration of Calendar No. 74, S. \n953, the Student Loan Affordability Act, and that the bill be read a \nthird time, the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill, and the \nmotion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, with \nno intervening objection or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, reserving the right to object, my good \nfriend and colleague from Massachusetts stated that students in \nMassachusetts have come up and said: Senator, fix the student loan \nprogram. Fix it. She said that what Republicans have done is they have \nfilibustered it. The fact is that what Republicans offered was a fix.\n  What the Senator comes to the floor today to do is to have a 2-year \nextension of a student loan program that the Secretary of Education \nadmits does not fix the problem. As a matter of fact, in a Washington \npaper today, Secretary of Education Duncan is very clear and implores \nthe Senate and the Congress: Fix it. Find a long-term solution.\n  Let me state for my colleagues that what the Senator from \nMassachusetts is here to do is to extend a preferred interest rate of \n3.4 percent for 2 years on 39 percent of the student loans that are \ntaken out. Current law is that for subsidized student loans, they are \nsubsidized at 3.4 percent. That preferred half, 50-percent cut, is \neffective until the end of June. But under current law, the \nunsubsidized Stafford loans are at 6.8 percent. The parent and graduate \nPLUS loans are at 7.9 percent. My colleague's amendment only covers the \nsubsidized Stafford loans that are 39 percent of all of the loans that \nare administered. So what her proposal says is that we are not going to \nfix it, we are going to kick the can down the road for 2 more years. To \nthe parents and to those who do not get subsidized Stafford loans, we \nare going to continue to charge you double what we charge other \nstudents. If we look at the math, where we are is unsustainable.\n  I understand that when we voted on a Republican alternative last \nweek, it was the Alexander-Coburn-Burr bill where we actually wanted to \ntie the interest rate on an annual basis to the rate of the 10-year \nTreasury bond. The advantage was that if you locked that in in any \ngiven year, that was your interest rate for the entire life of the \nloan.\n  What students want is predictability. What they want to do is \nunderstand how much is it going to cost them for their education, not \nthis year but over the life of having to pay it off. Well, you know \nwhat. We put a proposal on the table. It was routinely rejected even \nthough it was a solution. It was a fix. It was what the President has \ncalled for. It is what the Secretary of Education called for.\n  The President also proposed a fix. The President's--I do not agree \nwith all aspects of it, but it is a start. It is the nucleus of a \ncompromise. In the President's bill, he ties everything to the 10-year \nTreasury bond--very similar to the fix Republicans came up with. Here \nis the difference: The President ties subsidized loans to the price of \nthe Treasury bill plus .93. Ours was 3.0. On unsubsidized Stafford \nloans, it was 10-year Treasury bill plus 2.93--almost identical to the \nRepublican proposal. For parents and graduates, the President's bill \ncalled for a 10-year bond rate plus 3.93 percent. So if you do the math \nand you look at 60 percent of it not being subsidized and 40 percent \nbeing subsidized, what Republicans laid on the table and what the \nPresident laid on the table are very similar. As a matter of fact, both \nthe Republican proposal and the President's proposal said: Let's fix \nthe rate for the life of the loan.\n  So not only am I being asked today to agree to a unanimous consent \nrequest to take up a bill that does not fix the problem, I am being \nasked to grant unanimous consent to a bill that does not even extend \nthe same rate for the life of the loan for the students who are \nborrowing it. Imagine where we would be in the marketplace if we wanted \nto buy a home, and when we walked in, our lender looked at us and said: \nI am going to lend you the $300,000, but I have a right to readjust the \nrate every year. Some people take a risk at doing that. They are called \nmortgages that are fixed with ARMs--adjustable rate mortgages. After \nthe downturn, they were not very popular. As a matter of fact, many of \nthose were the ones that were foreclosed on.\n  Here is the challenge: We have to present something that is \nunderstandable and that is predictable and something that is \nfinancially sustainable for the American people. Some have come to the \nfloor and they have been brave enough to say that these bills actually \nproduce savings. Let me squash that. The Congressional Budget Office \nhas projected that direct student loans issued between 2013 and 2023 \nwill cost $95 billion based upon a fair value basis, in contrast with a \nprojected savings of $184 billion using questionable fuzzy math.\n  So make no mistake about it, there are no savings that can be claimed \nfrom any of the proposals that are out there. It is a cost to the \nAmerican taxpayer, one that I think is a justifiable investment in \neducation if we applied it to everybody. But this is not applied to \neverybody. It is a unanimous consent request for 39 percent of the \nindividuals who take out student loans. To the other 61 percent, it \nsays: Hey, you live with 6.8 or 7.9.\n  So I am not in a position today to agree to the unanimous consent \nrequest that has been made, but I am in\n\n[[Page S4459]]\n\na position to do this: I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed \nto the immediate consideration of the bill that is at the desk, which \nis the proposal of the President of the United States on student loan \nissues. I further ask that there be 1 hour of debate equally divided in \nthe usual form and that at the expiration of time, the bill be read a \nthird time and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage of the bill.\n  Let's put this to bed now. Let's not wait until the end of June, when \nwe have used a couple of more weeks, to say to kids: You ought to be \nconcerned because rates are going to go up. Let's lock it down. I will \nnot argue with the rates the President set even though I do not agree \nwith it all. It starts to fix the problem. It is a solution in the \nright direction, where just assuming that we extend what is currently \nbroken, does not fix it, and is not cost-sustainable, I believe is the \nwrong thing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from North Carolina?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Reserving the right to object, I would like to focus on \nthree words Senator Burr discussed, and they are ``unsustainable,'' \n``everybody,'' and ``fix.''\n  I heard all three, and I think all three are very important words \nhere. Let's go through this and figure out what it is the Senator is \nproposing and what it is we need to do.\n  Right now we have a student loan program that produces $51 billion in \nprofits this year off the backs of our students, $51 billion. Yes, I \nthink that is unsustainable. We must find a way to deal with that.\n  In fact, Republicans did put a proposal on the table. Their proposal \nwould have increased profits to the Federal Government from the student \nloan program by another $16 billion.\n  The Republicans' plan was to say let's take a debt load that is \nalready too difficult for students to deal with and let's make it \nharder. That is, in my view, completely unsustainable. We have to do \nbetter than that.\n  The question the Senator also raises is one about everybody: We need \nto fix this problem for everybody. I agree with the Senator. We do, \nindeed, need to fix this problem for everybody. Let's think about what \nthis is.\n  What we are talking about is student interest rates that are about to \ndouble. What the Democrats have proposed, what I propose in the \noriginal request for a UC, is that we not let those interest rates \ndouble. We use that time to try to develop a comprehensive way to deal \nwith the rising costs of college and with the trillion dollars of \ncollege loan debt that is outstanding.\n  In other words, we recognize this is a narrow slice. This is to \nprevent our students from facing a double interest rate, a doubling of \ntheir interest rates on July 1. We say we would use this time in order \nto get a comprehensive answer for all of our students.\n  What the Senator has proposed and what he has asked for unanimous \nconsent on is not that. It is only a narrow slice of the question of \nhow we are going to deal with interest rates on loans going forward. It \ndoesn't deal with the interest of the loans outstanding, and it \ncertainly doesn't deal with the rising costs of college. They want to \nput this problem to bed by saying that one problem we will deal with \nand we will move on. Let's keep in mind we have seen what the \nRepublican plan will do. The Republican plan will cost our students an \nadditional $16 billion. That is the plan. Take a problem and make it \nworse but not something that is sustainable and not something that \nfixes it for everyone.\n  The third point he raised is he used the question of fix. I think fix \nis exactly what we are talking about.\n  We have three different kinds of problems we need to solve. We have \nthe problem of $1 trillion of outstanding student loan debt that is \ncrushing our students. We have the problem of rising costs for college. \nWe must deal with this. We have the immediate problem of interest rates \nabout to double for our students.\n  We can fix one of those problems in the next 2 weeks. We could fix it \ntoday. We could fix it by unanimous consent right now.\n  Then we could agree to sit down, on a bipartisan basis, and we could \nwork together to try to solve the larger problems. That is what our \nstudents are asking for. That is what we need to do.\n  One last point I wish to make, I notice that Senator Burr cites the \nCongressional Budget Office study. Let's just be clear what that same \nstudy decided right from the beginning. The Congressional Budget Office \nprojects the total cost to the Federal Government of student loans \ndisbursed between 2013 and 2023--I believe that is what the Senator was \nreferring to--will be negative; that is, the student loan program will \nproduce savings that reduce the debt. Don't let anyone be confused by \nwhat that language means--produce savings that reduce the debt--meaning \nour kids have become a profit center for the Government. Right now this \ngovernment will lend to large financial institutions at less than 1 \npercent interest, but the plan has continued to produce profits off the \nbacks of our kids, and not small profits, tens of billions of dollars \nof profits.\n  There is $51 billion projected this year. The Republicans are asking \nfor another $16 billion. We can't do that.\n  We need a sustainable answer. We need a fix that encompasses all of \nour students, all of our families.\n  For that reason, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Is there objection to the original request from the Senator from \nMassachusetts?\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, continuing my objection, I am appalled. I \nam, frankly, appalled. Out of the student loan program, the Democrats \npush $8.7 billion to the Affordable Care Act; $8.7 billion of student \nloan-designated money is going to pay for ObamaCare.\n  I realize the Senator wasn't here when the vote was made, but it is \n$8.7 billion. To suggest that trying to be fiscally responsible is an \ninsult to this generation of students when they are sending $8.7 \nbillion to a health care plan out of the student loan fund is \nincredible.\n  Let me go a step further. The Senator quoted from the Congressional \nBudget Office. Let me quote from the Congressional Budget Office as \nwell:\n\n       Taking account the cost of market risk significantly \n     reduces or eliminates the savings estimated for student loans \n     under the FCRA approach, making student loans costly to the \n     Federal government in most years during the coming decade.\n\n  Maybe you can pick these out that say we can make money off this, but \nI am not sure it says it any clearer than that it costs the American \ntaxpayers money. Let me say I am fine with subsidizing student loans. I \nam not objecting to that. I didn't object to the President's proposal. \nI offered the President's proposal.\n  I am sure the President is going to be shocked to find out it doesn't \nsolve the problem because the Secretary of Education surely believes it \ndoes.\n  Here is what I object to. I object to the fact that we are going to \ngive some kids a preferred rate, and we are going to sock it to the 61 \npercent of kids, parents, and postgrads. Why should they be denied the \nsame rate? Why are only 39 percent going to get a cut of 3.4?\n  Why? Because it is hard to do. It gives away a political tool.\n\n  You see, we are here arguing this because of politics, not because of \naffordability of higher education. Thank goodness the President in his \nbudget proposal laid something on the table.\n  Quite frankly, I am sick and tired of waiting until the deadline. We \nare going to come out here every week, and we are going to hear in 3 \nweeks: This is going to happen; in 2 weeks: This is going to happen; \nand in 1 week: This is going to happen. We are going to come down to \nthe last day and we are going to dare each other not to do it.\n  I don't know what is going to happen on the last day, but I can tell \nyou what is going to happen every day until the last day. I am going to \ncome out and object to anything that does not solve the problem long \nterm. I don't want to go home and look at kids and tell them the rate \nthey agreed to this year is not the rate for the entirety of the loan, \nperiod.\n  That is not the case under this bill. I am not going to go home and \nlook at two different students whom we have put in two different \ncategories and tell one: You have to pay 3.4 percent, but you have to \npay 6.8 percent.\n  That is wrong. It is not our role to pick winners and losers.\n  I would turn to my good friend from Massachusetts and ask, Have I in \nany\n\n[[Page S4460]]\n\nway, shape or form misstated what her proposal does, which is extend \nthe 3.4 percent which is limited only to subsidized Stafford loans?\n  If the Senator thinks that is wrong, I would ask her to speak now.\n  Ms. WARREN. I believe, if I understand this correctly, what we are \ntrying to do is protect the subsidized Stafford loans. What I \nunderstand the Republicans have tried to do is protect all the new \nloans so no one is dealing with all the loans that already have been \nissued and are at much higher interest rates. This is how I understand \nit. If the Senator is talking about wanting----\n  Mr. BURR. Reclaiming my time----\n  Ms. WARREN. Then I assume the Senator means all the students with \nstudent loan debt, and that is not my proposal.\n  Mr. BURR. Reclaiming my time, clearly, the Senator said her bill only \ndeals with the subsidized Stafford loan.\n  Under current law, let me state it again, unsubsidized Stafford \nloans, current law, 6.8 percent; parent and graduate PLUS loans, 7.9 \npercent. Somehow, somebody thinks this is fair.\n  I, personally, participated in coming up with something that treats \neverybody the same, that ties it to a 10-year Treasury, that fixes the \nrate above a 10-year Treasury that sets that number once a year, lets \nstudents know exactly what their exposure is going to be, and provides \nthem the certainty of that interest rate for the life of the loan----\n  Ms. WARREN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BURR. Let me finish--which this unanimous consent request doesn't \nincorporate.\n  In essence, the unanimous consent request says we are not going to \ndeal with this 61 percent; we are only going to deal with 39 percent. \nBecause they have received the preferred rate up to this point, we want \nto protect the preferred rate.\n  Some people think it is the role of Congress. I don't think that is \nthe role of Congress.\n  I yield to the Senator for a question through the Chair.\n  Ms. WARREN. I wish to make sure I understand. Have the Republicans \nput any proposal on the table that will deal with all of the \noutstanding student loan debt?\n  Mr. BURR. I would be happy to address the Senator's question.\n  No, we haven't. The President's proposal--and I said there are parts \nof it I don't agree with--makes loan forgiveness tax free.\n  Maybe what we ought to debate is whether we are going to make college \ntuition free, because this is a race for who can make it the cheapest \non the backs of the American taxpayer--when we are $1 trillion out of \nbalance, $1 trillion we spend.\n  Excuse me, we have new numbers: $646 billion this year, projected to \ngo up next year. We are accruing debt on this country's books at a rate \nnobody ever dreamed. We are still talking about constructing programs \nthat financially are unsustainable because we are using somebody else's \ncheckbook.\n  This is the definition of insanity. Therefore, I would object to the \nSenator's original request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. I just wanted to return to this question, since the \nSenator has raised it, about the Congressional Budget Office. Let's all \nbe clear about what the current student loan interest rates produce for \nthe government.\n  The CBO, the agency in charge of estimating these costs for the \ngovernment, maintains that this year the government will make $51 \nbillion in profits from the student loans. Their most recent report on \nthis--I read the language earlier--is clear and direct. We will make a \nprofit.\n  The CBO uses this accounting method because it reflects reality. It \nis the reality of how these loans affect the Federal budget. The CBO's \nmethod takes into account the cost of lending money from the Treasury \nand the projected money that will be returned to the Treasury.\n  It takes into account the risk that some students will default; in \nother words, it is basic math.\n  Some people don't like the idea that the government is profiting from \nthe student loans. Their approach is to try to change the accounting \nrules to treat the government as if it were a private bank rather than \nthe Federal Government, which it is.\n  The government is not a bank in a private market. If we want to \nreduce the profits from student loans, then we should actually reduce \nthe profits from the student loans, not change the map, not bury our \nheads in the sand and pretend those profits don't exist.\n  Let's go back to what the Senator has proposed. The Republicans \npropose that we take $51 billion in profits that will currently be made \nfrom the backs of our students and add another $16 billion in profits \noff the backs of our students. This is fundamentally wrong. It is not \nsustainable.\n  I think the larger point the Senator makes is one that says we have a \nbig problem. We need to talk about the debt that is outstanding. We \nneed to talk about how we are going to pay for college over time. We \ncan't do that in the next 2 weeks.\n  We need to make sure interest rates don't double, and then we need to \naddress this problem. I am pleased to work with people on both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  Mr. BURR. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator should be aware we have a previous \norder to recess.\n  Mr. BURR. I ask unanimous consent to ask one question of my colleague \nfrom Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Does the Senator from Massachusetts agree that out of the \nstudent loan fund $8.7 billion is diverted to the Affordable Care Act?\n  Ms. WARREN. No.\n  Mr. BURR. The Senator is not aware of that?\n  Ms. WARREN. Look, we can go back over the CBO numbers, but what is \nclear right now is what the CBO has made clear. We will make $51 \nbillion in profits off the backs of our students. The Republicans \npropose to make another $16 billion off the backs of our students. We \ncan't do that. It is unsustainable. Our students are asking for more.\n  Mr. BURR. I thank my colleague for not answering.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/13/senate-section/article/S4460-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                         Gun Violence Epidemic\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, today we mark the 6-month \nanniversary of a date that none of us will ever forget because it \ntransformed our lives, it transformed America, and it certainly \ntransformed Connecticut and the community of Newtown.\n  We commemorate the 6-month anniversary of that unspeakable, \nunimaginable tragedy that cut short the lives of 20 beautiful, innocent \nchildren and six dedicated, courageous educators.\n  It transformed America in so many ways. It changed our lives \nirrevocably and, I hope, put us on a trajectory toward changes in our \nlaws that will prevent this kind of horrific, unimaginable tragedy from \never happening again. Our challenge right here in this body, on this \nfloor, is to make sure we learn from it, that we act on it, and that we \nkeep faith with those families, as well as the Newtown community and \nall of our country that lost so much that day.\n  December 14 began like so many other days for the parents of Newtown, \nCT. They took their children to school, kissed them goodbye, and went \nabout their day with plans for play dates, Hanukkah and Christmas \nholiday parties, and presents that they would give to those children \nfor those holidays. They planned snack breaks and holiday parties. They \nwrapped presents. Just hours later, I stood with them and saw them \nemerge from the Sandy Hook firehouse having learned that those children \nwould not be coming home that night.\n  I arrived in Newtown as a public official within hours of that \nshooting. But\n\n[[Page S4461]]\n\nwhat I saw was through the eyes of a parent--grief-stricken, panicked \nparents, tears streaming down their faces--who came hoping to reunite \nwith their children. Many parents did reunite. Children were brought to \nall of the parents who gathered at the firehouse, and they left with \ntheir children--until the families who realized that their children \nwould not be coming home.\n  I saw those families who lost beautiful, young children. Some of them \nare here, along with adults--dedicated, courageous adults--families of \neducators who died themselves trying to save their children. I will \nnever forget the cries of grief, anguish, pain, and disbelief.\n  Every parent in his or her DNA has something fundamental. It is about \ntrust and caring for children, making sure they come home at the end of \nthe day when they go to school; that they are kept safe in some very \nbasic and fundamental way. Society shares that trust. Society failed in \nthat trust.\n  We will never forget the loss and heartbreak of that tragic day in \nSandy Hook. But we also know that in the face of evil there was \ntremendous goodness and heroism. There were genuine heroes: the first \nresponders who braved the unknown, hearing gunfire, charging into that \nschool, and stopping the shooting through their courage because the \nshooter turned that gun on himself. There were the brave educators, \nteachers, administrators, and school psychologists who threw themselves \nin front of bullets or tried to save their children and perished \nthemselves. Then members of the community who came together in support \nof the families and who themselves, along with first responders, are \ncontinuing to recover. They exemplify the quintessential values of this \nquintessential New England town that make us proud to be American.\n  Thirty-two members of the victims' families at the massacre wrote to \nthe U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee. Through their unspeakable pain and \nsuffering, they asked Congress to honor the memory of their loved ones \nby supporting measures to stem and stop the epidemic of gun \nviolence. They wrote, ``In the midst of our anguish we are compelled to \nspeak out to save others from suffering what we have endured.''\n\n  These brave families have come to Washington to tell their stories. \nThey sat in this very gallery. They met with colleagues. Some of our \ncolleagues refused to meet with them. I urged them to share some of \ntheir hurt and meet with them, to hear their stories. We owe them \ntremendous respect and gratitude. They enabled us to come to this point \nwhere we are close to making fundamental changes in the law.\n  But in April, that day of the vote was a day of shame because the \nSenate turned its back on the families of Newtown while some of them \nwatched in this very gallery. How to explain to those families or try \nto explain how 90 percent of the American people could be in favor of \nreasonable, commonsense measures that we proposed--background checks on \nall firearms purchases and a ban on illegal traffic and straw \npurchases, on assault weapons, and on excess capacity magazines--how 90 \npercent of the people could be in favor of those kinds of commonsense \nmeasures, most especially the background checks, yet the Senate failed \nto pass it.\n  Those families have been resolute and resilient at every turn. Mark \nBarden, whose son Daniel was killed 6 months ago at Sandy Hook, wrote:\n\n       We are not defeated. We will always be here because we have \n     no other choice.\n\n  Despite their profound and harrowing loss, those parents, husbands, \nwives, sisters, brothers, grandmothers have kept faith and they have \ninspired us to keep faith. They uplifted us and their determination has \nmeant the world to colleagues who have heard them, and as an example of \ngrace under pressure and courage and strength, they have refused to \ngive up.\n  They will not give up, nor will we. We are coming back for another \nvote. We will not allow that vote to be the final one. It may be the \nfirst one, but it is not the final one, and we will win the last vote, \nwhich is the one that counts.\n  In the meantime many of my colleagues have stood up to the special \ninterests and most especially the NRA, which was accustomed to having \nits way and holding sway in this body, in Congress, just as a \nschoolyard bully would. My colleagues have stood up to that bully once \nand will do it again. This time we will win.\n  What happened in Newtown could happen anywhere in America. If it \nhappened there, it can happen in any town or city, and it has, in fact, \nclaimed the lives of 4,900 people since Newtown. Gun violence has \nclaimed their lives. I am constantly shocked and saddened by how \nquickly that number rises each time I speak about this topic. Just last \nweek a man armed with semiautomatic AR-15 assault rifle and more than \n1,300 rounds of ammunition, opened fire at a Santa Monica college and \nkilled five people.\n  The stories about Newtown, about all of the massacres since and \nbefore--whether Columbine or Virginia Tech or Arizona and Tucson--\naffirm that these laws can help save lives. These laws can help save \nlives.\n  Six months ago I left the firehouse at Sandy Hook to attend a vigil \nat a church in Newtown. The church was St. Rose of Lima, presided over \nby Father Bob, Msgr. Robert Weiss. The church was filled. It was a \npowerful and moving experience. People listened to the service through \nthe windows and the PA system outside.\n  I said that evening the world is watching Newtown. In fact, for 6 \nmonths the world has watched Newtown. It has seen a story of \nunparalleled and unprecedented courage and fortitude. Now we will \ncontinue to watch Newtown. But the world is also watching the Senate. \nWe need to be worthy of the courage and strength that Newtown has \ndemonstrated in moving ahead.\n  I thank the majority leader Harry Reid and all of my colleagues who \nhave determined that we will bring this bill back, not only to honor \nthe memories of the Newtown victims and keep faith with them but also \nto make this country better and safer, worthy of these children, \nbeautiful and innocent at the time of their passing with all of their \nfuture ahead of them. There were educators who worked for their whole \nprofessional lives, trying to help children such as these young people.\n  Out of that grief and pain we can make America safer and stronger. We \ncan make America better. That is the potential legacy of these lost \nlives, a better and safer America. If we achieve it, they will not have \ndied in vain.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I join my colleague from Connecticut on \nthe floor of the Senate to commemorate a sad day; 6 months since the \nshootings in Newtown took the lives of 20 6- and 7-year-olds and 6 of \nthe teachers charged with protecting them. I know you share in our \nsadness, Madam President, since it was not too long afterwards that \nyour State went through a tragedy of smaller and bigger proportions.\n  We have to wonder, 6 months later, after these families, the brothers \nand the sisters and the moms and the dads of these victims coming down \nto the Senate, over and over again, including this week, looking \nSenator after Senator, Congressman after Congressman, in the eye and \nasking for this place to learn something from this tragedy--we wonder \nhow 6 months later we have done nothing. We wonder how, if 20 little \nkids dying at the hands of a mad man with a gun over the course of 5 or \n10 minutes doesn't move this place to action, what would? What visit to \nyour office, what message, what story, what set of facts could possibly \nmake this place change the laws that have allowed for these \nslaughters--plural--over and over again to happen?\n  It is 6 months later and we have done nothing. At least on the Senate \nfloor we raised the bill, we put it on for debate, we got 55 votes, and \nthe rules prevented us from getting it passed. The House down the hall \nhas done absolutely nothing. They have not lifted a finger to move \nlegislation for 6 months, 6 months later, and no answer to these \nfamilies.\n  I was there with Senator Blumenthal that afternoon in that firehouse. \nThose are moments I would, a lot of days, love to have never lived--\nthings I did not need to see. But it changed my life and committed me \nto action.\n  It commands us to understand that the most shallow argument that has \nbeen posed, I would argue the most\n\n[[Page S4462]]\n\nbackward argument that has been posed over the last 6 months, is that, \nyes, these terrible things happen--the most terrible of them we are \nmarking the 6-month anniversary of--but there is nothing we could do \nhere that would change that; that very bad things are going to happen \nto good people, to good first grade students, but that nothing here is \ngoing to truly change any of that.\n  That is just flat wrong. It should not be every 6 months that we come \nto the floor to try to rebut that argument. It should be every day. \nBecause in Columbine, the guns that were bought to slaughter those high \nschool students were bought outside of the background check system--\nintentionally so, because the person who bought them knew if they went \ninto a legitimate gun store they would not be able to purchase the guns \nthat were being requested, so they went to a gun show, around the \nbackground check system.\n  We know different laws would change things because in Aurora the \nshooter went in with a 100-round drum and the shooting stopped and \npeople escaped, including a couple of my constituents, because the gun \njammed. They had trouble switching these massive ammunition clips.\n  In Newtown, we know the power of the gun that was used. These assault \nweapons are all over the place today. They have become commonplace. But \nit does not belie the fact that they still have a power to kill that \nfew other guns do, so much so that when Lanza walked into that school \nthat day, fired over 150 rounds, shot 20 kids, not a single one of them \nsurvived. Every kid he shot died, in part because of the power of that \ngun. That same day a very sick man walked into a school in China, armed \nwith a weapon, attacked over 20 children and every single one of them \nlived. That guy had a knife.\n  Assault weapons, if we continue to allow them to ripple throughout \nour streets, lead to mass slaughters. High-capacity ammunition clips, \nwhen somebody chooses to engage in one of these massacres, allow more \npeople to be killed. Our failure, over and over again, to pass \ncomprehensive background checks is unacceptable, given the number of \ncriminals and the number of people with severe mental illness who are \nstill allowed to get guns over the Internet or in gun shows; 6 months \nand we have done nothing.\n  But I stand here, frankly, more optimistic about human nature than I \nwas 6 months ago, not less optimistic. I might be less optimistic about \nthis place and about the Congress, but I am more optimistic about the \nindomitable human spirit than I was when this started out.\n  Senator Blumenthal said it best. That 10 minutes of grievous \nviolence, mental illness masquerading as evil inside that school, was \nessentially enveloped by the millions of acts of humanity that just \nflowed forth from Newtown, from Connecticut, from all over the country, \nwhether it was the heroism of those teachers, whether it was the \nfirefighters, the volunteer fighters who stayed at that firehouse for \ndays or weeks on end with no pay or just the thousands of gifts--teddy \nbears, small tokens of appreciation of the community that came from all \nover the country.\n  People are good. They truly are. Despite what that young man did, it \nreaffirmed my faith in who we are.\n  Last Friday night, the Sandy Hook Fire Department had their big \nannual fundraiser. Some people wondered whether they would do it. First \nof all, they said they were going to do it because they were not going \nto start changing the way they did things and, second, they needed the \nmoney because they expended a lot of effort and equipment and resources \nin responding to this tragedy. On Friday we had an absolute deluge in \nNew England. It was raining cats and dogs all day. There was no reason \nthey should have gone forward on Friday night with that lobster bake at \nthe Sandy Hook firehouse, but they decided to put it on, and I went, \ndespite thinking there were going to be about six people inside that \nfirehouse. It was packed, jammed full of people, not just from Newtown \nbut from all over New England who came down on a torrentially raining \nevening to show their support for those firefighters, for that \ncommunity, and for those families. That is what defines Newtown.\n  Six months later, we know the headlines still read about the 26 kids \nand adults who lost their lives there. But what we know Newtown to be \ntoday is a place full of love, full of compassion, and--though not \nmaybe today yet--a place that will, 1 year, 5 years, 10 years down the \nline be defined by resiliency.\n  I wish we weren't down here commemorating 6 months. I wish we weren't \ndown here commemorating nothing having been done over the course of 6 \nmonths. But we are not going away. We are not giving up. The families \nwho were down here this week didn't turn into advocates for 4 months, \nthey turned into advocates for 40 years, and they will be back again \nand again until we have an answer for these mass tragedies and for the \n5,033 people who have died at the hands of guns since December 14--6 \nmonths ago.\n  I yield back the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first of all, I wish to thank the \nPresiding Officer, the distinguished Senator from Delaware, who is not \nonly an outstanding Member of the Senate, but he is the chairman of the \nhomeland security committee. He has gone out of his way to understand \nthe issues we face when we are addressing border security. The chairman \nwas kind enough to visit the border between Arizona and Sonora, Mexico, \nand spent a lot of time with us and with the people who are entrusted \nto secure the border. He made some remarks I think were entirely \naccurate about the challenges we face in enforcing our border. So I \nwish to again thank the distinguished chairman of the homeland security \ncommittee.\n  I wish to address a few aspects of comprehensive immigration reform \nthat need to be discussed. First of all, everybody says--and I say it \ntoo--we don't want to return to 1986 because in 1986 we guaranteed the \nAmerican people we would secure the border, and it would never happen \nagain. Well, the fact is, when we look at what we did in 1986--and I \nwill, first of all, plead guilty for having voted for it--the only \nmandate in the entire legislation which gave ``amnesty'' to 3 million \npeople was:\n\n       Of the amounts authorized to be appropriated under \n     paragraph one, sufficient funds shall be available to provide \n     for an increase in the Border Patrol personnel of the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service so that the average \n     level of such personnel in each of the fiscal years 1987 and \n     1988 is at least 50 percent higher than such level for fiscal \n     year 1986.\n\n  Let me translate that. It meant we would increase the Border Patrol. \nThat was the only mention of how we were going to secure the border \nafter we gave amnesty in 1986. And at that time, I say to my \ncolleagues, the cost, as I mentioned, was 50 percent higher. The Border \nPatrol has to be 50 percent higher.\n  Well, the number of Border Patrol agents in 1986 was 4,000--4,000. \nNow we have 21,000. So there was really nothing in the 1986 bill about \nfencing, about sensors, about other ways to get our border secure. So \nwe learned from that.\n  We learned from that, and this legislation that recently passed \nthrough the Judiciary Committee and is now on the floor, as compared \nwith 1986 where they said they would increase the numbers of Border \nPatrol agents by 50 percent--this legislation appropriates $3 billion \nin funding for the comprehensive southern border security strategy. No \none who is in RPI status will be able to petition for a green card \nuntil certain requirements are fulfilled, including the following: E-\nVerify in use by all employers, an entry-exit system in place, $1.5 \nbillion in additional funding for the southern border fencing strategy \nthat has to be submitted within 180 days of passage of this legislation \nand signed by the President.\n  It sets the goal of a 90-percent effectiveness rate for all southern \nborder States. If that goal is not reached within 5 years, there will \nbe a bipartisan commission formed and authorized to spend $2 billion in \nadditional funds to secure the border.\n\n[[Page S4463]]\n\n  It will add an additional 3,500 Customs and Border Patrol agents. \nRemember, in 1986, there was a total of 4,000.\n  It will authorize the National Guard to provide assistance along the \nborder if requested. The National Guard has had tremendous success on \nour border. No, they don't carry weapons, but they do incredibly \nimportant work, and I am glad they don't carry weapons, to tell the \ntruth.\n  The bill funds additional Border Patrol stations and forward \noperating bases.\n  It increases something called Operation Stonegarden funding, which is \nvital, in my view, in disincentivizing people to frequently cross the \nborder, and strengthens Border Patrol training.\n  It authorizes funds to triple the border-crossing prosecutions in the \nTucson sector. Why do I mention the Tucson sector? Not because I am \nfrom the State of Arizona but because the Tucson sector for years has \nbeen a major thoroughfare for both people and drugs.\n  The current bill will authorize funds to help States and localities \nincarcerate criminal unauthorized illegal immigrants.\n  It grants the Department of Homeland Security access to Federal \nlands. That is a problem on our border, where we have an Indian \nreservation that is right on the border. They are sovereign nations, \nand this will authorize a greater ability for us to have access to \nthose lands. There are wildlife refuges we need access to as well.\n  The bill removes the discretion from the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity to develop the southern border strategy and provides the \nminimum requirements recommended by the Border Patrol. Those are the \npeople on the ground. These are the people who today, in 120-degree \nheat at the Sonora, AZ, border, are sitting in vehicles and patrolling \nour border to keep our Nation secure. This is recommended by them and \nmust be included in the strategy that we want to achieve and must \nachieve, which is 100 percent situational awareness of each and every \n1-mile segment of the southern border.\n  The technology list will include, but is not limited to, sector-by-\nsector requirements for integrated fixed towers, VADER radar systems. \nThese radar track people back from where they came.\n  The list includes unmanned aerial systems--what we know as drones--\nfixed cameras, mobile surveillance systems, ground sensors, handheld \nthermal imaging systems, infrared cameras, thermal imaging cameras, \nlicense plate readers, and radiation detection systems. All of these \nare part of this legislation and the billions of dollars we are going \nto spend to improve border security. We all admit the border is more \nsecure, but where I disagree with the Secretary of Homeland Security is \nthat it is not secure enough.\n  So we want to prevent the adjustment of status RPI, which is \nregistered permanent status, for people who will be granted it once the \npassage of this bill is achieved until that strategy is deployed and \noperational--deployed and operational. This is just to achieve a legal \nstatus in this country; also, a technology list before anybody can \nadjust RPI to green card status.\n  It removes the sole discretion from the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to certify the strategy is complete. It requires written, \nthird-party certification to the President and Congress that affirms \nthe elements required by the strategy are operational and capable of \nachieving effective control of the border.\n  With these tools in place, we can achieve situational awareness and \nbe guaranteed this technology is deployed and working along the border. \nSo I say to my friends who say we do not have sufficient provisions for \nborder security, we will be glad to do more, but let's look at this.\n  Look at what we are doing: billions of dollars of technology as well \nas additional people, as well as other measures, including the E-\nVerify. The magnet that draws people to this country is jobs, and if \nthe word is out that unless an E-Verify is in operation--unless a \nperson can get a job in this country they are not going to come here \nunless it is through a legal means and not through illegal means.\n  We are a nation of immigrants. I would remind my colleagues again, 40 \npercent of the people who are in this country illegally did not cross \nour border. They came on a visa that expired. So we need to have \nfootprints and other physical evidence of illegal crossings. It is a \ntool for Border Patrol agents to identify and locate illegal border \ncrossers. But it is imprecise. That is why we need to have this \ntechnology, so we can surveil and have situational awareness of the \nentire border.\n  The General Accounting Office is an organization all of us over time \nbegin to rely on enormously, and I will quote from them:\n\n       In terms of collecting data, Border Patrol officials \n     reported that sectors rely on a different mix of cameras, \n     sign cutting--\n\n  That is tracking footprints--\n\n     credible sources, and visual observation to identify and \n     report the number of turn backs and gotaways.\n\n  Turnbacks are those we catch and turn back, and gotaways are those we \nsee come across and do not apprehend.\n  Again, quoting the GAO:\n\n       According to Border Patrol officials, the ability to obtain \n     accurate or consistent data using these identification \n     sources depends on various factors such as terrain and \n     weather. For example, data on turn backs and gotaways may be \n     understated in areas with rugged mountains and steep canyons \n     that can hinder detection of illegal entries. In other cases, \n     data may be overstated--for example, in cases where the same \n     turn back identified by a camera is also identified by \n     tracks. Double counting may also occur when agents in one \n     zone record as a gotaway an individual who is apprehended and \n     then reported as an apprehension in another zone. As a result \n     of these data limitations, Border Patrol headquarters \n     officials said that while they consider turn back and gotaway \n     data sufficiently reliable to assess each sector's progress \n     toward border security and to inform sector decisions \n     regarding resource deployment, they do not consider the data \n     sufficiently reliable to compare--or externally report--\n     results across sectors.\n\n  That is why we need this technology.\n  Now, I wish to point out that from the Border Patrol, not from the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, I got a detailed list of what they \nbelieve is necessary, using their experience, as to the specific \nequipment and capabilities they need on each of the nine sectors of the \nborder.\n  For example, in the Arizona sectors, including Yuma and Tucson, we \nneed 56 towers, 73 fixed camera systems, 28 mobile surveillance \nsystems, 685 unattended ground sensors, and 22 handheld equipment \ndevices.\n  At points of entry or checkpoints we need one nonintrusive inspection \nsystem, and the list goes on. It is a specific list of what the Border \nPatrol believes we need in each of the nine sectors on our southern \nborder in order to give us 100 percent situational awareness and put us \non the path to a 90-percent effective control of the border.\n  So I say to my friends who say we cannot control our border, I \nrespectfully disagree because of what we are doing in this legislation. \nAnd those who say we are unable to keep track of what goes on at our \nborder, I would argue that the minimum requirements to be included in \nthe southern border security strategy as provided by the Border Patrol \nshould convince anyone of what we need.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these minimum requirements be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Minimum requirements to be included in the Southern Border Security \n                                Strategy\n\n                   Arizona (Yuma and Tucson

I see my distinguished friend from Vermont on the floor, \nwho is always worth listening to, so I will be brief.\n  I wish to share with our colleagues another aspect of this problem \nthat we really have not talked about very much, and that is the issue \nof drugs. Drugs are a problem of enormous proportion in this country. \nWe see the effects of illegal drugs such as methamphetamine and others, \nand we see it is doing incredible damage to our Nation and particularly \nto our young people.\n  This document is called the Arizona High Intensity Drug Trafficking \nArea Threat Assessment of 2013. Now, I am not going to go into a lot of \nthe details, but there are some stark facts about the flow of drugs \nacross our southern border that should disturb all of us. I quote:\n\n       The Tucson and Phoenix areas remain the primary \n     distribution hubs for ton quantities of marijuana in the \n     southwest region--\n\n  Ton quantities of marijuana in the southwest region--\n\n     as Tucson and Phoenix-based sources sell throughout the \n     United States.\n\n  In other words, the drugs come up across the Arizona-Sonora border, \nthey are tracked by guides on mountaintops and into Phoenix, and from \nPhoenix they are distributed throughout the country.\n  The Phoenix field DEA--Drug Enforcement Agency--Phoenix field \ndivision's biannual drug price list for 2012 indicates marijuana in the \nTucson and Phoenix metropolitan areas remained stable during the period \nJanuary 2011 to 2012.\n  Why is that important? Because the only real indication as to whether \nwe are reducing a supply is the price of that supply. So when we see \nthe price of marijuana on the street in Phoenix and Tucson is exactly \nwhat it was for the entire year, no matter what we see in the papers \nand on television of these large apprehensions, unless the price is \ngoing up, then we are not apprehending these drugs.\n  So I just want to mention a couple of other facts to my colleagues \nand why I think we are not addressing the drug problem sufficiently in \nthis legislation.\n  The assessment continues:\n\n       The retail price of methamphetamine decreased in the \n     Phoenix area and now ranges from $500 to $1,000 per ounce.\n\n  If there is a terrible drug on the market today, it has to be \nmethamphetamine. I am told that one--one--ingestion of methamphetamine \nmakes a person an addict. So what have we been able to do as far as \nmethamphetamine? The retail price of methamphetamine decreased, which \nobviously means the supply has certainly not been impacted.\n\n       Wholesale black tar heroin prices in Arizona have remained \n     stable or decreased slightly, including market stability.\n       Only 35 percent of the HIDTA--\n\n  The high density trafficking area--\n\n     respondents reported high cocaine availability in their \n     respective jurisdictions. Intelligence indicates cocaine \n     price increases in Mexico and Arizona during the past year \n     may have impacted the supply of cocaine to the Arizona \n     drug market, thus impacting other drug markets.\n\n  So that is good news.\n  Continuing to read from the threat assessment: The price per kilogram \nof cocaine increased $5,000 to $6,000 per kilogram in the Phoenix area.\n  My friends, I know my colleagues are very busy, but I would at least \nhave your staff read this threat assessment of 2013 in the State of \nArizona. Again, I do not say that because I represent the State of \nArizona. But these same people--the Drug Enforcement Agency--will tell \nyou still the bulk of illegal drugs crossing our southern border comes \nthrough the Arizona-Tucson sector.\n  So what is my recipe on this situation? Frankly, I do not know a real \ngood recipe because clearly demand is either stable or on the rise in \nthe United States of America depending on to whom you talk. In some \nplaces in America, the use of drugs is glamorized. In some places, it \nis kind of the sophisticated thing to do. I do not think there is any \ndoubt that there are influences in the United States of America that \nincrease the attractiveness of drugs to our citizens.\n  I am not saying I know the answer, but I do think that as we address \nthe issue of border security, we have to understand that if there is a \ndemand for drugs in the streets of every major city in America, they \nwill use all ultralights, they will use submarines, they will use \ntunnels, they will do whatever is necessary in order to get that supply \nto where there is a market.\n  I will never forget being down in Colombia, where the government \npeople there showed me a submarine the drug cartel people had built--a \nvery sophisticated submarine. They had hired engineers to build it. It \nwas one that travels under the water--not far but under the water.\n  I said: How much did it cost them to build this?\n  He said: Five million dollars.\n  I said: Five millions dollars. That is a lot of money.\n  The guy said: They make $15 million in one load--in one load.\n  So I am not coming to this floor with a lot of answers, but I am \ncoming to the floor of this Senate and saying that the drug issue in \nthis country is a serious one, and if anybody thinks we are reducing \nthe supply of those drugs, I think the facts contradict that, and it is \ntime we started seriously as a society addressing what is killing our \nyoung and old Americans.\n  So, again, I thank my colleagues for their consideration of this \nlegislation. I really came to the floor to convince them that this is a \nfar different situation from 1986. We have gone from 4,000 border \nagents to 21,000. We have put in all kinds of barriers to the border. \nBut, most importantly, as the Presiding Officer from Delaware pointed \nout earlier today, we now have technology that can surveil and \ninterdict people from crossing our border. Our challenge is to get it \ndone.\n  I thank my colleague from Vermont for his patience, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me congratulate Senator McCain for \nall of his hard work in the Gang of 8 and his focus on border security, \nwhich is an enormously important issue.\n  As the son of an immigrant--my dad came to this country at the age of \n17 from Poland--I strongly support the concept of immigration reform, \nand I applaud the Judiciary Committee and all of those people who have \nbeen working hard on this legislation.\n  There are a lot of provisions within this bill that I think should be \nstrongly supported by the American people.\n  I strongly support a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million \nundocumented immigrants in this country. Bringing undocumented workers \nout of the shadows and giving them legal status will make it more \ndifficult, among many other things, for employers to undercut the wages \nand benefits of all workers and will be good for our entire economy--a \nvery important step forward.\n  I strongly support the DREAM Act to make sure the children of illegal \nimmigrants who were brought into this country by their parents years \nago are allowed to become citizens.\n  I strongly support providing legal status to foreign workers on \nfamily farms. Dairy farmers in Vermont and the owners of apple orchards \nin my State have told me that without these workers, they would go out \nof business, and it is obviously true in many parts of this country.\n  We also need to make sure, as Senator McCain has just elaborated, \nthat our borders are more secure and prevent unscrupulous employers \nfrom hiring those who have come here illegally.\n  All of those provisions are extremely important, are included in the \nlegislation passed out of the Judiciary Committee last week, and are \nprovisions I support. I commend my colleague from Vermont Senator Pat \nLeahy for his leadership on those issues. But let me tell you some of \nwhat concerns me very much about the bill as it presently stands.\n  At a time when nearly 14 percent of the American people do not have a \nfull-time job, at a time when the middle class continues to disappear, \nand at a time when tens of millions of Americans are working longer \nhours for lower wages, it makes no sense to me\n\n[[Page S4466]]\n\nthat the immigration reform bill includes a massive increase in \ntemporary guest worker programs that will allow large corporations to \nimport and bring into this country hundreds of thousands of temporary \nblue-collar and white-collar guest workers from overseas. That makes no \nsense to me.\n  I am particularly concerned that at a time when college is becoming \nincreasingly unaffordable--and every parent out there with a high \nschool kid is worried about how that family is going to afford college \nfor their kids--at a time when young people desperately need jobs to \nhelp pay for the cost of a college education, this bill will make it \nmore difficult for young Americans to find the jobs they need.\n  Today, youth unemployment is over 16 percent, and the teen \nunemployment rate is over 25 percent. Unfortunately, many of the jobs \nthat used to be performed by young Americans are now being done by \nforeign college students through the J-1 Summer Work Travel Program and \nthe H-2B guest worker program.\n  Millions of Americans, including myself--and I suspect many Members \nof Congress--earned money when they were young at summer jobs or at \npart-time jobs when they were in college in order to pay for the cost \nof college. Some Americans today are working as waiters and waitresses. \nThey are working as lifeguards. They are working as front-desk clerks \nat hotels and resorts. They are working as ski instructors, as cooks, \nchefs, kitchen personnel, chambermaids, landscapers, and many other \nsimilar jobs. And there is nothing any American has to be embarrassed \nabout at working at any of those jobs or any other job in order to earn \nsome income to pay the bills or to make some money in order to afford \nto go to college. There is nothing anybody should be ashamed about \ndoing that kind of work. What I worry about very much is the degree to \nwhich those jobs will be available for young Americans as a result of \nthe J-1 program and the H-2B program.\n  It pains me very deeply that with minority unemployment \nextraordinarily high--I was just in Detroit last week talking to kids \nwho are working so hard, and they are working for $7.25 an hour at \nMcDonald's or other fast food places--if they are lucky enough to get \nthat work. Many of them would like to go to college but are unable to \nearn the money they need in order to go to college. It seems to me \nterribly wrong that we have programs such as this J-1 Summer Work \nTravel Program which brings students from all over the world into the \nUnited States to take jobs that young Americans want to do.\n  The J-1 program for foreign college students is supposed to be--is \nsupposed to be--used as a cultural exchange program, a program to bring \nyoung people into this country to learn about our way of life, our \ncustoms, and to support international cooperation and understanding. \nThose are extremely important goals. I believe in that passionately. \nWhen I was mayor of the city of Burlington, we started sister-city \nprograms with towns around the world in order to develop that type of \nunderstanding and cooperation. That is the theory of what the J-1 \nprogram is supposed to be, and a wonderful goal it is.\n  Unfortunately, that is not what it is today. Today the J-1 program \nhas morphed into a low-wage jobs program to allow corporations such as \nHershey's and McDonald's and many others to replace young American \nworkers with cheaper labor from abroad. Each and every year companies \nfrom all over this country are hiring more than 100,000 foreign college \nstudents in low-wage jobs through the J-1 Summer Work Travel Program.\n  Unlike other guest worker programs, the J-1 Summer Work Travel \nProgram does not require businesses to recruit American workers for \nthese positions, offer jobs to willing and able Americans first, or to \npay prevailing wages. In other words, if there are jobs out there that \nour young people would like to get in order to put aside a few bucks or \nhelp pay for the cost of a college education, the employer is not \nobliged to reach out to these young Americans. It is one thing for an \nemployer to say: Look, I reached out, tried to get some young people to \ndo this job, could not find them, and I had to go abroad. I can \nunderstand that. But that is not the requirement of this J-1 program.\n  Let me read from a Web site of a foreign labor recruiter touting the \nbenefits of using the J-1 Summer Work Travel Program to employers in \nthe United States. This Web site is called jobofer.org. This is one, as \nI understand it, of many. But here is what it says. I quote from the \nWeb site jobofer.org. This is going to employers who need unskilled \nworkers for the summer.\n\n       Whether you are running an amusement park, a water park, a \n     concessions stand, a golf club, a circus, a zoo, or anything \n     else where people come to enjoy themselves, it's a great idea \n     not to miss the opportunities of the season and hire \n     international seasonal workers to cover your growing staffing \n     needs.\n\n  International seasonal workers.\n\n       Jobofer.org has experience in matching candidates from \n     foreign exchange students with amusement firms all over the \n     USA, covering every type of entry level position you may want \n     to cover with seasonal staffing.\n       The Work And Travel USA program allows exchange students \n     from abroad to work in the US for up to 4 months during the \n     buzz season under a J1 visa.\n       Jobofer.org is committed to understanding your needs as an \n     amusement business and handling all the seasonal staffing \n     procedures for you, at absolutely no cost. Check out the list \n     of positions typically filled with international exchange \n     students . . .\n\n  Now, what this Web site is doing is telling employers--in this case, \nthey are just focusing on amusement parks, but obviously it goes much \nbeyond that into all kinds of resorts, many other areas--but what they \nare simply saying is that we need unskilled labor.\n  One knows that historically in this country that is what young people \ndid. When you were in high school, when you were in college, you would \ntry to make a few bucks. You go out and you get a summer job. Maybe you \ncould earn a couple of thousand dollars. Maybe it starts you on a \ncareer or maybe it is money to put aside to go to college. I did it. \nMany Members of the Senate did it. Millions of young people in this \ncountry want to do it.\n  What these companies are saying is: You do not need to hire kids in \nyour community anymore. You do not have to reach out to minority kids \nwho desperately need a job, to kids in Vermont who want to put away a \nfew bucks to go to college. You do not have to do that anymore. We will \nhelp you bring in young people from all over the world to do those \njobs.\n  One of the arguments we hear on the floor is we need highly skilled \nworkers because high-tech companies cannot attract the scientists and \nthe engineers and the physicists and the mathematicians they need. When \nwe bring them in, these guys are going to help create jobs in America. \nMaybe. That is a whole other issue for discussion. But nobody can tell \nme we need to bring young people from all over the world to work at \nentry-level jobs because there are not young Americans who want to do \nthat job, when the unemployment rate of young people in this country is \nextraordinarily high. Nobody with a straight face can make that claim.\n  Here are some of the jobs being advertised on this very same Web \nsite. There are many Web sites like it. This one focuses on jobs within \nthe amusement industry: Ride operators/attendants, game operators, food \nservice--flipping hamburgers--lifeguard. I guess we have no young \npeople in America who are capable of being lifeguards. Nobody in \nAmerica can swim and get a job as a lifeguard. I guess we need to bring \npeople from all over the world to be lifeguards. Guest relations, \nadmissions, security, games and attractions, merchandise, grounds \nquality, season pass processor, entertainment wardrobe, warehouse, \nsafari gatekeepers and wardens, parking lot attendant. I guess nobody \nin America could be a parking lot attendant. Landscape, cash control.\n  Here is the interesting point. The Web site, after mentioning all of \nthose jobs specific to the amusement industry, asks the following \nquestions: What happens--interesting question. What happens when you \nuse seasonal employment for your theme or amusement park? Here is the \nanswer this foreign labor recruiter gives on its Web site:\n\n       You cover your seasonal staffing needs with young, highly \n     motivated, English-speaking international staff from 18 to 28 \n     years old and cut costs by paying fewer taxes.\n\n  Got that? You can bring in international workers, students from \nabroad, and one of the advantages you have is you pay lower taxes on \nthat foreign worker than you do for an American worker.\n\n[[Page S4467]]\n\n  In fact, under the J-1 Summer Work Travel Program, employers do not \nhave to pay Medicare, Social Security, and unemployment taxes, which \namounts to a payroll savings of about 8.45 percent per employee. What a \nbargain. So we are enticing--we are giving an incentive to a company to \nbring foreign workers into this country and saving them money by hiring \nforeign workers at the expense of young Americans who certainly can do \nthose jobs.\n  Under the J-1 program, employers do not have to pay Social Security \nand Medicare payroll taxes. They do not have to pay unemployment taxes. \nThey do not have to offer jobs to Americans first. They do not have to \npay wages that are comparable to what American workers make. What \nemployer in America would want to hire a young American as a lifeguard \nor a ski instructor or a waiter or a waitress, or any other low-skilled \njob, when they can hire a foreign college student instead at a \nsignificant reduction in cost?\n  I understand the immigration reform bill we are debating reforms this \nprogram by requiring foreign labor recruiters to pay a $500 fee for \nevery foreign college student they bring into this country. Right now, \nforeign college students bear all of these costs. But in my opinion, \nthat is not good enough. This program is a real disservice to the young \npeople in this country.\n  I believe in cultural exchanges. I would put a lot more money into \ncultural exchanges so our young people can go abroad, so young people \nfrom all over the world could attend our high schools. That would be a \ngreat thing. But that is not what this J-1 program is. It is a program \nwhich is displacing young American workers at a time of double-digit \nunemployment among youth, and it is putting downward pressure on wages \nat a time when the American people are in many cases working longer \nhours for lower wages.\n  In my opinion, this particular program should be abolished. Cultural \nprogram, yes; but bringing in young people to take jobs from young \nAmericans, no. At the very least, if we are not going to abolish this \nprogram, we need to make sure we have a comparable summer and year-\nround jobs program for our young people in order to help them pay for \ncollege and to move up the economic ladder. At the very least, that is \nwhat should be in this bill.\n  That is why I will be filing an amendment today to the immigration \nreform bill to create a youth jobs program. My amendment would provide \nStates with $1.5 billion in immediate funding to support a 2-year \nsummer and year-round jobs program for low-income youth and \neconomically disadvantaged young adults. This amendment is modeled on \nthe summer and year-round youth jobs program included in President \nObama's American Jobs Act.\n  This amendment would build on the success from the American Recovery \nand Reinvestment Act, which provided $1.2 billion in funding for the \nWIA Youth Jobs Program. This program created over 374,000 summer job \nopportunities during 2009 and 2010 for young Americans who desperately \nneeded those jobs. This amendment, in fact, would create even more \njobs.\n  Let me be very clear. The same corporations and businesses that \nsupport a massive expansion in guest worker programs are opposed to \nraising the minimum wage. They have long supported the outsourcing of \nAmerican jobs. They have reduced wages and benefits of American workers \nat a time when corporate profits are at an all-time high. In too many \ncases, the H-2B program for lower skilled guest workers and the H-1B \nfor high-skilled guest workers are being used by employers to drive \ndown the wages and benefits of American workers and to replace American \nworkers with cheap labor from abroad.\n  The immigration reform bill that passed the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee could increase the number of low-skilled guest workers by as \nmuch as 800 percent over the next 5 years and could more than triple \nthe number of temporary white-collar guest workers coming into this \ncountry. That is the basic issue. That is my basic concern. At a time \nwhen unemployment is so high, does it make a whole lot of sense to be \nbringing hundreds of thousands of workers from all over the world into \nthis country to fill jobs American workers desperately need?\n\n  The high-tech industry tells us they need the H-1B program so they \ncan hire the best and the brightest science, technology, engineering, \nand math workers in the world, and that there are not enough qualified \nAmerican workers in these fields. In some cases--let me be very \nhonest--I think that is true. I think there are some companies in some \nparts of the country that are unable to attract American workers to do \nthe jobs that are needed. I believe in those instances, corporations \nshould have the right to bring in foreign workers so the corporation \ncan do the business it is supposed to be doing.\n  But having said that, let me also tell you some facts: In 2010, 54 \npercent of the H-1B guest workers were employed in entry-level jobs and \nperformed ``routine tasks requiring limited judgment,'' according to \nthe Government Accountability Office. Routine tasks.\n  So when a lot of my friends here talk about high-tech workers, they \nare talking about scientists, they are talking about all of these guys \nwho are doing a great job, but that is not necessarily the case. Only 6 \npercent of H-1B visas were given to workers with highly specialized \nskills in 2010, according to the GAO. More than 80 percent of H-1B \nguest workers are paid wages that are less than American workers in \ncomparable positions, according to the Economic Policy Institute.\n  Over 9 million Americans have degrees in a STEM-related field, but \nonly about 3 million have a job in one. Last year, the top 10 employers \nof H-1B guest workers were all offshore outsourcing companies. These \nfirms are responsible for shipping large numbers of American \ninformation technology jobs to India and other countries. Half of all \nrecent college graduates majoring in computer and information science \nin the United States did not receive jobs in the information technology \nsector. So it seems to me this is an issue we have got to deal with.\n  The second amendment I will be filing today is with Senators Grassley \nand Harkin. That amendment would prohibit companies that have announced \nmass layoffs over the past year from hiring guest workers unless these \ncompanies can prove their overall employment will not be reduced as a \nresult of these mass layoffs. In other words, what we are seeing is a \nvery clear trend. Large corporations are throwing American workers out \non the street, and they are bringing in foreign workers to do those \nvery same jobs.\n  Many of those very same companies have moved parts of their corporate \nworld away from the United States into Third World countries. So this \ncontinues the attack on American workers. We must stop it.\n  Let me give you a few examples as I conclude my remarks. In 2012, \nHewlett-Packard, one of the large American corporations, announced it \nwas laying off 30,000 workers at the same time it hired more than 660 \nH-1B guest workers. In 2012, Cisco laid off 1,300 employees at the same \ntime it hired more than 330 H-1B guest workers. In 2012, Yahoo hired \nmore than 135 H-1B guest workers at the same time it announced it was \nlaying off over 2,000 workers. Research in Motion hired 24 H-1B guest \nworkers at the same time it laid off over 5,000 people.\n  I think it makes no sense at all that corporations that are laying \noff American workers are now reaching into the H-1B program to bring in \nforeign workers.\n  Let me conclude by saying there is much in this legislation I support \nand that I believe the American people support. But problems remain. \nProblems remain. The main problem to me is this guest worker concept \nwhich is being widely abused by employers throughout this country. At \nthe very least, I want to see a summer jobs program for our kids who \nare now losing jobs because of the J-1 program. But we need to do even \nmore than that.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues who have worked so hard \non this bill to make it a bill that all Americans and all working \npeople can be supportive of.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murphy). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate as in \nmorning business and engage in a colloquy with the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4468]]\n\n                                 Syria\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in a couple of minutes the President of \nthe United States will be announcing it is now conclusive that Bashar \nal-Asad and the Syrian butchers have used chemical weapons, which is, \nas we all know, a red line which the President of the United States \nannounced that Bashar al-Asad cannot cross.\n  Asad has been very clever in using small amounts rather than large \namounts. But the fact is we are not the first country to conclude the \nAsad regime has used chemical weapons in their attacks on the \npopulation of Syria.\n  The President also will announce we will be assisting the Syrian \nrebels in Syria by providing them with weapons and other assistance. I \napplaud the President's decision, 93,000 people dead later, over 1 \nmillion refugees, and the countries in the surrounding region erupting \ninto sectarian violence, the clear spreading of this conflict into a \nregional conflict: Sunni, Shia, Saudi, Iran, Russia, all major players.\n  We see that Jordan is overwhelmed with refugees. Lebanon is \nexperiencing sectarian violence. Iraq is unraveling and the entire \nregion is bordering on chaos, not to mention the massacre and genocide \nthat is taking place in Syria.\n  I applaud the President's decision, and I appreciate it. The \nPresident of the United States had better understand that just \nsupplying weapons is not going to change the equation on the ground of \nthe balance of power. These people, the Free Syrian Army, need weapons \nand heavy weapons to counter tanks and aircraft. They need a no-fly air \nzone. Bashar Asad's air assets have to be taken out and neutralized. We \ncan do that without risking a single American airplane. We can do it by \ncratering the runways with cruise missiles, moving the PATRIOT missiles \ncloser to the border, and protecting a safe zone where they can \norganize, they can work, and they can coordinate with the civilian side \nof the Syrian National Army, and they can have a chance of success.\n  Today--thanks to Iranians, thanks to Russia, thanks to Hezbollah \npouring in by the thousands, thanks to people flowing in from all over \nthe Middle East--including from Iraq back into Syria--they are losing. \nThey are being massacred and they are sustaining incredibly heavy \ncasualties. It is terrible.\n  I applaud the President's decision. I applaud the fact that he has \nnow acknowledged what the French, the others, and all the rest of us \nknew, that Bashar Asad is using chemical weapons.\n  Just to provide weapons to the Syrian National Army is not enough. We \nhave to change the equation on the battleground. If I might say, I have \nseen and been in conflicts where there was gradual escalation. They \ndon't win. If all we are going to do is supply weapons, then there will \nbe a commensurate resupply by the Iranians, Russians, and others.\n  I thank the President for acknowledging the Syrians are using \nchemical weapons and massacring their own people. I applaud his \ndecision to provide additional weapons.\n  Every ounce, every bone in my body knows that simply providing \nweapons will not change the battlefield equation, and we must change \nthe battlefield equation; otherwise, we are going to see a regional \nconflict, the consequences of which we will be paying for for a long \ntime.\n  I yield to my colleague from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I wish to add my voice to the President's decision to \nact, because I think action by the United States and the international \ncommunity is required.\n  What does it matter to the average American that we contain this war \nin Syria and that it ends sooner rather than later? As to chemical \nweapons that have now been acknowledged to be used by Asad against his \nown people, my goal is to make sure they are not used against us, \nIsrael, or our allies throughout the world. If we don't stop this war, \nthe chemical weapons caches--numbers in the hundreds of thousands of \nweapons--could be used to be deployed to kill thousands of Americans or \nIsraelis or people who are aligned with us.\n  The President's decision to intervene comes from an escalation of the \nuse of chemical weapons by Asad. As Senator McCain has indicated, the \nthreats to our country are not just from the chemical weapons but from \na regional deterioration.\n  I say to the sitting President of the Senate today, we were in \nJordan. The Jordanian Government has to accommodate over 550,000 Syrian \nrefugees. Sixty thousand Syrian children are attending Jordanian \nschools. The economy in Jordan is about to collapse. If we lose the \nKing of Jordan, we have lost one of the last moderate voices in the \nMiddle East.\n  This war has a ripple effect. It is affecting Turkey; it is affecting \nIraq. Radical Islamists are flowing in on the Sunni side and Shia side. \nThere are al-Qaida elements that are filling in the vacuum because the \nwar has gone on so long. Now we have Hezbollah, a radical Islamic Shia \ngroup. This is turning into a civil war within Syria and a regional \nconflict.\n  To the President: Your decision today to get involved is welcome \nnews. But as Senator McCain said, Mr. President, the goal is to end the \nwar. The only way this war is going to end quickly and on our terms is \nto neutralize the air assets Asad enjoys.\n  On the air power advantage he has over the rebels, we can crater the \nrunways. There are four air bases he uses. We can stop the planes from \nflying. We can shoot planes down without having one boot on the ground. \nThat is not necessary.\n  As to Senator McCain's point, the longer this war goes on, the more \ndamage to our allies, and the more likely the chemical weapons can be \nused not just against Syrians but against us and others. My biggest \nfear about the war in Syria is the chemical weapons falling in the \nhands of radical Islamists. They are closer today than they have ever \nbeen in achieving that goal.\n  Mr. President, you made the right call today. We need to follow up to \nend this war with neutralizing Asad's air power and having a no-fly \nzone so the rebels can reorganize. When we supply arms to the rebels, \nwe will look long and hard at who to give the arms to.\n  The good news is we don't need to give them a bunch of anti-aircraft \ncapability if we crater the runways through the international community \nusing our assets. If we neutralize the air power by blowing up the \nrunways, you don't have to provide the rebels with a bunch of anti-\naircraft capability.\n  If we will provide a no-fly zone using PATRIOT missile batteries, you \ncan protect the people without interjecting massive weapons into the \nconflict.\n  Senator McCain has been right about this for a couple of years. This \nis a big day.\n  I will conclude with this. Asad is the reason the Russians are \nproviding him more weapons. The reason is Hezbollah is in Syria. The \nreason the Iranians are so bold is he is clearly winning. It is not in \nour national interests for him to win because the Israelis cannot allow \nthe technology being sold to Asad by the Russians being present, \nbecause it will hurt their national security.\n  I hope with this intervention today to get involved, after chemical \nweapons have been used, the tide of the battle will turn. If it doesn't \nturn, it will have catastrophic results for national security and the \nregion as a whole.\n  The President chose wisely today to get involved. We support him. The \ngoal is not to help the rebels, the goal is to end the war before \nchemical weapons can be used against us, we lose the King of Jordan, \nand the entire Middle East goes up in flames.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I ask my colleague if he remembers when the Secretary \nof Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff appeared \nbefore our committee well over a year ago and said, unsolicited, it is \ninevitable, it is inevitable that Bashar Asad will fall? Does the \nSenator remember that?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. This is from our highest ranking official and from our \nhighest defense official, the Secretary of Defense.\n  At that time I said: What makes you so sure? How can you be so sure \nwith the help from Hezbollah, with the help from the Russians at the \ntime, the equipment and arms they are getting?\n  They said: Don't worry. The fall of Asad is inevitable.\n  Is there anybody today who believes he is going to fall? I don't \nthink so. Because the facts on the ground are he is\n\n[[Page S4469]]\n\nwinning and the slaughter continues. The latest is 93,000 people have \nbeen massacred. As the Senator from South Carolina indicated, there are \nwell over 1 million refugees overwhelming the neighboring countries.\n  It is my understanding the President has not made the final decision \non arming, but he has made the decision that chemical weapons are being \nused. I think it is obvious they will be providing weapons. They need a \nno-fly zone. I would say there are military officials in the Pentagon \nwho will say we can't do it, and we have to have total mobilization of \nevery single Reserve in the world and the United States, and it is so \nhard.\n  We spend tens of billions of dollars a year on defense. If our \nmilitary can't establish a no-fly zone, then, by God, American taxpayer \ndollars have been terribly wasted and we ought to have an investigation \nas to why we can't handle a situation in a third-rate country. I \nbelieve we can, I know we can. I know, because I talked to people, such \nas the head of our Central Command, a former head of our Central \nCommand, our former head of NATO, and others, such as General Keane, \nthe architect of the surge. We can go in and establish a no-fly zone, \nand we can change this equation on the battlefield.\n  Finally, I would ask my colleague, we understand the American people \nare war weary. They are weary because of what happened in Iraq. We \nremain in Afghanistan. Iraq is unraveling, by the way, but Americans \nare weary. They are tired of reading the casualty lists, of the \nfunerals, and the terrible tragedies that have befallen American \nfamilies. That is why neither I nor the Senator from South Carolina is \nsaying we want boots on the ground. In fact, we don't want boots on the \nground. We know it would be counterproductive. We know it would not \nlead to victory. We do know we can provide incredible assistance and \nchange this battlefield equation.\n  Finally, because a lot of Americans haven't paid perhaps as much \nattention as some of us, and maybe because they are war weary, I think \nit would be wise for the President of the United States to go on \nnational television to explain to the American people why we are \nstopping this genocide, explain why we are assisting these people who \nare struggling for the same things we stand for and believe in, why the \nUnited States of America went to Bosnia with air power, not boots on \nthe ground, and why we went to Kosovo and didn't put boots on the \nground. Explain how we can help these people while alleviating the \nunspeakable misery of the Syrian people.\n  Does my colleague from South Carolina agree with that?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would recommend the President educate the American \npeople about what is going on in the Middle East, because it is scary. \nIt is really scary.\n  The Iranians are marching toward a nuclear weapon. Israel is becoming \nmore surrounded by radical Islamic nations, not less. The King of \nJordan is teetering. If we lose him, God knows what is going to happen \nin the Middle East.\n  I would suggest that the President take it one step further. Explain \nto the American people what happens to us if these chemical weapons \nAsad has used against his own people fall into the hands of radical \nIslamists who want to do more than just take care of Syria. My big fear \nis weapons of mass destruction are going to fall into the hands of \nradical Islamists either in Iran or Syria if we don't act quickly.\n  The only reason thousands of Americans have been killed in the war on \nterror--and not millions--is they can't get the weapons to kill \nmillions of us. If they could, they would.\n  I would argue very strongly it is in our national security interests \nto make sure the war in Syria ends and Asad is displaced.\n  Senator McCain is right, he is winning. He was supposed to be gone \nlast year. He is never going to be displaced until the tide of battle \nchanges. The way we change the tide of battle is neutralize his air \npower. We can do that without mobilizing every Reservist, including me. \nIt can be done, it should be done, and it is in our interests to do it.\n  One last thought. If we do not address the chemical weapons \ncompromise in Syria and end this war before these chemical weapons flow \nout of Syria, not only will Israel be in the crosshairs of radical \nIslamists with a weapons-of-mass-destruction capability, it is only a \nmatter of time before they come here. The next bomb that goes off in a \nplace like Boston could have more than nails and glass in it.\n  The people who want these weapons in Syria, trying to develop nuclear \ncapability in Iran, if we don't think they are coming after us, we are \nnaive. I know we are war weary, but I hope we are not too weary to \nprotect our children, grandchildren, and ourselves from a threat that \nis real. I wish it would go away, but we don't make these things go \naway by wishing, we confront them. The sooner we confront it, the \nbetter off we will be.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would mention one other thing, as I know one of my \ncolleagues is waiting on the floor. There is no other experience that I \nthink anyone can have to see the terrible ravage of war than to go to a \nrefugee camp. The Senator from South Carolina and I have been to \nrefugee camps on both the Turkish and the Jordanian border to see \nthousands of people living in terribly primitive conditions; to see, as \nI did in one camp we visited--there had been a rainstorm the night \nbefore and people were literally living in water--the desperation on \nthe faces of the people and the children.\n  I have had many moving experiences while visiting these refugee \ncamps, but I also think there is an aspect we ought to understand and \nappreciate as Americans. They are angry and they are bitter because we \nwouldn't come to their assistance.\n  I will never forget a woman who was a schoolteacher escorting me \naround the refugee camp. She said: Senator McCain, do you see all these \nchildren here? Do you see all these children?\n  She said: These children are going to take revenge on those who \nrefused to help them stop this slaughter by Bashar Asad.\n  So there are long-term implications both on the humanitarian side as \nwell as other aspects of this issue. Believe me, it is the greatest \nblow to Iran in 25 years if Bashar Asad fell. So it is not just a \nhumanitarian issue. If Bashar Asad goes, Hezbollah is disconnected from \nIran, and the whole equation in the Middle East dramatically changes. \nIf Iran and Bashar Asad succeed, we will see a direct threat of the \nState of Israel, which the Israelis understand, coming from the Golan \nHeights.\n  So this is not only a humanitarian issue, it is a national security \nissue. If Iran succeeds, keeping Bashar Asad in power, that will send a \nmessage throughout the Middle East about Iranian power, Iranian \nability, and the Iranian ability to change governments throughout the \nMiddle East. So there is a lot at stake.\n  I hope the President will go to a no-fly zone and give these people \nthe weapons with which to defend themselves, as Russian arms and \nIranian arms pour into the country on the side of Bashar Asad. My \nfriends, it is not a fair fight, and we know, in that kind of climate \nand terrain, air power is the deciding factor.\n  I thank my colleague from South Carolina, and I appreciate the \npatience of the Senator from Texas.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cowan). The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                             Iran Election\n\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, on Friday, the people of Iran head to the \npolls to make a false choice. Ostensibly participating in a democratic \nprocess to select a new President, they are really affirming their \nexisting extremist theocracy. They will be forced to select not the \ncandidate of their choice but the candidates that have been chosen for \nthem by the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei--candidates guaranteed to \ncontinue the Supreme Leader's policies of political and religious \noppression in pursuit of nuclear capability at all costs.\n  In the United States we are now engaged in a national dialog about \nhow we can best preserve our God-given rights guaranteed to us by our \nConstitution. We are taking a serious look at the role of government in \nour lives and revisiting the balance government is striking between \nsecurity and privacy. But even as we debate these vital issues at home, \nwe should remember those who are denied their liberty in Iran.\n\n[[Page S4470]]\n\n  Today, in Iran, the economic picture is grim. Forty percent of \nIranian citizens now live below the poverty line, almost double the \nrate in 2005. The rial has lost 50 percent of its value. The official \nrate of inflation is 32.2 percent. The real rate is considerably \nhigher. The national rate of unemployment is 11.2 percent, and it is as \nhigh as 20 percent in certain regions.\n  Basic freedoms--political, religious, speech, the Internet--are under \nsystematic attack by the regime. Sadly, persecution and oppression are \nthe norm in Iran. Iran's political opposition has been effectively \nsilenced. Key 2009 opposition leaders, such as Mir Hossein Mousavi and \nMehdi Karroubi have been imprisoned without charge in their own homes \nfor 2 years with locked doors and windows. The list of Presidential \ncandidates has been hand-selected by the Supreme Leader, not by the \nIranian people. American-Iranian Pastor Saeed Abedini is right now \nserving an 8-year sentence in Iran's brutal Evin prison for simply \nprofessing his faith.\n  In January, I was proud to sign a letter, along with 11 other \nSenators, to Secretary Clinton advocating for Pastor Abedini's release \nand to Secretary Kerry on February 12, thanking him for his statement \nin support of Pastor Abedini.\n  There has been a crackdown on Christians in the lead-up to this \nelection, including the closing of the Central Assemblies of God Church \nin Tehran and the detention of Pastor Robert Asserian. Iranian Pastor \nBehnam Irani may face the death penalty for organizing a 300-strong \ncongregation of the Church of Iran. Iran's 100,000-plus Evangelical \nChristians are suffering brutal oppression right now.\n  In an imitation of China, Iran is attempting to create a sort of \ninternal Internet that will block access to international news and \nsocial media. Since the 2009 uprising, the Supreme Leader has \ninstituted four new entities to restrict Internet freedom: The Supreme \nCouncil on Cyberspace, the Committee Charged with Determining Offensive \nContent, the Cyber Police, and the Cyber Army.\n  Iran has continued to aggressively expand its influence in the region \nand beyond. Iran remains a leading state sponsor of terrorism and is \nincreasing its activity. Iran has been so hostile toward the nation of \nIsrael that Prime Minister Netanyahu recently expressed fears of \n``another Holocaust'' from Tehran, regardless of any election that may \ntake place. Iran's proxy army, Hezbollah, is supporting Asad's \nmurderous attacks on his own people in Syria.\n  Today, the United Nations estimated that 93,000 people have been \nslaughtered in Syria since the uprising began in 2011. Iran's \nfingerprints are on those murders. Iran is not only expanding its own \ninfluence in the region through closer ties with the Muslim Brotherhood \nin Egypt, but it is also expanding its influence in Latin America. Most \ntroubling, Iran is proceeding undeterred in its pursuit of nuclear \nweapons capability.\n  In my judgment, there is no greater threat to the national security \nof the United States than the prospect of a nuclear Iran, and we need \nto be unequivocal and speak with absolute clarity that the United \nStates will do whatever it takes to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear \nweapons capability.\n  Unfortunately, the message from the United States has at times seemed \nmuddled. On the one hand, Secretary of State John Kerry has asked \nCongress to relax sanctions around the Iranian Presidential elections \nso his diplomatic efforts have a ``window'' to work. On the other hand, \nthe Obama administration recently announced new sanctions on Iran's \ncurrency and a new initiative to get communications devices to the \nIranian people. But both efforts, however well intentioned, came too \nlate to have any real impact on this election.\n  Today, the Senate is taking encouraging action. I am pleased the \nSenate hopes to pass a resolution, S. Res. 154, reaffirming our call \nfor free and fair elections, a resolution I fully support.\n  The resolution also condemns the widespread human rights violations \nof the Government of Iran, calls on the Government of Iran to respect \nits peoples' freedom of expression and association, and expresses our \nongoing support to the people of Iran for their calls for a democratic \ngovernment that upholds freedom, civil liberties, and the rule of law.\n  The Iranian people may well be confused about where the United States \nstands, especially after we stood silently by when they took to the \nstreets 4 years ago during the Green Revolution. But it was not always \nthis way. Twenty-six years ago this week, President Ronald Reagan stood \nin front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin and challenged Soviet leader \nMikhail Gorbachev to tear down the wall that divided the eastern and \nwestern halves of the city. No more important words have been spoken by \na leader in modern times.\n  Today, I ask all Americans to join me in likewise urging the regime \nin Iran to tear down the walls of political and religious persecution, \nto relieve the pain of the unnecessary economic hardship, and to \nrenounce the isolation caused by Tehran's aggressive and belligerent \npolicies.\n  To those right now imprisoned and being persecuted in Iran, I would \nrepeat the words of encouragement President Reagan gave when he knew \nthe tyranny represented by the Berlin Wall would not stand. As \nPresident Reagan observed: ``For it cannot withstand faith; it cannot \nwithstand truth; it cannot withstand freedom.'' That is the very same \nmessage we should convey to the people of Iran as they suffer under \ntyrannical theocracy.\n  To the Supreme Leader I would say: Stop oppressing your people. Stop \npersecuting Christians. Stop pursuing nuclear weapons capability. Stop \nstifling freedom of speech and allow real and free elections. Free the \nIranian people.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Defense Contracting\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the power of the free \nenterprise system. It is one of the reasons for America's greatness. I \nknow from experience that private businesses do some things better than \nthe government ever could. But over the last couple of decades, the \nUnited States has increasingly relied on private contractors to do the \nwork the men and women in our Armed Forces used to do, and they are \ngetting exorbitant salaries to do the same work--in some cases, almost \ntwice the salary of the President of the United States.\n  To the people of West Virginia and to me it doesn't make any sense to \npay a defense contractor up to $763,000 a year. That is almost twice as \nmuch as our Commander in Chief and almost four times as much as our \nSecretary of Defense. If we do nothing about this, this figure will \nautomatically rise to $951,000 next year--$951,000. That is almost $1 \nmillion a year right in the middle of sequestration when we are cutting \neverything.\n  With the war in Afghanistan winding down, it is only natural for \ndefense contractors to be looking for new opportunities, and the \nsouthern border of our country is one of the places they are eyeing. In \nfact, the New York Times says some of them are getting ready to \ndemonstrate military grade and long-range camera systems this summer in \nan effort to secure billion-dollar contracts with Homeland Security.\n  I understand we need the expertise of a private industry to secure \nour borders, but taxpayers should not be responsible for the exorbitant \nsalaries these contractors are demanding. So I am offering an amendment \nthat would cap compensation for private contractors employed for border \nsecurity. The cap would be $230,700 annually, which is the most a \ngovernment civilian can be paid in a given year. So it is in line with \nwhat we are doing.\n  That is significantly more than we pay Defense Secretary Hagel or our \nHomeland Security Secretary Napolitano.\n  There is nothing in my amendment that would prevent contractors from \nmaking more than $230,000. We are not saying they can't make more than \nthat. We are saying they can't pass that through to the taxpayers of \nAmerica. They have to pay it out of the profits of their company. The \nonly thing I\n\n[[Page S4471]]\n\nam preventing is the taxpayers from having to foot the bill.\n  I have heard some proposals to bring that figure down to $487,000. \nThat is an improvement. But, frankly, I can't look West Virginians in \nthe eye, and I am sure the Chair would have a hard time looking his \nconstituents in Massachusetts in the eye, and justify paying government \ncontractors that much money because it is just hard to justify. It \ncan't be justified.\n  We need to get our fiscal house in order. We can't do that if we \nallow private contractors to charge the taxpayers exorbitant salaries \nof almost $1 million. It is time for commonsense controls on \ncontractors' salaries. So I am asking for the support of this amendment \nwhen it comes to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to share \nsome remarks, and I appreciate the eloquence of my friend and colleague \nfrom West Virginia on the issue he just mentioned.\n  The committee did reduce almost by half the amount that contractors \ncould bill, and we may see further changes in that issue. But when we \nare talking about money, real money, there is a problem we have with \nthe bill that came out of committee. It is such a grim, serious matter \nthat we have to talk about it, we have to be up front about it, and \nnobody can be confused about it.\n  I was pleased with Chairman Levin. He is a wonderful chairman of our \ncommittee. We have consistently had bipartisan votes. I wanted it to be \na bipartisan vote for the bill and voted for it today, but I am not \nsure that was the right vote because I said during the committee that \nwe have a serious problem in the amount of money that was appropriated \nfor the bill, $52 billion over the current law.\n  There is a hope and belief that we can fix that gap between now and \nthe time it comes to the floor. Secretary Hagel was before the Budget \nCommittee yesterday. I am the ranking Republican on the Budget \nCommittee. He indicated he is working on a plan to help us be within \nthe law. He also indicated that to Chairman Levin and Ranking Member \nInhofe on the Armed Services Committee. But let's be sure what the \nsituation is.\n  August 2011 we had run up huge debt. We had hit our debt ceiling \nagain. The administration and the President wanted to raise the debt \nceiling $2.1 trillion, one of the largest--or maybe the largest--raise \nof the debt ceiling in history. That was supposed to take us 2 or 3 \nyears.\n  Well, we have already hit that debt ceiling again now it appears. \nSoon we will be having to pass legislation. All the little extensions \nand maneuvering to extend the debt ceiling a little longer are being \nexercised, and we will soon have to vote again to raise the debt \nceiling.\n  But in August of 2011, after much intensity of effort, legislation \npassed. I opposed it. One of my biggest concerns was what it was doing \nto the defense budget. But the bill passed. It set up a committee, and \nthe committee was to deal with future cuts and long-term entitlement \nprograms and other programs. That was their goal. They were given that \nchallenge.\n  Fundamentally, the bill that passed raised the debt ceiling $2.1 \ntrillion, but it reduced the growth of spending over the next 10 years \nby $2.1 trillion. Unfortunately, those reductions in the growth of \nspending fell disproportionately on the Defense Department. I will \nmention that in a minute.\n  But the agreement was clear. There were no tax increases. There were \nno other gimmicks to it other than the spending level would be reduced \nover 10 years by $2.1 trillion. We were then spending at the level of \n$3.7 trillion a year, which would mean $37 trillion over 10 years. We \nwere on track to spend $47 trillion over 10 years--a substantial \nincrease from the current level. So the agreement was that it would \nreduce the growth to $45 trillion instead of $47 trillion.\n  There was a hope that the committee would reach an even more historic \nagreement in which entitlements--Social Security and Medicare--would be \nput on a firm foundation, and we would get the country on the right \ntrack.\n  The committee failed. They did not reach an agreement. So in law \nthere remains the BCA, and within the Budget Control Act there was the \nsequester, and the sequester would take another $500 billion. The BCA \ntook about $500 billion out of the defense budget, and the sequester \npart of the BCA took another. When the committee didn't reach an \nagreement, that was another $500 billion to be taken out of the Defense \nDepartment, $1 trillion.\n  The Defense Department represents one-sixth of the Federal budget, \nalmost $1 trillion out of the defense, one-sixth of the government. \nThat is one-half of the cuts that were to be taken from our entire \ngovernment.\n  When we look at the numbers over 10 years, the defense budget \nadjusted for inflation would take a 14-percent reduction in its \nfunding, whereas the remaining five-sixths of the Federal Government \nwould have a 44-percent increase in its funding.\n  This is the kind of malapportionment of belt tightening that ought \nnot to happen. So I thought--and I believe the American people \nthought--that we should get together with the President and see how we \ncan avoid this problem and spread the cuts out through other agencies \nand departments, many of which had no reductions whatsoever. Of course, \nSocial Security had no reduction whatsoever. Medicaid--one of the \nfastest growing programs of all--had zero reduction in spending under \nsequester. Food stamps had gone from $20 billion to $80 billion, \nincreased fourfold in 12 years, and got zero cuts. A lot of other \nprograms got zero cuts; whereas, the Defense Department was getting \nhammered.\n  People think, well, the war is coming down and the Defense Department \ncan handle it. No, that is not the way it works. The war costs are \nentirely separate. This is a reduction of the base defense budget, \nwhere we pay our soldiers, pay our electric bills, maintain our \naircraft, our ships, our ports, and our bases around the world. That is \nwhat is being cut, the fundamental strength of the military, and it is \ntoo much.\n  Can they survive it? Not without doing some damage. Sure, they will \nsurvive it, and they will be able to get by. But what ought to be done \nis we ought to get together with the Commander in Chief of the U.S. \nmilitary, work with the Secretary of Defense, former-Senator Chuck \nHagel, get together and figure out a way to have some other parts of \nthis government take some of the reductions in spending that have \nfallen disproportionately on the Defense Department. It is just that \nsimple.\n  I suggested to Secretary Hagel yesterday at the Budget Committee \nthat, yes, he ought to be talking with Congress; yes, we have \neventually the power of the purse; but nothing is going to happen in \nthe Senate that President Obama doesn't agree to. Senator Reid is not \ngoing to support anything President Obama doesn't agree to. It looks to \nme like the Members of the Democratic caucus are going to stick \ntogether on this issue. They have so far. Months have gone by and \nsequester hasn't been fixed.\n  So I said: I assume, Mr. Secretary, you have the phone number to 1600 \nPennsylvania Avenue. I think you had better call over there to the \nCommander in Chief of the U.S. military, who has an obligation to the \nmen and women he is deploying all over the world and sending into \nharm's way, and who has an obligation to maintain the strength of our \nmilitary.\n  Yes, it can be more efficient. It has already taken $500 billion in \ncuts, and it may take a little more. But these cuts are more than can \nbe easily assimilated.\n  I just believe this has drifted to a point where we are in a serious \npredicament. The military has already had to lay off civilian workers \nof the U.S. Government for 11 days, furloughed without pay, and done \nother things to try to stay within the financial constraints they are \nnow under because the cuts are beginning to bite.\n  So that is the situation. I want to say to my colleagues, I do not \nbelieve the Defense bill that came out of committee--and we had a nice \ndiscussion today on multiple issues that are important to America's \ndefense, and we had a good collegial feeling. I don't believe that bill \nshould pass the Senate--I don't believe it will pass the Senate--if it \nviolates the spending limits we voted on just 2 years ago.\n\n[[Page S4472]]\n\n  Just think of it. We agreed to reduce the growth of spending from $37 \nbillion now at that rate 2 years ago. We were going to let it grow to \n47, we reduced the growth to 45, and we come back to the American \npeople and say we can't effect that now? We can't reduce the growth and \nspending just that little bit? We promised you that we would raise the \ndebt ceiling, but I know it made you angry, American people. You were \nmad at us because we mismanaged your money. But we promise, we will \nreduce the growth of spending by $2.1 trillion. Trust us. We will do \nit.\n  And here we are. President Obama, 6 months later, produced a budget \nthat wiped out all those cuts and increased taxes, taxes and spending. \nThis has been the pattern we have been in. I have to say, we do not \nneed to have this happen.\n  So I am prepared to meet with the President. I am prepared to meet \nwith the Secretary of Defense, the Office of Management and Budget, and \ntalk about where we can find other reductions in spending and reduce \nsome of the reductions on the Defense Department. We need to reduce a \ngood many of those, frankly. Then the Defense Department can phase in \nsome reductions in spending over the outyears. They can do that. But \ntoo much too fast is destabilizing. No business would do that. So we \nhave to figure out a way to make this system work.\n  I was pleased to work with Senator Levin and Senator Inhofe today. I \nwant to be cooperative and be positive in our efforts. I like much of \nwhat we did with the authorization bill in the Armed Services \nCommittee, but we just didn't talk about the elephant in the room; that \nis, the sequester, the real danger we have there. We are going to have \nto discuss it now. It will be part of the floor discussion and debate \nif it is not fixed.\n  It can be fixed. I think we are all prepared to work for it. I don't \nbelieve this country will sink into the ocean. I don't believe this \ncountry is going to have to close its ports. I don't believe this \ncountry is going to have to end tours at the White House to reduce the \ngrowth of spending by $2 trillion, from $47 trillion to $45 trillion \nover the next 10 years. I don't believe that is going to bankrupt us. \nBut we ought to do it in a smart way. We should have every agency and \ndepartment of government tighten their belts, not just some.\n  We slipped into this when the sequester was written to try to effect \nsome political result that didn't occur, and now, as a responsible \nSenate, we have to consider what is right for America. The right thing \nis to have all agencies and departments tighten their belts and reduce \nthe pressure that is now falling on our Defense Department.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich).

TODD JONES NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on Tuesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee \nheld a hearing on the nomination of B. Todd Jones to serve as the \ndirector of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, \nATF. I thank Senator Klobuchar for the exceptional job she did in \nchairing this hearing and setting the record straight with respect to \ndistortions of the nominee's record.\n  Todd Jones continues to serve this country honorably. He volunteered \nfor the U.S. Marine Corps in 1983, serving on active duty as a judge \nadvocate and infantry officer until 1989. In 1991, he was recalled to \nActive Duty to command the 4th Marine Division's Military Police \nCompany in Iraq. He also served as commanding officer of the Twin \nCities Marine Reserve Unit. He has twice been considered for the \nimportant law enforcement position of U.S. attorney and twice \nunanimously reported out of the Judiciary Committee and unanimously \nconfirmed by the Senate. In 1998 he was first appointed to be the U.S. \nattorney for the District of Minnesota and became the first African \nAmerican U.S. attorney in Minnesota's history. In 2009, when that \noffice was at a low point and needed a strong hand to lead it back, he \nanswered the call, again.\n  When the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives needed \nnew leadership after its poorly conceived and executed Fast and Furious \noperation, the President called upon him, again. He was called upon to \nclear up the mess and deserves our thanks for having made great \nprogress in doing so. He has done so while all the while continuing to \nserve as the U.S. attorney for the District of Minnesota and has had to \nrestore leadership and effectiveness in two important law enforcement \nagencies.\n  We have received numerous letters of support for Todd Jones' \nnomination from law enforcement, respected legal professionals, and \nveterans of the U.S. Marine Corps. He has critics; he has taken on \ndifficult assignments. As he noted at his hearing, sometimes you have \nto take action to make a change and change is not always something that \neveryone is going to favor. A fair evaluation of what he has \naccomplished leads me to support his nomination to be confirmed as the \ndirector of ATF.\n  The ATF has been without a permanent director since that position was \nmade a confirmable position in 2006. We lean heavily on the expertise \nof the ATF. For example, under the leadership of Todd Jones, since \nSeptember 2011, ATF has been called on to analyze the bombs left near \nthe finish line at the Boston Marathon, to sift through burned debris \nat the chemical plant explosion in West, TX, and to trace the weapons \nused in the Newtown and Aurora mass killings. Agents of the ATF have \nplayed a major role in investigating some of our Nation's worst \ntragedies. The agency needs a confirmed head. Todd Jones is the ATF's \nfifth acting director since 2006. The Senate should be doing everything \nit can to ensure that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and \nExplosives has the tools it needs to keep Americans safe, and that \nstarts with a Senate-confirmed director.\n  I had accommodated the ranking member on requests for further \ninformation and delay on this nomination for months. Senator Grassley \ninsisted on the production of documents from the Department of Justice \nthat his staff had already had access to for months. He insisted that \nhis staff be able to interview Todd Jones in his capacity as U.S. \nAttorney for the District of Minnesota, as well as two other Justice \nDepartment officials, in order to try to build a case against another \nnomination, that of Tom Perez to be Labor Secretary. Those interviews \nhave taken place. Senator Grassley requested additional background \ninformation from the administration not usually required by the \ncommittee for an executive nomination and he received that information. \nWhen he sought information about an ATF operation in Milwaukee, I \narranged a bipartisan briefing for our staffs from the agency.\n  Some are criticizing the nominee based on a complaint filed against \nhim by an AUSA from the earlier Bush-era U.S. attorney office. After \nlearning about the complaint, I had initially put on hold a planned \nhearing on this nomination. In late April, a news article reported that \n``an aide to Senator Grassley'' had released a letter from OSC that the \nranking member and I had received about the existence of that \npreliminary inquiry. It was at that time that I determined that this \nhearing should move forward to allow the nominee an opportunity to \ndefend his reputation. When a private complaint against him was \ndisclosed publicly, I thought it unfair that the nominee could not \nrespond. He did at his hearing and in my view that matter is put to \nrest.\n  The U.S. Office of Special Counsel, OSC, closed the file on the \nunderlying allegation made against the nominee of ``gross mismanagement \nand abuses of authority.'' The allegation involving alleged retaliation \nhas been referred to mediation. In deference to the complaining party \nand the request of the\n\n[[Page S4473]]\n\ninvestigating agency that the complaint not be made public, it has not \nbeen. I wish it were. It is not substantial or even substantially about \nTodd Jones. It is certainly not reason to oppose the confirmation.\n  The ranking member requested that the long-delayed June 4 \nconfirmation hearing on the nomination to head ATF be postponed \nfurther, and I postponed it another week. During that postponement, \nover that last weekend, the ranking member threatened to use Senate \nrules for the minority to call an outside witness to testify at the \nhearing. There is no precedent for outside witnesses at a Judiciary \nCommittee hearing for a subcabinet executive level position. I \nnonetheless sought to accommodate his last-minute demand by agreeing to \nhis calling a witness.\n  The hearing proceeded on Tuesday and should have cleared the air. For \ninstance, those opposing this nomination were unaware that Todd Jones \nhad terminated a supervisor of the Fast and Furious operation.\n  The Judiciary Committee had for decades followed a tradition and \npractice of examining allegations against nominees in a bipartisan \nmanner from the outset. That has not been the practice Republicans have \nfollowed during the last several years. They have, instead, not brought \nmatters to the bipartisan staff but chosen to proceed on their own.\n  Sometimes we do delay committee consideration of nominations to allow \na complaint to be resolved. Sometimes we proceed despite lawsuits \ninvolving nominees, such as the way we proceeded last year with the \nnomination of Judge Stephanie Rose of Iowa to the United States \nDistrict Court for the District of Iowa even though there was a lawsuit \npending in which there were allegations against her actions as the U.S. \nattorney for Iowa. Earlier this year, when defense counsel filed a \nmotion against the U.S. attorney for the District of New Mexico making \nallegations, we independently examined the matter. The committee \nproceeded with that nomination rather than delay it.\n  I have reached out to the ranking member staff about getting back to \nour tradition of conducting bipartisan inquiries into allegations made \nagainst nominees. I hope that practice will be restored. With respect \nto the nomination of Todd Jones, we are further examining the matter, \nbut I believe him qualified and at this time know of no good reason the \nSenate should not confirm his nomination to serve as Director of the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/13/senate-section/article/S4473-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING THE WAYSIDE RESTAURANT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I would like to pay tribute to the \nWayside Restaurant--a trusted and venerated Vermont fixture and a \nstaple of the community surrounding Montpelier, our State capital. The \nWayside is a local business that has remained true to the values of its \nhumble beginnings. For nearly a century, the Wayside Restaurant has \nbeen a place where Vermonters can count on quality service, reasonable \nprices, and a quality meal that is sure to satisfy both the stomach and \nthe heart. I am honored to join Vermonters in celebrating the Wayside \nRestaurant's 95th anniversary.\n  In 1918, when Effie Ballou first opened the Wayside's doors, many of \nthe restaurant's offerings were prepared in the kitchen of her home and \ncarried down to her roadside eatery. Never did she imagine that her \nsmall eating house would become the bustling spot that it is today, \ndrawing both locals and out-of-State travelers and serving nearly 1000 \ncustomers daily. Every day, diners--from families to office workers \npile into the Wayside Restaurant. Its warm environment, familiar staff \nand signature Vermont cooking make the restaurant a home away from home \nfor locals and visitors alike.\n  The owners and staff of the Wayside Restaurant are devoted to \nproviding extraordinary service to the crowds of loyal customers who \nstop in to pile their plates high with Wayside's fine fare. Regular \ncustomers of the Wayside Restaurant can order their meals to-go or can \ndine in while enjoying friendly conversation and classic Wayside dishes \nlike the salt pork and gravy, honeycomb beef tripe, or maple cream pie.\n  Current owners Karen and Brian Zecchinelli have remained true to the \nrestaurant's early virtues--preparation of quality, old-time favorites \nas well as modern cuisine, and a focus on family and community values. \nAs a member of the Vermont Business Environmental Partnership, the \nWayside Restaurant has implemented earth-friendly initiatives that are \nkind to our natural environment. In 2012, the Wayside Restaurant was \nrecognized as the first and only ``green'' restaurant in Montpelier and \nwas praised for its support of small business by buying locally \nproduced products, a tradition they have kept throughout the years.\n  Today the Wayside Restaurant continues as a symbol of both \nlongstanding tradition and effective progress. From Effie Ballou's \nhumble beginnings to the eatery's current, booming success, the Wayside \nRestaurant holds a special place in Vermonters' hearts. Marcelle and I \nare always delighted to join them for a meal and visit with other \npatrons. I want to join the many others congratulating the Wayside on \n95 successful years of enriching its community and supporting Vermont's \nlocal economy.\n  Every time I go there to eat I remember going with my parents, \nbrother, and sister when I was a child. It was great then and still is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/13/senate-section/article/S4473-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO NORM BROWNSTEIN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to wish a happy, if \nslightly belated, 70th birthday to Norm Brownstein--a dedicated \nhusband, father, and grandfather, and a talented and effective advocate \nfor the alliance between the United States and Israel.\n  Norm's story is a classic American tale of a young man rising from \nhumble beginnings to achieve big things. Born to an immigrant family, \nNorm was orphaned at an early age and faced a number of hardships. But \nhe did not let that stop him from working hard or realizing his \ndreams--even if they differed from his original goal of becoming a \ndentist. In fact, Norm became the first member of his family to \ngraduate from college and received both undergraduate and law degrees \nfrom the University of Colorado-Boulder.\n  He then opened a law firm with two fellow UC-Boulder law graduates in \nthe 1960s. In the ensuing decades, that firm would transform into an \nagency with hundreds of employees and offices in all corners of the \ncountry.\n  And, as a board member of the American Israeli Public Affairs \nCommittee, Norm would also establish himself as a well-regarded \nsupporter of the State of Israel and the relationship between our two \ncountries. Clearly passionate on the issue, Norm has made his case \neffectively to numerous policymakers over the years--Republicans and \nDemocrats alike.\n  As he looks back over his 70 years, though, I think Norm will be most \nproud of his role as a father of three, a grandfather of four, and as a \nhusband.\n  So, today, please allow me to wish Norm a happy birthday, and to also \nwish him good health in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/13/senate-section/article/S4473-3", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL.

Mr. President, much of what we read today in newspapers or \non the Internet, much of what we hear on TV, much of what dominates our \nnational conversation and our conversation here in the Senate is bad \nnews. And it's understandable in a way that we're focused on righting \nwrongs and debating the solutions to problems. But too often we lose \nsight of the remarkable accomplishments and uplifting stories that are \nevery bit as much a feature of the human condition as conflict and \ntragedy.\n\n[[Page S4474]]\n\n  With that in mind, I want to alert my colleagues to an \nextraordinarily good-news story from right in my home State of \nMichigan. There, experts at the University of Michigan's CS Mott \nChildren's Hospital, recently broke important new ground in treating a \nrare but life-threatening condition, and made an enormous difference in \nthe lives of one little boy and his family.\n  At just 3 months old, Kaiba Gionfriddo's life was in danger. The Ohio \nbaby was threatened by an unusual weakening of the wall of his \nbronchus, the passage leading to his lungs. His condition caused him to \nstop breathing, and his physicians worried that the condition would \nprove fatal. But they knew that doctors and engineers at the University \nof Michigan were working to develop a new treatment that offered hope.\n  At UM, pediatrician Dr. Glenn Green and biomechanical engineering \nprofessor Scott Hollister were working on a groundbreaking procedure. \nAlerted to young Kaiba's condition, they went to work. Kaiba was \nairlifted from his Ohio hospital to Ann Arbor, and the UM team went to \nwork.\n  Their ingenious idea combined several important technologies. They \nused high-resolution imaging to create a detailed picture of Kaiba's \nairway. Through computer-aided design techniques and the use of a \nthree-dimensional printer, they created a customized tracheal splint to \nsupport the weakened walls of his bronchus and allow him to breathe. \nAnd they fashioned this device out of a bioresorbable polymer that will \nbe absorbed by Kaiba's body by the age of four, after it has given his \nbody time to form a stronger breathing passage.\n  There are many heroes in this story: Kaiba's parents, who moved \nheaven and earth for their son while dealing with the fear that they \nmight lose him; the Ohio physicians who searched for solutions to a \ndifficult case; of course, Dr. Green and Professor Hollister and their \nteam at UM; and, not to be forgotten, the countless researchers, \nengineers, and developers who put remarkable technological tools such \nas high-resolution imaging, computer-aided design, and 3D printing in \nthe hands of the UM experts. A year after his procedure, Kaiba's mother \nApril says her son is doing well. ``He's getting himself into trouble \nnowadays,'' she said in a newspaper interview. ``He scoots across the \nfloor and gets into everything.''\n  It's a remarkable story--but every day, countless Americans are \nengaged in similar efforts to help loved ones, neighbors, patients, \neven total strangers they will never know or meet. The combination of \nremarkable ingenuity and public spirit are defining characteristics of \nour Nation, and so long as they remain, there is nothing Americans \ncannot accomplish. As we focus on the problems we need to solve and the \nchallenges we face and the flood of negative and discouraging news, I \nhope we will also keep in mind the remarkable good news that also \nhappens every day and take inspiration from it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/13/senate-section/article/S4474-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO HOWARD BOKSENBAUM\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to an exceptional \nlibrary advocate and public servant in Rhode Island, Howard Boksenbaum, \nwho is retiring from his position as the State's chief library officer \nafter a long and distinguished career.\n  Howard graduated with a linguistics degree from Washington University \nin St. Louis and Waseda University in Tokyo, earned a master's degree \nin library and information science from the University of Pittsburgh, \nand started his career working at various library positions in \nPennsylvania before moving to Rhode Island.\n  His service to Rhode Island libraries began nearly 34 years ago at \nthe Island Interrelated Library System, which, at the time, was one of \nfive regional library systems in the State. In 1988, he joined the \nState's Department of State Library Services, which later became the \nOffice of Library and Information Services, OLIS. After serving in \nvarious capacities within these agencies, and as assistant director for \nCentral Information Management Services at the Rhode Island Division of \nInformation Technology, Howard became the state's chief library officer \nin 2007.\n  During his more than three decades working for Rhode Island libraries \nand the State's library agency, Howard helped improve Rhode Island's \nlibraries in many important ways. His focus on and passion for \ntechnology brought our State's libraries further into the digital age. \nHe worked to consolidate Rhode Island's regional library networks into \na single statewide system and created Ocean State Free-Net, a public \naccess computer network. He also played a major role in other statewide \ntechnology initiatives, including working on the state's website launch \nand helping to establish the statewide public safety communication \nnetwork, RISCON. Howard was also part of the Rhode Island Library \nAssociation and the Coalition for Library Advocates.\n  His view of the importance of libraries to our citizens, to our \ncommunities, and to our Nation can be found in a quote of his soon \nafter he became chief library officer:\n\n       A library is bigger than the web because it includes it, \n     bigger than its users because they grow there. Unlike a \n     school, a library is elective, unlike a store, a library \n     belongs to its users, unlike the World Wide Web, a library is \n     people, is history, is culture, is connection. A library is \n     the past and the present and will be changing again to be the \n     future.\n\n  Rhode Islanders have been fortunate to have Howard devote more than \nthree decades of service to the state and its libraries, and especially \nfor the past 6 years he served as chief library officer. I have also \nhad the benefit of his knowledge and insights about libraries, and \nworked with him on legislative initiatives to enhance federal support \nfor libraries.\n  I would also like to recognize Howard's wife Judith Stokes and his \nthree daughters Anna, Martha, and Emily. I join many others in the \nState in thanking Howard for his dedication and service to our State's \nlibraries, and I ask my colleagues to join us in commending Howard \nBoksenbaum on his long and accomplished career. I wish him fulfillment \nand continued success in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/13/senate-section/article/S4474-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4474-S4475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COMMENDING JOHN LEWIS\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the life \nand legacy of Congressman John Robert Lewis of Georgia, and recognize \nthe 50th anniversary of his chairmanship of the Student Nonviolent \nCoordinating Committee.\n  John Lewis grew up during the heart of segregation, born as the son \nof sharecroppers and attending segregated schools in Pike County, AL. \nAt a young age, he became inspired by Martin Luther King, Jr. and Rosa \nParks, and decided that he too, would fight for equal rights guaranteed \nto all by the Constitution of the United States.\n  John attended Fisk University, where he began his civil rights \nactivism by organizing a sit-in at segregated lunch counters in \nNashville, TN. He later became one of the original 13 Freedom Riders, \nbravely challenging segregation at interstate bus terminals throughout \nthe South.\n  In 1963, John Lewis was elected as chairman of the Student Nonviolent \nCoordinating Committee, which we are here to recognize today. He helped \nfound this organization, which encouraged students to get involved in \nthe civil rights movement and played a key role in the struggle to end \nlegalized racial discrimination and segregation.\n  By the age of 23, he was recognized as one of the ``Big Six'' leaders \nof the civil rights movement, planning and participating as the \nyoungest speaker at the historic March on Washington in August 1963.\n  He remains the last remaining speaker from this march.\n  He continued his work, organizing the Mississippi Freedom Summer, a \ncampaign to register black voters and expose students around the \ncountry to the perils and conditions in the South. Knowing what lay \nahead, he risked his life to lead over 600 marchers across the Edmund \nPettus Bridge in Selma, AL, only to be brutally attacked by Selma \npolice officers. This massacre became known as Bloody Sunday, during \nwhich John's skull was fractured.\n  He still bears the scars today.\n  John remained chairman of the SNCC until 1966, and then continued his \ncommitment to the civil rights movement as associate director of the \nField Foundation and in various voter registration programs. Even after \nmore than 40 arrests during his peaceful protests, John Lewis never \ngave up on his cause.\n\n[[Page S4475]]\n\n  He still remains devoted to non-violence and equality for all.\n  In 1986, John was elected to serve as the U.S. Representative for \nGeorgia's Fifth Congressional District, where he continues to serve his \nconstituency and do remarkable work for the State of Georgia.\n  He has been a loyal colleague and friend, and an invaluable member of \nthe Georgia Congressional Delegation. John Lewis's unwavering ethical \nand moral principles have garnered admiration and respect from his \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, and I am honored to have known \nhim.\n  Today, let us honor Mr. Lewis, who stood boldly against those who \nresisted racial equality. John's legacy will be remembered as one of \ngreat importance in American history.\n  Like Martin Luther King, Jr. and Rosa Parks, John continues to \ninspire those of us around him to fight for what we believe in.\n  I hope we can all learn from the remarkable life of Congressman John \nRobert Lewis of Georgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/13/senate-section/article/S4475-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE ARMY'S 238TH BIRTHDAY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, tomorrow--June 14--marks the Army's 238th \nbirthday. For 238 years, the Nation has entrusted the Army with \npreserving its peace and freedom, and defending its democracy. Since \nits beginnings as the Continental Army during our Revolutionary War, to \nits instrumental role in the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan, the Army has \nalways served America admirably and I have every confidence that it \nwill continue in this proud mission.\n  The United States Army existed before there even was a United States \nto speak of. The Continental Army was established on June 14, 1775. It \nwas composed of rebellious colonists who had little or no experience in \nsoldiering. Despite these humble beginnings, General George Washington \nled the Continental Army and against overwhelming odds they defeated \nthe more seasoned and well-equipped British ground forces. Following \nthe end of the Revolutionary War, the Continental Army was disbanded \nbut that action was followed by the official creation of the U.S. Army \non June 3, 1784. Since then, our Army has become the model against \nwhich all other nations' armies are measured.\n  The Army's birthday coincides with Flag Day, a holiday that \ncommemorates our Nation's adoption of the U.S. flag. I believe this is \nfitting as our Nation's flag would not exist were it not for the \nbravery and sacrifice of our Army; and since its adoption, the Army has \nalways carried our Nation's flag into battle.\n  With the withdrawal of our military forces in Iraq and the drawdown \nof those forces in Afghanistan, I am concerned that our soldiers who \nhave recently entered--or are about to enter--civilian life will not be \nprovided with the tools to adapt to their new lives. Veteran \nunemployment, post-traumatic stress, and active duty military/veteran \nsuicides continue to be serious issues and they must be addressed. If a \nsolider is able to excel on the battlefield, then I see no reason why \nthat same soldier should not be able to excel in the classroom, in a \nhospital, or in the boardroom. We have to provide our servicemen and \nwomen with the tools to help them achieve these goals. Doing so is not \na hand-out, but rather a ``hand up'' that strengthens our Nation, since \nit redounds to the benefit of all Americans. Ultimately, we have to \ncontinue to give these men and women a stake in their own country.\n  Since 1775, American soldiers have been the strength and sinew of our \nNation. Our soldiers are driven by the ideals of the Warrior Ethos and \ncommit themselves to succeed in any mission our Nation asks of them. \nOur soldiers believe that our Constitution and the freedom it \nguarantees are worth fighting for. They sacrifice their personal \ncomfort and safety to answer a higher calling: service in the cause of \nfreedom, both here at home for Americans, but also abroad for foreign \npeoples.\n  I am awed by our servicemen and women's ability to adapt and succeed \nin a mission that at various stages has called upon them to be \nscholars, teachers, policemen, farmers, bankers, engineers, social \nworkers, and, of course, warriors--often all at the same time. Above \nall, I am perpetually thankful for their willingness to serve, and have \nthe greatest of faith in their ability to face the difficult and \ndangerous missions that lie ahead. These patriots have always been the \nstrength of the Nation. The unwavering dedication to duty, to our \ncountry, and to all Americans is embodied in the Army motto, which is \ninscribed on top of the Department of the Army's official emblem ``This \nwe'll defend.'' For 238 years, our Army has lived by these words, \nprotecting us so that our society may be free. Let us remember our Army \nsoldiers for this achievement today, and wish them a happy 238th \nbirthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/13/senate-section/article/S4475-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4475-S4476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                FLAG DAY\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, as do all West Virginians, I feel a \nspecial surge of emotion every time I see the American flag. After all, \nOld Glory is the most enduring symbol of our country, representing the \nunity of our people and the cause of liberty and justice for all.\n  But the Star Spangled Banner is also the most recognized symbol of \nfreedom wherever it flies in the world, a powerful inspiration to \npeople everywhere who are ``yearning to breathe free,'' as it is \ninscribed on the Statue of Liberty.\n  Every day, Americans all across this great land pledge their \nallegiance to the flag of the United States. We salute it; we fight for \nit; we cherish it; we honor it.\n  But one day a year, we pay special honor to our flag. We set aside \nevery June 14th as Flag Day, commemorating the date in 1777 when the \nContinental Congress officially made the Stars and Stripes the symbol \nof America.\n  Tomorrow, my office is planning special events in West Virginia \ncommemorating Flag Day. Members of my staff will be presenting American \nflags to selected organizations all across the State that have \nrequested flags:\n  To veterans in Logan at the ``Spirit of the Doughboy'' statue, which \nhonors the victorious American soldiers of World War One.\n  To the Veterans Museum of Mid-Ohio Valley in Parkersburg, which pays \ntribute to West Virginians who have fought to preserve this country's \nfreedom.\n  To Shepherd University in Shepherdstown, in conjunction with its Team \nRiver Runner program which includes kayaking programs for wounded \nwarriors and their families.\n  To American Legion Post 33, in Sutton, honoring them for conducting \nmemorial services for veterans in Braxton County.\n  To the City Council of Wardensville, to be displayed at the \nWardensville Town Office.\n  To the ``Here and There'' Transit of Philippi, as part of the \ndedication of its new operations facilities.\n  And to the West Virginia Northern Community College in Wheeling, \nwhich only last month opened its Applied Technology Center to veterans \nand other students.\n  Flag Day has a special significance to West Virginia. Our State was \nborn out of the fiery conflict of the Civil War, and next week we will \ncelebrate our 150th birthday.\n  In that terrible war, West Virginians had a choice of two flags. We \nchose to follow the Stars and Stripes and in doing so, West Virginia \nbecame the 35th star on that Grand Old Flag.\n  So as we prepare for our State's 150th birthday celebration, I urge \nall West Virginians to join me in celebrating Flag Day--by displaying \nthe flag that from the first days of America came to symbolize a ``new \nconstellation'' of hope and freedom and from the first days of West \nVirginia came to represent an allegiance to our remarkable \nConstitution.\n  In doing so, we honor not only our flag, but also the ideals on which \nAmerica was founded as well as the generations of Americans who have \ndefended those ideals in battle, always ensuring at the end of the \nfight that ``our flag was still there.''\n  The Star Spangled Banner is a symbol of their sacrifice and our \nfaith.\n  Not long after Congress officially adopted the Stars and Stripes as \nthe flag of the United States, George Washington said, ``We take the \nstars from Heaven, the red from our mother country, separating it by \nwhite stripes, thus showing that we have separated from her, and the \nwhite stripes shall go down to posterity representing liberty.''\n\n[[Page S4476]]\n\n  But a little poem I learned as a child from my Uncle Jimmy perfectly \ncaptures how I feel about the American flag even now:\n\n     It's only some stripes of red and white.\n     It's only some stars on a field of blue.\n     It's only a little cotton flag.\n     Does it mean anything to you?\n     Oh yes it does,\n     For beneath its folds\n     Our people are safe at land and sea.\n     It stands for a land where God is still king,\n     And His truth and His freedoms are free.\n     So let us love it well\n     And keep it pure as our banner of liberty.\n\n  This ``little cotton flag'' is displayed proudly in our homes, in our \nschools, in our businesses, over the Capitol and the White House, in \nparades and ballparks, on the field of battle, and on the graves of the \nheroes who fought in those battles.\n  It has flown from the tops of mountains, from the 9/11 rubble of \nGround Zero, over the scarred wall of the Pentagon and from the surface \nof the moon--not once, not twice, but six times.\n  May our beautiful flag ever wave, and may God ever bless the country \nfor which it stands.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/13/senate-section/article/S4476-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     CONGRATULATING SCOTT BLACKMUN\n\n Mr. BENNET.

Scott also \nserved the USOC capably in multiple previous capacities a decade ago.\n  A hard worker of high integrity, Scott previously served as chief \noperating officer of Anschutz Entertainment Group, a major presenter of \nsports and entertainment events.

The development of the passage has greatly \nimproved the trail, while preserving its natural beauty for all to \nenjoy.\n  The Great Allegheny Passage is a wonderful place for Americans of all \nages to engage in our rich cultural history, enjoy the varied natural \nhistory of great river valleys, and experience a range from rural to \nurban communities.\n  The Great Allegheny Passage significantly benefits the surrounding \ncommunities in many ways. Trails increase the quality of life in a \ncommunity. The proximity to rivers, trails, and greenways is an \nimportant factor when people and businesses are deciding where to live \nor invest in new properties. Employees who work near such areas will \nreduce their commuting costs by walking or biking to work.\n  The Great Allegheny Passage increases tourism to the surrounding \nareas. Americans realize that using such a trail is an environmentally \nresponsible way to spend their time. The trail attracts people to the \narea, which greatly benefits the local communities. Trail users create \na demand for more lodging, restaurants, and sporting equipment stores. \nNew jobs will be created as entrepreneurs continue to bring tourism and \nservice based businesses to the area.\n  The Great Allegheny Passage is truly a unique path through a \nsignificant corridor. I encourage Pennsylvanians and all Americans to \nenjoy the natural beauty of America by visiting the Great Allegheny \nPassage, now, and for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/13/senate-section/article/S4476-3", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MIHAELA GHITA\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mihaela \nGhita, a graduating senior at Manchester High School West in \nManchester, NH. There is much to celebrate about Mihaela's academic \nachievements, but one of her most notable accomplishments is that she \nhas never missed a day of school since the day she entered first grade.\n  Mihaela is an active member of West's school community. She competes \nin throwing events for the school's track and field team and is also a \nmember of West's gymnastics squad. In addition, Mihaela has gone above \nand beyond academic requirements by completing an extended learning \nopportunity, volunteering to read with and tutor the school's special \nneeds students. She is also an active volunteer in the greater \nManchester community.\n  Mihaela's dedication to her education and her commitment to being \npresent to learn every day is truly admirable. As a former public \nschool teacher and parent, I understand and appreciate how unusual and \nunique it is for a student to attend every day of school for an \nacademic year, but it is truly impressive that she has never missed a \nday at any point in her studies. The maturity and sense of dedication \nthat Mihaela has demonstrated will serve her well in whatever field she \nchooses. I am confident that Mihaela will achieve success in her future \npursuits.\n  High school graduation is a special time in a student's life, and I \nam pleased to rise today to recognize Mihaela's unique attendance \naccomplishment. However, I would also like to extend my sincerest \ncongratulations to Mihaela and all of her classmates who will be \njoining her on Saturday, June 15, 2013, for their graduation ceremony. \nWhile the students may be heading in different directions, they will \nalways share the common bond of being graduates of Manchester High \nSchool West. Once again, I would like to recognize Mihaela Ghita on \nachieving her exemplary attendance record. I know that her family, her \nfriends, and the entire West community join me in congratulating her \nand celebrating her many accomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/13/senate-section/article/S4476-4", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4476-S4477]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO RALPH McGARY\n\n Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I would like to speak \ntoday about an individual in my home State--a gentleman from Carlsbad \nnamed Ralph McGary. Because as we work for solutions to our Nation's \nchallenges, I hope that we will always remember one basic thing. There \nare human beings behind these debates. There are stories of struggle \nand hardship and of inspiration. What we do here in Washington, DC, has \nreal impact on real lives. What happens here matters in profound ways \nto millions of Americans, matters to fellow citizens like Ralph McGary, \nwho have sacrificed and worked hard, and who depend on a government \nthat will be there for them in return.\n\n[[Page S4477]]\n\n  This is Ralph's story, as reported recently in Focus on Carlsbad \nmagazine. Ralph worked in the oilfields. One day, in 2006, on his way \nhome, he was almost killed in a traffic accident. In an instant, his \nlife was changed forever. He spent 6 weeks in intensive care and then \n3\\1/2\\ months at a rehabilitation hospital. He survived but was left a \nquadriplegic. Ralph McGary had to face tremendous loss, and then he had \nto decide how to move forward with his life.\n  It is impossible for any of us to fully realize what an ordeal that \nmust have been for Ralph or what courage and determination it has \nrequired of him every single day just to keep going, just to find his \nway on a path that he never imagined he would be on. But move forward \nhe did. Drawing upon his own valiant spirit and with the help of \nothers, among his family and in his community. His is a classic \nAmerican story of self-reliance and community support.\n  He found valuable allies at the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation \nin Carlsbad. Despite his severe physical impairment, Ralph still wanted \nto work, still wanted to be as productive as his condition would allow. \nDVR is a State-Federal organization. Its mission is to work with folks \nlike Ralph to find employment, to help them overcome their \ndisabilities.\n  DVR provided Ralph with a computer and a special voice recognition \nsoftware. His counselor at DVR, Barry Jolly, explained:\n\n       We worked with him to develop a plan. That included going \n     back to school and completing his degree. We don't just \n     identify employment. We identify a strategy to get from where \n     you are to where you need to be.\n\n  Ralph is still on that journey getting from where he has been to \nwhere he needs to be. He requires 24-hour care. His family, like so \nmany others, tried to provide that care at home for as long as they \ncould. For now, Ralph resides at a local nursing care facility. Most of \nhis disability income pays for his nursing home care. He keeps about \n$60 a month. But his dream of greater independence continues. He dreams \nof some day being able to adapt his home to accommodate his needs.\n  In the meantime, he earned his associate's degree from the New Mexico \nState University-Carlsbad. Last year, he obtained a part-time job at \nthe Jeff Diamond Law Firm. The firm had helped him obtain his Social \nSecurity disability benefits, and SSA allows him to earn a certain \namount of money each month without reducing his disability income.\n  In his work at the law firm, Ralph calls himself the ``reminder \nguy.'' He calls clients to remind them of their appointments or other \nmatters relating to their disability claims. He knows their struggles. \nHe understands what they are going through. His job not only provides \nsome extra income, it boosts his morale and his connection to his \ncommunity, and the McGary family is very much a part of the community. \nHis wife, Susan, has taught at Carlsbad schools for over three decades.\n  Jolly told Focus on Carlsbad that:\n\n       Ralph is a determined man and a sharp individual. I used to \n     work in the oilfields too, so I think we speak the same \n     language. I think one of his strengths is his ability to get \n     along with other people and his understanding of how things \n     work.\n\n  Those are admirable qualities--getting along with others. \nUnderstanding how things work. We need more of that here in Washington, \nDC. People like Ralph McGary should expect no less of us. Ralph faced \nhis challenges. We should face ours.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/13/senate-section/article/S4477-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4477]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/13/senate-section/article/S4477-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4477]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/13/senate-section/article/S4477-3", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4477]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS \n  ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13405 OF JUNE 16, 2006, WITH \n                       RESPECT TO BELARUS--PM 12\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have \nsent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice \nstating that the national emergency with respect to the actions and \npolicies of certain members of the Government of Belarus and other \npersons to undermine Belarus's democratic processes or institutions \nthat was declared in Executive Order 13405 of June 16, 2006, is to \ncontinue in effect beyond June 16, 2013.\n  In 2012, the Government of Belarus continued its crackdown against \npolitical opposition, civil society, and independent media. The \nSeptember 23 elections failed to meet international standards. The \ngovernment arbitrarily arrested, detained, and imprisoned citizens for \ncriticizing officials or for participating in demonstrations; \nimprisoned at least one human rights activist on manufactured charges; \nand prevented independent media from disseminating information and \nmaterials. These actions show that the Government of Belarus has not \ntaken steps forward in the development of democratic governance and \nrespect for human rights.\n  The actions and policies of certain members of the Government of \nBelarus and other persons to undermine Belarus's democratic processes \nor institutions, to commit human rights abuses related to political \nrepression, and to engage in public corruption continue to pose an \nunusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign \npolicy of the United States.

Established in 1993, the \n     STARBASE program has grown to 76 locations across 40 states, \n     including three Michigan sites: Selfridge Air National Guard \n     Base, Battle Creek Air National Guard Base, and Alpena Combat \n     Readiness Training Center. The program reached about 3,500 \n     Michigan students in Fiscal Year 2012; and\n       Whereas, STARBASE provides exceptional, hands-on curriculum \n     to participating schools and students that helps overall \n     comprehension of science and math and improves MEAP scores. \n     It provides an inquiry-based curriculum of experiential, \n     exploratory learning to motivate fifth graders to explore \n     STEM as they continue their education. A more recent \n     addition, STARBASE 2.0, is aimed at middle school students in \n     an after school program. It offers robotic training \n     opportunities and participation in the Lego League team \n     robotics challenge. STARBASE works with school districts to \n     support their learning objectives and expands relationships \n     with local networks of STEM initiatives and organizations; \n     and\n       Whereas, The rapid pace of technological change and the \n     globalization of the economy demand that our workforce be \n     literate in science and math. Less than one percent of \n     current elementary students are expected to seek advanced \n     education in the sciences. STARBASE raises student interest \n     and improves their attitudes and confidence in STEM skills: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we urge the \n     support for continuation of the STARBASE program; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-20.

The Selected Reserve include the Army, Navy, \n     Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard Reserves, and the \n     Army and Air National Guards. The primary mission of a \n     military technician is to provide day-to-day continuity in \n     the training of reserve units, particularly, Army and Air \n     National Guard. More than 58,000 military technicians are \n     currently employed helping to maintain our military \n     readiness; and\n       Whereas, Military technicians are generally required to \n     maintain membership in the National Guard or Reserve as a \n     condition of their employment. They are required to attend \n     weekend drills and annual training with their reserve unit \n     and military technicians can be involuntarily ordered to \n     active duty just as other members of the Guard or Reserve; \n     and\n       Whereas, Under sequestration, uniformed military personnel \n     are exempt from furlough days and pay cuts. However, military \n     technicians in the National Guard and the Reserves were not \n     exempted, placing the readiness of our military at home and \n     abroad at risk: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize Congress to pass H.R. 1014 to amend the Balanced \n     Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to provide \n     that military technicians (dual status) shall be included in \n     military personnel accounts for purposes of any order issued \n     under that act; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-22.

and\n       Whereas, such management and regulation includes a \n     determination of the sustainability of each species and \n     preservation of the sustainability through the setting of \n     take limits, individual fishing quotas, and opening and \n     closing seasons; and\n       Whereas, on March 25, 2013, a temporary emergency rule was \n     published in the Federal Register that gives the National \n     Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries \n     Services the authority to set separate closure dates for the \n     recreational red snapper season in federal waters off the \n     individual Gulf of Mexico states; and\n\n[[Page S4479]]\n\n       Whereas, the closure dates will depend on whether state \n     regulations are consistent with federal regulations for the \n     recreational red snapper season length or bag limit; and\n       Whereas, the federal recreational season for Gulf of Mexico \n     red snapper begins June 1 each year with a two-fish bag limit \n     and the length of the season is determined by the amount of \n     the quota, the average weight of fish landed, and the \n     estimated catch rates over time; and\n       Whereas, since NOAA Fisheries is responsible for ensuring \n     that the entire recreational harvest, including harvest in \n     state waters, does not exceed the recreational quota, then if \n     states establish a longer season or a larger bag limit for \n     state waters than the federal regulations allow in federal \n     waters, the federal season must be adjusted to account for \n     the additional harvest expected in state waters; and\n       Whereas, if all states were to implement consistent \n     regulations, the 2013 recreational season would be twenty-\n     eight days, assuming the recreational quota is increased to \n     4.145 million pounds through separate rule-making; and\n       Whereas, in addition to Louisiana, the states of Texas and \n     Florida have indicated to NOAA Fisheries that they will \n     implement inconsistent red snapper regulations for their \n     state waters; and\n       Whereas, without this emergency rule, the 2013 federal \n     season would be reduced to twenty-two days to compensate for \n     that additional expected harvest; and\n       Whereas, this emergency rule allows NOAA Fisheries to \n     calculate the recreational red snapper fishing season \n     separately in the exclusive economic zone off each state to \n     account for any inconsistency of regulations in state waters; \n     and\n       Whereas, based on the expected regulations for Texas, \n     Louisiana, and Florida, the preliminary season lengths would \n     be as follows: Texas, twelve days; Louisiana, none days; \n     Mississippi and Alabama, twenty-eight days; and Florida, \n     twenty-one days; and\n       Whereas, on March 23, 2013, Louisiana implemented weekend-\n     only recreational red snapper season that will end on \n     September 30, with a recreational bag limit of three fish per \n     day at sixteen-inch minimum; and\n       Whereas, the regional administrator of the National Oceanic \n     and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries Services's Southeast \n     Regional Office and his scientists can provide information on \n     the following issues: (1) emergency rule on the recreational \n     closure authority specific to federal waters off individual \n     states for the recreational red snapper component of the Gulf \n     of Mexico reef fish fishery; (2) methodology for \n     determination of the length, allocations, and quotas for the \n     red snapper season; (3) plans for the future allocations and \n     quotas of red snapper; (4) update on the regional and Gulf of \n     Mexico red snapper stock assessments on natural and \n     artificial habitats; (5) relationship of size of quota to \n     recovery of red snapper fisheries; (6) general conditions and \n     health of red snapper fisheries and projections for future; \n     and (7) requirements in order for Louisiana to get additional \n     allocations or quotas based on Louisiana's management and \n     growth of the red snapper fisheries: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States and requests the secretary \n     of the United States Department of Commerce to take such \n     action as necessary to require the regional administrator of \n     the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries \n     Service's Southeast Regional Office and his scientists to \n     attend a meeting of the Louisiana Senate Committee on Natural \n     Resources, on a date that is convenient for the parties \n     during the month of April or the first week of May, to \n     provide information on the red snapper season, and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, that a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives, to \n     each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United States \n     Congress, to the secretary of the United States Department of \n     Commerce, and the regional administrator of the National \n     Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries Service's \n     Southeast Regional Office.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-23. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Missouri supporting continued \n     and increased development and delivery of oil derived from \n     North American oil reserves to United States refineries; to \n     the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 19\n\n       Whereas, the United States relies--and will continue to \n     rely for many years--on gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel, as \n     well as renewable and alternative sources of energy; and\n       Whereas, in order to fuel our economy, the United States \n     will need more oil and natural gas while also requiring \n     additional alternative energy sources; and\n       Whereas, the United States accounts for 20% of world energy \n     consumption and is the world's largest petroleum consumer. \n     The United States consumes more than 15 million barrels of \n     oil each day, with forecast suggesting that this will not \n     change for decades; and\n       Whereas, even with new technology, oil discoveries, \n     alternative fuels, and conservation efforts, the United \n     States will remain dependent on imported energy for decades \n     to come. A secure supply of crude oil is not only needed for \n     Americans to continue to heat their homes, cook their food, \n     and drive their vehicles, but to allow the United States \n     economy to thrive and grow free from the potential threats \n     and disruptions of crude oil supply from less secure parts of \n     the world; and\n       Whereas, the growing production of conflict-free oil from \n     Canada's oil sands and the Bakken formation in Saskatchewan, \n     Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota can replace crude \n     imported from countries that do not share American values, \n     but additional pipeline capacity to refineries in the United \n     States Midwest and Gulf Coast is required; and\n       Whereas, increasing energy imports from Canada makes sense \n     for the United States. Canada is a trusted neighbor with a \n     stable democratic government, strong environmental standards \n     equal to that of the United States, and some of the most \n     stringent human rights and worker protection laws in the \n     world; and\n       Whereas, improvements in production technology have reduced \n     the carbon footprint of Canadian oil sands development by 26% \n     on a per barrel basis since 1990. Oil sands production \n     accounts for 6.9% of Canada's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions \n     and 0.1% (1/100th) of global GHG emissions. Total emissions \n     from Canada's oil sands sector was 48 megatons in 2010, \n     equivalent to 0.5% of United States GHG emissions. Oil sands \n     crude has similar CO2 emissions to other heavy oils and is 6% \n     more carbon-intensive than the average crude refined in the \n     United States on a wells-to-wheels basis; and\n       Whereas, the 57 refineries in the Gulf Coast region provide \n     a total refining capacity of approximately 8.7 million \n     barrels per day (bpd), or half of United States refining \n     capacity. In 2011, these refineries imported approximately 5 \n     million bpd of crude oil from more than 30 countries, with \n     the top four suppliers being Mexico (22%), Saudi Arabia \n     (17%), Venezuela (16%), and Nigeria (9%). Imports from Mexico \n     and Venezuela are declining as production from those \n     countries decreases and supply contracts expire. Once \n     completed, TransCanada's Keystone XL Pipeline and Gulf Coast \n     Expansion projects could displace roughly 40% of the oil the \n     United States currently imports from the Persian Gulf and \n     Venezuela; and\n       Whereas, the Keystone XL Pipeline project has been subject \n     to the most thorough public consultation process of any \n     proposed United States pipeline, and the subject of multiple \n     environmental impacts statements and several United States \n     Department of State studies which have concluded that it \n     poses the least impact to the environment and is much safer \n     than other modes of transporting crude oil; and\n       Whereas, the original Keystone Pipeline, which spans across \n     the northern part of Missouri, supplies over 500,000 barrels \n     of North American crude oil to American refiners in the \n     Midwest. When completed, the Keystone XL Pipeline will carry \n     830,000 barrels of North American crude oil to American \n     refineries in the Gulf Coast region which will make its way \n     back to Missouri in the form of gasoline, diesel, and jet \n     fuel; and\n       Whereas, the Keystone XL Pipeline project will create \n     approximately 9,000 construction jobs. The Gulf Coast \n     Expansion project is a $2.3 billion project that has created \n     approximately 4,000 construction jobs. Combined, these \n     projects support yet another 7,000 manufacturing jobs. 75% of \n     the pipe used to build the Keystone XL Pipeline in the United \n     States will come from North American mills, including half \n     made by United States workers. Goods for the pipeline valued \n     at approximately $800 million have already been sourced from \n     United States manufacturers: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the members of the House of Representatives \n     of the Ninety-seventh General Assembly, First Regular \n     Session, the Senate concurring therein, hereby strongly:\n       (1) Support continued and increased development and \n     delivery of oil derived from North American oil reserves to \n     United States refineries;\n       (2) Urge the United States Congress to support continued \n     and increased development and delivery of oil from Canada to \n     the United States;\n       (3) Urge the President of the United States to support the \n     continued and increased importation of oil derived from the \n     Bakken formation in Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota, \n     as well as Canadian oil sands;\n       (4) Urge the United States Secretary of State to approve \n     the newly routed pipeline application from TransCanada to \n     reduce dependence on unstable governments, create new jobs, \n     improve our national security, and strengthen ties with an \n     important ally; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Missouri House of \n     Representatives be instructed to prepare properly inscribed \n     copies of this resolution for the President of the United \n     States, the President Pro Tem of the United States Senate, \n     the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, \n     and each member of the Missouri Congressional delegation.\n       Adam Crumbliss, Chief Clerk of the House of \n     Representatives, and Terry L. Spieler, Secretary of the \n     Senate, do hereby certify that the aforementioned is a true \n     and correct copy of House Concurrent Resolution No. 19, \n     adopted by the House of Representatives on March 14, 2013, \n     and concurred in the Senate on April 17, 2013.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-24. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana\n\n[[Page S4480]]\n\n     memorializing the United States Congress to take whatever \n     actions necessary to encourage and support reunification of \n     Ireland; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 21\n\n       Whereas, Ireland is an ancient and distinct land, an \n     island-nation artificially rendered in two in 1922; \n     partitioned by the Government of Ireland Act as an \n     independent Irish state and Northern Ireland which remained a \n     dominion of the United Kingdom; and\n       Whereas, the partition divided the nation into Northern \n     Ireland, which is composed of six counties and is one of the \n     four constituent countries of the British Crown, and Southern \n     Ireland, which consists of the remaining twenty-six counties \n     and which eventually became the Republic of Ireland in 1949; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Belfast Agreement, also known as the Good \n     Friday Agreement, was ratified by the Irish and British \n     governments on Apri 10, 1998, as was successfully negotiated \n     with support from the United States; and\n       Whereas, the Good Friday Agreement represents a fundamental \n     political advance that created a framework and a mechanism \n     for further political development toward the final resolution \n     of the issue and reunification; and\n       Whereas, today with self determination, the Irish Republic \n     enjoys an unencumbered economic future as a viable member of \n     the European Union; and\n       Whereas, the time has come to bring about a seamless \n     resolution of the partition of Ireland in favor of a more \n     united, sovereign nation that guarantees equal rights and \n     equal opportunities for all of its citizens; and\n       Whereas, in every area that affects the overall well-being \n     of the Irish people, including their economy, education, \n     health, governance, and social interaction, a united Ireland \n     proffers the best opportunity for peace and prosperity for a \n     divided Irish population; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to take whatever actions \n     necessary to encourage and support the reunification of \n     Ireland, and be if further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-25. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana memorializing the Congress of the \n     United States to enact legislation to provide additional \n     funding for research in order to find a treatment and a cure \n     for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; to the Committee on \n     Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 14\n\n       Whereas, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, is more \n     commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease; and\n       Whereas, ALS is a fatal neurodegenerative disease \n     characterized by degeneration of cell bodies of the lower \n     motor neurons in the gray matter of the anterior horns of the \n     spinal cord; and\n       Whereas, the initial symptom of ALS is usually weakness of \n     the skeletal muscles, especially those of the extremities; \n     and\n       Whereas, as ALS progresses, the patient typically \n     experiences difficulty in swallowing, talking, and breathing; \n     and\n       Whereas, ALS eventually causes muscles to atrophy and the \n     patient becomes a functional quadriplegic; and\n       Whereas, ALS does not affect mental capacity of the \n     patient, such that the patient remains alert and aware of \n     surroundings and aware of the loss of motor functions and the \n     inevitable outcome of continued deterioration and death; and\n       Whereas, on average, patients diagnosed with ALS survive \n     only two to five years from the time of diagnosis; and\n       Whereas, despite the catastrophic consequences of a \n     diagnosis of ALS, the disease currently has no known cause, \n     means of protection, or cure; and\n       Whereas, research indicates that military veterans are at a \n     sixty percent greater risk of developing ALS than those who \n     have not served in the military; and\n       Whereas, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs \n     has promulgated regulations to establish a presumption of \n     service connection for ALS thereby presuming that the \n     development of ALS was incurred or aggravated by a veteran's \n     service in the military; and\n       Whereas, a national ALS registry, administered by the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is currently \n     identifying cases of ALS in the United States and may become \n     the largest ALS research project ever undertaken; and\n       Whereas, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Awareness Month \n     increases the awareness of the circumstances of living with \n     ALS and acknowledges the terrible impact this disease has not \n     only on the patient, but also on the family and community of \n     anyone receiving such a diagnosis; and\n       Whereas, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Awareness Month also \n     increases awareness of research being done to eradicate this \n     dire disease: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     recognize May 2013 as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Awareness \n     Month, and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to enact \n     legislation to provide additional funding for research in \n     order to find a treatment and a cure for Amyotrophic Lateral \n     Sclerosis, and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-26.

Res. 17. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States authorizing Congress to prohibit the \nphysical desecration of the flag of the United States; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, tomorrow is Flag Day and I am proud to be \njoined by 21 of my colleagues in introducing an amendment to the \nConstitution giving Congress power to prohibit the physical desecration \nof the flag of the United States. At a time when many issues divide us, \nthe flag to which we pledge allegiance ought to be one thing that \nunites us.\n  On this day in 1777, the Continental Congress adopted a resolution \ndesignating the design of the flag of the United States. President \nWoodrow Wilson first issued a proclamation in 1916 officially \nestablishing June 14 as Flag Day and Congress did so by statute in \n1949.\n  States began adopting laws protecting the American flag in the late \n19th century and every state had adopted such a law by 1932. Congress \nadopted the Federal Flag Code in 1942 providing uniform guidelines for \ndisplaying the flag and in 1968 enacted the Federal Flag Protection \nAct.\n  We have, as they say, come a long way--but not in a good direction. \nGregory Johnson, a member of the Revolutionary Communist Party, was \nprosecuted under State law for torching an American flag at the 1984 \nRepublican National Convention in Dallas. Five years later, in Texas v. \nJohnson, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the State flag protection law \nviolated the First Amendment. Congress quickly revised the Flag \nProtection Act but in United States v. Eichman, the Supreme Court held \nin 1990 that it too violated the First Amendment.\n  I believe these two cases, decided by the narrowest 5-4 margins, were \nbased on an incorrect interpretation of the First Amendment. But I also \nbelieve that the Constitution belongs to the American people, not to \nFederal judges.\n  The Constitution embodies the will of the American people in setting \nrules for government. The Constitution defines what the federal \ngovernment may do by enumerating its powers in the body of the \nConstitution. It defines what government may not do by identifying \nindividual rights in the amendments to the Constitution.\n  The Supreme Court has had its say, concluding that neither States nor \nthe Federal Government may prohibit desecration of the American flag. \nBut the Supreme Court does not have the last word about what the \nConstitution says or what the Constitution means. The American people \ndo. They alone have authority to change the Constitution's rules for \ngovernment.\n  This is why I first introduced a flag protection constitutional \namendment on June 22, 1989, just one day after the Supreme Court's \ndecision in Texas v. Johnson. The American people can decide whether to \nchange their Constitution only when an amendment is proposed and sent \nto the States for ratification. The American people should have that \nopportunity regarding protection of this unique symbol of national \nunity.\n  Today is the ninth time I have introduced a flag protection \namendment. The Senate has voted five times on such proposals, including \nthree of mine. The bipartisan support has grown each time--from 51 \nvotes in 1989, 58 votes in 1990, 63 votes in 1995 and 2000, and 66 \nvotes in 2006, just one short of the \\2/3\\ required by the \nConstitution.\n  Members of Congress must keep two things in mind. First, even if it \nis ratified, this amendment would not prohibit flag desecration. It \nwould merely give Congress authority to do so. Remember what the \nSupreme Court did in its pair of decisions. The court did not say \ngovernment should not protect the flag, but said that government may \nnot do so. This amendment would restore that authority. I believe that \na vigorous and public debate about our shared values and principles and \nabout the flag as a unique symbol of national unity would be very \nhealthy for America. We can have that debate only when the Constitution \nallows it and with this amendment the Constitution would.\n  Second, members of Congress must remember our role in the \nconstitutional amendment process. Congress cannot amend the \nConstitution. We can propose amendments, but the Constitution is not \nchanged until \\3/4\\ of the States say so. Congress should not deprive \nthe American people of the opportunity to express their will on this \nimportant issue.\n  The American people want that opportunity. All 50 State legislatures \nhave indicated their support for a constitutional amendment to allow \nprotection of the flag.\n  Just a few days ago, President Obama issued the annual proclamation \ndesignating this week as National Flag Week and designating today as \nFlag Day. He urged all Americans to observe these ``with pride and all \ndue ceremony . . . as a time to honor America, to celebrate our \nheritage in public gatherings and activities, and to publicly recite \nthe Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America.'' \nI believe that we can make that ongoing observance and celebration \ncomplete by restoring authority to protect this symbol of national \nunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/13/senate-section/article/S4483-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4483-S4484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 170--COMMEMORATING JOHN LEWIS ON THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY \n  OF HIS CHAIRMANSHIP OF THE STUDENT NONVIOLENT COORDINATING COMMITTEE\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 170\n\n       Whereas Congressman John Robert Lewis was born on February \n     21, 1940, outside of Troy, Alabama, to parents Eddie and \n     Willie Mae (Carter) Lewis;\n       Whereas John Lewis has devoted his life to safeguarding \n     human rights, protecting civil liberties, and building what \n     he calls ``the Beloved Community'' in the United States;\n       Whereas John Lewis grew up on a farm in a family of \n     sharecroppers and attended segregated public schools in Pike \n     County, Alabama;\n       Whereas, drawing inspiration at an early age from the \n     dedication and bravery demonstrated through the Montgomery \n     Bus Boycott and the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., John \n     Lewis joined the movement to secure the basic equal rights \n     guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States;\n       Whereas, while studying at Fisk University, where he earned \n     a Bachelor of Arts in Religion and Philosophy, John Lewis led \n     the charge by unifying and organizing volunteers for sit-in \n     demonstrations at segregated lunch counters in Nashville, \n     Tennessee;\n       Whereas, in 1961, John Lewis showed his bravery and \n     dedication while participating in Freedom Rides, challenging \n     segregation at interstate bus terminals throughout the South, \n     subjecting himself to being beaten by an angry mob, and even \n     being arrested for peacefully confronting the injustice of \n     Jim Crow segregation in the South;\n       Whereas, from 1963 to 1966, at a pivotal point in the Civil \n     Rights Movement, John Lewis was named Chairman of the Student \n     Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, which he helped found, \n     orchestrating student activism in the Movement, including \n     sit-ins, voter registration drives, community action \n     programs, and other activities;\n       Whereas, at the young age of 23, John Lewis achieved \n     national recognition and respect as 1 of the ``Big Six'' \n     leaders of the Civil Rights Movement, both planning and \n     speaking at the historic March on Washington in August 1963, \n     along with fellow leaders and friends such as Martin Luther \n     King, Jr.;\n       Whereas, along with many others, John Lewis demonstrated \n     great courage by risking his life and casting light on the \n     senseless cruelty of the time when he was brutally attacked \n     while leading over 600 peaceful orderly protestors across the \n     Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, to demonstrate the \n     need for voting rights, on March 7, 1965, which later became \n     known as ``Bloody Sunday,'' expediting the passage of the \n     Voting Rights Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 1971 note; Public Law \n     89-110);\n       Whereas, in 1968, John Lewis portrayed wisdom in balancing \n     his advocacy with family, taking Lillian Miles Lewis as his \n     wife and later raising their son, John Miles Lewis, together;\n       Whereas John Lewis was elected in 1986 to serve as the \n     United States Representative for Georgia's Fifth \n     Congressional District and has capably and effectively served \n     his constituency since then, serving as Chief Deputy Whip for \n     the House Democratic caucus;

and\n       Whereas private individuals and public agencies must work \n     together on the federal, state, and local levels to combat \n     increasing occurrences of abuse, neglect, and exploitation \n     crime and violence against vulnerable older adults and \n     vulnerable adults, particularly in light of limited resources \n     for vital protective services: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 15, 2013 as ``World Elder Abuse \n     Awareness Day'';\n       (2) recognizes judges, lawyers, adult protective services \n     professionals, law enforcement officers, social workers, \n     health care providers, victims' advocates, and other \n     professionals and agencies for their efforts to advance \n     awareness of elder abuse; and\n       (3) encourages members of the public and professionals who \n     work with older adults to act as catalysts to promote \n     awareness and long-term prevention of elder abuse by reaching \n     out to local adult protective services agencies and by \n     learning to recognize, detect, report, and respond to elder \n     abuse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/13/senate-section/article/S4484-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1259.

Mr. President, today I rise in recognition of June 15 as \nWorld Elder Abuse Awareness Day. This Saturday will be the eighth \ncommemoration since the day was first established in 2006. By observing \nWorld Elder Abuse Awareness Day, we are joining organizations around \nthe world to raise awareness and support existing efforts to combat the \nserious problem of elder abuse in all forms.\n  Every year, millions of older Americans are abused, neglected, or \nexploited, with an estimated 84 percent of these cases going \nunreported. This problem is particularly relevant for my constituents \nin the great State of Florida, which has the highest proportion of \nindividuals over age 65 in the United States. As chairman of the \nSpecial Committee on Aging, I will shine a spotlight on this issue and \nwork with my colleagues to eradicate and hold accountable those that \nwould take advantage of our seniors.\n  I am proud of the State of Florida's leadership to raise awareness \nabout World Elder Abuse Awareness Day. For example, the Seminole County \nTriad--a collaborative of local law enforcement, public safety, and \nsenior organizations in Seminole County, FL--will host its eighth \nannual World Elder Abuse Awareness Day symposium. The focus this year \nwill be on Alzheimer's, an area the Aging Committee has and will \ncontinue to work on as this session of Congress continues.\n  The University of Miami Health System Center on Aging will host a \nwebcast on financial exploitation and its impact on the health of older \nadults. This webcast, along with similar informational events being \nheld throughout our country and the world, provide essential \ninformation for professionals who work with seniors.\n  Our 11 area agencies on aging are on the frontlines of helping older \nFloridians. They share a common information and referral system, making \naccess to services faster and more efficient. By calling 1-800-96-\nELDER, individuals receive advice and information on a range of issues, \nincluding health care, housing, nutrition, abuse prevention, and other \nsocial programs. One of these agencies, Elder Options, recently moved \nto a new location in Gainesville, allowing them to better provide vital \nservices to seniors living in 16 different counties in the mid-Florida \nregion.\n  Florida is also home to the Elder Rights Center of Excellence at the \nPalm Beach-Treasure Coast Area Agency on Aging. Led by director Mary \nJones, the Elder Rights Center conducted 24 trainings for over 670 \ndifferent professions, provided over 3,100 hours of service, and \nassisted over 4,400 senior crime victims last year in Palm Beach \nCounty. It also has a staffer dedicated to working solely on financial \nabuse.\n  I am proud of these events, and all those events that will be held \nthis year that aim to protect our seniors from harm. World Elder Abuse \nAwareness Day is not only a time to recognize and support these efforts \nbut also to critically examine what further steps can be taken. As \nChairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I will continue to \nwork on eradicating elder abuse as one of many issues that are critical \nto ensure the health health and economic security of older Americans.\n  In honor of the many advocates working tirelessly to combat elder \nabuse throughout the United States and the world, I am pleased to \nrecognize June 15 as World Elder Abuse Awareness Day.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the resolution be \nagreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4496]]\n\n  The resolution (S. 171) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in today's Record \nunder ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I apologize to everyone for having to wait. \nWe were trying to get some things cleared, and it didn't work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/13/senate-section/article/S4496-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR MONDAY, JUNE 17, 2013\n\n  Mr. REID.
