Mr. President, at 5:30 p.m. there will be a rollcall vote \non the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 1963.\n\n\n        Measures Placed on the Calendar--H.R. 3590 and H.R. 3964\n\n  Mr. REID. I am told there are two bills at the desk due for a second \nreading.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will read the bills by title for \nthe second time.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3590) to protect and enhance opportunities for \n     recreational hunting, fishing, and shooting, and for other \n     purposes.\n       A bill (H.R. 3964) to address certain water-related \n     concerns in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Mr. REID. I object to any further proceedings with respect to these \ntwo bills.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard. The bills will be \nplaced on the calendar.\n\n\n             Restoring Retirement Pay to U.S. Armed Forces\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today the Senate will consider new \nlegislation that would restore earned retirement pay to the men and \nwomen of our Armed Forces. The measure restores cost-of-living \nadjustments for all military retirees regardless of age, disability or \nemployment status. Congress should protect veterans who put their lives \non the line to protect our country.\n  I appreciate very much Senators Pryor, Shaheen, Hagan, and Begich for \ntheir leadership on this issue. Although the provision reversed by this \nmeasure doesn't take effect until the end of next year, there is no \nreason to delay, and we should move forward with it. I hope Republicans \nwill join Democrats to pass this bill without their usual partisan \ngames.\n  Unfortunately, the type of obstruction and delay I just referred to \nwas on full display here last week. On Thursday, the Senate fell one \nvote short of restoring unemployment insurance for 1.7 million \nAmericans who lost their jobs through absolutely no fault of their own. \nEvery single Democratic Senator voted for this bill. A few reasonable \nRepublicans--four, to be exact--voted with us to restore benefits that \nwould boost our economy and provide a lifeline for out-of-work \nAmericans. But we are still one Republican vote shy before we are able \nto do this for these people.\n  It is so unfair. If someone loses their job today, they can apply for \nunemployment benefits and get them immediately. But if a person has \nbeen out of work for a long time at 57 years old and can't find a job, \nthat person needs this, but they can't because of what the Republicans \nhave done.\n  When 1.7 million struggling Americans fall short of the rent, skip \nmeals to save cash or turn down the thermostat on freezing days, they \nwill know who to blame--41 Republican Senators. We only need one more \nRepublican--a total of 5 out of 45--to step up and do what is right for \nthese desperate people.\n  We are not going to stop pushing to restore emergency unemployment \ninsurance. In the weeks to come, we will vote again on this important \nissue and again if we need to. In the meantime I hope my colleagues \nacross the aisle will think long and hard about their unsustainable \nposition on this issue, a position that hurts middle-class families.\n\n\n                              Minimum Wage\n\n  In the weeks ahead the Senate will also consider legislation to give \n17 million minimum wage workers a much needed raise and our economy a \nmuch needed boost. No American working full time should live below the \npoverty line, but many of them do. So we are going to push to make the \nminimum wage a living wage and raise it to $10.10 an hour.\n\n[[Page S838]]\n\n  To ensure this country's economic success, it is crucial that every \nAmerican has an opportunity to succeed as well. When some people have \nto work two or three full-time jobs just to pay the rent and put food \non the table, something is wrong.\n  Minimum wage workers spend their paychecks in local stores, gas \nstations, and restaurants. That is why an increase in the minimum wage \nwould create 85,000 new jobs.\n  This increase is also key to ensuring every full-time worker has a \nshot at entering the middle class. Contrary to the common belief, \nraising the minimum wage isn't just about helping teenagers earn a \nlittle extra cash. Two-thirds of the people working for minimum wage \nare women. It is also about helping any woman, such as a 35-year-old \nwoman earning half of her family's income and more than one-quarter of \nthe workers who would benefit from a raise are supporting children.\n  Last week Republicans voted against the interests of middle-class \nAmericans doing their best to survive unemployment. When it comes time \nto consider Democrats' minimum wage proposal, I hope the Republicans \nwill choose the right way, not the wrong way, as they have done so \noften. They should stand for middle-class families rather than resort \nto obstruction.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  I ask the Chair to announce the business of the day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaine). Under the previous order \nleadership time is reserved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 1963.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                          NSA Security Breach\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the National Security Agency continues its \nindiscriminate collection of a massive number of phone records about \nAmericans under section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act. I have said over \nand over again that as a nation we have long needed to have the \nnational conversation about bulk collection that is now underway, and \nthe section 215 program should have been declassified long before it \nwas.\n  I wish to make very clear, as I have said before, I do not condone \nthe way this or other highly classified programs were disclosed. I am \ndeeply concerned about the potential damage to our intelligence-\ngathering capabilities, our foreign relationships, and national \nsecurity.\n  I am also deeply concerned that one person with a security clearance \ncan wreak this much havoc. According to the New York Times, Edward \nSnowden accomplished his heist of extraordinarily sensitive information \nabout NSA activities with ``inexpensive and widely available \nsoftware''; in other words, software that any one of us could get. He \ndidn't even execute a particularly sophisticated breach. He did not, \napparently, face a particularly complex technological challenge while \nremoving these sensitive documents from the NSA trove. Yet he pulled \noff what the Director of National Intelligence James Clapper recently \ncalled ``the most massive and most damaging theft of intelligence in \nour history.''\n  I continually ask the leaders of our intelligence community: What are \nyou doing to stop this from happening again? I have learned that the \nNSA has devoted substantial resources to fixing the faults that allowed \nthis to happen, has taken some steps to address them, and has \nidentified a range of other actions that need to be taken. But one has \nto ask, especially in the wake of the Private Manning leaks, how could \nthe NSA have allowed this to happen in the first place.\n  I say this not to beat up on the NSA. I know we have highly \ndedicated, patriotic men and women working there, and I applaud them \nfor their service to their country. But when I hear their leadership \nask us to trust that they will keep our information safe and that we \nshould have faith in its internal policies and procedures, one has to \nask: Is this accurate?\n  This is the same NSA that first told us that the section 215 program \nwas essential to national security. They talked in speeches around the \ncountry that it thwarted dozens of plots. But then when they were asked \nquestions in a congressional hearing specifically about it, that number \nwent from in the fifties down to possibly one. The primary defense of \nthe NSA's bulk collection program now appears to be the program is more \nof an insurance policy than anything else. But now even that new \ndefense of the program has been called into question.\n  The Washington Post has reported that under this program the NSA \ncollects less than 30 percent of domestic phone records. The Wall \nStreet Journal says the number is less than 20 percent. These estimates \nare consistent with the public copy of the President's Review Group \nreport, which cautioned against placing too much value on this program \nas a tool to rule out a domestic connection to a terrorist plot; thus, \nthe so-called insurance policy. The Review Group report tells us it is \nprecisely because--although the program is unprecedented in scope--it \nstill covers only a percentage of the total phone metadata held by \nservice providers.\n  It appears to this Senator that the intelligence community has \ndefended its unprecedented, massive, and indiscriminate bulk collection \nby arguing that it needs the entire ``haystack'' in order for it to \nhave an effective counterterrorism tool--and yet the American public \nnow finds out they only have 20 to 30 percent of that so-called \nhaystack.\n  These revelations call even further into question the effectiveness \nof this program.\n  Although the program is ongoing, some preliminary and positive \nchanges are underway. Just last week, the Director of National \nIntelligence announced that the FISA Court has approved procedures \nunder which the government will seek approval by a FISA Court judge \nbefore querying these phone records--absent a true, almost \ninstantaneous kind of an emergency. The President has directed the \nAttorney General and the Director of National Intelligence to develop \nalternatives to the section 215 phone records program and report back \nto him at the end of next month. That is progress but only some \nprogress. It is not enough. It is not going to be enough to just reform \nthe government's bulk phone records collection program.\n  The program, as expensive and extensive as it is, has not proven \neffective. But beyond that, it is not worth the massive intrusion on \nthe privacy of the American people--of the good, law-abiding men and \nwomen in what is supposed to be the greatest democracy on Earth.\n  Congress should shut it down. We should enact the bipartisan, \nbicameral USA FREEDOM Act. Then Congress has to examine carefully--and \nto the extent possible publicly--the security breach that led to these \nrevelations in the first place.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee has had a number of hearings on this \nissue. We are going to continue working on these issues at a hearing \nthis week with the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board--yet \nanother voice concluding that the section 215 program should not \ncontinue. If the NSA is to regain the trust of the American people, it \nhas to spend less time collecting data on innocent Americans and more \ntime keeping our Nation's secrets safe.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I will suggest the absence of a quorum. Is time being divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is not currently being divided.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Retirement\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to talk today about a subject that \nhas immense implications for America's future. In fact, I often talk \nabout it as being perhaps the darkest cloud hanging over the future \neconomic well-being of our country that no one ever talks about. It has \nbeen hugely ignored; that is, the issue of retirement income and what \npeople are going to do when they retire in the future.\n  I have been focused on this for several years. My HELP Committee has, \nover the last 2 or 3 years, had 10 hearings on this issue. We have met \nwith a\n\n[[Page S839]]\n\nlot of the investment community and retirement benefits community to \ntake a look at what is happening and to see whether we can have a \nbetter system for retirement than we have.\n  Right now young people who are working to pay off student loan debt, \nmaybe buy a new home, put a little money away for their own kids' \neducation later on or people who are close to retirement, a nurse who \nhas been working all her life, someone maybe worked in a small business \nand they are 60 years old, are wondering what are they going to do when \nthey retire. They are worried they will not have enough money to live \non.\n  Quite frankly, they are very right to be worried. If you looked at \nthe future work force of America today and you said: What is it this \ngroup of people will need to live on when they retire and what they \nhave saved for retirement, there is a deficit. They do not have enough \nsaved on which to retire.\n  How big is that deficit? Calculations in our hearings show it is \nabout $6.6 trillion. That is a big chunk of change. That is a huge \nhole. So when you look at what is happening, half of Americans--half of \nAmericans--have less than $10,000 in savings.\n  As I talk and as we look at this, we have to remember that retirement \nhas always been thought of as a three-legged stool. One leg is a \npension; one leg is savings; the other leg is Social Security. So what \nis happening now is that on the retirement pension system, the savings \nsystems are falling down. Social Security is still strong. I will have \nmore to say about that. But what we have to do is look at how much \npeople have in savings. Half of all Americans who are working today \nhave less than $10,000 in savings--less than $10,000 in savings.\n  When I came to the Congress in the 1970s, one out of every two \nworkers had a pension. That means they had a pension that would pay \nthem a monthly income until the day they died. And if they died, their \nspouse would get it. One out of every two. Today it is one in every \nfive and it is getting worse. Only one in five.\n  By the way, this has fallen by 30 percent in just two decades. Again, \n75 million people have no retirement plan at all. Seventy-five million \npeople--that is about half of the workforce in America--have no \nworkplace retirement plan at all--nothing, no 401(k), no IRAs, no \ndefined benefit program. Nothing. Half, one out of every two, have \nnothing whatsoever.\n  Unfortunately, instead of trying to improve the pension system and \nlift up everyone, there are too many people out there trying to score \npolitical points by scapegoating public servants for State and local \nbudget shortfalls. Pensions are not the cause of State fiscal problems, \nand retired public servants are not living high on the hog on the \ntaxpayer's dime. These are simply malicious myths being spread by \npeople who I think have two objectives: one, to discredit public sector \nunions; secondly, to dismantle the pension system.\n  Pensions are one of the best ways to ensure that middle-class people \ncan have a secure retirement because they provide a guaranteed source \nof income that a person can count on for as long as he or she lives.\n  Can the current pension system be improved? I believe so. But there \nis no reason to abandon a system that has worked for millions of \npeople.\n  The sad truth is that these days the vast majority of employees with \nany retirement plan at all have a 401(k). Again, I am not here to bad-\nmouth 401(k)s. They can be a very good way to help people put some \nmoney aside to supplement their pension. But 401(k)s were never \nintended to replace pensions. It was to be that other leg of the stool, \nthe savings part.\n  Again, we know that savings rates are too low. As I said, most people \nhave less than $10,000. There is no simple way for people to convert \ntheir savings into a stream of retirement income that they cannot \noutlive. The promise people made about 401(k)s was that more businesses \nwould start them, more people would participate.\n  Well, I was here when 401(k)s started. It sounded like a good idea, \nan easy way for people to save. But decades after the start of 401(k)s, \nthe number of workers participating in these plans has stayed flat. \nAccording to Monique Morrissey of the Economic Policy Institute, in \n1989, participation in 401(k)s was at 46 percent of the workforce. In \n2010, it was 45 percent. So it has stayed flat.\n  We have seen some modest increases in savings the last few years. \nThat is what people told me at our hearings. We have seen some modest \nincreases. I said: Really? Okay, let's take a look at that. This kind \nof surprised me, that we had an uptick in savings. But then we looked \nat the data. What does it show? It shows who is saving what. The top \n10-percent income earners, the top 10 percent of income earners in \nAmerica have 100 times more saved for retirement than the median \nhousehold. So we charted it out. You see back here in 1989, well, they \nwere not too far apart. Here is the top 10 percent. The top 10 percent \nnow has nearly $239,000 set aside for retirement; the median household, \n$2,500. You say savings have gone up. Yes, look who has saved--the top \n10 percent, those of us who work here. So $239,000 as opposed to $2,500 \nfor the average family.\n  I might also add that buried in this, buried in this chart, is an \nunacceptable amount of racial and gender inequality in this system. The \nNational Institute on Retirement Security recently found that Black, \nAsian, and Latino workers have significantly less access to retirement \nplans on the job than White Americans, especially in the private \nsector. As a result, the vast majority of working-age households headed \nby people of color have little or no retirement savings. For those with \na retirement plan, the average account balances for Black and Latino \nhouseholds are less than one-fifth that of White households. So if I am \nnot mistaken, one-fifth of $2,500 would be about 500 bucks. So buried \nin this--keep in mind--is unequal gender and racial inequality.\n  Addressing the issue of retirement security again would be \nparticularly beneficial to women. We all know about the income gap \nbetween men and women. But what a lot of people do not realize is the \ngap worsens after retirement. When you think about it, you can \nunderstand that. In 2011, the median annual income of older women; that \nis, over retirement age--keep this in mind, the median annual income \nwas $14,225. The median annual income of that same core of older men \nwas $24,794.\n  Why is that? Think about it. Unequal pay during their working years. \nThat means women have less opportunity to save. They may take some time \noff during their working years to start a family. They have less time \nto save. Additionally, women tend to be concentrated in jobs that do \nnot traditionally offer retirement plans. It has been said many times \nthat women save more money than men. Well, yes, they have higher rates, \nbut they are starting from a very low point. So women still lag behind \nmen when it comes to total retirement savings.\n  That sort of sets the stage for our committee and for me to introduce \nthe USA Retirement Funds Act, S. 1979--if anybody wants to write down \nthe number of the bill. It is a new retirement program, and I am going \nto explain, basically, how it operates.\n  The USA retirement means it is universal, it is secure, and it is \nadaptable. That is what the USA stands for. It would tackle the \nretirement crisis head-on by ensuring that the 75 million people--\nremember my earlier chart--without a workplace retirement plan would \nhave the opportunity to earn a safe and secure pension--universal, \nsecure, and adaptable.\n  The concept is very simple. Employers who don't offer a pension or a \nwell-designed 401(k) would automatically enroll their employees in this \nretirement fund. If an employee wanted to opt out, he or she could. No \none would be forced to participate. But by making the system opt out \ninstead of opt in, we get millions more people participating.\n  Employer and employee contributions would go into a fund that would \nbe managed by a board of trustees. When a participant retires, the fund \nwould provide the retiree with a monthly benefit as long as he or she \nlives, and if that person died it would go on to their spouse.\n  Over time, as people contribute, they would earn a real retirement \nbenefit that will be a better bang for their buck than what they could \nhave gotten on their own. That is because these funds would spread \nretirement risk over large groups of participants.\n\n[[Page S840]]\n\n  A recent report by David Madland at the Center for American Progress \nfound that the USA Retirement Fund, with risk pooling and professional \nmanagement, would make retirement much more affordable for working \nfamilies. In fact, it would cut in half the amount people would need to \nsave over the present system of defined contribution 401(k)s.\n  So it is basically universal access; everybody is in. You could work \nfor an employer--with three employees, four employees, two employees--\nor you could be self-employed and have universal access.\n  You would get monthly benefits for life. You wouldn't be borrowing \nagainst it. You wouldn't be taking out a lump sum. It would be there, \nand you would get a monthly benefit for life with a spousal survival.\n  ``Professionally managed'' means that it would be managed by a board \nof trustees who would have a fiduciary responsibility to this pool to \ninvest it wisely--fiduciary responsibility. That relieves the \nindividual from trying to figure our out what is the best place to put \nmy little, meager amount of savings.\n  You wouldn't have to consider whether or not you should follow Uncle \nFred's advice about this stock that he has that is going to make you a \nlot of money in the future or Mr. Ponzi's--what was the Ponzi guy's \nname again--where all you had to do was give him a lot of money or \nmaybe Bernie Madoff in later years. You wouldn't have to worry about \nthat. This would be a professional board that would have a fiduciary \nresponsibility. As I said, it would have lower costs--about 50 percent.\n  In other words, what this means is if you were 35 years old and \nworking, and you figured under your 401(k) you would need $2 million by \nthe time you retired in order to live out your life and have a decent \nretirement income, if you were involved in this program, you would only \nneed $1 million because the costs would be that much less.\n  A big portion of that $2 million goes into fees during the life of \nthat 401(k). So that is the big savings. USA retirement, that is for \nthe personnel.\n  Let's take a look at what it means for the business, the business \ncommunity itself. These are the benefits to the business. It is easy to \noffer. They don't have to set up a plan. For a small mom-and-pop \nbusiness, if they are filling out FICA taxes anyway, they just have a \nseparate line for this, send it off, and they haven't anything else to \ndo. They don't have to manage it--no risks and no fiduciary \nresponsibility as an employer, none whatsoever--and they get quality \nbenefits.\n  This is what this means. A lot of employers want to make sure their \nemployees have a good retirement benefit because as they get older they \nearn more. Let's face it, you would like to have people retire so you \ncould bring younger people into the workforce.\n  If you have people now who can't retire because they don't have \nenough money, they stay working. If you have a good, quality benefit, \nwhen people get to the age of retirement, basically they can retire \nnow; they have their retirement set up. It means for an employer, for a \nbusiness, they get the kind of turnover they need to bring in new, \nyounger workers.\n  As I said earlier, it is professionally run. The company has no \nfiduciary responsibility whatsoever such as they do under a defined \nbenefit program. They don't have to manage it, don't have to do \nanything and, as I said, no risk to the business whatsoever.\n  I would add also that under the bill employers could voluntarily \ncontribute to the program. They don't have to, but they could \nvoluntarily contribute.\n  If you are signing up one of your workers at 6 percent, the employer \ncould say: I want to have a good workforce; I want to hire really good \npeople. I have good people, and I want to keep them, but I will tell \nyou what, I will kick in 2 percent, 3 percent or 2.5 percent.\n  They can kick in whatever they want as a management tool, maybe even \nas a recruitment tool to recruit very good workers. Again, it is a good \nrecruitment and management tool for businesses.\n  For the economy in general, this would be good. This is what a lot of \npeople don't consider. By bringing more people into this retirement \nsystem, there are going to be more savings, and there are going to be \nsavings that are long-term type savings.\n  It is what we call patient capital. In other words, with the capital \nthat comes into these big retirement pools, they don't need to earn and \nthink about the quarterly bottom line, but they do think about the long \nterm.\n  Haven't we spent a lot of time in this body and around the country \ntalking about the need for infrastructure, long-term projects for this \ncountry, energy systems, electrical systems, roads, bridges, sewers, \nall of these. Plus, we need long-term capital for the new entrepreneurs \nstarting these new businesses that may take a long time for them to \nreturn some capital, but they need that access to that long-term \npatient capital that something like this could provide for them.\n  As I said, it creates a lot of jobs. Again, because of this ability \nto invest over the long term, they are going to be able to start \ncreating more jobs in our country.\n  I want to emphasize two more key points before I yield the floor.\n  First, USA Retirement Funds would not replace pensions or 401(k)s. \nEmployers could and should continue to offer these plans at the \nworkplace. But what this would do is give people without access to a \nquality employer-provided plan the opportunity to earn a retirement \nbenefit.\n  The second point I want to make is that USA Retirement Funds isn't a \nnew government program. There have already been some stories written \nabout this in the paper.\n  Someone said: Harkin has come up with a new government program.\n  No, I haven't. This is not a government program. This is a 21st \ncentury retirement plan run entirely by the private sector, just like \npensions and 401(k)s.\n  Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't talk about that third leg of \nthe stool, and that is Social Security. We have to improve the most \nefficient, most effective retirement program we have, and that is \nSocial Security. Last year, I, along with others, introduced a bill, S. \n567--a nice, easy number to remember--to expand the benefits by $65 a \nmonth. That means that if you are at the lower end of the income scale \nwhen you retire, your replacement rate will be a little bit better. You \nget $65 a month.\n  For some at the higher end, $65 a month is not that big of a deal, \nbut it sure helps those at the bottom end. So it would increase that by \n$65, and it would index the living adjustment so you would have \nimproved cost-of-living adjustment in the future because it would look \nat the CPI--the cost-of-living for elderly. I look at that and adjust \nit for that.\n  Secondly, it would strengthen the trust fund by lifting the cap on \nthe payroll tax. If we do all of that, we strengthen Social Security, \nwe actually increase the benefit a little bit, and it extends the life \nto 2050. So it makes Social Security stronger for future beneficiaries.\n  By improving the private retirement system, bolstering Social \nSecurity, we can do a lot to take away that dark cloud. We can tell \npeople, assure people, that they will be able to save and have a \nretirement benefit, an annuity, every month, as long as they live.\n  Secondly, we make it easier for businesses to set it up. Third, it \ncreates jobs in our economy by long-term types of investment. During \nthis time of economic insecurity, it is more important than ever that \nworking people have the opportunity to prepare for retirement.\n  I urge my colleagues to help rebuild the pension system in this \ncountry by supporting the USA Retirement Funds Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Fischer and Mr. King pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 2007 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we find ourselves today considering \nlegislation to fix a problem that Congress and the President created \nonly 2 short months ago. We knew from the Ryan-Murray spending deal \nthat it cut military pensions. Yet this Senate passed the bill anyway, \nover my objections and those of many of my Republican\n\n[[Page S841]]\n\ncolleagues. Congressional Democrats insisted on keeping the military \npension cuts in the Ryan-Murray deal. They would not accept change. \nAlmost every Democrat supported Majority Leader Reid and rejected \namendments to stop the cuts and voted for the final passage. So they \nignored the warnings I and others issued, and virtually every Senate \nDemocrat voted to keep these cuts rather than close clear Federal tax \nloopholes that allow illegal aliens to gain money improperly.\n  So what happens? Constituents back home were outraged. Senate \nDemocrats are trying to claim credit for fixing the very problem they \ncreated--which, in itself, is not bad, but unfortunately, instead of \ndoing this in a good-faith way consistent with our spending priorities \nand limitations under the Murray-Ryan bill, the Pryor bill before us \nnow authorizes more spending, unpaid for, in direct violation of the \nspending limits set out in the Ryan-Murray legislation passed just a \nfew weeks ago.\n  So we passed legislation, we set limits on spending, and here we are \nblithely walking in again. I am at a loss to see why my colleagues \ncontinue to resist replacing these cuts--cuts to veterans who have \nearned it, who have been drawing these benefits, and not replacing them \nby closing the tax credit loophole for illegal immigrants.\n  Closing of this loophole was recommended by the inspector general of \nPresident Obama's own Treasury Department. So why are there those \ndetermined to protect billions of dollars in tax fraud and allow it to \ncontinue? Would it not be in our national interest to close this \nloophole, restore these pensions for our veterans, and maintain the \nsavings we promised to the American people? Indeed, the savings would \nmore than pay for the replacement of the veteran retirement provision, \nand it would help reduce our huge deficits.\n  Let's review how we got here.\n  In August of 2011, as we approached the statutory borrowing limit--\nthe debt ceiling--Congress passed a Budget Control Act, which Congress \nagreed to immediately increase the debt limit by $2.1 trillion, but \nCongress promised to reduce the projected growth of spending from $10 \ntrillion over the next 10 years to $8 trillion over the next 10 years. \nThis was said to be a spending cut but was really a reduction in the \ngrowth of spending.\n  So this 2011 legislation, passed into law and signed by the \nPresident, promised to reduce the growth of spending by $2.1 trillion. \nI did not support this act. I thought we could have done more, and \nhoped to do more. Of course, I recognized it applied to our military in \na disproportionate way--although we hoped it would ultimately be \navoided, but it was not.\n  Once this legislation was passed, I felt--and I think most of us in \nCongress believed--we should honor the agreement we made to the \nAmerican people. But almost immediately, many of our colleagues began \nsaying even those spending reductions were too much. At every turn, the \nSenate passed or attempted to pass legislation which broke the spending \ncaps.\n  I raised a number of budget objections. I am the ranking member on \nthe Senate Budget Committee, and when spending violates the spending \nlimits we have, I have on a number of occasions raised objections, or \nbudget points of order. It takes 60 votes to spend more than the budget \nallows us to spend, so it gives us a check on spending.\n  Many of my objections were sustained, almost entirely with Republican \nvotes, but in plain fact our colleagues were unwilling to save the \nmoney they promised the American people. We agreed to save a certain \namount of money--we promised to do so. But when things get tight and \ntheir political groups want more, we tend to spend more, make excuses, \nand violate the budget. That, of course, is why we are in this deep, \nadverse financial situation.\n  Chairman Murray and Chairman Ryan entered into a negotiation to ease \nthe Budget Control Act spending cuts--the sequester. They unveiled a \nplan which increased spending above the BCA level in exchange for \nincreased revenues and some spending cuts. They said the new increases \nin spending were paid for. The increases in spending happened in 2 \nyears, promised cuts were over a long period of time in the future, but \nit did in fact balance as they described it at the time.\n  However, immediately my staff alerted me to a provision in the bill \nwhich proposed cutting military retirement benefits by $6 billion--not \nfor future recipients but for current soldiers and retirees. Some \nservicemembers would see a lifetime reduction of $120,000 or more, some \n$72,000. This is a cost-of-living reduction of more than 60 percent for \nsome people. I felt this was unacceptable. There are a lot of other \nthings we ought to be cutting before we cut the promised earned \nretirement benefits to our veterans who serve 20 years. Only those who \nhave a 20-year service record qualify for this. I thought this was \nunacceptable and pointed it out.\n  Of course, no one seems to know where this provision came from. The \nDepartment of Defense said they weren't consulted. This is not \nsurprising, since the legislation was produced by a secret few behind \nclosed doors--something I do not think is a good process. The \ntraditional legislative conference committee process was abandoned.\n  The good news is it was caught before it came to the floor, and when \nthe bill came up, some of us offered proposals to fix this problem \nwhile staying within the spending caps. So as to not cut veterans $6 \nbillion we needed to find some other place to cut $6 billion. This \nwould at least have kept the promises of the bill sponsors of Ryan-\nMurray.\n  Military retirement cuts were a significant part of pay for this new \nspending. In that spirit, I proposed what I thought was a reasonable \nalternative. For over 2 years now, I have been trying to close a \nmassive tax loophole.\n  In July of 2011, the U.S. Treasury Department, part of President \nObama's administration, reported that illegal aliens received more than \n$4 billion in free child tax credits in just 2010 alone. In some cases, \nhouseholds received tens of thousands of dollars year after year, in \nmany cases claiming as dependents people who don't even live in the \nUnited States. A number of these filers had no tax liability--that is, \nthey were paying no tax at all--but they were getting tax credit checks \nfrom the Federal Government. The inspector general of the Treasury \nDepartment asked Congress to act and close this clear abuse. And it is \ndramatic, really.\n  What we found, in 2005, is credits claimed under this provision \namounted to $924 million. But the inspector general reported by 2010, \nit was $4.2 billion--it has gone up four times in 5 year or 6 years--\nsurging, as word got out that all you had to do was make these claims, \nnobody checks that the children were in the United States or if there \nwere children at all. There is no way to check.\n  The inspector general of the Treasury Department has made at least \nthree reports on this subject, and in its 2009 report pointed out the \nproblems we face.\n  And it is not accurate to say that we somehow want to abuse children \nand deny them support. We are talking about plain fraud and abuse in \nthis system.\n  This is what the inspector general said in March of 2009:\n\n       Legislation should be considered to require a Social \n     Security Number in order to be eligible for the Additional \n     Child Tax Credit--\n\n  That is basically the amendment I offered, and what the amendment \nSenator Ayotte is now offering and I cosponsored with her would do--\njust require you to have a Social Security number before you claim a \nbig check from the U.S. Treasury. This would be consistent with the \nrequirements, the IG said, for the earned income tax credit. Americans \nwho file an earned income tax credit have to have a Social Security \nnumber. This is for people who work and receive a low income.\n  The Inspector General goes on:\n\n       [A]s it now stands, the payment of Federal funds through \n     this tax benefit appears to provide an additional incentive \n     for aliens to enter, reside, and work in the U.S. without \n     authorization . . .\n\n  By the way, he said, this would appear to be an additional incentive \nfor people to illegally enter the country, because you can come in \nunlawfully here and claim credit for children who may not even exist. \nAnd, if they do, they might be in a foreign country. It is now running \nat the rate of $4 billion-plus a year.\n\n[[Page S842]]\n\n  Remember, over 10 years the cost of the cuts to veterans is $6 \nbillion. Closing this loophole would more than pay for this.\n  The inspector general goes on to say:\n\n       As far back as 2007, [IRS] employees responsible for \n     resolving errors on tax returns, including those filed by \n     individuals with an ITIN, raised concerns to IRS management \n     about its policies for handling errors in ITIN tax returns. \n     These employees stated that management did not take any \n     subsequent action to address their concerns. A formal \n     complaint was subsequently filed with the TIGTA.\n\n  In its 2009 report in December, some 6 or 9 months later, it goes on \nto say:\n\n       The volumes of ITINs is growing, increasing the risk that \n     fraudulent tax returns using ITINs could be submitted.\n       ITINs were issued without sufficient support documentation. \n     A statistical sample of 658 forms . . . selected from 1.5 \n     million application[s] . . . submitted from January 1 through \n     November 1, 2008, showed that . . . 78 percent contained \n     errors.\n\n  The inspector general goes on to say:\n\n       There are . . . no controls to prevent an ITIN from being \n     used by more than one taxpayer on multiple tax returns.\n\n  Nobody is checking if the ITIN number is used again, so they just \nfile multiple returns.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       More than 60,000 ITINs were assigned and used on multiple \n     tax returns, processed in Calendar Year 2008.\n\n  So more than 60,000 of these numbers issued to individuals were used \non more than one tax return. They shouldn't be using them but on one.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       In addition, more than 55,000 ITINs were used multiple \n     times on approximately 102,000 tax returns with refunds \n     totaling more than $202 million. These are just the ones \n     which used the number on more than one return.\n\n  The report goes on:\n\n       97 percent [of] supporting identification documents . . . \n     were missing or illegible . . . 23 percent [of] signatures \n     were missing . . . [and] 5 percent [had incorrect] birth \n     dates.\n\n  And it goes on and on.\n  Something of interest is the news media has dug into this a bit. \nNBC's affiliate in Indianapolis in April of 2012 reported this:\n\n       An undocumented worker in southern Indiana told Channel 13-\n     Investigates just how easy it truly is.\n       He said four other illegal immigrants file tax returns \n     using his address, even though none of them actually lives \n     there. And he said this year, those four workers filed tax \n     returns claiming 20 children live inside his small trailer \n     home. As a result, the IRS sent the illegal immigrants tax \n     refunds totaling more than $29,000. But none of the 20 \nchildren listed as dependents on the tax returns lives in Indiana or \neven in the United States. ``No, they don't live here,'' admitted the \nundocumented worker. ``The other kids are in their country of origin, \nwhich is Mexico.''\n\n  On July 2012, they further reported about an IRS officer with a \ncomplaint in South Carolina. They reported that Howard, the IRS \nofficer, received a stack of ITIN applications for dozens of children \nattending the same school in South Carolina. When he researched that \nschool, he discovered it didn't even exist. When Howard reported the \nscam to his bosses, he claims his managers ordered him to approve the \napplications anyway. The inspector general also looked into that \ncomplaint.\n  This is not good. The taxpayers don't need to be subjected to this \nkind of fraud and abuse, and we absolutely should not cut veterans' \nearned retirement benefits while refusing to take action against such \nfraud and abuse as identified by our Treasury Department.\n  I offered the amendment to save the soldiers' pensions and pay for it \nby closing this tax loophole, but the majority leader--supported by his \ncaucus, including the authors of this legislation--blocked the effort, \nnot once but twice.\n  Let me make it clear that this bill before us--because our colleagues \nare refusing to utilize this possible fraud-closing mechanism to save \nenough money to more than pay for it--will be asking us to violate the \nfundamental principle of the Ryan-Murray Act. The Ryan-Murray Act \npromised we would spend more but that new spending would be paid for by \ntaxes and spending cuts, and one of the spending cuts were the cuts to \nthe veterans. If we take out the cuts to the veterans, where are we \ngoing to get the money to make sure the bill is paid for as promised? \nThat is the question. We have offered a perfectly reasonable and \nessential loophole-closing mechanism to pay for that and pay even more \nthan that. Let me make it clear: The bill before us is placing us in a \nposition to choose from allowing an illegality to continue or cutting \nbenefits earned by our veterans.\n  What we are seeing--in an astonishingly cynical move, if you think \nabout it--is that we would restore the pensions to veterans without \npaying for it, without admitting that a mistake was made and not living \nup to the plain promises made in the Ryan-Murray bill, which reinforced \nand repassed spending limitations.\n  Congress passed spending caps in 2011. Ryan-Murray spent more but \nalso established higher and clearer spending caps. It reestablished \nspending cuts. The Pryor legislation busts the in law Ryan-Murray caps. \nThis is not acceptable. Are we blithely ignoring plain spending limits \npassed into law just a few weeks ago? Is there no shame, no \nembarrassment at such a dramatic breach of legal and budgetary spending \nlimits?\n  Closing the ITIN tax credit loophole is a no-brainer. Let's stop this \nabuse and not cut current retirement of our veterans.\n  I hope we can move forward with the legislation today. I am uneasy \nand worried, but let's move forward. Let's bring the bill to the floor \nand maybe a compromise that is acceptable can be reached. I certainly \nbelieve that Senator Ayotte's proposal--the one I am supporting--is a \nperfectly reasonable compromise that ought to have overwhelming support \nin this body.\n  If such an amendment of this nature is not accepted to pay for this \nchange, I think the legislation is not going to pass in its current \nform. It would be a plain violation of the promises we made to limit \nspending just a few weeks ago. It is the kind of erosion of integrity \nthat will lead this country to financial disaster. We are running up \ntoo much debt.\n  The Congressional Budget Office Director will testify before the \nBudget Committee tomorrow, and I trust the Presiding Officer will be \nthere. He is an excellent member of that committee.\n  The Congressional Budget Office Director is going to tell us that \ninterest on the debt of the United States--which will increase every \nyear for the next 10 years and begin to surge upward in the outer \nyears--in the 10th year alone will be $890 billion. That is stunning. \nThe Department of Defense is just at $500 billion.\n  Right now interest on the debt is $250 billion. It is going to $900 \nbillion in 10 years. The first money this government will have to pay \nis the money we pay on our interest on the debt that we have run up--\n$17 trillion. According to CBO, we are going to add another $7 trillion \nover the next 10 years. We will have to pay $24 trillion on interest.\n  He told us that if interest rates go up 1 percent, it will add $1.5 \ntrillion to the amount of interest we would pay over the next 10 years. \nMost people tell us our interest rates are going up.\n  I guess what I am saying to my colleagues is that we know we face a \nfinancial challenge. We know we have to get spending under control. The \nRyan-Murray bill was designed to ease this year's cuts in the Budget \nControl Act and sequester, and this was the tightest and toughest year \nof all. They eased that, and they said they paid for it with tax \nincreases and spending reductions.\n  The bill before us would eliminate one of the pay-fors and substitute \nnothing else, which would mean we would add another $6 billion to the \ndeficit. That is the path to fiscal irresponsibility and financial \ndanger, and we need to get off of it.\n  I thank the Chair, yield the floor, and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, today I rise in support of S. 1963, the \nMilitary Pay Restoration Act.\n  Last year, the Senate passed the Bipartisan Budget Act--a bipartisan \nand bicameral agreement that funded our government, provided stability \nfor our\n\n[[Page S843]]\n\neconomy, and reduced our deficit by over $22 billion.\n  I think my colleagues and the American people will agree that last \nyear was tough. We saw the delay of the farm bill, the government \nshutdown, and the debt ceiling. Needless to say, this budget agreement \nwas a positive step forward.\n  However, I will be the first to admit--and I think I maybe was the \nfirst to admit, possibly--that this wasn't perfect, especially when it \ncame to the harmful budget cuts made at the expense of our men and \nwomen in uniform.\n  There is no question we need to cut our spending. I think almost \neveryone in this Chamber agrees with that, and I think so many \nAmericans agree with that, but we must do it responsibly. We can \naddress the isues we all talk about, such as cutting waste and fraud \nand abuse. We can be smart and eliminate items--again, once we think \nabout them and roll up our sleeves and do the hard work and recognize \nwe should--such as unnecessary government property purchases and \nmaintenance, and pursue other cuts such as out-of-date and inefficient \nprograms. All of those issues should be addressed.\n  But we cannot balance the budget on the backs of our hard-working \nmilitary members and their families. We are a free nation today because \nof the sacrifices our men and women in uniform make. They make those \nsacrifices for all of us. They make sacrifices for the Nation and for \nthe world. They lay their lives on the line for us, oftentimes in \nplaces far away from their homes and their families, so we can live in \npeace right here at home.\n  Ashley, a soldier's wife from Alma, AR, recently wrote me and said: \n``My husband signed up to serve so those that don't want to wouldn't \nhave to.''\n  We have made a commitment to our servicemembers and we need to honor \nthat commitment today by ensuring they receive the benefits they have \nearned.\n  When Aaron of Lake City, AR, signed up for the Army and deployed to \nIraq, he counted on those earned benefits to provide for himself and \nhis family. As he said in his letter: ``I held up my end of the \ncontract and I believe the government should uphold their end.''\n  I agree with Aaron. Singling out our brave servicemembers isn't just \nunfair, it is wrong.\n  Dwayne of Drasco, AR, who served in the Air Force, said: ``I have \nbeen to Iraq and Afghanistan many times. I left a wife and three kids \nthat depended on me. I fulfilled my obligation.''\n  The government must right this wrong and fulfill our obligation to \nservicemembers such as Dwayne.\n  I have introduced the Military Retirement Pay Restoration bill to \nrepeal section 403 of the budget agreement that unfairly reduces the \ncost-of-living adjustment benefits for our military retirees under the \nage of 62 by 1 percent and to ensure that our future military retirees \nreceive their full retirement pay.\n  Unfortunately, I have heard a lot of back-and-forth here in the \nSenate and on the Senate floor about this provision. Instead of working \nagainst each other, let's work together to get this done. As President \nJohn F. Kennedy said:\n\n       Let us not seek the Republican answer or the Democratic \n     answer, but the right answer. Let us not seek to fix the \n     blame for the past. Let us accept our own responsibility for \n     the future.\n\n  We can fix this. Today, we will take an important step forward in \nfixing it. I am proposing a responsible solution which everyone on this \nfloor should be able to support. In fact, I have even heard Speaker \nBoehner down the hall here urging his colleagues over in the House to \nconsider supporting legislation that would repeal section 403 of the \nbudget agreement, just as mine does, just as ours does.\n\n  Supporting our men and women in uniform is not a partisan issue; it \nis an American issue. We have seen 30 of the major veterans groups urge \nus to fix this: the Air Force Association, the Marine Corps League, the \nEnlisted Association of the National Guard of the U.S., the Association \nof the U.S. Navy, the Military Officers Association of America, just to \nname a few. There are 30 of these organizations that have urged us to \nfix this. They have told us: ``This provision breaks faith with each \nindividual who has faithfully served their nation for over two decades \nin uniform.''\n  So let's fix it. Let's restore America's faith in Congress by doing \nthe right thing today. Let's give our soldiers and their families the \nunwavering support they have given us. Let's put the partisanship \naside, and let's pass this bill. Our military members and their \nfamilies are counting on us.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Gun Violence\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. I try to come down to the floor every week or so to give \nvoices to the victims of gun violence. All across this country, every \nday and every week, dozens, hundreds, thousands of Americans are gunned \ndown on our streets and in our homes, in part because the Congress does \nabsolutely nothing, has done absolutely nothing over the course of the \npast several years, over the course of the past decade, to try to curb \nthis scourge of destruction that plagues virtually every corner of our \nsociety. Eighty-six people a day die at the hands of guns; 2,639, \napproximately, people every month. We lose 31,000 people every year. \nThere is not another first-world country in the world that can come \nclose to the level of gun violence we have here in the United States.\n  On top of these numbers are the horrific trendlines on mass \nshootings. Over the course of January, we saw a school shooting \nessentially every 2 days that school was in session. ``Luckily'' is not \nthe word to ascribe to this sentence, but luckily, in each one of those \ninstances, the damage was relatively minor to the potential damage that \nwill unfortunately one day come when a shooter walks into one of these \nschools and is able to perpetrate the kind of violence that Adam Lanza \ndid in Newtown, CT. We are sending a message of complicity when the \nSenate and the House of Representatives stand absolutely silent in the \nface of this violence.\n  I have come to the floor almost every week, and I hope that almost \nevery time I arrive at the floor, I let my colleagues know that I don't \nexpect that any law we pass is going to reduce 31,000 or 2,600 or 86 to \nzero. I understand that the reality is there is no law we can pass that \nwill end all incidents of gun violence, that there is no panacea to \nthis problem that Congress can offer, but we send a very clear message \nwhen we do nothing. When the Senate does not act, when the House does \nnot act, we tell people in this country that we must be OK with the \nnumbers that continue to accrue and move upward. I know that isn't the \ncase. I know my Republican colleagues are just as sickened as I am at \n86 people dying every day from guns. I know that supporters of the NRA, \ngun owners themselves, can't stand that this number is so high at \n31,000 a year. But if the stats don't do it, then hopefully the voices \nof these victims will. So I offer four more recent victims, all from \nthe streets of our cities in Connecticut.\n  Varnouard Hall was killed just a few days ago in New Haven, CT, \nJanuary 31. He was shot and killed on the corner of East Pearl Street \nand Pierpont Street in New Haven. Emergency personnel were dispatched \nshortly before 10 p.m., and they found Hall lying on the ground, \nunresponsive, with a gunshot wound to his head. He was pronounced dead \nat the scene. Hall was the third homicide victim of the year, 31 days \ninto January.\n  A couple of days later about 60 people gathered at the corner where \nHall was shot. He had a lot of family, he had a lot of friends, and \nthey mourned together. His family members and friends remember him as a \nvery kind person. The family says: We don't want retaliation; we want \njustice.\n  Hall's sister Renee Evans said:\n\n       I need people to stop being afraid to say what they see. If \n     you see it, say it; you don't need to give your name. . . . \n     Anyone who knows something should call the police.\n\n  He was a well-liked person all across the neighborhood.\n  Varnouard Hall, shot dead, was 33 years old.\n\n[[Page S844]]\n\n  Durell Patrick Law was killed 10 days earlier in New Haven. He had \njust started attending church regularly, the Faith Revival Temple \nChurch in West Haven. He had gone to one of his first services on \nJanuary 19, and he didn't make it to the next service--not by choice \nbut because he was shot dead on Eastern Street on January 20. This was \nthe city's first homicide of 2014. Mourners packed that church, where \nhe was a new parishioner, to mourn him. They said he was a good man who \nliked to goof around, especially with his many family members.\n  Durell leaves behind a 1-year-old son. He was very active in sports \nin high school, and he was only 20 years old. In high school he had \nparticipated in football and track.\n  Justin Mariano was 29 years old when just before the new year he was \nkilled in Bridgeport, CT. He was shot on the evening of November 9. \nPolice responded to Bridgeport Hospital, where Mariano later died from \nhis injuries. He had just started working at a barbershop called Sharp \nCutz, and he was remembered by the people who worked with him and the \nfolks who trained him at a local cosmetology school as talented, \nbright, and energetic.\n  Jerome Copeland was 22 years old when he was killed on the streets of \nHartford. He was the 16th homicide victim in Hartford when he was \nkilled in the late summer of 2013. A woman who knew him said that ``he \nwas a young father, struggling, trying to make ends meet.'' He leaves \nbehind a son, a brother, two sisters, and a loving girlfriend who \ndescribed him as ``an energetic man who loves music.''\n  When I was at Central High School in Bridgeport a few weeks ago, I \nwas sitting with a group of kids who wanted to see what they could do \nto end the violence on the streets of their city, to feel a little \nsafer when they walked to school in the morning. I asked them all: How \nmany of you know someone--a close relative or friend--who has been \nkilled by guns? They looked at me strangely; in part, because every \nsingle one of them raised their hands. At Central High School you just \naccept at some point before you reach the age of 18 you are going to \nknow somebody--a close friend or relative--who has been killed by guns \nin that city.\n  At a similar meeting of high school students in Hartford, CT, one \nyoung girl said the signs of police sirens at night were her lullaby \ngrowing up. She just knew there was a pretty good chance on any night \nsomeone was going to be killed in her neighborhood and she had come to \naccept the signs of crisis response as just the pitter-pat of raindrops \noutside.\n  To these kids, they look at their lives, in which they fear for their \nsafety when they walk to school, in which they accept the inevitable \nfact they will lose someone close to them over the course of their \nteenage years, and they do not understand the complacency of the \nSenate.\n  A recent study of Cook County hospitals in and around Chicago showed \nof all the people they treated for episodes of violence, nearly half of \nthem displayed signs of PTSD. The fact is, in these neighborhoods, PTSD \nis a reality in the same way it is for our troops who serve us overseas \nbecause they witness horrific acts of violence in neighborhoods that \nare supposed to be safe for our kids. We shouldn't have to compare the \nlevels of PTSD in the neighborhoods our kids transit in the same way we \nlook at PTSD on the field of battle.\n  It is time we did something--whether it is an investment in new \nmental health resources or beefed-up background checks to make sure \ncriminals aren't buying guns or a recognition there are some weapons \nthat probably deserve to be in the hands of the military rather than in \nthe hands of everyday citizens. It is time for us to have an answer. \nThese numbers--31,000, 2,600, and 86--are too high. If the stats don't \ndo it, then hopefully over time the voices of victims will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING NORTH DAKOTA FIREMEN\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Madam President, most of the country watched with a \ngreat deal of interest right before the new year, when we unfortunately \nhad a train derailment in Casselton, ND. What was unique about this \ntrain derailment was that the train that derailed subsequently derailed \nanother train which resulted in a fairly large explosion, which sent \nshock waves through the rest of the country as we started to address \nthe issue of how do we maintain safety on the rails.\n  So we have been having a lot of discussions about what is the \nappropriate level of regulation. We have been having a lot of \ndiscussions about tank cars. The U.S. Department of Transportation has \nbeen meeting with the railroad industry as well as the oil and gas \nindustry trying to assure whatever decisions are made, that they \nenhance safety. But I wish to talk about something that is not about \ngovernment regulation and it is not about long-term strategies, except \nto point out the heroics and the importance of first responders.\n  I rise to honor the heroics of Geoff Andersen, an engineer in \ntraining for the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad, whose bravery \nfollowing the recent train derailment near Casselton prevented the \ndangerous explosions from the crash from spreading even farther.\n  For many of us in the Senate, the Casselton derailment has trained \nour focus on our efforts to improve safety for the rail shipments of \ncrude oil. From increased track inspections to updated tanker car \nstandards, to the consideration of new routing options for crude \nshipments, all angles for improving the safety of crude rail shipments \nare being considered. What we should not overlook in our efforts, \nhowever, is the importance of skillful and well-trained railmen on the \nlines. Railmen such as Geoff Andersen are the backbone of that \nindustry, and when one goes above and beyond the call of duty to \nprevent a disaster from spreading, they deserve to be recognized.\n  On December 30, a grain car carrying soybeans to the Pacific \nNorthwest derailed near Casselton, ND. An axle broke on the car near \nthe middle of the train, forcing the car off the rails and onto the \ntracks of the adjacent line carrying trains in the opposite direction. \nConductor Bruce Anderson and Road Foreman of Engines Paul Douglas \nradioed the emergency to the oncoming train on the opposite track, but \nthere was insufficient time to slow down that train headed their way. \nIn the brief moments following the derailment, an eastbound train \ncarrying crude oil collided with a soybean car lying over the tracks \nand the eastbound train exploded.\n  Following the crash, Geoff and the entire crew of the westbound grain \ntrain sprang into action. Immediately following the derailment, \nConductor Bruce Anderson went back and pulled approximately 50 cars \naway from the fire. Recognizing the fire would soon spread to the \nremaining cars, Geoff worked with Assistant Fire Chief Adrian Kieffer \nto hatch a plan to couple back onto the remaining oil cars and unhook \nthe tanker cars and pull them to safety.\n  Geoff, a former civilian firefighter for the Grand Forks Air Force \nBase, borrowed two radios and fire protection gear from the Casselton \nFire Department. His engineer and trainer, Tom Cooks, jumped into the \nrear engine of the train to reverse the locomotive toward the fire and \nconnected the train to the tanker cars in danger of exploding.\n  Geoff, armed in fire protection gear, walked toward the fire to \nconnect the train to the cars. He then walked even closer to the fire \nto pull the pin on the closest tanker car within a safe distance, \ngetting 25 more cars away from the fire.\n  Remember, these are cars filled with crude oil.\n  Once the pin was pulled, Geoff radioed to Tom to pull the cars away.\n  Because of Geoff's heroics, the danger from the derailment was \nminimized and the explosions were isolated to the tanker cars adjacent \nto the derailment. Had it not been for Geoff, this disaster would have \nbeen much worse.\n  I would like to take this time to thank not only Geoff Andersen but \nall those involved in the response, including Engineer Tom Cooks, \nConductor Bruce Anderson, Road Foreman of Engines Paul Douglas, \nCasselton Fire Chief Tim McLean, and Casselton Assistant Fire Chief \nAdrian Kieffer, for their presence of mind and their decisive action \nfollowing the crash to minimize the danger of this derailment.\n  I rise with some awareness of what firemen do. As attorney general \nfor the\n\n[[Page S845]]\n\nState of North Dakota, I had the pleasure of also being responsible for \nthe fire marshal's office. As somebody in charge of the fire marshal's \noffice, I spent a great deal of time traveling across North Dakota \nvisiting not only with full-time firemen but the wonderful volunteer \nfire offices we have all across North Dakota.\n  I have a special spot in my heart for firemen. My dad was chief of \nthe fire department in Mantador, ND, for years and years, and took that \neffort quite seriously, took the training quite seriously.\n  As we move forward in this discussion of guaranteeing the safety of \ncrude moving on the rails, I ask this body to consider a third prong, \nbeyond simply looking at routing decisions and prevention of \nderailment, and then in the unfortunate incidence, of containment of \nthe consequences of derailment; that is, the importance of training, \nthe importance of doing everything we can to provide the equipment and \nto provide the training and the resources to our first responders.\n  Anyone who doubts the commitment of those first responders to put \ntheir lives in harm's way need only look to the 9/11 responders and \nrealize, if you have worked with firemen, they all knew when they \nwalked into that building their chances of returning were virtually \nnonexistent. Yet they walked into that building in an effort that we \ncan only shake our heads at--the heroics of that effort. Take a look at \nthe heroics of Geoff Andersen and his colleagues in doing everything \nthey could to promote public safety and to guarantee public safety. \nLet's respond with appropriate public policy and appropriate training \nand appropriate resources for our first responders.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I am one of the sponsors of the bill \npending before the Senate at this moment. As we know, the bill is about \nas simple as we can get around this place: a one-sentence measure to \nrestore the fairness to America's military retirees. The bill repeals \nthe COLA cut Congress gave to working-age military retirees when we \npassed the budget just before Christmas.\n  The budget bill had a lot of good provisions and passed with large \nbipartisan support on both sides of the Capitol. It avoided another \ngovernment shutdown. Alaska's delegation was unified in passing the \nbudget bill. It prevented another round of major cuts to Defense \nDepartment and other agencies. It showed the American people that \nRepublicans and Democrats can work together. But it wasn't much of a \nChristmas present for our veterans--the brave Americans who made a \ncareer out of serving their country and, in many cases, putting their \nlives on the line.\n  That budget deal says working-age military retirees will see their \npension COLA adjustments reduced by 1 percent annually. For many this \nis a hit totaling tens of thousands of dollars over years. For some the \ntotal reduction over their lifetime is upwards of $80,000. It is \ncompletely unacceptable. This is why many of us only supported the \nbudget deal because we had already committed to rolling back the COLA \ncut once the deal was completed.\n  The bill before us right now will take care of the problem once and \nfor all. The chief sponsors are Senators Hagan, Pryor, Shaheen, and \nmyself. Many others are coming onboard. In fact, I don't know a single \nMember of this Chamber who opposes making sure our military retirees \ncontinue to receive their full COLA. It is right to do. When these \nheroes signed on to serve and made their military service a career, it \nis what they were promised. They should expect no less now.\n  But I have been around the block a few times and I know what is \ncoming. Many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are going \nto come to this floor and talk a good game. They are going to pledge \ntheir loyalty to the troops, they are going to wrap themselves in the \nflag, and then they are going to pivot. They are going to start \nqualifying things. They are going to say the sky is falling. And they \nare going to say we can only pass this bill if we pay for it. We have \nalready been down that road. Many of us in this Chamber tried to fix \nthe military COLA last month, but our efforts failed in a fight over \nwhat is known around here as a pay-for. Honestly, I am sick of it.\n  The bill before us right now--the bill I proudly sponsor--has no pay-\nfor. Why is that, people ask. Because the men and women of our Armed \nServices have already paid--paid up on their end of the deal--and now \nit is time for us to pay our part.\n  Unfortunately, too many of them have paid the ultimate sacrifice, \nwith their lives. All of them--even those who served, who survived, and \nwere lucky enough to retire--had agreed to put their lives on the line. \nThat is the deal when you sign up to serve this country.\n  So to my colleagues I say, don't come down to this floor and lecture \nme about paying for this bill, because it is a simple thing to do.\n  I have a list right here of Alaskan soldiers who died in battle \nduring the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the wars that weren't paid \nfor. There are 22 names here. Alaska is a small-populated State, so \nevery one of these losses hit us hard.\n  In all, nearly 6,800 American soldiers have died in these 2 wars. \nHalf of these fallen soldiers were between the ages of 18 and 24 years \nold. With permission, I am going to read just a few of the names of our \nfallen Alaskans:\n  TSgt Leslie Williams, Air Force, age 36, Juneau; PFC Adare Cleveland, \nArmy, age 19, Anchorage; SGT Kurtis Arcala, Army, age 22, Palmer; \nMichael Lasky, Marine Reserves, age 22, Sterling.\n  Twenty-two Alaskans have paid the price. Granted, we will never know \nif these brave soldiers would have chosen to make a full career out of \nthe military. We will never know if they would have collected a pension \nfrom the country they served. But this much we do know: Every American \ntroop who is serving right now, especially the career soldiers, signed \non with a promise from the rest of us that in return for their \nsacrifice, their government would take care of them.\n  It is time for those of us in Congress to step up and do that--both \nsides of the aisle on both sides of the Capitol. It is time for us to \npass this bill and to make good once again on our end of a deal.\n  Let me make one point. Our actions so far on this issue are not \ntheatrical. This isn't about some ideological policy debate. By voting \nto reduce the COLA adjustment, we have already impacted real people and \nreal families and created uncertainty in their future. Here are just \ntwo examples of Alaskan constituents.\n\n  A soldier from Anchorage wrote to me and said:\n\n       I myself am on active duty with just over 18 years of \n     service. Maybe I made a mistake by devoting my life from age \n     19 to now to the Air Force.\n\n  He said he has moved six times, has two failed marriages and two \nchildren, one of whom is disabled. He says we changed the rules of the \ngame and now wonders what would have happened if he had chosen college \ninstead of the military. The letter says:\n\n       I can't undo 18 years of service. I can't change my career \n     path. It seems very unfair to be changing our retirement like \n     this.\n\n  Another family from the North Pole up near Fairbanks wrote to me. The \nhusband served 20 years in the Air Force, and their daughter is \ncurrently a major in the Air Force. They were promised benefits for \nlife, such as good health care and retirement benefits with a COLA \nadjustment. The husband could have left sooner and started another \ncareer, but he chose to stay because of the benefits. Their message to \nme was very simple: The vote to reduce the COLA breaks faith with them, \nwith those already retired, and with everyone who has chosen a military \ncareer.\n  And what about those bright young people who are deciding right now \nwhether to sign up and perhaps make a career out of the military? What \nare they thinking about their Congress and their future?\n  We need to fix this, and fix it right now, starting with our vote \nthis evening--not next month, not later\n\n[[Page S846]]\n\nthis spring, not next fall, but right now.\n  I know there is going to be a lot of debate. Hopefully tonight we \nwill see the cloture vote and move to the debate. I know there will be \na list of pay-fors. As I said earlier, the people whom this protects \nand ensures they have a COLA and retirement they can depend on are \npeople who served this country and put their lives on the line. We have \nan obligation--an obligation today, tonight, and tomorrow--to finish \nthis and put their COLA back in place.\n  I know we will hear arguments about the deficit and all these \nexplanations. But I can't say enough about the payment that has already \nbeen made by our military, by the people who served not only on the \nfrontlines but throughout this world, protecting our country. I hope we \nput aside our political debates and our politicking, and get on with \ndoing what is right.\n  When we put this in perspective about the 6,800 who perished in the \ntwo unpaid-for wars--$2 trillion-plus unpaid for--this is a $6 billion \nissue over the next 10 years. It is a small amount to make sure we \nsolve this problem for our retirees.\n  The military coalition--an incredible organization of many of our \nmilitary organizations around the country--has sent a letter today \nsupporting S. 1963, the bill we have up today. So I hope Members on \nboth sides put aside this whole argument on the pay-for and let's get \non with doing what is right with our retirees. They have paid the \nprice, they have served our country, and it is time to pay the bill--\nand that is voting for this piece of legislation tonight, voting to \nclose it in cloture, and then moving on to final passage.\n  I look forward to the debate.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I wish to speak as if in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I see that S. 1963, a bill to repeal \ncertain reductions made by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, is on the \ncalendar. I didn't vote for the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, and my \nno vote was cast for one reason--this so-called CPI-minus-1-percent \ninjustice done to military retirees. Military retirees under the age of \n62--according to this newly passed bipartisan budget bill signed by the \nPresident--will not be able to keep up with the cost of living because \ntheir annual cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, would be reduced each \nyear by 1 percent.\n  I think we have clearly pointed out to the American people the \ninjustice of this provision in the Budget Act. An enlisted person would \nlose approximately $80,000 out of his or her pocket over their \nlifetime. These military retirees have fulfilled every part of their \nbargain. After they have done their share and subjected themselves to \nworldwide duty--perhaps serving in a war zone any number of times--the \ngovernment comes along in the form of this bill and says: We have \nchanged our minds. We are not going to give you your full cost of \nliving. We are going to take a percent of that each year. For officers \nit is even more than $80,000 over their lifetime.\n  I believe most Americans now realize that it was a mistake to do \nthis. It needs to be corrected, and we need to go back and keep our \npromise to military retirees. We have an obligation to do this for our \nmilitary retirees.\n  At the same time, we have an obligation to future generations not to \ngo back on the budget savings that were so hard fought in this budget \nact. I supported the level of budget savings, but I didn't like the way \nthey were done.\n  Time and time again I, along with Senator Ayotte, Senator Graham, and \nothers came to the Senate floor and pointed out that there were other \nways to pay for the savings that needed to be made in the budget. There \nare better ways to do that than taking it out of the hides of the \npeople who volunteered to serve their country in the military.\n  We have a bill, S. 1963, that we will be considering, and it is \nauthored by Mr. Pryor, Mrs. Hagan, Mrs. Shaheen, and Mr. Begich. I like \nthe idea of addressing the problem. There is only one fault in the \nbill. It does not have a pay-for. So of the budget savings that we made \nlast December, some $6 billion of that would simply go away and we \nwould end up spending that $6 billion we were planning to save.\n  Our obligation needs to be to the military people and to future \ngenerations. Why do we need to cut $6 billion? Why do we need to stay \nwith the $6 billion in budget savings? Because we have an obligation to \ndo something about the debt. That was the whole reason for the budget \nbill last December. We are drowning in a sea of debt to the tune of $17 \ntrillion-plus and growing every day. We need to rectify the wrong done \nto military people, and at the same time we need to find the budget \nsavings elsewhere.\n  Today I will vote to proceed to the bill. I will do so in the hope \nthat Republicans and conservatives will be allowed to offer amendments \nin the regular order and find the $6 billion in savings needed over a \n10-year period to pay for this bill.\n  There is a proposal by me, Senator Ayotte, and Senator Graham that \nwould use an Obama administration pay-for to pay for the cost of \nrectifying the wrong to the military retirees. It is a closing of a \nloophole in the U.S. Tax Code. The loophole I am referring to allows \npeople to improperly claim an additional child credit.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated that this change could \nsave approximately $20 billion over the next decade. This was an issue \nidentified by the Obama administration's Treasury Department and their \ninspector general. We are not taking something from the Heritage \nFoundation. This is something by the Treasury Department of the Obama \nadministration and their inspector general.\n  I simply submit this to my colleagues. Let's rectify the wrong done \nto the military retirees and also admit we have an obligation to future \ngenerations and not add to the debt any more than this Congress has \nalready done. We can fulfill both of these obligations today, and the \nway to do it is to vote for cloture on the motion to proceed, which I, \nand I believe many of my Republican colleagues, will do.\n  In return, we ask for regular order on this important bill. Allow \namendments and pay-fors through the Ayotte-Graham-Wicker legislation or \nperhaps through another amendment. If there are Members on the other \nside of the aisle who have a better pay-for, bring that to the floor, \noffer it, let the sun shine on these suggestions, and let the American \npeople know where we stand on righting the wrong and protecting future \ntaxpayers.\n  I say to my colleagues, vote yes on cloture on the motion to proceed. \nI say to the leadership, don't lock it down this time like it has done \nin the past. Don't fill up the amendment tree. Allow Republicans and \nDemocrats--who have other ideas about how to protect our future \ngenerations from a sea of debt--to bring those ideas to the floor, vote \non them, and let the American people see that we can correct this wrong \nto the military without adding $6 billion to the debt.\n  I hope we will have a bipartisan consensus and begin this new year \nwith regular order and allow the elected representatives of the States \nto work their will rather than having deals cut behind closed doors.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending \ncloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 298, S. 1963, a bill to repeal \n     section 403 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013.\n\n[[Page S847]]\n\n         Harry Reid, Mark L.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of S. \n1963.\n  I ask unanimous consent that after my remarks, Senator Brown from \nOhio follow me for a time not to exceed 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, this is a bill Senator Pryor and I have \nintroduced to repeal the harmful cuts to military retirement pay in the \nrecent Bipartisan Budget Act. As the Senator from the most military-\nfriendly State in the Nation, I am pleased that we have just voted to \nadvance this important legislation that will affect so many brave men \nand women from North Carolina and around the country who serve our \nNation in the military.\n  These harmful cuts to military retirement pay were included in the \nrecent bipartisan budget that passed the House and Senate with \nbipartisan support. While I supported the Murray-Ryan budget because it \nrolled back across-the-board sequester cuts that threaten our military \ncapabilities and the safety of our troops, I am opposed to the \nprovisions in this budget that reduce these cost-of-living adjustments \nfor military men and women who have served our country with honor and \ndistinction. Without action these cost-of-living cuts will take effect \nin December of 2015. By passing this legislation this week we can keep \nour promise to our servicemembers and veterans who do not deserve to \nhave their retirement benefits cut.\n  The proposed cuts would affect our current and future retirees who \nare still serving our country on Active Duty. If allowed to remain, the \ncost-of-living cuts would cost a typical retiree over $80,000. In my \nState of North Carolina, close to 90,000 retirees as well as thousands \nof servicemembers still on Active Duty would bear the brunt of these \ncuts.\n  I recently heard from a veteran from Apex, NC, who served in the \nmilitary for 21 years, including two tours in Afghanistan, one in Saudi \nArabia, and one in Korea. He said the cost-of-living cuts changed the \npromise made to his family. After moving 12 times in 21 years, his \nfamily made decisions on where to live, what house to purchase, what \njob to take, and how to save for his son's education based on this \npension income.\n  I also heard from a woman whose husband is an Active-Duty marine \nstationed at Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville, NC. She wrote:\n\n       My husband has served 16 years in the infantry, four tours \n     in Iraq and is preparing to deploy to Afghanistan soon. He \n     has kept his promise to the U.S. and earned his benefits in \n     full. We have lived with long-term separations, uncertainty \n     and financial stress. Please do not add to that. The money \n     may not sound like a lot to some, but it means a whole lot to \n     us.\n\n  Once again, that woman's husband is an Active-Duty marine.\n  This is unacceptable. We have made a commitment to these brave men \nand women, many of whom have deployed multiple times to combat zones \noverseas. We must keep our promises to our servicemembers after they \nhave sacrificed so much for us.\n  These cost-of-living cuts would negatively impact not only individual \nservicemembers but also the military as a whole. I serve on the Armed \nServices Committee. Two weeks ago military leaders testified that \nretirement benefits are an integral part of a servicemember's decision \nto remain in the military or to further reenlist. We cannot overlook \nthe consequences these cuts would have on the retention of \nservicemembers, particularly midgrade officers and noncommissioned \nofficers who are considering the length of their future service, nor \ncan we overlook the effect they would have on the military's long-term \nreadiness.\n  I am pleased that we have acted to prevent the cost-of-living cuts \nfor the most severely wounded military retirees and Survivor Benefit \nPlan recipients, but our bill would go further. This would repeal these \ncost-of-living adjustment cuts for all military retirees. Yes, it is \ntrue that our country faces difficult fiscal challenges. However, we \ncan never balance the budget on the backs of those who have answered \nthe call to duty. We must keep the promises we have made to our \nveterans, who have put their lives on the line to protect us. I urge my \ncolleagues to support our legislation that will ensure current and \nfuture veterans receive the benefits they have earned.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I appreciate the words of Senator Hagan, \nwho has been a leader in the Senate on issues for our veterans, for \ntheir health care and Camp Lejeune and so many other ways, looking out \nfor pensions and health care for those who have earned it and \nsacrificed for us. She, as do I, believes it is an honor to honor those \nwho have sacrificed for us.\n\n\n                           CVS TOBACCO SALES\n\n  Today I was at a CVS drugstore in Lakeland, OH, a city west of \nCleveland, thanking and celebrating, if you will--perhaps a strong \nword--CV's decision they announced last week that they would stop \nselling tobacco products at their 7,000 stores and pharmacies and that \nthey would invest in a national smoking-cessation campaign designed to \nhelp people quit smoking. CVS's CEO said that is ``the right thing to \ndo for customers and our company to help people on their path to better \nhealth . . . Put simply, the sale of tobacco is inconsistent with our \npurpose.''\n  That is good news.\n  In my State one in every five deaths is connected to tobacco. Ohio \nranks sixth in the adult smoking rate, and 16,900 children in Ohio \nunder 18 start smoking each year. The Presiding Officer knows what we \nknow about tobacco. We know that every year in the United States of \nAmerica 480,000 people die of tobacco-related illnesses. Do you know \nwhat else we know? Because 480,000 Americans die from tobacco-related \nillnesses, we know that the big tobacco company executives understand \nthey have to find 480,000 new customers every year to buy their \nproducts.\n  The Presiding Officer knows there is nothing particular about his age \nor\n\n[[Page S848]]\n\nmine, but they do not aim at people such as us. They do not aim at \npeople in their forties, fifties, and sixties to get them to join to \nreplace those 480,000 people who have passed away; they aim at people \nthe age of our pages who are sitting in the well.\n  In fact, they don't aim at only 16- and 17-year-olds, they are aiming \nat \n12-, 13-, 14-, and 15-year-olds.\n  Joining me at CVS today were two young women, Shanisha Collins and \nMelissa Renton. They both smoke and are both working to quit smoking. \nBoth are doing very well as they quit smoking. They both started \nsmoking, they told us, as teenagers, and CVS is working with them in \ntheir smoking-cessation campaign.\n  We were also joined by Michael Roizen of the Cleveland Clinic who has \ndone remarkable work in preventive care in a preventive medical \npractice, if you will, at the Cleveland Clinic. He is a heart doctor \nwho also has done so well in various kinds of care to help people quit \nsmoking, to help people lose weight, and to help people prevent \ndiabetes--all of the preventive care he has worked on.\n  We were also joined by two nurse practitioners, Lauren and Molly, who \nas part of the CVS clinic have helped people do to better manage their \nhealth.\n  The point is CVS has made this decision. It isn't earth-shaking. Half \nof the cigarettes bought today are from gas stations, and that is not \ngoing to change much. Cigarettes are going to be available. It is a \nlegal product. In fact, people should have the right to buy cigarettes \nif they choose to. But the point is tobacco companies shouldn't be able \nto target young people the way they do.\n  We have seen major progress. Fifty years ago the Surgeon General \nissued his groundbreaking report on the health effects of tobacco use. \nLook at the progress we have made. Some 42 percent of adults smoked \ncigarettes in 1965. Today 18 percent of adults smoke cigarettes. It has \nbeen a huge public health victory, and it has been a huge public health \nvictory in small steps and large steps.\n  First, the report was very important. We remember as kids--the \nPresiding Officer is old enough to remember this, as I am--we could \nsmoke anywhere in our society. State governments then began to prohibit \nsmoking in public buildings and then began to prohibit smoking in other \npublicly owned buildings--government buildings. Then people couldn't \nsmoke in public places in many States around the country.\n  We remember people used to smoke on airplanes. Then over time smoking \nwas restricted to, I remember, aisles 18 to 35 or something--so you \ncould smoke if you were in one of those aisles but not in a seat in \nfront of that or behind that--whatever it was. Now smoking is banned on \nall flights. We have seen major progress made.\n  CVS is one step in that. We have sent a group of us led by Senator \nHarkin--Senator Blumenthal has been involved, and a number of others--\nasking the other drugstore chains--Walgreens and Right Aid--to do the \nsame, to quit selling cigarettes there.\n  So we have seen progress, but it is still a major public health \nproblem. In one of the places it is particularly a problem. I said at \nthe beginning of my remarks that 480,000 people in America die from \ntobacco-related illnesses every year--heart diseases, cancer, a whole \nhost of illnesses that are connected to smoking or chewing tobacco. So \nthey aim at children, for sure, with their targeted campaigns, but they \nalso go overseas. The tobacco companies are trying to undermine public \nhealth laws, particularly in poor countries around the world.\n  If someone is a public health official in India, they have to worry \nabout cholera, malaria, TB, HIV/AIDS, child diarrhea. They have to \nworry about all the things that kill people prematurely in that \ncountry. When the tobacco companies come in--whether they are American \ncompanies, British companies or companies from any other country--they \ndon't have much defense against that. That is why I know the Presiding \nOfficer from Indiana has been a real leader in opposing bad trade \npolicy for our country.\n  But one of the elements of a bad trade policy is giving U.S. tobacco \ncompanies too much power to go into far too many of these countries to \ncajole, threaten, and even undermine public health laws.\n  In fact, we have seen in more than one country--thought to be a poor \ncountry, without too many people, and that does not have many public \nresources, and where people are very poor--we have seen tobacco \ncompanies threaten those countries that are about to enact a health \ncare law, and that country backs off because they don't have the \ndollars or the resources to fight the tobacco companies' efforts in \ncourt.\n  We have a lot of work to do.\n  I wanted to share what happened today in Lakewood, OH, with my \ncolleagues, how important it is, and what a huge public health victory. \nAgain, I want to emphasize how successful these efforts to curb the use \nof tobacco are--the greatest preventable killer in the country--and how \nsuccessful we have been. More than 40 percent of people smoked in 1965 \nand today fewer than 20 percent. That is because of a partnership among \ngovernment, local officials, public health officials, the American \nCancer Society, and the American Heart Association. So many of these \norganizations have stepped up in a way that has mattered--the American \nLung Association and others--to protect the public interest and \nespecially to protect children.\n  I applaud the efforts of that company and the efforts of so many of \nmy colleagues who have been working on this issue.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the hard work and \ndedicated service of my friend Pat Mulroy who is retiring from her \nposition as general manager of the Las Vegas Valley Water District and \nthe Southern Nevada Water Authority.\n  In Nevada, as well as much of the Southwest, water is an important \nand scarce resource; and since 1989, Pat has been an unparalleled \nleader for Nevada and the Nation in managing our precious water \nsupplies. I applaud her tremendous abilities and vast understanding of \nour region's water demands, which helped her lead our State through \nunprecedented strains on our water resources.\n  During her time at the water district and the water authority, Pat \nworked tirelessly to invent solutions to solve Nevada's complex water \nproblems and has been instrumental in finding a balance between \nregional growth and water conservation. In a 6-year span, from 2002 to \n2008, the population in the Las Vegas area increased by more than \n400,000 people. Yet Pat's innovative conservation techniques have \nhelped reduce Southern Nevada's water usage by a third.\n  Over the years, I have watched Pat rise to challenge after challenge. \nEarly on, she initiated negotiations with water purveyors in Arizona, \nthen Utah, California, and Mexico. Pat has proven herself as a powerful \nand effective voice for Nevada when negotiating Colorado River system \nagreements, and her strong leadership helped her build unmatched \npartnerships with the States that share the Lower Colorado River Basin. \nThrough Pat's persistence and proactive response to climate change and \nwestern water issues, she has truly helped shape Southern Nevada and \nthe region into what it is today.\n  Pat has received many acknowledgements and awards for her hard work, \nincluding the National Jewish Medical and Research Center's \nHumanitarian Award, the University and Community College System of \nNevada Board of Regents' Distinguished Nevadan Award, and the Public \nEducation Foundation's Education Hero Award.\n\n[[Page S849]]\n\n  Many know Pat as an expert on water issues, but I also know her as \nloving wife to her husband Robert, a devoted mother, and an active \nleader in her community. I think so highly of Pat and believe she has \ndone such important work for our State and our country. She will surely \nbe missed, and I wish her all the best in her future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/10/senate-section/article/S849-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REMEMBERING CAPTAIN JOHN JAMES McGINTY III\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart to \nreport some sad news to my colleagues. John James McGinty III--raised \nin my hometown of Louisville, KY--succumbed to bone cancer on Friday, \nJanuary 17, after 73 years of life. Although his wife Elaine passed in \n1991, he is survived by his sons Michael and John IV. Mr. McGinty was a \nveteran of the U.S. Marine Corps who received the Medal of Honor for \nhis exemplary record of valor in the Vietnam War. Our country owes him, \nas we do all of our veterans, an unimaginable debt of gratitude for his \nservice.\n  John J. McGinty III was born to John and Eve McGinty on January 21, \n1940, in Boston, MA. The family soon moved to Louisville, where John \ncompleted grammar school and began high school. The call to serve his \ncountry, however, rang more loudly and clearly than the school bell. \nAfter a year and a half, he dropped out and enlisted in the Marine \nCorps Reserves in February 1957.\n  John enlisted in the regular Marine Corps the following year. He \nserved as a drill instructor and a brig officer until 1966, when he \nvolunteered for duty in Vietnam. In June of that year he took part in \nOperation Hastings, during which his service to his country would \nextend above and beyond the typical call of duty. Three days into the \noperation, McGinty's company, reduced to a strength of 100 men, was \nordered to withdraw. On July 18, Sergeant McGinty's platoon was \nproviding rear security for the withdrawal when they were attacked by \nwhat was estimated to be 1,000 North Vietnamese soldiers.\n  Amidst the chaos of the attack, two squads from his platoon were cut \noff and nearly surrounded. Sergeant McGinty rushed through the jungle \nunder a hail of gunfire to find his men in dire straits--20 were \nwounded and their medical corpsman had been killed. Showing little \nregard for his own shrapnel wounds to his leg, back, and left eye, \nSergeant McGinty reloaded the wounded men's weapons and, according to \nhis Medal of Honor citation, ``directed their fire upon the enemy.'' \nWhen the attackers inched closer and closer to his men, Sergeant \nMcGinty drew his .45-caliber pistol and killed five enemy soldiers at \npoint-blank range. Then, with enemies at all sides and still taking \nheavy gunfire, he accurately called in naval airstrikes to within 50 \nyards of his position.\n  His actions that day were consistent with the highest traditions of \nthe United States Marine Corps, and at a White House ceremony on March \n12, 1968, President Lyndon Johnson bestowed upon then-Second Lieutenant \nMcGinty the Medal of Honor.\n  Although he retired from the Marine Corps as a captain in 1976, Mr. \nMcGinty continued to work to better the lives of America's service men \nand women. He worked for the Department of Veterans Affairs in various \ncapacities, and along with fellow veterans, made several trips to Iraq \nand Afghanistan to visit with American troops. He would, however, stop \nwearing his Medal of Honor after becoming a born-again Christian in the \nearly 1980s. His son Michael McGinty explains, ``He didn't have a \nproblem with the honor.'' Rather, it was the medal's depiction of the \nRoman goddess Minerva that ran contrary to his deeply held belief that \nthe reason he was still alive is the one true God.\n  Captain McGinty was modest about his own heroic actions. His son \nMichael has said, ``My father used to say that he did what any Marine \nsergeant would have done in that situation.'' There can be no doubt, \nwith his record of valor, however, that CAPT John James McGinty III is \nindeed a hero, and America has lost a hero with his passing. John's \nservice to his country, both as a U.S. Marine and as a private citizen, \nis deserving of the highest praise and respect of this body. Thus, I \nask my U.S. Senate colleagues to join me in honoring and mourning this \nfallen soldier with roots in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. All \nKentuckians, and all Americans, should be honored that he fought to \nprotect us, and grateful for his service and sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/10/senate-section/article/S849-2", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             2014 OLYMPIANS\n\n  Mr HELLER. Mr. President, today it is with great pride I congratulate \nall of the 2014 Winter Olympians, especially Tim Jitloff, David Wise, \nand Chas Guldemond, the three Nevada proudly call their own.\n  A Reno native, Tim Jitloff grew up on skis and has been claiming \ninternational titles since 2005. Tim's unwavering dedication to his \nsport has developed him into a two-time Olympic athlete, qualifying for \nthe Men's U.S. Ski Team for the first time when he was just 19 years \nold. In Sochi, he will compete in Alpine skiing's super combined giant \nand common slalom. Tim's successes extend not only to a first place \nfinish at the 2013 U.S. Championship, but off the snow where he is a \ndetermined advocate in the fight against breast cancer, as his mother \nis a survivor. Tim's passion for service is marked by the respect he \nhas earned on the big snow as well as his earnestness and resounding \nhard work.\n  David Wise's Olympic status begins in the Reno snow where he began \nskiing as a 3-year-old. He turned professional at an early age after \nsecuring his first U.S. national title when he was 15. His wins include \nThe Dew Tour, The Grand Prix, and repeat Winter X Game titles. David \ncontinued his achievements in 2013 when he qualified for his first \nOlympics in this year's debut sport of ski halfpipe. David's dedication \nto his passion, family, and faith personifies a true talent, unmatched \nand inspiring for all of Nevada.\n  Chas ``Chuck G'' Guldemond has been a driving force in snowboarding \nsince moving to Lake Tahoe in 2005. Working a series of odd jobs to pay \nhis own way for the sport for years is just one of the testaments of \ncharacter Chas contributes to the 2014 U.S. Olympic team. Chas has had \nseven healthy seasons of competition and won almost every major event \nin snowboarding since his early days of participating in the sport. In \nSochi, he competes as one of the biggest names in slopestyle. The \ndedication and sacrifices Chas has made in pursuit of his dream are \ncommendable.\n  Steadfast in their training, each one of these athletes reminds us \nthat even the seemingly unfathomable is possible. Our American pride \ngrows stronger as these Nevadans compete in Sochi. It is an honor to \nwatch them and the entire team compete in the name of a United States \nvictory in these 22nd Winter Olympics. I ask my colleagues to join me \nin congratulating these and all of the remarkable athletes on their \naccomplishments thus far. We wish them a safe and gold-winning trip to \nRussia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/10/senate-section/article/S849-3", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S849-S850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO GERARD GRIMALDI\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me \ntoday in honoring the work of Gerard Grimaldi. Gerard has a long \nhistory of public service in Kansas City, stretching back to his time \nserving as an aide to Senator Tom Eagleton and later as an aide to \nCongressman Alan Wheat. More recently, since 2001, Gerard has ably \nserved as vice president of health policy and government relations for \nTruman Medical Centers. Everyone who knows Gerard respects him, and \neveryone who gets to work with him considers themselves lucky.\n  A few years ago, I asked Gerard to serve as my nominee on a volunteer \ncommunity advisory panel for the Bannister Complex in Kansas City, MO. \nThis opportunity required a significant time commitment from Gerard--\ntime he would normally spend with his beautiful wife and four lovely \nchildren--to serve on a panel which offered Gerard no personal or \nprofessional benefit. Not only that, but this panel was created to help \nfacilitate constructive community dialogue around some sensitive issues \nin a very heated environment. But, true to his background as a public \nservant, Gerard didn't hesitate when I asked him to volunteer.\n\n[[Page S850]]\n\n  Gerard not only served on the community advisory panel for over 3 \nyears, but he also was the chair of the panel, heading a diverse group \nof community leaders. This panel worked diligently to facilitate \nconstructive community input and to help ensure transparency by \ngovernment agencies involved in the Bannister Complex environmental \ncleanup and redeployment efforts. The work Gerard and the panel did was \nsuccessful and has now come to an end.\n  In the course of my adult life, I have been fortunate to meet many \noutstanding public servants--men and women who exemplify leadership and \na genuine desire to contribute to the greater good. Of those public \nservants, Gerard is one of the best. I am proud that he is a \nMissourian, and I am honored to be able to recognize him here today.\n  I ask that the Senate join me in congratulating and honoring Gerard \nGrimaldi for his exemplary public service to Kansas City and the great \nState of Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/10/senate-section/article/S850-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    BEAR PAW DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION\n\n Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Bear Paw \nDevelopment Corporation of Northern Montana, which celebrates its 45th \nanniversary this month. Bear Paw Development is a proven leader in \nproviding economic and community development solutions to challenges \nfaced by northern Montana's small businesses and local and tribal \ngovernments. On behalf of all Montanans, I commend Bear Paw Development \nfor its 45 years of outstanding work to build economic momentum and \ninstitutional support to ensure a brighter future for our State.\n  Bear Paw Development Corporation, one of the oldest federally \nrecognized economic development districts in the Nation, provides \ninformation, technical support and hands-on assistance for northern \nMontana, helping business owners and local leaders take hold of their \npotential and build on their success. The dedicated employees of Bear \nPaw Development assist our communities in every aspect of planning and \ndevelopment, from providing business loans and small business \ncounseling to facilitating investment in critical infrastructure \nprojects.\n  As a farmer, I have a special appreciation for their work in value-\nadded agriculture. Bear Paw serves as one of four centers in the \nMontana Food and Agriculture Development Center Network, working with \nfarmers to create greater market access so that Montana agricultural \nproducts can compete on a global scale.\n  Working with local governments, Bear Paw coordinates millions of \ndollars of investment every year into infrastructure. Through the \nconstruction of drinking water systems, wastewater systems, bridges, \nand other community infrastructure projects, Bear Paw's work is vital \nto the residents, communities and businesses of northern Montana.\n  Since the creation of Bear Paw Development's revolving loan fund, \nthey have assisted hundreds of small businesses with their financing \nneeds to either start a new business or expand an existing one. In \ntotal, through more than 330 individual loans, Bear Paw Development has \ndisbursed $21.7 million to businesses in northern Montana, helping to \ncreate or retain a total of over 1,240 jobs.\n  Over the next 45 years, I fully expect Bear Paw Development to \ncontinue its historic and significant success in the areas of business \ngrowth, alternative energy, workforce development, community \nimprovement, and of course, agriculture. Its continued commitment to \nthe economic growth and diversification of northern Montana will \ncontinue to be a shining example of the role economic development \ndistricts can play throughout our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/10/senate-section/article/S850-2", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/10/senate-section/article/S850-3", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/10/senate-section/article/S850-4", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:04 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2954.

   \n\n[Pages S853-S854]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FISCHER (for herself, Mr. King, and Mr. Rubio):\n  S. 2007. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nprovide for regulating clinical and health software, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about rapid \nadvancements in health care information technology or health IT. Health \nIT holds amazing potential to transform Americans' everyday lives for \nthe better. I believe that protecting this kind of exciting innovation \nfrom overregulation and excessive taxation needs to be a high priority.\n  That is why I am introducing the Preventing Regulatory Overreach to \nEnhance Care Technology or the PROTECT Act of 2014. Together with \nSenator Angus King of Maine and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, we are \nputting forward this pro-jobs, risk-based framework governing health \nIT.\n  Before I speak about our bill, I thank my colleague from Maine \nSenator Angus King for joining me in this effort. I am informally \ntelling people that our efforts might be the start of the ``surf and \nturf caucus'' in the Senate, the place where Nebraska and Maine come \ntogether politically to find common ground and work to address real \nproblems in this country.\n  We are able to do so together because Senator King is known as an \nindependent thinker, a problem-solver who isn't afraid to work across \nthe aisle in order to get things done. It is refreshing, and I \nsincerely appreciate his willingness to work with me.\n  I also give special thanks to Senator Rubio for his interest in this \nissue as well. He is also an original cosponsor, and he has worked with \nus on this important topic.\n  What we are trying to do is clarify the Food and Drug \nAdministration's oversight authority over health information \ntechnologies. Under current law dating back to 1976, the FDA can apply \nits definition of a medical device to assert broad regulatory authority \nover a wide array of health IT, including applications that do not pose \na threat to human safety.\n  That means low-risk health IT can be treated like traditional medical \ndevices, subjecting job creators and innovators to these challenges \nthat really don't make sense.\n  The PROTECT Act fixes this discrepancy. The PROTECT Act keeps the \nFDA's resources focused on products that pose the highest risk to human \nhealth. In doing so it also gives regulatory certainty to innovators \nand job creators who are developing these new products that use data \nsafely to improve health care and also to reduce its cost. Furthermore, \nthe PROTECT Act relieves categories of low-risk clinical and health \nsoftware from the 2.3-percent medical device tax. Most importantly, \nthough, it protects and promotes American jobs in a key growth sector \nof our economy.\n  The mobile health and mobile application market is expected to exceed \n$26 billion by 2017, while the U.S. mobile apps economy is responsible \nfor nearly half a million new American jobs. A report from Health Data \nManagement anticipates 23-percent annual growth in this sector over the \nnext 5 years. The FDA highlights on their Web site that 500 million \nsmartphone users worldwide will be using health apps by 2015. The \nmobile analytics platform Localytics, which monitors more than 20,000 \napps, has seen a 19-percent increase in new health and fitness apps in \n2013 from the year prior. That is amazing.\n  But what is even more impressive is the health IT's ability to \nprotect people. Consider the example of a young man named Xavier Jones \nwhose basketball coach downloaded a $1.99 mobile application that gave \nhim a refresher course on how to properly administer CPR. It was a \nskill that came in handy the very next day when Xavier collapsed in the \nmiddle of practice.\n  In 2012 the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs partnered to \nrelease a free Apple and Android app called the Post-Traumatic Stress \nDisorder Coach. PTSD Coach has been downloaded over 100,000 times in 74 \ncountries. It provides reliable information on PTSD and treatments on \nusers' smartphones.\n  Other types of health IT, such as electronic health records and low-\nrisk clinical decision software, can also lower costs and can improve \noutcomes. Some of these technologies hold the power to quickly and \nbroadly disseminate new information about effective\n\n[[Page S854]]\n\ntreatments and recent clinical trials. Patients want their doctors to \nhave access to these cutting-edge therapies. Protecting low-risk health \nIT is about empowering people with access to information. We need to \nprotect that kind of innovation because innovation is an equalizer for \nconsumers.\n  These technological benefits don't stop at our borders. Think about \nthis statistic: One estimate shows that mobile health deployment in \nAfrica could save as many as 1 million lives by 2017. From assisting \nnurses with scheduling to reminding pharmacists to refill their stock \nor even tracking emerging malarial epidemics, mobile health is already \ntransforming the landscape of the developing world in very dramatic \nways.\n  These stories only scratch the surface of where this technology is \ngoing. It is important how we treat innovation here in the United \nStates. Other countries around the world are looking at how our \ngovernment will regulate and oversee these low-risk technologies.\n  Our bill makes it so low-risk, highly innovative clinical and health \nsoftware technologies--and the potential they have to empower people--\nare not undercut by these burdensome regulations. FDA's promise to use \nits enforcement discretion over low-risk health IT only serves to \ncreate confusion and uncertainty in the marketplace. Regulatory \ndiscretion by its very nature is something that can easily change over \ntime, and discretion can be misused or abused.\n  Clear rules should be set because the current FDA regulatory model \nfor medical devices is not well suited for low-risk health information \ntechnologies. In a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing last \nyear, the FDA submitted a letter to the committee that said:\n\n       For 2011 and 2012, the average time for FDA review of \n     medical device submissions that were identified as containing \n     a mobile medical app was 67 days and the average total time \n     from submission to FDA decision was 110 days.\n\n  When regulatory days turn into months, problems are going to persist, \nand that is not something we should leave to discretion. The regulatory \ntime line for risky devices should not be the same for low-risk \nsoftware that gets released every 60 days, has major updates every \nmonth, and sees regular changes every week. Having an approval process \nthat takes longer than the shelf life of the average device operating \nsystem stifles opportunity and it stifles innovation.\n  Innovators, regulators, and consumers need clarity and certainty into \nhow these regulations are going to be enforced. Since mobile wellness \napps and most clinical decision support technologies pose little risk \nto patients, they should not be subject to the same costly painstaking \nprocesses as medical devices. The answer is the commonsense, risk-based \nregulatory approach the PROTECT Act provides. It protects innovation, \nit protects jobs here in the United States, and it protects jobs in \nthis U.S.-based job sector. Most importantly, it protects patient \nsafety by giving the FDA continued authority and oversight over health \nIT that is risky and by creating an appropriate regulatory framework \nfor that which is lower risk.\n  With the introduction of the PROTECT Act, I would also like to \nacknowledge the great work of Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, \nSenator Orrin Hatch of Utah, Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, and \nothers who have undertaken this effort in the past. These Senators have \nhelped to lay the groundwork for the development of a risk-based \nframework for health IT. The ideas included in the PROTECT Act would \nnot be possible without the progress they secured in previous \nCongresses and in the FDA's Safety and Innovation Act.\n  I am committed to working with anyone on these issues to exchange \nviews and to exchange ideas so we can get the right policy balance our \ncountry needs and deserves.\n  Again, I thank my friends Senator King from Maine and Senator Rubio \nfrom Florida for joining me in this important effort. Together, we can \nachieve our shared vision of protecting patient safety, protecting \ninnovation, and protecting U.S. economic job growth and opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to join the Senator from \nNebraska. I love the idea of the surf-and-turf caucus reaching across \nthe country to try to find commonsense solutions. I often think about \nlegislation and what we are attempting to do, and there is an attempt \nto codify common sense, to try to bring to the regulatory process, as \nit deals with medical devices, a little more thoughtfulness and \ncautiousness as it affects health information technology.\n  The first part of the bill actually sets up a process whereby we can \nexamine in a thoughtful kind of way some of these issues to reduce the \nregulatory burden and at the same time foster innovation and, very \nimportantly, protect patient safety. It sets up a process involving the \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology and other parts of the \nadministration so that the regulatory process in this area can be \nrationalized across agencies and better coordinated.\n  The heart of the bill, however, as the Senator just outlined, is our \nattempt to differentiate between medical software, which has a direct \nimpact upon patient health, and software that is more peripheral and \ncan range from the app I have on my iPhone, which is a pedometer that \ntells me how much I have walked each day and how much I should walk \neach day, to the kind of software that is being developed across the \ncountry to assist medical practices in their billing and in the \noperational part of the medical business.\n  I think one of the most important points, as the Senator pointed out, \nis that software evolves almost overnight, and if you go through this \nburdensome regulatory process--whether it is 60 days, 120 days, or 1 \nyear--to get your software approved and then you find there is a bug \nyou have to fix, that could restart the whole regulatory process. So I \nthink we should acknowledge that this is a bit of preemptive \nlegislation because the FDA thus far has not intruded very deeply into \nthis process, and we believe it is important in order to define the \nareas where regulation and the protection of patient safety is \nimportant, but software that manages the billing process of a medical \npractice should not fall into that category and should not be subject \nto that level of regulation. That is really what we are talking about.\n  As the Senator mentioned, this law goes back to 1976. In thinking \nabout 1976, Gerald Ford was President and software was a mink coat. We \nweren't really thinking about what we are doing today, and of course \nthe legislation did not anticipate the kind of intense innovation and \nnew thinking that is going on that is able to protect people's health \njust by giving them information about themselves. No doubt the time \nwill come when a smartphone will be able to do blood pressure or \ntemperature or certainly provide one's heart rate, and that is \ninformation we should have ourselves, not necessarily regulated by the \nFederal Government.\n  I am delighted to join the Senator from Nebraska and the Senator from \nFlorida in introducing this piece of legislation. I think it is \nimportant. It is part of a larger project to try to bring our Federal \nregulatory process into the 21st century where time is of the essence, \ninnovation is at the speed of light, and that we can't burden our \npeople who are creating these innovations with a lengthy and, yes, \nexpensive process that has a tendency to discriminate against smaller \nentrepreneurs and businesspeople.\n  I compliment the Senator from Nebraska for bringing this piece of \nlegislation forward.
