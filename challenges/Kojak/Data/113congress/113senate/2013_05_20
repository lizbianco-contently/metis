Mr. President, Democrats and the tea party-driven \nRepublicans differ on many things, so it is remarkable and encouraging \nto see how well Senator Stabenow and Senator Cochran, the chairman and \nranking member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, worked as a team to \nbring the ag jobs bill to the floor. Their work has been exemplary, \nsome would say old-fashioned--the way things used to be.\n  The committee members included many of the amendments that were \nadopted last year when the Senate considered and passed a farm bill. As \nwe will remember, it went to the House, and of course they did nothing. \nThe committee did this in an effort to expedite the floor process which \nbegins today. I hope their cooperative spirit guides our work on this \nimportant legislation.\n  American farmers are counting on us, but so is the economy. Despite \nuncertain economic times, America's farms and ranches are the most \nproductive in the world, exporting about $150 billion worth of products \nlast year and supporting 16 million private sector jobs. But to keep \nAmerican farms strong, Congress must pass a strong farm bill. The \nlegislation before this body will create jobs, cut taxpayer subsidies, \nand reduce the deficit. The bill includes important reforms to farm and \nfood stamp programs and saves more than $23 billion, which we will use \nto reduce the deficit. It will give farmers the certainty they need to \nmaintain the largest trade surplus in any sector of our economy.\n  Helping American farmers thrive is an important part of our work \ngetting the economy on firm footing again. Again, I commend Senators \nStabenow and Cochran for their leadership on this important issue.\n  While the Senate has taken a lot of bipartisan action on the \nagriculture jobs bill, it has seen no progress on the important budget. \nSenate Republicans still refuse to allow us to negotiate with our House \ncounterparts on a compromise that respects both parties' principles. It \nhas now been 58 days since the Senate passed its budget, 58 days \nwaiting for the Republicans to say: OK, let's try to work out our \ndifferences.\n  They have been talking for a couple of years now: What is wrong with \nthe Senate? We don't follow regular order.\n  What does that mean? We don't follow the principles we have always \nfollowed.\n  They say they want to pass a budget so we can get to regular order. I \nguess they thought we could not pass a budget, because we passed one \nand now they refuse to go to conference. I think the main reason they \nare afraid to do that is that under the rules in the House, if\n\n[[Page S3590]]\n\nwe go to conference, the House Democrats--who are kept out of \neverything--have the right by rule of the House of Representatives to \noffer what they call motions to instruct, to say don't cut Medicare, \ndon't continue to whack little kids who are trying to get an education \nwith the Head Start Program, don't cut NIH programs. They can force the \nRepublicans to vote on that matter. I think that is what it is all \nabout.\n  It has been 58 days since the Senate passed its commonsense, \nprogrowth budget, but my Republican colleagues have objected time and \ntime again to a conference with the House. The only explanation \nRepublicans have given for endless obstruction is this: They refuse to \nnegotiate unless we agree in advance to let them win. I am not making \nthat up. That is true. Republicans refuse to go to conference unless \nDemocrats adopt policies that were soundly rejected by the American \npeople last November. It is a very bizarre way to negotiate. Meanwhile, \nthe country inches closer and closer to yet another crisis--defaulting \non the Nation's legitimate bills. They put off compromise until the \nlast moment so they can use the debt limit as a bargaining chip. They \nhope to exploit concessions such as more tax breaks for the wealthy, \nhurting middle-class families; more concessions in Draconian cuts to \nMedicare, which, of course, hurts the elderly; stark concessions with \ncuts to Head Start, hurting little kids or they hope to extort \nconcessions on more cuts to the National Institutes of Health, which \nhurts us all.\n  In fact, House Republicans met last week to decide what ransom they \nwould demand to avoid a catastrophic default on this Nation's debts. \nOne House Republican called it a laundry list of conditions. On the \nlist--repealing the landmark health care reform. On the list--\nrestricting women's health choices. On the list--more Draconian cuts to \nprograms that are keeping American families strong.\n  Despite the political pain they caused themselves last time they held \nhostage the full faith and credit of the United States, they are again \nheaded down that same path. This time they are suggesting that \ngovernment should skip payments to the troops, to veterans, to Medicare \nrecipients, and more. Why? So we can pay China first. I am not making \nthis up. That is what they want to do. Their plan would hurt our \nnational security, our economic security, and it would not prevent \ndefault. The Republican approach--default on the bills--is \nirresponsible, extreme, and really senseless. By now they should know \nthat it is compromise, not political hostage-taking, that will set our \nNation on the road to fiscal responsibility.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/20/senate-section/article/S3590-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate will be voting \non the confirmation of Judge Michael McShane today to serve as U.S. \ndistrict court judge for the District of Oregon.\n  Judge McShane is a product of the judicial selection committee that I \nhave organized at home in Oregon. Senator Merkley has been in full \nsupport of this effort. Judge McShane is coming forward for \nconsideration by the Senate as a result of the work of that special \njudicial selection committee made up of individuals with a variety of \ndifferent philosophical views, and I am very pleased that the President \nhas seen fit to send Judge McShane's name to the Senate.\n  In a sentence, Judge McShane has a heart for people, a head for the \nlaw, and a high-minded sense of justice. I start by way of saying he \ncertainly has outstanding academic credentials. He was a magna cum \nlaude graduate from Gonzaga University. He attended the Northwestern \nSchool of Law at Lewis and Clark College where he graduated in the top \n10 percent of his class, and his accomplishments in the courtroom have \nearned him very high ratings by the American Bar Association.\n  From an academic standpoint, Judge McShane is clearly qualified for \nthis position. What I feel particularly strongly about--and what was \nevidently very important to our judicial selection committee--is that \nhe has been an extraordinary member of our community.\n  He always steps up when asked to help his community. For instance, he \nstepped up when he was called and asked to be an advocate for inner-\ncity and HIV-positive youngsters. While in these various leadership and \nvolunteer roles, he has always come forward, not just to help but also \nto come up with innovative approaches in terms of his work with kids. \nWe especially see this in his advocacy for at-risk youngsters in the \nJob Corps Program.\n  Judge McShane brings these young people into his courtroom as interns \nto help with the day-to-day operations where they are given the \nopportunity to see the inner workings of our judicial system. In many \ninstances Judge McShane literally guides them through the process and \nsets about to make it possible for them to be involved in ways we \nnormally would not think of when we are looking at the role of a judge.\n  For example, in many cases Judge McShane buys sport coats and khakis \nfor these youngsters who might otherwise feel uncomfortable in a \ncourtroom setting. Judge McShane, in his own words, has been known to \nsay: I want to make sure those young people have a chance to \n``blossom.'' Those are the words he uses. He makes it possible for them \nto get the sport coats and khakis with his own money so they can \nparticipate in this unique training.\n  This past year he was awarded the 2012 Oregon State Bar President's \nPublic Service Award for his service to the community. He is involved \nin the Northwestern School of Law mentoring program, and in 2009 he was \nnamed the law school's Mentor of the Year.\n  Also, through the classroom law project Judge McShane presides over \nSummer Law Camp for inner-city kids. On top of that, Judge McShane \nplays an important role as a foster--and now adoptive--parent through \nthe Oregon Department of Human Services.\n  We looked at that kind of community caring, and we said this is truly \nan exceptional individual. We juxtaposed that wonderful record of \ncommunity service alongside of his legal track record.\n  Judge McShane began his legal career as an attorney with the \nMetropolitan Public Defender's Office in Portland. We all understand \nthe importance of public defenders. In 1997, as a result of his good \nwork, he was appointed by the Oregon Supreme Court as a full-time pro \ntem judge. For the last decade he has been an adjunct professor at his \nalma mater, the Northwestern School of Law at Lewis and Clark College, \nwhere he teaches trial advocacy and the criminal practice seminar.\n  Among the many reasons I believe he is academically and \nprofessionally very qualified to be a judge is because his litigation \nexperience includes both complex criminal and civil cases. He is the \nsenior member of the Multnomah County Circuit Court's Death Penalty \nPanel and presided over more capital cases than any other sitting judge \nin our State. He has been a proven advocate for evidence-based \nsentencing, and he has a proof-based sentencing model for driving under \nthe influence of intoxicants offenders that has now become the standard \nin Multnomah County.\n  It is for all of those reasons--especially his track record in terms \nof community service as well as those outstanding professional \nexperiences starting as a public defender and teaching in the \nclassroom--that I am very\n\n[[Page S3591]]\n\nhopeful the Senate will agree with me on a bipartisan basis that Judge \nMcShane is qualified to serve as the U.S. district court judge for the \nDistrict of Oregon.\n  As I indicated, Judge McShane has a heart for people, a head for the \nlaw, and a high-minded sense of justice. We have a long history in our \nState, as I think the President pro tempore of the Senate is aware, of \nsome of those who have been part of our network of distinguished \njudges, and I have every confidence Judge McShane will join that list.\n  I thank Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member \nGrassley for advancing Judge McShane's confirmation through the \ncommittee. I also wish to thank Leader Reid and Minority Leader \nMcConnell for bringing this nomination to the floor, and I look forward \nto the vote we will have later today.\n  I hope my colleagues, on a bipartisan basis, will vote to confirm \nJudge Michael McShane as U.S. district court judge for the District of \nOregon.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to the consideration of S. 954, which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 954) to reauthorize agriculture programs through \n     2018.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I wish to thank our majority leader, \nRepublican leader, and all the Members for allowing us in the Senate to \nmove forward today on this very important bill. I want to thank my \nranking member Senator Thad Cochran for his friendship and his \nleadership. I want to thank all of the members of the committee for \nworking together to write this important legislation. Also, I want to \nthank our staffs on both sides of the aisle. We have excellent staffs \nwho have worked together, and I know we will continue to work together \nas we move this legislation through.\n  Our bill, the Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013, is \ncritical to the 16 million Americans whose jobs rely on a strong \nagricultural economy. Agriculture has been one of the bright spots as \nour economy is getting back on track. In fact, it is one of the few \nareas where we actually have a trade surplus, where we are exporting \nmore than we are importing. This means jobs for us in America.\n  The farm bill is a jobs bill. It is a jobs bill, a trade bill, a \nreform bill, a conservation bill, and it is a kitchen table bill. \nThanks to the farm bill, families all across America will sit down \naround a table tonight and enjoy the bounty of the world's safest, most \nabundant, and most affordable food supply. Those who need temporary \nhelp to feed their families during an economic crisis will get help as \nwell. This is a bill that reflects our best values as Americans.\n  It is easy to take agriculture for granted. It is easy for many of us \nto forget the food we eat doesn't come from the supermarket, as some \nfolks may think. The food we eat comes from the skill and the efforts \nof the men and women who work hard from sunrise to sunset, day in and \nday out, to put food on our tables. Too often I believe we take them \nfor granted as well. Most of us don't have to worry about how many days \nit has been since the last rainfall or whether it is going to freeze in \nMay after the fruit trees are blooming. Most of us don't have to worry \nabout decisions and weather conditions around the world and how they \naffect our livelihood here at home.\n  That is why we have what we call the farm bill. We have a farm bill \nbecause farmers are in the riskiest business in the world. We saw that \nlast year as our country was in the grip of the worst drought in \ngenerations. We saw this as ranchers had to cull their herds because \nthey couldn't get enough food or water for their cattle. We saw all \nacross the country that farmers lost their crops in late spring freezes \nthat wiped out cherry and apple crops in Michigan and other parts of \nthe country. That is why the top goal of the agriculture reform bill is \nrisk management. We are reforming farm programs, ending direct payments \nand other subsidies that have no relationship to risk and instead \ngiving farmers market-based risk management tools. That is the hallmark \nof this farm bill.\n  We want to make sure a farm that has been passed on for generations \ndoesn't face bankruptcy because of a drought or other events outside \nthe farmer's control. We also want to make sure that when there is a \ndrought we are conserving our precious soil and water resources. When \nit comes to conservation, the farm bill is risk management for the \nwhole country. Conservation programs in the farm bill make sure our \nsoil doesn't blow away and our waters aren't polluted by runoff.\n  In many parts of the country last year we had a drought that was \nworse than the Dust Bowl, but we didn't have a dust bowl. We didn't \nhave out-of-control erosion, and that is because the farm bill did what \nit was supposed to do in conservation. Soil stayed on the ground. It is \neasy to take that for granted as well.\n  The farm bill is our country's largest investment in land and water \nconservation on private lands, and the farm bill gives farmers tools to \nstrengthen wildlife habitat. I had the opportunity this weekend, with \nmy gracious host, the Senator from Mississippi, to visit a wildlife \npreserve program and wetlands preserve program, and Senator Cochran is \nresponsible for those parts of the farm bill. We had an opportunity to \ngo out on a beautiful piece of flat land in the Mississippi delta and \nsee where ducks were coming back, quail were coming back, and habitat \nwas beginning to flourish because of efforts to support these important \nresources for the future. The farmer involved in the property said he \nfelt he was in partnership with the USDA and making a commitment for \nhis children and future generations through conservation. This is a \nreal source of pride for us as we look at this 5-year farm bill.\n  I am pleased the bill before us includes a new historic agreement \nbetween conservation groups and commodity groups around conservation \nand crop insurance. These folks from very different perspectives sat \ndown together, listened to one another, and worked out an agreement \nthat will preserve land and water resources for generations to come.\n  The farm bill helps farmers improve 1.9 million acres of land for \nwildlife habitat. Healthy wildlife habitat and clean fishable waters \nare not only good for our environment but they also support hunting, \nfishing, and all the other great outdoor recreation which benefits our \neconomy and creates jobs. We just plain have fun doing it in Michigan. \nIn fact, outdoor recreation supports over 6 million jobs alone. That is \na big deal.\n  We also continue our support for specialty crops, fruits, vegetables, \nand those crops that make up about half of the cash receipts of our \ncountry. Organic agriculture is a growing part of agriculture. We \nexpand farmers markets in local food hubs to encourage schools and \nbusinesses to support their local farmers by purchasing locally grown \nfood and creating more local jobs. We expand the availability of fresh \nfruits and vegetables that are so essential in schools and community \nfood programs.\n  We also strengthen rural development financing for small businesses. \nOnce you get outside of the cities in Michigan and all across our \ncountry, every single community in Michigan, outside of our big cities, \ngets support for jobs through something we call rural development, \nfinancing for small businesses, for water and sewer projects, road \nprojects, housing efforts for families, a whole wide variety of things \nwe do through this economic arm in the USDA called rural development.\n\n[[Page S3592]]\n\n  We also expand the energy title to encourage support for new jobs in \nbiobased manufacturing, which is an exciting new effort. In addition to \nbiofuels, we now can use agricultural products and byproducts to \nreplace petroleum and other chemicals in manufacturing. There is a huge \nnew opportunity for jobs, as well as supporting our environment by \ndoing these things. There is no doubt that the farm bill is a jobs \nbill.\n  This bill also continues to focus on the issue that has taken so much \nof our time this year, last year, and the year before, and that is \ncutting the deficit and getting our Nation's fiscal house back in \norder. We get rid of unnecessary subsidies such as the Direct Payment \nProgram that sends a check to folks regardless of whether they are even \nfarming a particular crop anymore, streamlining programs to cut \nredtape, and cracking down on fraud and abuse. In fact, we eliminate \nover 100 different programs or authorizations that either were \nduplicating something else or didn't make sense to do anymore. I think \nthat is the way we ought to be cutting spending and creating savings.\n  Altogether, including the cuts that took effect already this year, we \nare able to cut spending by about $24 billion. That is more than double \nthe cuts proposed by the Simpson-Bowles Commission and last year's Gang \nof Six that worked on deficit reduction. And I want to underscore that \nthis is four times--four times--more than is required by the arbitrary \nacross-the-board sequestration cuts. So we in agriculture take a back \nseat to no one in our commitment to doing our part in making tough \ndecisions and setting priorities to reduce the deficit.\n\n  This bill represents the most significant reform of American \nagriculture in decades, in my judgment. We are putting caps on payments \nto farmers and closing loopholes that allowed people who were not \nactually farming to receive payments. We are strengthening crop \ninsurance, which we heard from farmers was the No. 1 risk management \ntool for them. It is important we strengthen it and protect it as we \nmove through this process.\n  The agriculture reform bill includes disaster assistance for our \nranchers and farmers as well who cannot receive crop insurance--\nlivestock owners and others in areas that cannot receive crop \ninsurance.\n  We made sure our food assistance programs are accountable, that there \nis integrity in our programs, so we continue to build on the integrity \nthat is already there by cracking down on abuses and misuse. We made \nsure our changes would not remove one single needy family. It is not \nabout hurting folks, it is about making sure there is not abuse, and \nthat is what we address.\n  Let me say when we look at crop insurance, it is there for disasters \nfor our farmers, and it goes up when there are a lot of disasters. That \nis when there is cost. Then it goes down when things are going better, \nand it is the same for food assistance for families. Costs go up during \nbad times, as we have seen over the last number of years, but now CBO \ntells us those costs are going down. Why? Because the economy is \ngetting better and people are able to go back to work. That is how it \nis supposed to work, and that is how it is working.\n  Last year we in the Senate passed a farm bill with strong bipartisan \nsupport. We didn't take the 16 million Americans who work in \nagriculture for granted, we didn't take our land and water resources \nfor granted, and we stood for families all across the country who had \nfallen on hard times.\n  Unfortunately, at that time the House of Representatives did not \nfollow our lead. They allowed the farm bill to expire at the end of \nlast year, which is why we are here again working through this process.\n  I appreciate the way we have gotten to this point in a bipartisan \nway. We have worked very hard to make sure every part of agriculture is \naddressed in terms of their needs and the risk management tools in this \nbill.\n  I thank my colleague from Mississippi Senator Cochran, who is the \nranking member of our committee. He and his staff have worked \ndiligently and in a bipartisan way, and that has allowed us to get to \nthis point. So I thank him for that.\n  I am looking forward to working with colleagues to pass this bill as \nsoon as possible, and we look forward to working with colleagues on \namendments throughout this week.\n  I see my distinguished colleague, our ranking member, is here, and I \nwill turn to him in just a moment. I do want to place one amendment in \norder at this point, and then we can proceed with our discussions. This \nis an amendment we have cleared on both sides on behalf of Senator \nCantwell.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 919\n\n  Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 919.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Ms. Stabenow], for Ms. Cantwell, \n     proposes an amendment No. 919.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To allow Indian tribes to participate in certain soil and \n                      water conservation programs)\n\n       At the end of subtitle F of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 25___.

Mr. President, I now take the opportunity to turn to my \nfriend, a great agricultural leader in the Senate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am flattered by the kind remarks of the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan and am pleased and honored to serve \nwith her on the Senate Agriculture Committee. She chairs that committee \nwith a sense of responsibility for the subject matter, which is very \nimportant to our Nation's farmers and all consumers in America as well, \nbut also to the fellow members of our committee--Republicans and \nDemocrats--who serve on the committee and who have worked together to \nput a bill before the Senate that continues to authorize programs of \nthe Federal Government that benefit landowners and those who work to \nconserve the resources of soil and water that help nurture our great \nagricultural sector that produces a bountiful amount of fruits and \nvegetables and marketable commodities that are sold in international \ntrade at competitive prices.\n  It is a great success story. I am tempted to say a great American \nsuccess story because it truly is. It is the backbone of our Nation's \neconomy. So it is serious business at the same time it provides jobs, \nfood to eat, grain to harvest, to export, and cotton and the fibers \nthat come from it that clothe and dress millions of people in our \nNation and around the world. So bringing this bill to the floor is a \npoint of achievement, and with gratitude we point out the leadership of \nthe distinguished chairman.\n  We have enjoyed her strong leadership and her keen sense of awareness \nof how to manage legislation such as this and present it to the Senate, \nas she has just done, and that is quite impressive. We are very \nfortunate to have her serving in this capacity.\n\n[[Page S3593]]\n\n  We have recommended a bill that contains some major reforms of the \nfarm programs that come within the jurisdiction of our committee. For \nexample, the bill reduces authorized spending by $24 billion. It \nincludes $6 billion in sequestration cuts. These represent real \nsavings. We know we have been confronting a deficit crisis, a fiscal \npolicy management crisis, and this bill does its part.\n  With the authority it has over the law governing the subject matter, \nwe have moved to eliminate direct payments to farmers, which has \namounted in the past to $40 billion. There are reforms in this \nlegislation of the crop insurance title. The bill recommends adoption \nof reforms that limit payments to producers. Conservation programs have \nbeen streamlined in this legislation and consolidated.\n  The committee has crafted reforms in the nutrition title to eliminate \nwaste, fraud, and abuse in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance \nProgram. These are big challenges, and these challenges have been met \nwith a recognition that there are people who need the support of \nprograms such as this--schoolchildren who are attending school and \ngetting the benefit of a reduced price and, in some cases, free meals \nat school. This has made major contributions to the quality of work and \nthe degree and level of education that children are able to absorb and \nbenefit from, and it is tied to these programs.\n  The committee has dealt with conservation, as I have mentioned, the \nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and throughout the bill we \nsee reflected a broad bipartisan level of support and an approach that \naccommodates interests represented by all the members of our committee. \nSo I think we have produced, with the leadership of the chairman, a \nresponsible but fair bill, and I am pleased to recommend to the Senate \nthat it should approve the bill. It deserves our support.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss one of the most \nimportant and significant reforms of our Nation's agriculture in \ndecades. The Agriculture Reform, Food, and JOBS Act of 2013, known \naround here as the farm bill, is the product of months and months of \npolicy discussions and late-night deliberations, with special thanks to \nthe chairman of the committee, Senator Stabenow from Michigan, and the \nranking member, Senator Cochran of Mississippi. I thank them both for \ntheir good work, and also a special thanks to Katharine Ferguson in my \noffice for her good work on this legislation.\n  There is a reason people across the country--farmers and business \nowners, faith leaders, and county commissioners--are paying attention \nto this legislation. It is a farm bill, it is a food bill, it is a \nnutrition bill, it is an economic development bill, it is a rural \ndevelopment bill, and it is a conservation bill all in one. In my State \none out of seven jobs is related to food and agriculture. To keep our \neconomy moving forward, the farm bill must remain a priority in \nCongress.\n  We did our job last year on this legislation. Unfortunately, the \nHouse of Representatives didn't, but I think this year it will when we \npass overwhelmingly a similar bill to the one which passed by a vote of \n64 to 35 last year.\n  The bill saves more than $20 billion while maintaining important \ninvestments in conservation and nutrition, renewable energy and \nagricultural research, which is so important to my State, to rural \ndevelopment, to broadband, and all that farm legislation can in fact do \nfor rural development.\n  In the last 2 years the Senate has considered reform bills that have \ndone more than any farm bill literally in 20 years. We have eliminated \ndirect payments and recoupled eligibility for crop insurance with the \nexpectation that farmers do right by the land.\n  The work of Chairwoman Stabenow and Ranking Member Cochran in \ncommittee to keep that coalition together, linking crop insurance with \nconservation, was especially important. We set tight limits on the \namount of support any individual producer can receive.\n  There is obviously more that can be done, but this bill takes \nimportant strides in reforming our farm program. It will increase \nefforts to improve water quality in Lake Erie--one of the five Great \nLakes with the greatest body of fresh water anywhere in the world. It \nis even perhaps more important to the State of Michigan, the \nchairwoman's State, than even mine. It will help small towns such as \nBryan, Bucyrus, and Bellaire make strategic economic development \ninvestments to jumpstart their local economies.\n\n  The bill continues efforts to make sure all Americans have enough to \neat and access to affordable, healthy, and fresh food.\n  This is a forward-looking bill, and I was pleased to support it in \ncommittee and hope to work with Senate colleagues of both parties in \nthe coming days to make slight improvements as it moves forward.\n  The centerpiece of the bill's deficit reduction efforts is rooted in \nreform of the farm safety net. The era of direct payments made annually \nregardless of need is over.\n  Across Ohio and the Nation we have heard crop insurance is the most \nimportant tool farmers have for managing risk, so this bill improves \nand preserves crop insurance. We know what that meant last year, \nparticularly as drought hit States such as Ohio and, more severely, \nStates west of my State.\n  Farmers have said they want a leaner, more efficient market-oriented \nfarm safety net. Taxpayers deserve that too. Last year, Senator Thune, \na Republican from South Dakota, and Senators Durbin and Lugar and I \nproposed the Aggregate Risk and Revenue Management Program, ARRM, \nstreamlining the farm safety net to make it more market oriented.\n  Instead, the new Agriculture Risk Coverage Program will work with \ncrop insurance to provide farmers the tools they need to manage risk--\nmaking payments only when farmers need them most. This program is \nmarket oriented, relying on current data. It is more responsive to \nfarmers' needs and is more responsive to taxpayers.\n  The bill reforms a number of longstanding unjustifiable practices. \nFor the first time this farm bill ends payments to landowners who have \nnothing to do with farm management. It ends payments to millionaires \nand puts a firm cap on how much support any farmer can receive from the \ndirect farm support programs each year. This so-called conservation \ncompliance provision reflects a landmark agreement put forward by a \nnumber of key commodity and conservation interests and stakeholders.\n  People who are going to receive federally subsidized crop insurance \nneed to show they are meeting basic conservation requirements. Again, \nthe days of subsidies without conditions and subsidies without \nresponsibility are over. It is an example of what can happen when \ngroups with different perspectives--the commodities farmers and the \nconservationists--come together to listen to each other. By relinking \ncrop insurance subsidies with good environmental practices, this bill \nmakes our farm safety net more defensible and protects our natural \nresources.\n  As I said, this farm bill takes great strides toward better, leaner, \nsmart farm policy, but it is also a work in process. A key difference \nbetween this year's bill versus the one we passed last year is the \ninclusion of the Adverse Market Payments Program--the AMP Program--\nthat, to be candid, is something important to southern growers but not \nin line with what I believe Ohioans want to see and what I hear from \nOhio farmers.\n  I worked closely with colleagues from the middle of the country to \nmake sure this AMP Program is as market-oriented as possible, but it \nwas a battle not wholly won and something I want to see modified. We \ncannot have farm programs in one part of the country become more \nmarket-oriented while others do not.\n  The Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act supports farmers but also \nprovide a lifesaving safety net to American families who have fallen on \nhard times. The SNAP program now serves 47 million Americans, more than \nhalf of whom are children and seniors. Along with unemployment \ninsurance, SNAP is the primary form of assistance we provide Americans \nwho have fallen on tough times. Just understand and be certain that \nmany of these families are people with full-time and part-\n\n[[Page S3594]]\n\ntime jobs who simply do not make enough money to get along.\n  Some of my colleagues will point out the rapid increase in SNAP \nenrollment over the past few years. This is to be expected since it \nmirrors the downturn in the economy, the unemployment levels, and the \nfact that for 10 years most people in this country have not had a \nraise. As costs go up, it hits the lowest income people the hardest. \nThat is the biggest reason people have relied on food stamps. This is \nevidence that SNAP is working. As our economy is recovering, SNAP \nenrollment will decrease.\n  More telling is that today some 50 million Americans still live under \nthe Federal poverty level. The number of Americans who rely on SNAP \ntells me we should not be gutting, we should not be undercutting, as a \nnumber of my colleagues in the House of Representatives want to do. We \nshould not be cutting Federal nutrition programs. What we should be \ndoing is enacting better economic policies that create jobs and reduce \ninequality and enable Americans to put food on the table without \nassistance.\n  This bill cuts $4 billion from SNAP. That is already $4 billion too \nmuch. I appreciate the chairwoman's efforts to make that $4 billion cut \nas painless as possible in terms of benefits SNAP beneficiaries \nreceive. Again, most of these--a huge number of these SNAP \nbeneficiaries are in working families. A huge number of them are \nchildren. A huge number of them are senior citizens. It goes without \nsaying that a bill with the level of the cuts to SNAP--some $20 billion \nincluded in the House bill--will not get my support and will not pass \nmuster in the Senate.\n  While we also work to preserve SNAP, we can make sure our nutrition \nprograms are smarter. The farm bill makes important strides toward \naligning our food and our farm and our economic policy. Agriculture has \nalways been an important engine of economic growth. I said at the \noutset that one out of seven jobs in my State is related to agriculture \nand food. Shortening the supply chain benefits farmers and families, \nmeaning that the more people eat what is grown locally, the better it \nis for the economy, the better it is for their health, and the better \nit is for the environment. It helps keep money in the local economy and \nhelps build the economy, especially of rural communities in my State \nand across the country.\n  This farm bill affects every American every day. It is a deficit \nreduction bill, it is a jobs bill, and it is a bipartisan economic \nrelief bill. I again commend Chairwoman Stabenow and Ranking Member \nCochran for their work in drafting this legislation. I especially \nappreciate the staff of individual members of the committee, their \nstaffs, for their work.\n  I urge my colleagues to work together and break the impasse that \nkeeps us from making progress on this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Before the Senator from Ohio leaves, I want to thank \nhim. He has been an invaluable member of our committee. We would not \nhave the agricultural risk coverage portion and the yield loss coverage \nportion in this bill were it not for his work, he and Senator Thune \nworking together. We used their bill as the basis for this.\n  He has also been the champion of rural development. We have \ninvestments in rural development we would not have had without his \ninvolvement, as well as other efforts in the energy title and \nthroughout the bill. I thank him. We are very lucky to have him as a \nmember of the committee.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up the \nFeinstein-McCain amendment No. 923 and make it pending.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I just \nindicated to the Senator from Arizona that while I have no objection to \nhaving a vote on his amendment, I ask that he not proceed with his \nrequest at this time. We have an amendment that is pending, and we also \nhave a number of crop insurance amendments we want to do together. I \nwill not object to voting on his amendment, there is no attempt not to \ndo that, but at this point I do object to having his amendment as the \npending amendment.\n  I ask my colleague through the Chair if he would be willing to work \nwith us. I will commit to having a vote on his amendment. This is not \nan attempt to not vote on his amendment. The ranking member and I have \ntalked, and we are certainly committed to voting on the Senator's \namendment; however, we would like to have an opportunity to set up how \nwe will be voting on a series of amendments.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, if I heard the Senator correctly, she \ncommitted to a vote on this amendment, correct?\n  Ms. STABENOW. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Does that mean we would vote on this early on?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I don't know the exact timing of the vote. There is no \nattempt to delay. We are just getting started at this point. I will be \nhappy to work with the Senator from Arizona. We are certainly not \ntrying to postpone it to be the last vote. We can certainly do it \nearlier rather than later, but we would like to have some flexibility \nto look at a group of amendments we might vote on which relate to the \nsame subject area.\n  I believe I can speak on behalf of the ranking member in saying we \nare committed to a vote on the amendment and want to work with Senator \nMcCain as to a time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the distinguished manager.\n  Since I have the floor, I would like to make a brief statement about \nthe amendment. I understand the objection, and I would rely on the good \noffices of the manager of the bill, as well as the ranking member, that \nwe would have a vote early on in regard to this amendment and not at \nthe last minute when we are trying to complete the votes on the \namendments to the bill.\n  The amendment by Senator Feinstein and me would eliminate taxpayer-\nsubsidized crop insurance for tobacco. The Congressional Budget Office \nestimates this amendment would save taxpayers $333 million. Again, that \nis the estimate of the Congressional Budget Office.\n  It might surprise Americans to know that despite efforts to end \ntraditional farm subsidies for tobacco producers, government handouts \nfor tobacco lives on in the form of highly subsidized crop insurance. \nSince 2004 we have spent more than $276 million on insurance subsidies \nfor tobacco. This is in addition to the $10 billion financed under the \ntobacco buyout law the Congress passed a decade ago. That law was paid \nfor by assessments on cigarette manufacturers, and it was meant to wean \ntobacco growers from farm subsidies by buying out their growing quotas. \nWell, it turns out that Joe Camel's nose has been under the tent all \nthis time in the form of these hidden crop insurance subsidies.\n  As my colleagues know, crop insurance in general has a dubious \nreputation as a ``safety net'' for farmers because it largely insures \nagainst revenue loss instead of crop loss due to weather or pests. \nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, taxpayers spend about \n$14 billion a year to subsidize about 60 percent of the cost of crop \ninsurance premiums. The Federal Government also reimburses private crop \ninsurance companies for about 25 percent of their ``administrative and \noperating'' costs.\n  We have identified eight types of tobacco that are eligible for crop \ninsurance: tobacco Maryland, tobacco flue cured, tobacco fire cured, \ntobacco dark air, tobacco cigar wrapper, tobacco cigar filler, tobacco \ncigar binder, and\n\n[[Page S3595]]\n\ntobacco burley. All of these crops remain extremely profitable even \nwithout their old farm subsidies.\n  According to reports by the Wall Street Journal and CNBC, tobacco is \n10 times more profitable than corn and most American tobacco is \nexported. In fact, the value of American tobacco is at a 10-year high \nsince Congress ended traditional tobacco subsidies. It makes no sense \nto subsidize tobacco insurance considering how well the free market \nsystem is working for tobacco producers.\n  I will have a longer statement on this, Mr. President.\n  Last year the eight separate tobacco insurance products cost $34.7 \nmillion in taxpayer subsidies. The USDA--Department of Agriculture--\ndata shows that more than $276 million in taxpayer subsidies has been \nspent on this tobacco subsidy program since 2004.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \ncigarette smoking adds $96 billion to domestic health care expenses and \ncosts the American economy $97 billion in loss productivity annually. \nSecondhand smoke adds another $10 billion in health care costs and lost \nproductivity.\n  Clearly, we should be doing nothing to subsidize production of \ntobacco. I am not saying we should ban the growth of tobacco in \nAmerica; that is a decision farmers and the market make. But for us to \ncontinue to subsidize when these enormous costs are borne by the \nAmerican people in terms of our health and our economy--it is time we \nended it.\n  I thank the distinguished manager and ranking member for their \ncommitment to having an up-or-down vote on this amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment this \nafternoon to talk about the importance of crop insurance as a risk \nmanagement tool. I think we will probably have a lot of discussion on \nthe floor about crop insurance, but, as I said, as a matter of policy, \nwe are moving away from direct subsidies. We certainly have not \nsubsidized tobacco growers for a long time, and I would not support \ndoing that.\n  In general, we are moving away from that into an insurance model \nwhere the cost is shared between the Federal Government and growers. We \nwant as many growers as possible to purchase crop insurance rather than \nhave a disaster and then want us to pass a disaster assistance bill. I \nmight add that we didn't have to do that this last time around despite \nthe worst drought in 50, 60, 70 years because the crop insurance worked \nthis last year. Crop insurance covered the losses. It is a very \nimportant public-private sector process and partnership.\n  One of my concerns about carving it up, having limits or removing one \ncrop over another is that we have been moving away from a general \npolicy of insurance. Going down the road, I think that would have a lot \nof implications and farmers in general would have great concern about \nthat.\n  I have a tremendous amount of sympathy and, in fact, agreement with \nthe distinguished Senator from Arizona. I sympathize with what my \ncolleague was saying about tobacco as far as the harm to health and so \non. When we look overall at crop insurance, the good news is that less \nthan 1 percent of that whole program--I think substantially less than 1 \npercent--covers tobacco, so that is a good thing.\n  The larger question for farmers and all of us across the country is, \nAre we going to make a commitment broadly to the No. 1 risk management \ntool for them? Are we going to make sure that as we say we are not \ngoing to do subsidies anymore, we listen to what they are saying about \nhaving a crop insurance system?\n  There are parallels between that and flood insurance. So as people \nare proposing various limits on crop insurance, I think it is important \nto ask would we put that on other types of insurance, such as flood \ninsurance risks or other things. Insurance deals with risks, and it is \nmore about encouraging farmers to have a stake in the game and to be \nable to cover part of that risk with their own dollars rather than \nother types of policies we have debated about subsidies.\n  As we go forward, there will be a lot of different discussions about \ncrop insurance, and I would ask colleagues to join with us in resisting \nefforts to eliminate or limit what is a public-private insurance system \nthat is, frankly, working very well.\n  We are so proud that all of the farm organizations and commodity \ngroups--just about all of them--come together to work with the \nconservation groups and environmentalists. They say that together they \nare going to both support an insurance model--a risk management model \nbroadly as a matter of policy for agriculture--and they are also going \nto support linking that to conservation packages. So as a farmer \nreceives that partnership--the piece we kick in--with that brings a \ncommitment for conservation practices for our land, our soil, our \nwater, and so on.\n  This is very important. This was not the case in the last farm bill \nor the farm bill before. We have not seen that kind of link, and now \nthey have come together and said they support crop insurance broadly as \nan insurance model without limits that have been proposed by various \npeople. In return for that, whether it is a very large farm or a small \nfarm, the broad public benefit of having conservation compliance \noutweighs much of what we are hearing about in terms of the limits \nbeing proposed. In terms of the public good, we should have crop \ninsurance that gives this alliance of crop insurance and conservation \ncompliance.\n  This is a historic agreement, and I stand by that agreement with all \nof the Members. I believe that whether we are talking about large \nfarmers or small farmers, this is a very important policy, and we need \nto have conservation compliance involved across the board in our \nefforts as we expand crop insurance.\n  We will have a lot of discussion and a lot of debate on this issue. I \nthink it is very tempting to look at one particular crop--certainly a \ncrop that has a lot of health risks related to it and that we have a \nlot of concerns about in other venues--and say let's just eliminate one \ncrop.\n  The challenge with that, of course, is as a policy for insurance, \nthere will be deep opposition and concern coming from agriculture--from \nfarmers, large and small, across the country--about starting down that \nroad no matter how noble the cause in terms of the concern about the \nrisks of that particular crop. So we look forward to more discussion, \nbut I think it is very important to put a broad lens on this. We have \nmoved away from subsidies that come regardless of good times or bad, \nwhether they are needed or not, and have moved to a system where we are \nasking farmers to put some skin in the game. We are saying: You have to \nget crop insurance; you have to be a part of paying for it, and you \ndon't get any help unless there is a disaster; there is no payout \nunless there is a disaster. As we move to that broad cornerstone, I \nhope we can keep that in place and not see efforts that will weaken it \naround the edges.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I further ask unanimous consent to \nspeak for perhaps as long as but probably shorter than 20 minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, every week that we are here, I try \nto remind the body of the damage carbon pollution is doing to our \natmosphere and oceans, try to awaken us to our duty. I have done it \nmore than 30 times now. I have tried to kick out the underpinnings of \nany argument that the deniers could stand on.\n\n[[Page S3596]]\n\n  I have kicked out the scientific so-called denial argument, which \nactually properly belongs in the category of falsehood, not argument. I \nhave kicked out the economic denial argument, pointing out that in a \nproper market, the costs of carbon must be in the price of carbon. I \neven tried to kick out the religious denial argument, showing that the \nbelief that God will just tidy up after us, however stupidly we behave, \nruns counter to history and counter to Biblical text.\n  So today let's take a crack at the political argument. How wise is it \nfor the Republican Party to wed itself to the deniers and proclaim that \nclimate change is a hoax?\n  Make no mistake, that is the Republican position. The consensus \nRepublican position and the default Republican position is that climate \nchange is a hoax. It has been said right on this floor and in \ncommittees and, as far as I know, not one Republican Senator has stood \nafterwards in this Chamber to say: Wait a minute. Not so fast. That is \nactually not the case. Any Republican Senator who disagrees, please, \ncome to the floor and articulate a Republican position other than that \nclimate change is a hoax.\n  This Chamber looks relatively empty, but on C-SPAN lots of people are \nwatching, and lots of Republicans are watching. Yet not one Republican, \nover all 30 speeches, has ever gotten back to me, even quietly on the \nside, to say: You know what. This is really getting serious. Let's see \nif we can work on this together.\n  An iron curtain of denial has fallen around the Republican Party. So \nlet me respectfully ask my Republican colleagues: What are you \nthinking? How do you imagine this ends?\n  More than 95 percent of climate scientists are convinced that human \ncarbon pollution is causing massive and unprecedented changes to our \natmosphere and oceans. You want to go with the 5 percent, and you think \nthat is going to be a winning strategy?\n  Moreover, it turns out that a lot of those 5 percenters are on the \npayroll of the polluters. You know that. It is public knowledge. Some \nof those payroll scientists are the same people who denied acid rain, \nwho denied the dangers of tobacco.\n  You still like those odds? Those are the folks to whom you really \nwant to hitch your Republican wagons? You have to know they are not \ntelling the truth. So where does this go? What is the endgame?\n  Our planet has had a run of at least 800,000 years, with levels of \ncarbon dioxide in the atmosphere between 170 and 300 parts per million. \nThat is measurement not theory--800,000 years. Homo sapiens have only \nbeen around for about 200,000 years, so that 800,000 years--8,000 \ncenturies--takes us back a ways. Madam President, 800,000 years, \nbetween 170 and 300 parts per million, and in just the last 50 years, \nwe have blown out of that range and have now hit 400 parts per million \nand climbing. You really want to be on the side of ``nothing is going \non here''? Really?\n  Have you noticed the floods and wildfires and droughts and \nsuperstorms and tornadoes and blizzards and temperature records? Have \nyou noticed those warming, rising seas? Have you noticed species \ninvading new territories and miles of dead pine forests in the Rockies \nand Arctic sea ice disappearing?\n  Do you understand that carbon in the atmosphere gets absorbed by the \nsea and that is a law of science and is not debatable? Do you \nunderstand that because they are absorbing the carbon, the oceans are \ngetting more acidic--30 percent more acidic already and climbing?\n  Do you understand that is a measurement, not a theory? It is one \nthing to be the party that stands against science. Are you really also \ngoing to be the party that stands against measurement? Do you know the \nmeasurement is showing the oceans are not just becoming more acidic, \nthey are becoming more acidic at the fastest rate recorded in a \ngeologic record of 50 million years?\n  Have you not heard about the coral reefs, those incubators of our \noceans, bleaching out and dying off, with almost 20 percent gone \nalready worldwide? If you are a denier, look around. Do you think the \nnews is getting better for you?\n  Let me ask my Republican friends, what is your best bet on whether \nthis climate and oceans problem gets better or worse in the next 20 or \n40 years? Seriously. Your party's reputation is on the line here. All \nthe chips. Tell me how you are going to bet. Do you want to bet the \nreputation of the Republican Party that suddenly this is all going to \nmagically start getting better? Because that is what you are doing \nright now.\n  Let me ask you this: What are the young people of today going to \nthink when they are 37 or 57 and it is worse, maybe a lot worse? What \nare they going to think about the Republican Party then, that you took \nthe 5-percent bet with their futures; that you went with the polluters \nover the scientists? Young people are already out there asking their \nuniversities to divest from coal, as they divested from the evils of \napartheid and the dangers of tobacco. Good luck with the youth vote \nwhen you lock in with the coal merchants. By the way, the youth vote \ngrows. It grows up and it sticks around.\n  How is it going to look for the Republican Party when the historical \nrecords show, because facts have a funny way of coming out, that the \ncampaign to fool the public on climate change was as phony and \ndishonest as the campaign to fool the public on acid rain and the \ncampaign to fool the public on tobacco, when the historical record \ndiscloses that 5 percent wasn't even real, and was actually a scam paid \nfor by the polluters? You, your great party, with young American's \nfutures in the balance, took sides with the scam.\n  If that is the state of play for young voters as they come of age, \nwhy would those young people ever trust the Republican Party on \nanything else ever again?\n  Speaking of taking sides, have you noticed who is left on your side? \nThe Koch brothers, billionaire polluters; the big oil companies, the \nbiggest polluters in the world; the coal barons with their legacy of \npollution, strip mining, mountaintop removal, and safety violations \nthat kill their miners. That is a fine cast to be surrounded by.\n  But wait, you say, there is more. There is the Heartland Institute, \nand the Institute for Energy Research, and the American Enterprise \nInstitute, the American Legislative Exchange Council, and the Heritage \nFoundation. There are many organizations. Right. Like the heads of \nHydra, they may look like many, but, as you know, in reality, it is all \nthe same beast. It is all the same scheme. It is all the same money \nbehind the scheme. You can name those front organizations and many \nmore, but none of it is real. They are all part of the same cheesy \nvaudeville show put on by the big polluters.\n  Do you, I ask my Republican friends, want to lash yourself to that \noperation, to go down with that ship? The great Republican Party, the \nparty of Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt, branding itself as the \none that gave it all to protect a gang of scheming polluters? That is \nwhere you are headed.\n  Look who is on the other side on record against you seeing through \nthat nonsense. How about the Joint Chiefs of Staff, our military \nleaders? How about the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops? How about \nNASA? NASA is driving a vehicle as big as an SUV around on the surface \nof Mars right now. They sent it there. To Mars. They landed it there \nsafely. Now they are driving it around on Mars. Do you think those \nscientists might know what they are talking about? How about every \nlegitimate American scientific professional society, about 30 strong? \nHow about major American corporations such as Walmart, Ford, Apple, \nCoca-Cola? How about global insurance and reinsurance businesses such \nas Lloyds of London and Munich Re, whose businesses depend on accurate \nrisk models?\n  Indeed, today, Frank Nutter, the president of the Reinsurance \nAssociation of America, is reported as saying:\n\n       Insurance is heavily dependent on scientific thought. It is \n     not as amenable to politicized scientific thought.\n\n  So I ask my Republican friends, whose side do you like in this? In \nthis corner, the Joint Chiefs, the bishops, Walmart, Ford, Apple, Coke, \nNASA, 30 top scientific organizations, the top insurers and reinsurers, \nand, by the way, several thousand legitimate others. In that corner, \nthe polluting industry and a screen of sketchy organizations they\n\n[[Page S3597]]\n\nfund. Let's be serious. Do you want to bet the reputation of the \nRepublican Party that the polluters are the ones we should count on \nhere? Because that is what you are doing. For what? To protect market \nshare for the polluters. That is your upside. The reputation of the \nparty hangs in the balance and your upside is market share for \npolluters.\n  Look, I am willing to do a carbon pollution fee that sets the market \nin balance and returns every single dollar to the American people. No \nnew agencies; no new taxes; no bigger government; every dollar back; a \nbalanced market with the costs included in the price the way they are \nsupposed to be, which will make better energy choices, increase jobs, \nand prevent pollution.\n  Yes, that does mean less market share for the polluters as new \ntechnologies emerge--that is actually the point--but every single \ndollar back in Americans' pockets. By the way, three-quarters of the \nAmerican people believe climate change is real and that we need to do \nsomething about it.\n  You may have a question for me: Why do you care? Why do you, Sheldon \nWhitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, care if we Republicans run off \nthe climate cliff like a bunch of proverbial lemmings and disgrace \nourselves?\n  I will tell you why. We are stuck in this together. We are stuck in \nthis together.\n  When cyclones tear up Oklahoma, hurricanes swamp Alabama, and \nwildfires scorch Texas, you come to us, the rest of the country, for \nbillions of dollars to recover. The damage your polluters and deniers \nare doing doesn't just hit Oklahoma, Alabama, and Texas; it hits Rhode \nIsland with floods and storms, it hits Oregon with acidified seas, and \nit hits Montana with dying forests. Like it or not, we are in this \ntogether. You drag America with you to your fate.\n  I want this future: I want a Republican Party that has returned to \nits senses, is strong, and is a worthy adversary in a strong America \nthat has done right by its people and the world. That is what I want. I \ndon't want this future. I don't want a Republican Party disgraced, that \nlets its extremists run it off the cliff. I don't want America \nsuffering from grave, economic, environmental, and diplomatic damage \nbecause we failed, because we didn't wake up and do our duty for our \npeople, and because we didn't lead the world.\n  I do not want that future, but that is where we are headed. I will \nkeep reaching out and calling out, ever hopeful you will wake up before \nit is too late, both for you and for the rest of us.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Before we move on to other business this evening in the \nSenate, I would like to encourage all of our Senators to submit \nwhatever amendments they have so we can begin to work through them. We \nwant to work diligently through the amendments and be able to move, \nobviously, as quickly as possible within reason to be able to put \ntogether votes. We would ask all of our colleagues, if they do have \namendments, to let us know what they are and to file them as soon as \npossible so we can begin working on those amendments.\n  I believe Senator Cochran and I are both in agreement. We are anxious \nto get going and are looking forward to working with colleagues to vote \non and dispose of amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am pleased to join the distinguished chairman.\n  I urge Senators who do have amendments to come to the floor and offer \nthose amendments so we can proceed to complete action on this bill in a \nreasonable amount of time. We don't want to cut everybody off. \nEverybody has a right to be heard on whatever subject they wish to \nbring before the Senate.\n  We do have some Senators whom we know have amendments that are \nrelevant to the issue before us. We are hopeful we can consider all of \nthem and give them the kind of attention they deserve.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/20/senate-section/article/S3597-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3597-S3604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF SHERI POLSTER CHAPPELL TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n                   FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF FLORIDA\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF MICHAEL J.

Madam President, it has now been almost 6 months since \nthe horrible shooting in my State of Connecticut at Sandy Hook \nElementary where 20 6- and 7-year-old children lost their lives, and \nanother 6 adults, who were protecting them, perished as well.\n  We all believed we were going to do something about it here on the \nfloor of the Senate. We thought we were going to come to our senses and \nfinally realize it is in part the laws of this Nation that allow for \nthis kind of senseless killing, whether it be in mass numbers in places \nsuch as Sandy Hook or Aurora or Tucson or at the Sikh temple in the \nState of the Presiding Officer or in just the everyday, average gun \nviolence that has become background noise to this Nation.\n  It is not just about bad people doing bad things; it is also about \nthe laws of this Nation that have allowed for this to happen because we \ndon't have background checks on every gun purchase so that criminals do \nnot get guns. We still allow for dangerous military-style weapons, such \nas the AR-15 and 100-round drums of ammunition to be carried on the \nstreets of this country. We don't even have a Federal law saying it is \nillegal to traffic in guns, taking them out of gun shows and gun stores \nand then going out and selling them on the streets as straw purchasers \nto people who shouldn't have bought them in the first place. We had 55 \nvotes in the Senate to do something about that, but we didn't have 60 \nvotes, which is the law of the land here these days.\n  I have promised to come down here every week and do something rather \nsimple, which is to tell the stories of the dozens of people who are \nkilled every single day by guns, because it is their stories that will \neventually move this place to action. I know this place has enough \nempathy, enough compassion to not be so callous as to allow month after \nmonth to go by and do nothing about the 4,243 people, as of today, \nsince Newtown who have died in this country at the hands of gun \nviolence.\n  Let me cite that number again. Since the massacre at Sandy Hook, \nwhere 28 people died, including the gunman and his mother, 4,243 people \nhave died due to gun violence.\n  I want to spend the next couple of minutes before we get back to the \ndebate on these nominations telling the stories of a few of these \npeople.\n  On May 15, 2013, about a week ago, five different people were shot in \nDetroit. Halfway through May and there have been 73 shootings in \nDetroit, MI. Ten people have been killed, with 8 of the shooting \nvictims being 17 years old or younger.\n  On that day, May 15, five people were shot. A 24-year-old man opened \nfire\n\n[[Page S3598]]\n\nafter a pretty simple verbal altercation on the street. What happened, \napparently, was that one parent of one child told the other kids to go \nhome for some reason. Something had happened at their house. That youth \nreturned to the house with some of his family members, including the \n24-year-old man who got so upset over this simple altercation about a \nmom asking some kids to leave her house that he opened fire, killing \nAllmeter Walls and wounding the others.\n  It was a pretty bloody 24-hour period in Detroit, where 12 people \nwere shot on that day from 6 a.m. on Wednesday until 6 a.m. on \nThursday. There were 73 shootings halfway through May in 1 city alone.\n  On May 15 as well, Newark police said that an 18-year-old high school \nstudent, a senior, at Weequahic High School in Newark, NJ, was killed. \nHe had signed himself out of school because he wasn't feeling well, and \nhe was shot.\n  Councilman Ras Baraka, who is also the principal of another high \nschool, said: ``We are outgunned and outmanned here on the street.'' \nThere are so many guns on the streets of Newark that principals and law \nenforcement feel outgunned and outmanned.\n  Of the young student who was killed, one of his friends said: ``He \nwas a good kid. When he was little, we used to play pool and video \ngames around here.''\n  In Bridgeport, CT, just before sunrise on Mother's Day, police found \n22-year-old Robert Rivera dead in his car from perhaps a dozen bullet \nwounds. ``He was one in a million,'' a friend said. ``No one will ever \nbe like him.'' Chino was his nickname. He was a good kid. His friend \nsaid, ``The good die young here.'' He was 22 years old and was killed \nin a spray of bullets in his car in Bridgeport, CT.\n  These are the ones we don't hear that much about because they are in \nthe local papers. But we know there are also these mass killings as \nwell, and before I yield the floor, I want to talk about a handful of \nvictims from the State of the Presiding Officer who were killed at a \nSikh temple when someone walked in, in August 2012, and opened fire, \nbecause people should know who these victims are as well. There are \nvictims of everyday gun violence, but we have had a string of mass \nshootings in this country which will not end until we do something \nabout it.\n  Paramjit Kaur lived for her children. She spent 11 hours a day, 6 \ndays a week in production at a medical devices firm in order to provide \nfor her children. She was praying inside the temple when she learned of \nthe active shooter outside the temple. Instead of being afraid, she \nshowed great courage, bowed down and prayed one last time before she \nwas shot.\n  Satwant Singh Kaleka was the founder and president of that Sikh \ntemple. He worked 18 hours a day at his family's gas station to provide \nfor his family. His hard work as a small businessman paid off and he \nacquired eight stations by the end of his career. His attempts to \nthwart the gunman with a small dull knife gave the group of women, \nincluding his mother, a chance to escape.\n  Suveg Singh Khattra, a former dairy farmer in northern India, came to \nthe United States for a better life. He was a humble and loving man who \nwas a constant presence at the temple. He was a man of habit, waking \nevery morning at 4:30 a.m. to watch a live broadcast from India and \nengage in readings from the holy book. He died at 84.\n  Prakash Singh was a pious man with a great sense of humor. He stayed \nin the priest quarters in the temple, and was excited about the fact he \nwas about to get an apartment outside the temple. They were due to move \ninto their new home at the end of August, a few weeks after he was \nkilled.\n  Then the two brothers, Ranjit and Sita Singh. They were brothers and \nSikh priests who left their families behind to move to Oak Creek for a \nbetter life. Ranjit was the more outgoing of the two. His \nresponsibility was to take care of every visitor who came through those \ndoors. But his younger brother Sita was just as fun loving and would \nwake up every morning at 5 a.m. to read the Sikh holy book. His \nspecialty was to make sure everyone who walked into that temple had \nenough to eat.\n  All perished at that Sikh temple. These things are going to happen \nagain. There is going to be another mass atrocity. And there will \ncontinue to be these shootings in Detroit and Bridgeport and Newark if \nwe don't do something about it on this floor. I know we have important \nbusiness, whether it be the farm bill this week or our hopeful attempt \nat passing immigration reform, but as soon as that is done, hopefully, \nwe will get to come back to this issue of gun violence, because if we \ndon't these everyday urban stories will mount and there will be another \nmass shooting somewhere across this country.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I would say to my colleague from \nConnecticut: Amen.\n  And I would say to my colleague from Oregon: Thank you for your \ncourtesy in letting me go ahead, in light of the fact we have a Federal \njudge coming up for a vote at 5:30.\n  I am very grateful to the Judiciary Committee--to both the Democrats \nand the Republicans--in allowing us to vote, and I urgently implore we \nconfirm Judge Sheri Polster Chappell to the United States District \nCourt for the Middle District of Florida.\n  While I rise to speak in favor of Judge Chappell, I want to express \nmy concern for the growing partisanship that is dragging down our \nefforts to fill these judicial vacancies across the Nation. In the past \nwe have had qualified consensus judicial nominees who would be \nconfirmed in weeks, if not in days. Unfortunately, even the judicial \nnominees who have the support of both Senators from the State--and \nsometimes, as is the case of Florida where we have the Republican \nSenator, Senator Rubio, and myself, the Democratic Senator--we are \nstill finding the judges are being held up. We are experiencing waiting \nmonths for an up-or-down vote only to then have them confirmed \noverwhelmingly.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. NELSON. Of course, I yield to the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would say to my dear friend, the senior Senator from \nFlorida, I share his frustration. We put these judges through the \nSenate Judiciary Committee often with a unanimous vote and then they \nwait here months and months to get a vote on the floor. As the \ndistinguished Senator from Florida noted, that vote is then virtually \nunanimous.\n  This effort where if somebody is nominated by President Obama they \nmust be blocked, even if it is somebody everyone supports, is totally \nunfair to the President, it is completely unfair to the country, but it \nis devastating to the judiciary because good men and women are not \ngoing to be willing to take nominations or appointments to be a Federal \njudge if they think they are going to wait month after month after \nmonth or even a year before they go on the bench.\n  I appreciate the statement of the distinguished senior Senator from \nFlorida and I share his frustration.\n  Mr. NELSON. I thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. A good \nexample--this isn't even a Federal district judge, this is court of \nappeals--we confirmed the judge 94 to 5, when we finally got a vote. \nThat was Judge Adalberto Jordan, the first Cuban-American-born judge, \nfrom Miami, to serve on the U.S. court of appeals. The Eleventh Circuit \nis one of the busiest circuits in the country. It encompasses the \nSoutheastern United States. He was unanimously reported out of the \nJudiciary Committee, but he was blocked by a filibuster of judicial \nnominees after 4 months of waiting on the Executive Calendar.\n  Obviously, with a vote of 94 to 5, he was eminently qualified. He was \nnot controversial. He had the support of Senator Rubio and myself, a \nunanimous vote in the Judiciary Committee. Yet his nomination was \nfilibustered.\n  In addition, highly qualified district court judge nominees are \nfacing the same partisan delays. Obviously, these nominees ought to get \nconfirmed without the needless obstacles, facing potential cloture \nmotions, just to receive an up-or-down vote. I am told the majority \nleader has had to file cloture on as many as 20 of the Federal district\n\n[[Page S3599]]\n\ncourt nominees since 2009. It is an indication that we are clearly \ngoing in the wrong direction in this Senate.\n  I will give one other example. Here the judge we are about to \nconfirm--and before the chairman came in I thanked him profusely, and \nthe Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, for bringing Judge Chappell \nup for a vote today. There is no controversy over Judge Chappell. She \nhas the support of Senator Rubio and myself. She was voted out of the \nJudiciary Committee twice unanimously. It is a judicial vacancy \nemergency declared in the Middle District of Florida.\n  She is waiting. Today is the 329th day.\n  She was originally nominated during the 112th Congress, but it has \ntaken 329 days to get us to this point today.\n  Judge Chappell earned her Bachelor of Arts degree at the University \nof Wisconsin and her juris doctor at Nova Southeastern University. \nJudge Chappell is serving as a United States Magistrate Judge for the \nMiddle District of Florida, where she has been since 2003.\n  Prior to which she served as a county court judge in the Twentieth \nJudicial Circuit of Florida and she began her legal career as \nprosecutor in Fort Myers. Judge Chappell has also been an active member \nof the community. She has served on the Florida Prosecuting Attorneys \nAssociation, the Domestic Violence Task Force, and the truancy board. \nJudge Chappell is a true public servant and she will make a fine \ndistrict court judge.\n  As of May 20, 2013, according to the United States Administrative \nOffice of the Courts, there are 34 judicial emergency vacancies across \nthis Nation. Florida is home to four empty benches--two in the middle \ndistrict of Florida and two in the southern district of Florida. In \ntotal there are 84 judicial vacancies waiting to be filled and 28 \nnominees stuck in the pipeline waiting for confirmation. These delays \nin filling vacancies mean that courts are overburdened. It also means \nthat our citizens are seeing their day in court delayed.\n  The public is concerned as these delays are further exacerbating the \nproblem facing the courts. In fact, these delays are a scathing \nindictment of the lack of cooperation and growing partisan nature of \nprocess for confirming judicial nominations. These delays undermine the \npublic trust and are illustrative of the stranglehold that partisanship \nhas on Washington and on the rest of the country.\n  We cannot have that. It is time to confirm Judge Polster Chappell and \nmove with purpose on the rest of these nominations so we can get our \ncourts fully staffed and the judicial system working how it is supposed \nto.\n  I again thank the Judiciary Committee for bringing up Judge Chappell, \nbut it cannot keep going on like this. I hope we are going to see some \nreform and movement quickly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Today the Senate will finally be allowed to vote on the \nnominations of Judge Sheri Chappell and Judge Michael McShane. For \nJudge Chappell in particular, this day is long overdue. She was \nnominated almost a year ago, and was one of the 11 nominees who Senate \nRepublicans refused to vote on before the end of the last Congress. \nThey delayed her confirmation even though she had the support of every \nsingle Republican on the Judiciary Committee, and the bipartisan \nsupport of her home state Senators, Senator Nelson and Senator Rubio. \nThey delayed her confirmation even though she is nominated to fill a \njudicial emergency vacancy that has been vacant for over 400 days. When \nI say that President Obama's qualified, consensus nominees have faced \nunprecedented levels of delay and obstruction, this is precisely what I \nhave been talking about.\n  Even the Wall Street Journal has taken notice. In an article last \nweek, Gerald Seib wrote that the obstruction even of consensus district \ncourt nominees is an example of ``the Senate's inability to pull out of \npartisan ruts and get beyond an epidemic of filibusters.'' While only a \nfew years ago Senate Republicans insisted that filibusters of judicial \nnominees were unconstitutional, or that they should be reserved for \n``extraordinary circumstances,'' this article notes that they ``decided \nin recent years that it is acceptable to mount filibusters not only in \nexceptional cases but to stop even the most routine business.'' I ask \nunanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my statement.\n  Senate Republicans claim that they have blocked only two of President \nObama's nominees, but they are not being fair in that characterization. \nThey blocked nominees like Robert Chatigny and Louis Butler by refusing \nto allow the Senate to vote on them. They blocked nominees like \nVictoria Nourse, Arvo Mikkanen, and Elissa Cadish by refusing to return \nblue slips. They even blocked Steve Six by rescinding the blue slips \nafter the nominee had already had a hearing. This reminds me of the way \nthey pocket filibustered dozens of President Clinton's nominees. While \nas Chairman I have protected the rights of home State Senators, that \nright does not extend to allowing them to shirk responsibility for it. \nIn all, President Obama has had a significantly lower percentage of his \ncircuit and district nominees confirmed at this point in his time in \noffice than President Bush did at the same point in his presidency.\n  Senate Republicans who take such pride in the number of nominees \nbeing confirmed this year ignore how many, like Judge Chappell, were \nneedlessly delayed from confirmation last year and what they have done \nduring the last 4 years. That is why even after the 17 confirmations \nthis year, we remain nearly 20 confirmations behind the pace we set for \nPresident Bush's circuit and district nominees, and vacancies remain \nnearly twice as high as they were at this point during President Bush's \nsecond term. For all their self-congratulatory statements they cannot \nrefute the following: We are not even keeping up with attrition. \nVacancies have increased, not decreased, since the start of this year. \nPresident Obama's judicial nominees have faced unprecedented delays and \nobstruction by Senate Republicans. We have yet to finish the work that \ncould and should have been completed last year. There are still a dozen \njudicial nominees being denied confirmation.\n  A recent report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service \ncompares the whole of President Obama's first term to the whole of \nPresident Bush's first term, and the contrast could not be more clear. \nThe median Senate floor wait time for President Obama's district \nnominees was 5 times longer than for President Bush's. President \nObama's circuit nominees faced even longer delays, and their median \nwait time was 7.3 times longer than for President Bush's circuit \nnominees. The comparison is even worse if we look just at nominees who \nwere reported and confirmed unanimously. President Bush's unanimously \nconfirmed circuit nominees had a median wait time of just 14 days. \nCompare that to the 130.5 days for President Obama's unanimous \nnominees. That is more than 9 times longer. Even the nonpartisan CRS \ncalls this a ``notable change.'' There is no good reason for such \nunprecedented delays, but those are the facts.\n  The confirmations in the last few months do not change the reality of \nwhat has happened over the last four years. If a baseball player goes \n0-for-9, and then gets a hit, we do not say he is an all-star because \nhe is batting 1.000 in his last at bat. We recognize that he is just 1-\nfor-10, and not a very good hitter.\n  So while I welcome the confirmations this year, I note both that 13 \nof the 17 could and should have been confirmed last year and that there \nare another dozen nominees pending before the Senate, including two who \nalso could have been confirmed last year. We can and must do more for \nAmericans who look to our courts for justice. They deserve better than \nlong delays and empty courtrooms. With 10 percent of our Federal bench \nvacant, and a backlog of nominees on the Senate Executive Calendar, it \nis clear that the Senate is not doing what it should on nominations.\n  It is also ridiculous to complain that the Senate does not have \nnominees when Mark Barnett, Claire Kelly, Sheri Chappell, Michael \nMcShane, Nitza Quinones Alejandro, Luis Restrepo, Jeffrey Schmehl, \nKenneth Gonzales, Gregory Phillips, Sri Srinivasan, Ray Chen, and \nJennifer Dorsey are awaiting confirmation.\n  In addition, Senate Republicans need to take responsibility for not \nworking\n\n[[Page S3600]]\n\nwith the President to fill vacancies. It is disingenuous of Republican \nSenators not to work with President Obama to pick nominees and then \nblame the President for the lack of nominees. I was interested to hear \none Senate Republican argue that if Senators do not get recommendations \nin ``expeditiously enough,'' the President ``has the prerogative to \nnominate someone and then we have the responsibility to act on it.'' \nBefore President Obama had made a single judicial nomination, all \nSenate Republicans sent him a letter threatening to filibuster his \nnominees if he did not consult Republican home state Senators. So the \nrecent statement was either a complete reversal in position, or baiting \na trap to then block any nominees the President sends to us.\n  Some Republican Senators have been willing to work with the President \nto find nominees in their States. We recently received nominations for \ndistrict court vacancies in Alabama and Tennessee, and I hope to \nschedule those nominees for hearings soon. In Pennsylvania, the \nRepublican Senator is now working with Senator Casey to find nominees \nthat they both support. In fact, three such nominees are pending before \nthe Senate now, and they would fill three of the six current vacancies \nin the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The nominees have been pending \nbefore the Senate for over 2 months after being reported unanimously, \nand I hope Senate Republicans will allow us to complete action on them \nbefore the Memorial Day recess.\n\n  I remain deeply concerned about the impact of sequestration on our \nFederal courts and our legal system. After 4 years in which Senate \nRepublicans have forced our courts to operate shorthanded, with 10 \npercent or more of judgeships vacant, these harsh spending cuts are the \nlast thing we should be doing. I continue to hear from judges and other \nmembers of the legal community about the damage of sequestration.\n  The Judicial Conference, whose presiding officer is Chief Justice \nRoberts, wrote last week to request emergency funding for fiscal 2013 \nin order to ``address critical needs resulting from sequestration \ncuts.'' These indiscriminate cuts have left our Federal judiciary \n``confronting an unprecedented fiscal crisis that could seriously \ncompromise the Constitutional mission of the United States courts.'' \nMembers of the bar have written in support of this request, stating \nthat ``budget cuts have forced diminished court staffing, court \nclosures, compromised security, and lengthy trial delays.'' They \nrightly note that ``it is people's lives that are adversely changed'' \nby these unnecessary cuts. I ask unanimous consent that both letters be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my statement. I hope \nSenators read these letters and take these concerns seriously, and that \nwe can come together to meet our responsibilities to our coequal branch \nand to the 310 million Americans we all serve.\n  Judge Sheri Polster Chappell is nominated to a judicial emergency \nvacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, \nwhere she has been serving since 2003 as a Federal Magistrate Judge. \nPrior to her appointment to the Federal bench, she worked as a Lee \nCounty Court Judge, as an Assistant State Attorney in the Twentieth \nJudicial Circuit of Florida, where she was the first female county \noffice head, and as an instructor at the Southwest Florida Criminal \nJustice Academy. Judge Chappell was reported unanimously last year and \nagain 2 months ago. The Middle District of Florida has a second \njudicial emergency vacancy, and it is unfortunate that the Senate is \nnot being allowed to consider the nominee to that seat, as well. Judge \nBrian Davis received unanimously the ABA Standing Committee on the \nFederal Judiciary's highest rating of ``well qualified,'' and was \nreported favorably almost 1 year ago.\n  Judge Michael McShane is nominated to a judicial emergency vacancy on \nthe U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon. Currently a Circuit \nCourt Judge on the Multnomah County Circuit Court, Judge McShane has \nserved as a State court judge for over 15 years. He previously served \nas a Circuit Judge Pro Tem on the Multnomah County Circuit Court. Prior \nto becoming a judge, Judge McShane spent his entire 9-year legal career \nas a trial attorney in the Metropolitan Public Defender's Office in \nPortland, OR. Judge McShane has the support of his home State Senators, \nSenator Wyden and Senator Merkley, and was reported unanimously by the \nJudiciary Committee over 2 months ago.\n  Senate Republicans have a long way to go to match the record of \ncooperation on consensus nominees that Senate Democrats established \nduring the Bush administration. After today's votes, 10 more judicial \nnominees remain pending, and all but one were reported unanimously. All \nSenate Democrats are ready to vote on each of them to allow them to get \nto work for the American people. We can make real progress for our \nFederal courts and the American people if Senate Republicans are \nwilling to join us.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 14, 2013]\n\n                 Open Judgeships Show D.C. Dysfunction\n\n                          (By Gerald F. Seib)\n\n       Jill Pryor of Georgia and Rosemary Marquez of Arizona \n     aren't exactly household names, but they share a distinction \n     with national importance: Both have been waiting exactly 689 \n     days for the Senate to act on their nominations to become \n     federal judges.\n       Yet they aren't even the most extreme examples of \n     Washington's inability to perform one of its most basic \n     functions, filling the federal judiciary across the land. All \n     told, 85 federal judgeships sit vacant, meaning some 10% of \n     the federal judiciary is empty--and this at a time when those \n     who run the court system think there actually should be new \n     judicial posts created because of an escalating workload.\n       Openings on two of the nation's most important federal \n     appeals courts--the Ninth Circuit in the West and the D.C. \n     Circuit in Washington--have been unfilled since 2005.\n       There is no current nominee for either seat, not since \n     President Barack Obama's choice for the D.C. slot gave up in \n     frustration after Republican filibusters put her nomination \n     in limbo for 2\\1/2\\ years.\n       The Obama administration must shoulder some blame for this \n     predicament. It has been slower than its predecessors to vet \n     and nominate judicial candidates.\n       But the lion's share of the blame lies with the Senate, a \n     body that's becoming an embarrassment to itself and that \n     increasingly infects the rest of government with its \n     paralysis.\n       Traditionally, the first step in the process of picking \n     federal judicial nominees is for senators to recommend to the \n     White House candidates to fill vacancies in their home \n     states; the process slows when home-state senators of \n     different parties can't agree.\n       Senators then can quietly decline to endorse a nominee, or \n     put an unpublicized ``hold'' on nominees they disapprove of, \n     or can stop a nomination by simply threatening a filibuster.\n       In today's partisan environment, all those tactics are at \n     work.\n       ``There always was a bit of back and forth between the \n     parties on nominations generally, and judicial nominations \n     specifically,'' says Caroline Fredrickson, a former Senate \n     aide and now president of the American Constitution Society, \n     a left-leaning organization that tracks judicial nominations. \n     ``But it's become so extreme that I think we are in a \n     completely different situation now.''\n       This problem persists even though the Senate has confirmed \n     more than a dozen judges in the past couple of months. That \n     progress has served mostly to keep the number of vacancies \n     below 100; judges still aren't being confirmed fast enough to \n     keep up with the rate of attrition as older judges retire.\n       In recent days, more attention has been devoted to the \n     Senate's unwillingness to confirm Obama administration \n     nominations for senior executive-branch positions, including \n     Thomas Perez as labor secretary and Gina McCarthy as \n     Environmental Protection Agency administrator. Republican \n     senators have buried the nominees with written questions and \n     refused to show up for committee votes on them.\n       Yet the backlog of judicial vacancies is a more long-\n     standing problem and a better illustration of the Senate's \n     inability to pull out of partisan ruts and get beyond an \n     epidemic of filibusters.\n       Both parties know that, while cabinet secretaries come and \n     go, federal judges stay on the scene for years, even decades. \n     So the party out of power is reluctant to let a president \n     fill the judiciary with nominees of his political persuasion, \n     if leaving the positions unfilled creates at least the chance \n     that the opposition party will be able to put a judge of its \n     liking into place a few years hence.\n       This political temptation wouldn't matter so much if \n     senators hadn't also decided in recent years that it is \n     acceptable to mount filibusters not only in exceptional cases \n     but to stop even the most routine business.\n       Thus, the country now is in the bizarre position of having \n     a chief justice, John Roberts, on the Supreme Court for \n     almost eight years--while his previous position on the D.C. \n     Circuit Court of Appeals has sat empty for the entire time.\n       This problem has been building for years. A recent study by \n     the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service shows that \n     even\n\n[[Page S3601]]\n\n     noncontroversial judicial appointments--those that ultimately \n     got bipartisan support and easily passed the Senate--are \n     having to wait longer for confirmation across the past four \n     presidencies of both parties.\n       As Republicans note, Democrats set the stage for today's \n     problems by filibustering George W. Bush's judicial nominees. \n     Now the problem has grown worse in the Obama years, as \n     Republicans turn the tables and bottle up Democratic \n     nominations.\n       The study found that 35.7% of George W. Bush's \n     noncontroversial circuit-court nominees had to wait more than \n     200 days for confirmation--up from 22.2% for Bill Clinton. \n     During the Obama presidency, that percentage has soared to \n     63.6%. No Obama circuit-court nominee has been confirmed in \n     less than 100 days.\n       What's more, previously only more-sensitive appeals-court \n     nominations were filibustered; now it's also less-sensitive \n     district-court nominations.\n       It has been clear for a while that Washington has trouble \n     getting big things done. Judicial vacancies show it doesn't \n     do the smaller ones so well either.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                          dri,\n\n                                        Chicago, IL, May 16, 2013.\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: The operations of the federal \n     judiciary are essential to maintaining the rule of law in \n     this country, the foundation for much of our economic life. \n     This lies in peril now as budget cuts have forced diminished \n     court staffing, court closures, compromised security, and \n     lengthy trial delays. This, of course, means that justice is \n     delayed. Since criminal trials must take priority, already \n     lengthy delays in civil trials become even longer. Perhaps \n     thousands of businesses will not survive the abeyance of \n     lengthy uncertainty over the outcome of litigation. We talk \n     of the effect on justice, we talk of the effect on businesses \n     but, at bottom, it is people's lives that are adversely \n     changed.\n       The U.S. Judicial Conference and the Administrative Office \n     of the U.S. Courts have petitioned for emergency funding of \n     $73 million that would replace only a small portion of the \n     $350 million in cuts forced upon them by sequestration. The \n     22,000 members of DRI--The Voice of the Defense Bar with one \n     voice wholeheartedly support their petition and urge that you \n     take whatever action is necessary to realize its fulfillment.\n       DRI will remain at the disposal of Congressional and White \n     House leaders to provide any expertise or support needed to \n     move funding forward.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Mary Massaron Ross,\n     DRI President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Judicial Conference\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 2013.\n     Hon. Sylvia Mathews Burwell,\n     Director, Office of Management and Budget, 17th Street NW, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Director Burwell: We write on behalf of the Judicial \n     Conference of the United States to inform the Administration \n     of the Judiciary's decision to seek $72.9 million in fiscal \n     year 2013 emergency supplemental appropriations to address \n     critical needs resulting from sequestration cuts. The \n     supplemental request includes $31.5 million for the Courts \n     Salaries and Expenses account, and $41.4 million for the \n     Defender Services account. In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 1107, \n     we respectfully request that the President transmit the \n     Judiciary's supplemental requirements to Congress promptly \n     and without change. A detailed summary of this supplemental \n     request is included in Enclosure 1. A funding table and the \n     proposed legislative language are included in Enclosure 2.\n       Final enacted appropriations for fiscal year 2013, after \n     sequestration cuts are applied, reduce Judiciary funding \n     overall by nearly $350 million below fiscal year 2012 \n     discretionary appropriations. Emergency measures have been \n     implemented throughout the federal court system to address \n     the drastically reduced funding levels under sequestration, \n     but the federal courts do not have the flexibility to absorb \n     such a large cut. The impacts of sequestration are compounded \n     by the fact that 100 percent of the cuts must be absorbed \n     with only six months remaining in the fiscal year. Unlike \n     some Executive Branch entities, the Judiciary has little \n     flexibility to move funds between appropriation accounts to \n     lessen the effects of sequestration. There are no lower-\n     priority programs to reduce in order to transfer funds to \n     other Judiciary accounts.\n       Section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Act of 1985 allows for statutory spending \n     caps to be exceeded under certain conditions, including if \n     Congress and the President designate funding as an emergency \n     requirement. The Judiciary is confronting an unprecedented \n     fiscal crisis that could seriously compromise the \n     Constitutional mission of the United States courts. We \n     believe our supplemental request meets the threshold for \n     receiving an emergency designation.\n       The Judiciary's emergency actions to date do not constitute \n     a solution to the budget crisis facing the federal courts as \n     a result of sequestration. Instead, these actions represent a \n     conscientious effort to mitigate the adverse impact of \n     sequestration on court operations in an attempt to ensure \n     continued access to justice for the citizens of this country. \n     However, sequestration cuts have created an unprecedented \n     financial crisis that is impacting all facets of federal \n     court operations.\n       Finally, we note that Executive Branch agencies with \n     criminal justice responsibilities have had the flexibility \n     and resources to address their fiscal year 2013 sequestration \n     cuts. As a result, these agencies--which directly impact the \n     workload of the Judiciary--have been able to avoid furloughs. \n     While the Judiciary has the authority to transfer funds \n     between appropriation accounts, it does not have the \n     available funding flexibility needed to do so. Instead, we \n     must ask Congress to approve a supplemental appropriation.\n       Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions \n     regarding this supplemental appropriations request.\n           Sincerely,\n     Julia S. Gibbons,\n       Chair, Judicial Conference, Committee on the Budget.\n     Thomas F. Hogan,\n       Secretary, Judicial Conference of the U.S.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Summary of Judiciary Fiscal Year 2013 Emergency Supplemental Request\n\n\n                      COURTS SALARIES AND EXPENSES\n\n       The Courts Salaries and Expenses account funds the bulk of \n     federal court operations including the operations of the \n     appellate, district, and bankruptcy courts, and probation and \n     pretrial services offices. This account was cut $239 million \n     below fiscal year 2012 levels under sequestration. Given the \n     decentralized nature of the federal court system, individual \n     courts will decide how to absorb the majority of cuts \n     required by sequestration. To mitigate the impact of \n     sequestration on employees, the courts have slashed non-\n     salary budgets but even with these reductions, on a national \n     level, up to 1,000 court employees could be laid off over the \n     remainder of the fiscal year and thousands of employees face \n     furloughs. These staffing losses will come on top of the \n     nearly 2,200 probation and pretrial services officers and \n     clerks' office staff the courts have already lost since the \n     end of July 2011, a 10 percent loss of staff. Cuts to clerks' \n     office staffing will result in the slower processing of civil \n     and bankruptcy cases which will impact individuals, small \n     businesses, and corporations seeking to resolve disputes in \n     the federal courts.\n       Sequestration cuts will also impact public safety. Our \n     probation and pretrial services officers are federal law \n     enforcement officers that supervise defendants awaiting trial \n     and offenders on post-conviction release. Cuts to officer \n     staffing levels mean less deterrence, detection, and response \n     to possible resumed criminal activity by federal defendants \n     and offenders in the community. In addition, funding to \n     support GPS and other electronic monitoring of potentially \n     dangerous defendants and offenders has been cut 20 percent. \n     Equivalent cuts to funding for drug testing, substance abuse \n     and mental health treatment of federal defendants and \n     offenders have also been made, increasing further the risk to \n     public safety.\n       Of the $31.5 million in fiscal year 2013 supplemental \n     funding requested for Courts Salaries and Expenses, $18.5 \n     million will be used to avoid further staffing cuts and \n     furloughs in clerks of court and probation and pretrial \n     services offices during the fourth quarter of fiscal year \n     2013. This funding will save the jobs of approximately 500 \n     court employees and avoid 14,400 planned furlough days for \n     3,300 court employees. The remaining $13.0 million will \n     restore half of the sequestration cuts to drug testing, \n     substance abuse, and mental health treatment services for \n     defendants awaiting trial and offenders released from prison. \n     Timely diagnosis and treatment of drug and mental health \n     conditions is critical to defendants/offenders successfully \n     completing their terms of release and ensuring community \n     safety.\n\n\n                           DEFENDER SERVICES\n\n       The Judiciary's Defender Services program provides \n     financially eligible federal defendants with defense counsel \n     and related services that, under the Sixth Amendment and the \n     Criminal Justice Act, the government must fund in order to \n     prosecute cases. Program costs are essentially comprised of \n     compensation to federal defender organization (FDO) staff, \n     payments to private ``panel'' attorneys, case related \n     expenses (expert witnesses, interpreters, investigations, \n     etc.), space rent, and other fixed costs. Consequently, the \n     primary options for absorbing the $52 million sequestration \n     cut are reducing FDO staffing levels and/or deferring \n     payments to private panel attorneys. Reducing FDO staff \n     results in appointments being shifted to panel attorneys thus \n     increasing those costs, and deferring panel attorney payments \n     into fiscal year 2014 only adds to fiscal year 2014 \n     appropriations requirements. Absent supplemental funding, the \n     Judiciary will need to suspend payments to private panel \n     attorneys for the last 15 business days (3 weeks) of the \n     fiscal year, and FDOs will need to further reduce costs \n     through staffing cuts and by furloughing employees for a \n     national average of approximately 15 days for the remainder \n     of the fiscal year.\n\n[[Page S3602]]\n\n       We are aware that the U.S. Department of Justice is not \n     furloughing staff so we anticipate the pace at which criminal \n     cases requiring appointment of defense counsel will continue \n     unabated, while resources in the Defender Services program \n     are diminishing. Between October 2012 and April 2013, FDOs \n     downsized by 113 employees and other employees were \n     furloughed. Further FDO cuts and the anticipated suspension \n     of panel attorney payments will create the real possibility \n     that panel attorneys may decline to accept Criminal Justice \n     Act appointments in cases that otherwise would have been \n     represented by FDOs. Delays in the cases moving forward may \n     result in violations of constitutional and statutory speedy \n     trial mandates resulting in criminal cases being dismissed.\n       Of the $41.4 million in supplemental funding requested for \n     Defender Services, $27.7 million is required to avoid \n     deferring payments to private attorneys for the last 15 \n     business days (3 weeks) of the fiscal year. To address \n     staffing losses, $8.7 million is needed to avoid further \n     staffing cuts and furloughs in FDOs during the fourth quarter \n     of fiscal year 2013. This funding will save the jobs of \n     approximately 50 employees and avoid 9,600 planned furlough \n     days for 1,700 FDO employees. The remaining $5.0 million is \n     for projected defense representation and related expert costs \n     for high-threat trials, including high-threat cases in New \n     York and Boston that, absent sequestration, the Defender \n     Services program would have been able to absorb without the \n     need for supplemental funding.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                             FEDERAL JUDICIARY--FY 2013 SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS REQUEST\n                                                                         [$000]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                              FY 2012                                         FY 2013\n                                                         -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                  Appropriation Account                       FY 2012      FY 2013 Full       FY 2013         FY 2013         FY 2013         FY 2013\n                                                              Enacted      Year CR (P.L.

I yield to my distinguished colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I rise to speak to the nomination of \nMichael McShane to serve on the U.S. district court of Eugene. Judge \nMcShane is an exceptionally qualified nominee and will make a terrific \naddition to the Federal bench in Oregon. Over his entire career, Judge \nMcShane has demonstrated a tremendous commitment to the law, to public \nservice, and to our State.\n  He came to Oregon 30 years ago to serve communities through the \nJesuit Volunteer Corps. The Jesuit Volunteer Corps, known as JVC, is \nfolks, often graduating from college, who dedicate 1 year of direct \nservice to the poor, simple living, and spiritual community. They work \nin locations such as food banks and local church programs, to work with \nat-risk youth and work of this nature. They work directly to help make \nthe world a better place and do so in an exceptional manner. Anyone who \ncomes out of college and dedicates 1 year to such an effort certainly \nstarts in a very sound place.\n  Since that time, Judge McShane has remained deeply dedicated both to \nOregon and to serving those in our society most in need. After \ngraduating from Lewis & Clark Law School, Judge McShane went to work as \na public defender in Portland. For more than 10\n\n[[Page S3603]]\n\nyears, he represented those who otherwise would have no voice in our \nlegal system. After his time as a public defender, he went to work on \nthe circuit court, first as a judge pro tem and then simply as a judge.\n  In the approximately 15 years he served on the circuit court, Judge \nMcShane has developed an excellent reputation for fairness, \nthoroughness, and accuracy.\n  He also continued to serve in the community as a foster parent and \nadjunct law professor at Lewis & Clark College. In one letter of \nsupport I received, a member of the Portland law community summed up \nhis nomination by saying:\n\n       What stands out to me is that Judge McShane lives and \n     conducts his personal life with the same integrity, honor, \n     compassion and diligence as he displays as a judge.\n\n  Judge McShane will make an excellent addition to the U.S. district \ncourt. I urge my colleagues present tonight to join in support for his \nnomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before we vote on the nominees today, I \nwant to update my colleagues on where we stand with judicial \nconfirmations. After tonight, the Senate will have confirmed 190 \ndistrict and circuit nominees; we have defeated two. That's 190-2; \nwhich is a .990 batting average. That is an outstanding record. Who can \ncomplain about achieving 99 percent?\n  So far this year, the Senate has confirmed 17 nominees. Today, if \nJudge Chappell and Judge McShane are confirmed, we confirm the \neighteenth and nineteenth nominees. At this stage in President Bush's \nsecond term, only 4 were confirmed. That is a record of 19 to 4.\n  This President is being treated exceptionally fairly.\n  The President has recently submitted a few new nominations. I know I \nhave been reminding him that we can't do anything about vacancies \nwithout him first sending up nominees.\n  But again, even with the recent nominations, 58 of 82 nominations \nstill have no nominee. And for judicial emergencies, only 6 of 32 \nvacancies have a nominee.\n  So I just wanted to set the record straight before we vote on these \nnominees. I expect they will both be confirmed tonight and I \ncongratulate them on their confirmations.\n  Judge Chappell received her B.A. from the University of Wisconsin--\nMadison in 1984 and her J.D. from Nova Southeastern University Law \nSchool in 1987. Upon graduation, Judge Chappell became an assistant \nState Attorney in the Fort Myers Misdemeanor Division. In 1988, she \nbegan prosecuting felony cases including crimes against children, \ndrugs, property crimes, and crimes against persons. In 1991, she was \npromoted to office head of the Hendry and Glades County office where \nshe prosecuted cases and supervised the attorneys, secretaries, and \ninvestigators. From 1993 until 1998, she acted as the supervisor of the \nFort Myers Circuit Court Trial Division where she served as chair of \nthe hiring committee and created a training course for new assistant \nstate attorneys. From 1998 to 2000, Judge Chappell served as the office \nhead of the Charlotte County office.\n  In 2000, Judge Chappell was appointed by then-Governor Jeb Bush as a \nLee County Court judge for the Twentieth Judicial Circuit. In 2002, she \nwas elected to serve a 6-year term for this position. There, she had \njurisdiction over misdemeanor cases and civil disputes involving \n$15,000 or less. She resigned in 2003 due to her selection as a United \nStates magistrate judge for the Middle District of Florida. There she \nhandles criminal and civil dockets.\n  According to her questionnaire, Judge Chappell has presided over \napproximately 519 cases that have gone to verdict or judgment.\n  The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary gave her a Unanimous ``Qualified'' rating.\n  Judge McShane received his B.A. from Gonzaga University in 1983 and \nhis J.D. from Northwestern School of Law at Lewis and Clark College in \n1988. For the first 9 years of his law career, Judge McShane worked as \na public defender in Portland, OR, representing indigent clients facing \ncriminal prosecution, the majority accused of felonies. During this \ntime, he held the positions of Senior Felony Attorney and Misdemeanor \nSupervisor. According to his questionnaire, as a practicing attorney, \nJudge McShane tried over 500 trials to verdict.\n  In 1997, Judge McShane was appointed as a Multnomah County Circuit \nCourt judge pro tem by then-Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court, \nWallace Carson. He presided over misdemeanor trials, criminal \narraignments, traffic matters, stalking protective orders, probation \nhearings, small claims, and forcible entry and detainer matters.\n  In 2001, Judge McShane was appointed to the Multnomah County Circuit \nCourt by then-Governor John A. Kitzhaber. In 2002, he was elected to \nthe position and re-elected in 2008. He served as a trial judge with \ngeneral jurisdiction and presided over criminal and civil matters. In \n2012, he was assigned to the family law bench. According to his \nquestionnaire, Judge McShane has presided over thousands of cases, of \nwhich approximately 1,600 cases went to verdict.\n  The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary gave him a Majority ``Qualified'' and Minority ``Well \nQualified'' rating.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cowan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, we yield all time on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is, \nWill the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Sheri Polster \nChappell, of Florida, to be United States District Judge for the Middle \nDistrict of Florida?\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Donnelly). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from North Dakota (Ms. \nHeitkamp), the Senator from Louisiana (Ms. Landrieu), the Senator from \nNew Jersey (Mr. Lautenberg), and the Senator from Arkansas (Mr. Pryor) \nare necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nLouisiana (Ms. Landrieu) would each vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Mr. President, I rise today to reiterate my strong \nsupport for Tom Perez, a man eminently qualified to serve our country \nas the next Secretary of Labor.\n  I am pleased that the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee voted last Thursday to favorably report Mr. Perez's \nnomination to the full Senate. But we must remember this step forward \ncame only after weeks of delay.\n  This is the week we should have been on this floor debating and \nvoting on the confirmation of Tom Perez, but we are not. Instead, \ndelaying tactics on this and other nominees have now needlessly, \npointlessly pushed this debate into next month.\n  Let me state for the record that the obstruction we have seen thus \nfar in the confirmation process is completely unacceptable and, for the \nsake of the American people, for the sake of good governance, it must \nend.\n  It does not stop at the Department of Labor. Republicans have refused \nto take up nominees at the National Labor Relations Board, threatening \nthe operation of this critical agency. It appears any agency that \nstands up for workers' rights is under attack. Let's just do the job \nthe American people sent us here to do.\n  Tom Perez is a quintessential public servant, but apparently that is \nnot enough for my colleagues on the other side. He is a consensus \nbuilder, but that is not enough. As secretary of labor in Maryland, he \nbrought together the chamber of commerce and Maryland labor unions to \nmake sure that workers received the level of wages and benefits they \ndeserved and that businesses had the skilled workforce they needed, but \nthat experience of bringing both sides together is not enough. It is \nnot enough that he is the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil \nRights Division of the Department of Justice, where he increased \nprosecutions of human trafficking by 40 percent, won $50 million for \narmed services members whose homes were improperly foreclosed on while \nthey served, and settled the three largest fair lending cases in the \nhistory of the Fair Housing Act, recovering more money for victims in \n2012 than in the previous 23 years combined. But none of those \naccomplishments on human trafficking, on servicemembers, on people who \nwere abused in fair housing--that is not enough. It is not enough that \nhe spent his entire career in public service. It is not enough to be a \nBrown University graduate or have a master's in public policy from the \nKennedy School or a juris doctorate from Harvard Law.\n  The truth is that my friends on the other side are looking to block \nhis nomination because Tom Perez is not enough of a Republican to pass \nmuster. He is too much of an advocate for people with disabilities, \nachieving the largest ever disability-based housing discrimination \nsettlement. He is too much of a civil rights champion. He obtained the \nfirst convictions under the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Hate Crimes \nPrevention Act. He has been a strong supporter of ending discrimination \non the basis of sexual orientation. They seem to hate the Civil Rights \nDivision, but who could deny the importance of their work?\n  Tom Perez is just too much for my friends on the other side who want \nto block this nominee and insist on obstructing, obfuscating, and \npoliticizing everything that comes before the Congress. The fact is \nthat this is not even about Tom Perez. It is about rendering government \nhelpless and standing in the way of any effort to govern.\n  Tom Perez is a good man. He is qualified and competent. He is a \nprofessional public servant nominated by the President and already \nconfirmed by the Senate to the post he holds today. I endorsed Tom \nPerez after meeting him. I continue to stand firmly by him as a \nnominee. But what I will not stand for is Republicans blocking his \nnomination for no valid reason, without any real objection, only an \nideological objection to allowing this President or this Congress to \ngovern or to at least select a Cabinet that will help us do so, and in \nthis case particularly the Department of Labor that stands for working \nmen and women of this country.\n  I said, when the President nominated him, he was an outstanding \nnominee to be the Secretary of Labor. He has ``dedicated his career to \nchampioning the rights of workers and all Americans, and I am confident \nhe will continue to do the same if confirmed.''\n  I also marvel that I listen to all the election postmortem about how \nthe Republican Party has to reach out to Hispanic Americans in this \ncountry, how they have to do a better job of engaging them and selling \ntheir vision of America. This is the President's first nominee for this \nsecond term of a Hispanic American who is eminently qualified.\n  To try to stop this nominee is reverting back to the same old failed \npolitical strategies during the last election. It is unfortunate that \nthe President's first Hispanic choice for his second-term Cabinet comes \nunder such attack, no valid attack. It does not have to be that way. \nMr. Perez deserves an up-or-down vote, and he deserves to be swiftly \nconfirmed as the next Secretary of Labor.\n  To my friends on the other side, I would say to you it is time to \nstop the obstructionism. I would say to you the empty rhetoric and \nbaseless objections to Tom Perez's nomination are not going to serve \nyou well in the Hispanic community. You should allow, as I have heard \nso many times--give us an up-or-down vote--an up-or-down vote. Working \nfamilies in this country, those who depend upon the Labor Department to \nhave a sense of fairness and justice, deserve an up-or-down vote. \nHispanic Americans who want to see someone from that community \nrepresented in the President's Cabinet want to see an up-or-down vote. \nThat is what justice would be all about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Before my friend from New Jersey leaves the floor, I wish \nto thank him for leading a letter regarding this important nomination. \nWe need a Secretary of Labor. We had a wonderful Secretary of Labor, \nHilda Solis. The reason it is so essential is we\n\n[[Page S3605]]\n\nnow see that the middle class is essentially collapsing, even though we \nare coming out of the worst recession since the Great Depression \nbecause of the leadership of our President and those of us who tried to \nhelp him. We need a head of the Department of Labor to make sure \neverybody gets a fair chance. I wish to thank my friend. He makes a \nvery important point about Republican obstructionism.\n  After the election, they sat around, all of them, and said: Oh, my \ngoodness. We have to do better with Hispanics. We have to do better \nwith women.\n  Who are the two people they are holding up with all their might at \nthis point--and I hope they end it--Mr. Perez and Gina McCarthy, a \nwoman who deserves a promotion just as Mr. Perez deserves a promotion. \nThey can say all they want that they are reaching out to minorities and \nwomen, but then they are blocking promotions of people who are \noutstanding Americans. I wished to say that before my friend left the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/20/senate-section/article/S3605-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3605-S3609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FACING THE ISSUES\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are focused \non several issues, which they call scandals. I would like to address \nthose and then talk about issues that seem to be falling through the \ncracks while they focus on ``gotcha'' politics; they are going to get \nthe President.\n  I think we will start with the IRS. It is wrong to target any group \nfor scrutiny whether they are on the right or on the left, if it is a \ntea party group or a liberal church. We have seen this with the IRS \nover the years. As a matter of fact, I looked back to see how many of \nmy Republican friends stood up and talked about going after the IRS and \nstraightening them out when they went after the NAACP or when they went \nafter a liberal church in Pasadena in Congressman Schiff's district. \nThe fact is they got exercised when they went after the tea party. OK. \nI hear you. I am with you. What is important is so is the President.\n  If this President says: I agree with you, they say: We didn't hear \nyou.\n  They just want to fight. I have friends where sometimes we are having \na debate, and all of a sudden a bright light goes on and I will say, \nyou know what, I think you are right. Sometimes they keep on arguing.\n  The President said this is an outrage, and he has already made sure \npeople are being fired. We are going to make sure we straighten things \nout at the IRS.\n  Let's focus on how to fix it, not how to make it into a ``gotcha'' \npolitical issue. We also have Republican outrage over the Justice \nDepartment seeking the phone records of the Associated Press.\n  I, myself, believe freedom of the press is one of the most important \nfreedoms we have. I don't like to see phone records of reporters \nsubpoenaed in secret.\n  I was once a reporter and had a lot of confidential sources. I wrote \nfor a very good weekly magazine called the PacificSun. I did indepth \nstories on all kinds of issues. People would talk to me, and they knew \nI would never say who they were and who was giving background.\n  The thought of having the government take a look at these records \nwithout telling the press is bad. Guess what. The President agrees it \nis bad. The President said we need a law, a media shield law. Guess \nwhat else. We had a vote on this in 2008. It was 51 to 43 with all \nDemocrats supporting the media shield law and all Republicans, save 5, \nvoting to filibuster, so the bill was killed.\n  How do they then say this is horrible when they themselves, \nRepublicans, blocked us from protecting the media?\n  I believe this is an important issue we should work on together, but \nit shouldn't be made into a political ``gotcha.'' We should fix it and \nmove on. Let's take up a media shield law again. This time the \nRepublicans shouldn't filibuster since they are all over this question, \nand let's get going.\n  Then we look at Benghazi. I am on the Foreign Relations Committee. I \nsit next to the chairman. I sat next to John Kerry. I sat through all \nthe hearings where Hillary Clinton, the Secretary of State, said: This \nwas a tragedy. These were my friends who were killed. I take full \nresponsibility.\n  She ordered an independent investigation. It came back and guess what \nit said. We need to spend more defending our outposts.\n  Guess who started cutting embassy security, who initiated it. The \nRepublicans in the House.\n  I think if they are looking to blame someone, why don't they look in \nthe mirror for starters.\n  Again, let's fix the problem. I am supporting a bill that will \nauthorize funding for key items identified by the independent review \nboard Secretary Clinton put together. It will deal with a number of \npieces they recommend. It requires, among others, detailed reports from \nthe State Department on how they are progressing toward implementing \nthe recommendations, and it requires the identification of the most \nhigh-security threats.\n  I understand why we would look at losing four brave Americans as a \ntragedy. It is a tragedy. Don't politicize it.\n  Where were the Republicans when we lost 4,000 Americans in Iraq, \ninjured 10 times as many. Where were they? Where was their indignation \nat that? Based on false premises, that war was a war of choice, not a \nwar of necessity.\n  We have all of this swirling around Washington and we look at the \nAmerican people and we say what is it they want us to do. Sure, we \nshould conduct oversight. I am all for it. Let's solve those problems, \nbut let's move to the issues that matter.\n  I will tell you what matters most in California: jobs, jobs, jobs, \nthe economy, the economy, the economy. We just moved off a double-digit \nunemployment rate. For the first time in a long time we are below 10 \npercent. It means we have to keep our eye on this economy. We have to \nmake the investments that matter. Restore some of the mindless cuts \nthat were made with the sequester while we see this deficit going down.\n  That is another point. All the howling from the Republicans about how \nthis President doesn't care about deficit reduction, we are witnessing \ndeficit reduction. We are witnessing the housing market come back. We \nare witnessing a lot of good. Just think of what we could witness if we \ncame together, sat down with this President and inked a whole new plan \nfor this economy, for deficit reduction.\n  We have to do the farm bill. We just did the water resources bill. \nLet the House get it done. We did the Marketplace Fairness Act. Let the \nHouse get it done.\n  Republicans, I say to them--they are not here--rhetorically, help us \npass a budget. They are blocking the budget. They went around the \ncountry campaigning against Democrats saying we didn't pass a budget. \nThen we passed a budget and now they will not finish the job, which \nmeans making sure we get conferees appointed. Bring the two bills \ntogether, the House and the Senate, compromise on that, and get the \nbudget done. There is no budget. They will not let us do it.\n  Endlessly, they bash the President. Immigration reform, my colleagues \nare doing an incredible job in the Judiciary Committee, very \ndifficult--sensible gun laws, background checks, things that matter to \npeople.\n  Working on the farm bill, I hope we get it done this week. Last time \nit died in the House. I have a message for my House friends. Please, do \nyour oversight but do something for the people that they are asking us \nto do. Get a budget, get a farm bill, get a Marketplace Fairness Act. \nWork on restoring the mindless cuts so we can have more jobs. These are \nthe things that have to be done. Background checks. We didn't get it \nhere. It was very close. It would be great if they did something in the \nHouse.\n  This week I believe we are voting on Richard Cordray to head the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau. We have to protect the middle \nclass.\n  Today I read the paper about some new instrument that has been \nthought of by Wall Street that would go to people and say give us the \nproceeds of your pension plan, and we will give you a lump sum. Maybe \nthat is great, but it sounds risky to me. We need someone who is out \nthere protecting the consumers, particularly in banking and housing. I \nhope we get Richard Cordray done.\n  I thought Senator Menendez was brilliant the way he explained why \nThomas Perez deserves to be head of Department of Labor.\n\n[[Page S3606]]\n\n  I wish to spend a couple of minutes on Gina McCarthy. She has a \nhistory of bipartisanship. She worked for not one, not two, not three \nbut four Republican Governors: Republican Governor of Connecticut Jodi \nRell, Republican Governor of Massachusetts Paul Cellucci, Republican \nGovernor of Massachusetts Jane Swift, Republican Governor of \nMassachusetts Mitt Romney. She worked for four Republican Governors. \nShe is not enough qualified for my friends on the other side. She was \nconfirmed here without a dissenting vote for her current position. What \nmore do they want? She worked for four Republicans and one Democrat, \nBarack Obama. What more do they want?\n  This is what Christie Todd Whitman said about the Republican boycott: \nThey walked out. They have since returned to the table. I was happy, \nbut when they walked out of that meeting, they didn't come to the \nmeeting, and we couldn't mark her up the first time we tried. She said: \nThey looked like sore losers when they walked out. If they don't object \nto the person and what they have done in the past, and they don't with \nGina, then they have even less grounds to hold up this nominee.\n  Jane Swift, who was a former Republican Governor of Massachusetts, \nsaid it was disgraceful.\n  I don't get it. Ms. McCarthy answered 1,000 of their questions. Then \nwhen I approach my friends on the other side and say, you asked her a \nthousand questions, their answer was: Well, we only cared about five. \nThen why did you ask her a thousand questions? She had to sit there, \nexhausted, answering every single question.\n\n  Now Senator Vitter says I don't know what I will do. I might let it \ngo and not filibuster, but then I might filibuster or I might wind up \nvoting for her. Well, you know, the time for all this contemplation has \npassed. The woman is qualified. The President deserves his Cabinet, he \ndeserves an EPA Administrator. He made a bipartisan choice in Gina. \nGina was brilliant when we had our hearing. Enough already. Please, it \nis time to have a vote up or down on Gina McCarthy.\n  We have a lot of work to do. I mentioned a few. How about the latest \nthreat from the Republicans? They decided they are not sure they are \ngoing to raise the debt ceiling so they now have a bill where they lay \nout who would get paid first when we default on our debt. And guess \nwhat, America: It is not you. It is China. Before we pay America's \nbusiness or American bondholders, we are going to pay China.\n  So when you look at where we are going with this debt ceiling, the \nlast time they held it up it cost us $19 billion--$19 billion over 10 \nyears--because they played games, even though when Ronald Reagan was \nPresident he said: Don't even go there. Of course, I am paraphrasing. \nBut he said even the thought of not raising the debt ceiling and not \npaying our debts is dangerous for our Nation.\n  Yet now the Republicans have a bill that we call ``Pay China First.'' \nThat is what it is about. They would pay China and other foreign \nbondholders before we pay our troops, our disabled and retired \nveterans, doctors and hospitals that treat Medicare patients, and \nbefore we pay American businesses that are contractors.\n  I understand they had a meeting to discuss this further, and they \nwere so excited about it--what hostages they could hold--they talked \nabout proposals that threaten a woman's right to choose, tax breaks for \nthe wealthy, and repealing ObamaCare. They have already tried it 37 \ntimes. And cutting Medicare.\n  What are they thinking over there? Pay our bills. Don't let this \ncountry's credit be downgraded again.\n  I tell you something, if that is what they do, they do not deserve to \nget their salary. I have a bill that would say if we default on our \nobligations by not raising the debt ceiling we should give up our pay. \nI don't know what they are doing over there other than playing \npolitics, and it is dangerous.\n  We know they do not care for our President, but he is the President. \nShow a little respect for the office. Show a little respect for what he \nhas on his shoulders. Show a little respect for what he has already \naccomplished, and accept the fact that when there is trouble he doesn't \nhide in the corner. He says: You are right, I want to fix it. Let's fix \nit together.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  I have gone over just some of the issues we have to look at, but I am \ngoing to close with one very big issue that no one, except a handful of \nSenators, seems to care about, and that is climate change.\n  I have to say it is shocking to me that as this planet enters a \nplanetary emergency, where we are as close as we can be to carbon \nconcentrations of almost 400 parts per million, which is the danger \nzone, I still don't see anyone here saying to me, as chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, let's get a bill to the floor. \nOh, no. Oh, no. So we are burning up.\n  I am going to read a little bit from what I thought was a very well-\ndone piece in Politico, and I am going to read parts of it, but I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record the entire Politico \narticle I am about to read from.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From Politico Pro, May 10, 2013]\n\n               Scientists Alarmed As CO2 Passes Threshold\n\n                         (By Andrew Restuccia)\n\n       The amount of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the \n     atmosphere passed a symbolic milestone this week, scientists \n     announced Friday, reaching levels that haven't prevailed on \n     the Earth since long before human civilization began.\n       The long-expected announcement by the National Oceanic and \n     Atmospheric Administration--that CO2 concentrations had \n     finally hit 400 parts per million at a key measuring station \n     in Hawaii--means little by itself. But it's a sign that time \n     is slipping away to head off or lessen the rising sea levels, \n     worsening storms, species die-offs and other fallout from \n     global warming, scientists and climate activists warned.\n       Still, there are few signs that Washington will emerge from \n     its deep snooze on the issue.\n       Congress remains unable to pass serious legislation to \n     tackle climate change. Efforts to reach a major binding \n     international climate change treaty have sputtered. And while \n     the Obama administration has made some strides in lowering \n     greenhouse gas emissions, including increasing fuel-\n     efficiency standards for cars, climate experts say much more \n     needs to be done--and fast.\n       ``We've never been here before, certainly not while human \n     beings were on the planet,'' said Melanie Fitzpatrick, \n     climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, \n     estimating that it's been 3 million-5 million years since the \n     planet has had such high carbon dioxide levels.\n       ``The carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere is \n     like the thermostat in your house. Every time you turn it up, \n     we are essentially turning up the heat in the planet,'' said \n     Jon Hoekstra, chief scientist at the World Wildlife Fund. \n     ``We're essentially baking ourselves in, perhaps quite \n     literally.''\n       NOAA said the daily mean CO2 concentration was 400.03 ppm \n     on Thursday at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, the world's oldest \n     continuous carbon dioxide measurement station. That was the \n     first time the figure had crossed 400 ppm there since \n     measurements began at the site in 1958, the agency said.\n       NOAA said last year that sites in the Arctic had already \n     reached 400 ppm, but measurements from the facility in Hawaii \n     are closely watched as an indicator of broader trends on the \n     planet.\n       ``It's unprecedented,'' said James Butler, director of the \n     Global Monitoring Division of NOAA's Earth System Research \n     Laboratory. ``Hitting 400 is just saying, ``Folks, we haven't \n     addressed this yet.' ''\n       Butler said the planet hasn't seen atmospheric levels of \n     carbon dioxide this high since the Pliocene era, between 2.5 \n     million and 5 million years ago. He said the global average \n     temperature will probably reach 400 ppm in one or two years.\n       Scientists warn that continued increases could result in \n     catastrophe. A federal report released earlier this year, for \n     example, said 5 million Americans living in low-lying areas \n     could be affected by sea-level rise in the coming decades.\n       And global emissions appear poised to continue soaring. Not \n     only has the CO2 concentration risen over the decades, NOAA \n     said, but the rate of increase has been accelerating--``from \n     about 0.7 ppm per year in the late 1950s to 2.1 ppm per year \n     during the last 10 years.''\n       ``Before the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, \n     global average CO2 was about 280 ppm,'' NOAA said in a \n     statement Friday. ``During the last 800,000 years, CO2 \n     fluctuated between about 180 ppm during ice ages and 280 ppm \n     during interglacial warm periods. Today's rate of increase is \n     more than 100 times faster than the increase that occurred \n     when the last ice age ended.''\n       The surge in atmospheric carbon dioxide emissions shows \n     that federal and global policies to curb global warming \n     aren't even close to adequate, said Dan Lashof, director of \n     the climate and clean air program at the National Resources \n     Defense Council.\n       ``It's a very black and white record of what we're doing to \n     the atmosphere. The bottom line for climate policy can be \n     measured by\n\n[[Page S3607]]\n\n     the CO2 concentration we're observing in the atmosphere,'' \n     Lashof said.\n       Bill McKibben, founder of 350.org--an activist group that \n     has led the call for lowering carbon dioxide in the \n     atmosphere to 350 ppm--called the measurement ``one more grim \n     milestone.''\n       ``Somewhere between 350 and 400 ppm the Arctic melted, and \n     the ocean turned 30 percent more acidic,'' he said. ``And the \n     country's political leaders took no action even remotely \n     commensurate with the scale of the crisis. Let's hope we can \n     build this movement strong enough that that changes before we \n     add another 50 ppm.''\n       Environmental groups used the 400 ppm milestone to revive \n     their long-standing demands for action.\n       ``What we're looking at is really an opportunity for a \n     wake-up call for people,'' Fitzpatrick said. ``We really need \n     to come up with solutions. And they're out there. We just \n     need to implement them.''\n       But bitter partisanship in Washington has proven that \n     policymakers face massive hurdles in their push to tackle the \n     problem. Brad Johnson, campaign manager of the climate \n     activist group Forecast the Facts, painted a bleak picture of \n     the political landscape.\n       ``We must respond with urgent resolve to end this \n     uncontrolled experiment on our only home,'' he said in a \n     statement. ``Yet the Republican Party maintains climate \n     change denial as a central tenet of their party platform, and \n     President Obama refuses to admit the threat projects like the \n     Keystone XL tar-sands pipeline pose to our future survival.''\n       Still, some expressed hope that recent events like the \n     droughts that hammered much of the country and Hurricane \n     Sandy will build support for action.\n       ``At what point do we as a society say this is more than we \n     can put up with?'' Hoekstra asked.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. This is from an article dated May 10 from Politico:\n\n       The amount of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the \n     atmosphere passed a symbolic milestone this week, scientists \n     announced Friday, reaching levels that haven't prevailed on \n     the Earth since long before human civilization began.\n\n  Let me say that again. Is anybody listening to this? Scientists said:\n\n       The amount of heat-trapping carbon in the atmosphere passed \n     a symbolic milestone this week, reaching levels that haven't \n     prevailed on the Earth since long before human civilization \n     began.\n\n  Do you know who said that? NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration.\n\n       . . . CO2 concentrations had finally hit 400 \n     parts per million at a key measuring station in Hawaii. . . . \n     Still, there are few signs that Washington will emerge from \n     its deep snooze on the issue.\n\n  How right on. They are all sleeping, except for a handful of us. Wake \nup to this.\n\n       Congress remains unable to pass serious legislation to \n     tackle climate change.\n\n  Melanie Fitzpatrick, climate scientist at the Union of Concerned \nScientists, was quoted in the article saying:\n\n       . . . it's been 3 million to 5 million years since the \n     planet has had such high carbon dioxide levels. We've never \n     been here before, certainly not while human beings were on \n     the planet.\n\n  She goes on. Oh, no, this is Jon Hoekstra of the Wildlife Fund.\n\n       The carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere is like \n     the thermostat in your house. Every time you turn it up, we \n     are essentially turning up the heat in the planet.\n\n  James Butler, Director of Global Monitoring of NOAA's Earth System \nResearch Lab, was quoted as saying:\n\n       It is unprecedented. Hitting 400 is just like saying, \n     ``Folks, we haven't addressed this yet.'' The planet hasn't \n     seen atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide this high since the \n     Pliocene era, between 2.5 million and 5 million years ago. \n     The global average temperature will reach 400 parts per \n     million in 1 or 2 years.\n\n  The article continues:\n\n       Scientists warn that continued increase could result in \n     catastrophe. . . . 5 million Americans living in low-lying \n     areas who could be affected by sea level rise.\n\n  It goes on and on. Hoekstra ends his quote with:\n\n       At what point as a society do we say this is more than we \n     can put up with?\n\n  I will tell you why we are not doing anything. Special interest: Big \noil, big coal, big polluters. They do not want to address this. For \ntheir short-term profit they do not to want address this. It is sad, \nthe control they have here. Special interests have a lot of control, \nwhether it is the NRA stopping us from doing something 90 percent of \nthe people want, such as background checks, or it is big polluters--big \npolluters who don't want us to do anything about this issue for their \nshort-term benefit.\n  When they are all gone and people are suffering in our country, our \ngrandkids and great-grandkids are going to say: What was my great-\ngrandma thinking? What was my great-grandpa doing? We see what is \nhappening in the weather. Just look out the window. We see it.\n  Mr. President, I have discussed the latest scientific information \nthat is available to us, including a front-page story in USA Today, on \nMarch 1, that spotlighted the impacts of climate change unfolding \naround us. The story was part of a year-long series called ``Why You \nShould Sweat Climate Change,'' and it described how climate disruption \nis happening all around us.\n  I have also talked about a report entitled the ``2013 High Risk \nList'' that was released by the Government Accountability Office--GAO--\na government watchdog agency. That report told us how climate \ndisruption and the increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather \nevents, such as Superstorm Sandy, threaten our Nation's financial \nsecurity.\n  Another aspect of climate change that I have discussed is its impact \non public health in the U.S. and China, which has experienced the \nharmful health effects from air pollution due to its rapid \nindustrialization over the past few decades.\n  Today I will discuss how climate disruption poses a risk to our \nnational security in several ways. It has serious implications on \nnational security planning, it places additional burdens on the U.S. \nmilitary, and it affects our military readiness.\n  We have been told by a number of military leaders and defense \nexperts, such as former Secretary of State George Schultz under \nPresident Reagan, that climate change is a fact and we must address it \nas a national security priority.\n  It is a priority that we simply cannot ignore. An open letter was \nsigned by 38 former high-ranking Republicans, Democrats, and \nIndependents--including 17 former Senators and Congress members, 9 \nretired generals and admirals, and Cabinet officials from the Nixon, \nFord, Carter, Reagan, Bush (41), Clinton, and Bush (43) \nadministrations. The letter was turned into an ad highlighting that.\n  Look at this chart.\n  ``The cost of inaction will be staggering.'' This is a February 25, \n2013, Partnership for a Secure America ad.\n  Some of our most senior military leaders have already told us that \nclimate disruption will have significant impacts on national security.\n  According to the Chief of U.S. Pacific forces:\n  The significant upheaval from climate change `is probably the most \nlikely thing . . . that will cripple the security environment . . . \nNavy Admiral Samuel J. Locklear, III, ``Chief of US Pacific forces \ncalls climate biggest worry,''\n  That is from the Boston Globe, March 9, 2013.\n  There are a broad range of risks associated with the impacts of \nclimate change, such as drought and lack of drinking water supplies, \nwhich can contribute to military crises around the world. These threats \nmust be factored into our national security planning and operations.\n  According to President Obama's National Security Advisor, the \nenvironmental impacts of climate change are clear:\n  [T]he danger from climate change is real, urgent, and severe. The \nchange wrought by a warming planet will lead to new conflicts over \nrefugees and resources; new suffering from drought and famine; \ncatastrophic natural disasters; and the degradation of land across the \nglobe.\n  That is from Tom Donilon, National Security Advisor, April 24, 2013.\n  In March, the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, \nreported to the Senate that climate change and extreme weather will \ncreate water scarcity, disrupt food supplies, and harm energy \ninfrastructure in ways that will raise global risks of instability and \naggravated regional tensions.\n  This is from the March 12, 2013, Worldwide Threat Assessment of the \nU.S. Intelligence Community, report to the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence.\n  While climate change alone does not cause conflict, it can accelerate \ninstability, increase the threat of international military crises, and \nhinder our ability to combat terrorism. According to the Department of \nDefense's Defense Science Board:\n\n[[Page S3608]]\n\n  Climate change effects, particularly those related to water and food \nand security, can erode the legitimacy of fragile states and create \nconditions terrorists and extremists seek to exploit. Therefore, they \nare significant factors in combating terrorism.\n  This is from ``Trends and Implications of Climate Change for National \nand International Security,'' Department of Defense's Defense Science \nBoard, October 2011.\n  Climate disruption is also placing an additional burden on our \nmilitary, because it impacts the type of missions that must be planned \nfor and undertaken. Climate change is increasing the frequency and \nintensity of extreme weather events, and when a weather disaster \noccurs, our Armed Forces mobilize to provide humanitarian assistance to \nlocal communities and families in need.\n  We saw this happen with Superstorm Sandy, which wiped out entire \ncommunities in just a few hours. In response, our soldiers came to the \nrescue of people on the east coast who were impacted by Sandy's storm \nsurge. These types of humanitarian missions--whether it is in the U.S. \nor overseas--place additional burdens on our brave men and women in \nuniform.\n  Disasters such as Sandy that harm our civilian infrastructure, such \nas airports, ports, and electric grids, also create national security \nissues, because they can affect military readiness.\n  In addition to civilian infrastructure, Superstorm Sandy caused \ntremendous damage to our military facilities. A portion of the $60 \nbillion Sandy emergency relief package that Congress passed earlier \nthis year went toward repairing and replacing damaged Federal military \nassets, including: Fort Dix in New Jersey; Norfolk Naval Station in \nVirginia; Dover Air Force Base in Delaware; and the Coast Guard Academy \ncampus in Connecticut.\n  The U.S. military has almost 300,000 buildings valued at $590 \nbillion--much of which is at risk because of climate change. In \nJanuary, DoD stated:\n  In many ways, coastal military installations have been on the front \nlines of climate change.''\n  In fact, 10 percent of DoD coastal installations and facilities are \nlocated at or near sea level. According to the National Intelligence \nCouncil, more than 30 U.S. military installations were already facing \nelevated risks from storm surges and rising sea levels. These \ninstallations include\n  Eglin Air Force base, located on the Gulf of Mexico in the Florida \npanhandle--this facility faces storm surges and sea level rise; and\n  Norfolk Naval Station and the neighboring Newport News shipyard--the \nlocation where we build aircraft carriers. These facilities are also \nthreatened by storm surges and sea level rise.\n  The U.S. military is not alone in viewing climate change as a threat. \nA recent study found that over 70 percent of nations surveyed around \nthe world view climate change as a national security threat.\n  This is from the American Security Project: Global Security Defense \nIndex on Climate Change, March 21, 2013.\n  Countries around the world recognize that climate change is a \nnational security threat, but it is the U.S. military that must take a \nleading role. As one of America's retired military leaders, former U. \nS. Navy Vice Admiral Lee Gunn, stated:\n  Climate Change poses a clear and present danger to the United States \nof America . . . The imperative, then, is for leadership and action on \na global scale. The United States must act. The United States must \nlead.\n  This is from the November 1, 2012, ``Climate Change and the \nHomeland,'' American Security Project.\n  I could not agree more. We must follow the analysis and advice of our \nNation's military leaders and national security experts to protect the \nAmerican people by addressing the dangerous threat posed by climate \ndisruption.\n  I want to show a few charts about what people are saying, and then I \nwill stop.\n  ``The cost of inaction will be staggering.'' This ran in March.\n\n       The effects of climate change in the world's most \n     vulnerable regions present a serious threat to American \n     national security. Countries least able to adapt to or \n     mitigate the impacts of climate change will suffer the most, \n     but the resulting crisis will quickly become a burden on U.S. \n     priorities. Both the Department of Defense and State \n     Department have identified climate change as a serious risk \n     to American security and an agent of instability.\n\n  This is a very bipartisan group. It is actually mostly Republicans on \nthis, of people saying do something about this. Our national security \nis at stake.\n  When there are refugees who are run out of their country, what is \ngoing to happen to the world? There already are climate refugees. There \nis a movie called ``Climate Refugees.''\n  ``Danger from climate change is real, urgent and severe.''\n\n       The change wrought by a warming planet will lead to new \n     conflicts over refugees and resources; new suffering from \n     drought and famine; catastrophic natural disasters; and the \n     degradation of land across the globe.\n\n  That is a quote from Tom Donilon, National Security Adviser. So this \nis a national security issue.\n  How could the polluters have so much power to overwhelm our national \nsecurity people? But that is where it is. That is where it is.\n  ``Climate change can hinder ability to combat terrorism.''\n\n       Climate change effects, particularly those related to water \n     and food and security . . . can create conditions terrorists \n     and extremists seek to exploit. Therefore, they are \n     significant factors in combating terrorism.\n\n  That was the Department of Defense, October 2011. Department of \nDefense. National security advisers. The CIA has been telling us this \nfor a long time. We have to act. We have to act.\n  I have to say there are a number of my colleagues here--a small \nnumber--who feel the way I do. We are all pushing hard. Senator Sanders \nand I have a bill, the Sanders-Boxer bill, that would put a price on \ncarbon. Carbon could cost us the planet. The least we can do is put a \nlittle charge on it so people move to clean energy--clean energy.\n  Take the issue of the Keystone Pipeline. It is a big controversy. \nPeople say, let's just do it. Well, you ought to see what will come out \nof that in terms of carbon pollution. It will undo all the good we did \nfrom fuel economy. And the oil won't stay here. They have a waste \ndisposal problem with it. But it is a little bit inconvenient.\n  Remember when Vice President Gore wrote the book ``Inconvenient \nTruth.'' It is a little inconvenient for us. We don't want to know \nabout it because it is hard to deal with. But we can do it.\n  In California, we are beginning to see more and more solar rooftops, \nmore and more clean power, and the jobs that are coming with it are \nextraordinary. We can do this. This is the greatest Nation in the \nworld, but we are kind of held hostage to the big polluters. We have to \nsay that we have to act for the safety of the people.\n  We are hearing it. We are hearing it from our national defense \ndepartment, we are hearing it from George Shultz, who was the former \nSecretary of State under President Reagan. He says it is a national \npriority that shouldn't be ignored. Cabinet officials from the Nixon, \nFord, Carter, Reagan, and Bush--41 from Clinton and 43 from Bush--wrote \na letter to us. And Navy ADM Samuel Locklear, III, Chief of U.S. \nPacific Forces, calls climate ``our biggest worry.''\n  That is what he said.\n\n       The significant upheaval climate change ``is probably the \n     most likely thing . . . that will cripple the security \n     environment. . . . ''\n\n  This is a Navy man.\n\n       There are a broad range of risks associated with the \n     impacts of climate change, such as drought and lack of \n     drinking water supplies, which can contribute to military \n     crises around the world.\n\n  This is what the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, \nsaid:\n\n       . . . extreme weather will create water scarcity, disrupt \n     food supplies, and harm energy infrastructure in ways that \n     will raise the global risks of instability and aggravated \n     regional tensions.\n\n  It goes on. The entire national defense establishment is speaking \nwith one voice. We also wanted them to tell us what would happen to our \nmilitary facilities. Many of them--300,000 buildings valued at $590 \nbillion are at risk because of climate change. Those are coastal \nmilitary installations.\n  We are dealing with a lot of infrastructure. Norfolk Naval Station, \nneighboring Newport News shipyard where they build the aircraft \ncarriers, they are threatened by storm surges and sea level rise.\n  I have come to the floor now three or four times to keep raising \nthese different issues. Tonight I am talking about national security, \nbut we also\n\n[[Page S3609]]\n\nsaw terrible tornadoes in Oklahoma--horrible. I send my condolences to \nthe people who lost loved ones. This is climate change. This is climate \nchange. We were warned about extreme weather--not just hot weather but \nextreme weather.\n  When I had the gavel years ago--it has been a while--the scientists \nstarted to agree that we would start to see extreme weather. People \nsaid: What do you mean? Do you mean it is going to get hot? Yes, it is \ngoing to get hot, but we are also going to have snow in the summer in \nsome places. We are going to have terrible storms and tornadoes and all \nthe rest.\n  We need to protect our people. That is our No. 1 obligation. We have \nto deal with this threat that is upon us. It is going to get worse and \nworse through the years.\n  I certainly hope--and I pray over it--that people will wake up to \nthis and we will start to have support for moving together and at the \nend of the day it is a win-win-win. We will help save our planet. We \nwill create good-paying jobs right here in America as we move toward \nclean energy. We will see fewer people with asthma, and we will have a \nmore healthy population.\n  At the end of the day we will help those in the transition who have \nto pay a little bit more for their energy. We have it all figured out, \nhow to do that, and no one will be hurt. But right now--I am a very \nstraight from the shoulder person--I can tell you it is not happening, \nbut I feel an obligation to my grandkids to be here every Monday I can \nbe here to put in the Record the problems we are facing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/20/senate-section/article/S3609-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3609-S3610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, over the past several weeks the Senate \nJudiciary Committee has considered the Border Security, Economic \nOpportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act. In addition to the \nthree hearings the Committee held this year on the need for \ncomprehensive immigration reform, the Committee held an additional \nthree hearings specifically on this legislative proposal after it was \nintroduced. In those legislative hearings we received testimony from 26 \nwitnesses, including the Secretary of Homeland Security, Secretary \nNapolitano, who spoke at length about the bill would make our country \nsafer and help address the current problems in our immigration system.\n  The Judiciary Committee has benefited from more process and \ntransparency than any previous Committee consideration of immigration \nreform. In 1985, the Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Immigration \nheld three hearings on the Immigration Control and Reform Act and heard \ntestimony from 14 witnesses. In 2006 and 2007, the last two times the \nSenate tried to enact comprehensive immigration reform, the Republican \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee held no hearings on his legislative \nproposal or the McCain-Kennedy proposal or the Kyl-Kennedy formulation.\n  In 2006, the Republican chairman circulated his legislative proposal \njust one week before the Committee met to make opening statements. He \nthen revised his legislation and circulated it barely 2 days before the \nCommittee met to begin debate and consider amendments. This year, the \nJudiciary Committee received the bill text on April 17, and after a \nperiod of more than 3 weeks to consider it and draft amendments we \nbegan our consideration of amendments to the bill on May 9.\n  During the Committees consideration of the Immigration Reform and \nControl Act in 1986 the Committee met four times. We are holding our \nfourth day of markup today. It is my hope that the Committee will \ncomplete our consideration of the bill on Wednesday after 6, extended \ndays of consideration. In 1985, the Committee debated only 11 \namendments, adopting 7. The Committee sent the bill to the Senate on as \n12-5 vote.\n  In 2006, the Committee met five times to consider amendments to the \nChairman's Securing America's Borders bill, conducted 60 votes and \nadopted 54 amendments. The bill was then reported to the Senate on a \nvote of 12 to 6. In 2007, the bill was not considered by the Judiciary \nCommittee at all before floor consideration.\n  Already this year the Committee has met for 4 days to consider \namendments to the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and \nImmigration Modernization Act. During just the first three executive \nsessions, the Committee has considered 99 amendments. Of those 50--more \nthan half--were offered by the Republican minority. During those first \n3 days, the Committee debated and voted to accept 67 amendments to the \nbill. That is already more amendments than were debated in 2006 and 6 \ntimes as many amendments as were debated in 1986. Of those accepted, 20 \nwere offered by Republican members. That includes several amendments \nsponsored by Senator Grassley, Senator Cornyn and a few sponsored by \nSenator Sessions. The Committee has acted in a bipartisan way to accept \namendments authored by Senators from both sides of the aisle and by \nSenators who are proponents of the bill and some by Senators who can \nfairly be considered opponents of the bill.\n  The Committee will continue its consideration of the legislation \nafter tonight's votes. As of 4:30 today, we have considered an \nadditional 45 amendments, including 22 offered by Republicans, and 23 \noffered by Democrats.\n  One example of the Committee's bipartisan efforts to improve this \nlegislation was offered by Senators Hatch, Coons and Klobuchar, which \nwill increase certain immigration fees and provide 70 percent of the \nfunds collected to the states to improve and enhance the economic \ncompetitiveness of the United States by improving science, technology, \nengineering, and mathematics education and training in the United \nStates. Senator Schumer offered a second degree amendment which would \ndirect some of this funding to promote STEM education in groups that \nare underrepresented in the sciences, such as women and racial \nminorities. Both amendments were accepted by the Committee by unanimous \nconsent.\n  The Committee also unanimously approved my amendment to permanently \nauthorize and further strengthen the EB-5 Regional Center Program which \nwill benefit the economy. The United States Citizenship and Immigration \nServices--USCIS--estimates that the EB-5 Regional Center Program has \ncreated tens of thousands of American jobs and has attracted more than \n$1 billion in investment in communities all across the United States \nsince 2006.\n  These amendments are just a few of the many offered to promote jobs \nand innovation in the non-immigration visa provisions in Title IV of \nthe bill. Other bipartisan proposals to provide assistance for American \nworkers to apply for jobs in the technology sector and establish \nemployee reporting requirements to address potential abuse of the visa \nsystem have also been adopted.\n  The Committee has voted to accept amendments offered by nearly every \nmember of the minority on the Judiciary Committee. Senators Grassley, \nHatch, Sessions, Graham, Cornyn, Lee, and Flake have all offered \namendments adopted by the Committee to improve the bill. Senators \nFeinstein, Whitehouse, Klobuchar, Franken, Coons, Blumenthal and Hirono \nhave also contributed important amendments to improve the legislation. \nWith the adoption of these amendments, the Committee demonstrated its \nability to act in a bipartisan manner to improve this historic \nlegislation.\n  In an unprecedented effort to achieve transparency during the \nJudiciary Committee's public proceedings, and to ensure the American \npeople could follow the Committee's consideration of the bill, I made \npublic all 301 amendments filed on Tuesday, May 7, by posting them on \nthe Judiciary Committee's website. In real time, as the Committee \naccepts or rejects amendments, the Committee's website is updated to \nreflect which amendments are modified, accepted or fail.\n  The Judiciary Committee's mark up of the Border Security, Economic \nOpportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act is not yet finished but \nwe have completed work on two of the four titles of the bill as well as \nthe important ``trigger'' provisions. We have been able to focus our \nextensive consideration of this complex bill for three weeks and still \nachieve a fair and transparent process for Committee consideration. \nWith the help of the Senators who serve so diligently on the Judiciary \nCommittee from both sides of aisle, I hope by the end of this week\n\n[[Page S3610]]\n\nthat the Committee will have completed its consideration of the \nlegislation and that we will report a comprehensive immigration reform \nbill to the Senate with the recommendation that it be considered and \npassed. I look forward to bringing this legislation before the full \nSenate at the beginning of our next work period.\n  I note, I hope we will finish that this week. We will go very late \ntonight, very late tomorrow night, very late Wednesday night, all day \nThursday, and all day Friday, if necessary, until we get it finished.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/20/senate-section/article/S3610-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3610-S3611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE FARM BILL\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last week, the Senate Agriculture Committee \nonce again reported to the full Senate a bipartisan farm bill, and I am \npleased the Senate has turned to its consideration this week. I \ncompliment the distinguished chair, Senator Stabenow, who has done \nHerculean duties. The bill before us represents nearly 2 years of hard \nwork to satisfy the widely varied agricultural interests of this \ncountry, while supporting food assistance programs for those in need. \nThe Agriculture Reform, Food and Jobs Act will save $23 billion over 10 \nyears, which is remarkable given the fiscal restraints we face, and was \noverwhelmingly supported by the members of the agriculture committee by \na vote of 15-5.\n  Unfortunately, due to the House's inaction on the Senate-passed bill \nlast year, many farm bill programs expired, while others were \ntemporarily extended at the end of the year, making it all the more \nimperative that we work together now to ensure we move ahead with a \nbill in the next few months. I was glad that in December we were able \nto delay and prevent the ``dairy cliff'' from roiling markets worldwide \nand inflating dairy prices, which would have wreaked havoc in the \nmarketplace and on our farms. But the short-term extension of the Farm \nBill is no rational way to legislate, and the last-minute extension \nleft dozens of critical agriculture programs stranded without funding. \nWe must not repeat that process.\n  The bill before us contains many of the same improvements included in \nthe 2012 Senate-passed bill, while making important updates to reflect \nnew fiscal realities and maintaining the integrity of the policies we \nworked so hard to pass last year. The Agriculture Reform, Food and Jobs \nAct makes an investment in American agriculture that will benefit our \nproducers, our dairy farmers, our rural communities, our Main Street \nbusinesses, taxpayers, and consumers, all while reducing the deficit by \n$23 billion.\n  Every Farm Bill is important to the Green Mountain State and to all \nthe states of our nation as a matter of national security. Very few \ncountries can boast that they can feed themselves. We have the ability \nto nourish 320-plus million Americans. This represents an important \npart of our national security.\n  Agriculture is a pillar of Vermont's economy and of our Nation's \neconomy. So it is with this farm bill that we have produced in the \nSenate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. One of many \nkey components of this bill, in terms of Vermont and Vermont's economy, \nis a significant dairy reform proposal that offers the best hope in \ndecades of helping producers and consumers step off the dangerous \nrollercoaster of wild price swings in the markets in which dairy \nfarmers must sell their time-sensitive products. I believe this is key \nto our consideration of a farm bill, and I know it is what farmers in \nVermont are watching closely; I have been hearing from them regularly \nin strong support of stabilization and margin insurance working in \ntandem. We simply must protect our dairy farmers from the volatility of \nturbulent price swings with a financially sound risk management program \nto help farmers manage risk and margin volatility, and do so without \ndriving up the cost to the government.\n  As the author of the Organic Foods Production Act, I am extremely \npleased this bill continues to make strong improvements for organic \nagriculture. I am also pleased that the bill once again includes a \npolicy to give the National Organic Program much-needed authority to \neffectively protect and enforce organic integrity. In addition to \nenforcing the integrity of the organic brand, I am committed to seeing \nthat this bill treats all farmers fairly. We made great strides last \nyear in making improvements to crop insurance so that it will \nadequately compensate organic producers for their losses. Similar \nchanges are needed in the Environmental Quality Incentive Program to \neliminate the unfair lower payment limit applied solely to organic \nfarmers seeking to enroll in the program's Organic Initiative.\n  Another important compromise in this bill is found in the trade \ntitle, where the proposal expands the success of the Local and Regional \nFood Aid Procurement pilot program from the 2008 farm bill, and also \nincreases the funds available to support strategic prepositioning, \nwhich brings food aid commodities to at-risk regions before food \nemergencies strike. I look forward to working with Senators to find \nfurther improvements in how we can best provide emergency food aid and \ninternational development programs that have the flexibility to react \nquickly in times of emergency, avoid disrupting local markets, and \nincrease efficiency so we can save money and feed more people.\n  This legislation also includes support for vital anti-hunger programs \nsuch as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP, and the \nEmergency Food Assistance Program. Unfortunately, with so many \nAmericans still struggling to put food on the table, nutrition \nassistance and emergency feeding programs have become even more \ncrucial. The bill also contains initiatives to encourage better health, \nincreased access to local foods, nutrition for children and seniors, \nand to support self-sufficiency and food security in our Nation's low-\nincome communities while tackling the difficult problem of ``food \ndeserts.'' I am also pleased that Chairwoman Stabenow included language \nI offered as an amendment in committee last year to make it easier for \nSNAP participants to buy local foods through a Community Supported \nAgriculture Share, CSA, membership.\n  But at a time when more Americans than ever before are at risk of \ngoing hungry and food pantry shelves across the country are bare, these \nprograms could be made even stronger by dedicating more resources to \nhelp the neediest among us. I hope during our consideration of this \nbill we can work to increase support for the Emergency Food Assistance \nProgram, SNAP employment and training programs, and community food \nprojects to the level included in last year's farm bill. These programs \nare essential in our communities, and I hope we can invest as much in \nthese programs this year as we did last year.\n  I am disappointed, however, that the bill before the Senate today \nonce again includes $4 billion in cuts to the SNAP program, which will \npredominately come from northeastern States. I understand this cut is \npart of a larger compromise on behalf of Chairwoman Stabenow, who has \nbeen a strong supporter of these nutrition assistance programs. \nEnsuring these programs can continue to serve Vermonters and all \nAmericans in need is a key part to enacting a strong farm bill for this \ncountry.\n  This is why I am particularly concerned about the bill the House will \nconsider which includes five times the cuts to nutrition assistance as \nthe Senate bill, and $4 billion more than the House included in their \ncommittee bill last year. These cuts will needlessly eliminate millions \nof low-income Americans from this program. The House bill would mean \nthat several thousand children would lose eligibility for free school \nlunches. In Vermont, one in five children lives in food insecure homes \nand I know that number is even higher in some other States. It is \nshameful for any child in this country to go hungry and I hope the \nSenate will continue to oppose these draconian cuts to nutrition \nassistance.\n  The Senate agriculture committee's chairwoman and ranking member, and \nboth of their staffs, should be applauded for the great work they have \ndone to swiftly move this bipartisan bill through committee and now \nonto the Senate floor in record speed. I hope the Senate can once again \nmove forward in a bipartisan way to pass the farm bill this week, and I \nhope the\n\n[[Page S3611]]\n\nHouse moves forward as well so we might reconcile our differences \nbefore the expiration in September of the current short-term extension.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/20/senate-section/article/S3611-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              KENTUCKY MILITARY ORDER OF THE PURPLE HEART\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Membership in the MOPH is reserved for combat-wounded veterans \nwho have been awarded the Purple Heart for their service in the U.S. \nArmed Forces. The members of the Kentucky MOPH have made extraordinary \ncontributions and sacrifices in defense of the United States. Their \nbrave and valiant actions during combat have been vital to preserving \nthe freedom and way of life that Americans continue to enjoy today. I \napplaud the members of the Kentucky MOPH not only for their service to \nthe United States but also for their steadfast commitment to their \nfellow combat-wounded veterans and to all of our Nation's veterans and \ntheir families.\n  On June 1, 2013, the Kentucky MOPH will gather in Paducah, KY, for \nits annual convention. In anticipation of this gathering, I would like \nto draw attention to two noteworthy milestones the Kentucky MOPH \ncelebrates this year. January 2, 2013, marked the 70th anniversary of \nthe Louisville, KY, Bluegrass Chapter 146 of the MOPH, and the \nDepartment of Kentucky MOPH will celebrate its 25th anniversary on \nOctober 22, 2013. At this time, I ask my colleagues in the Senate to \njoin me in extending gratitude and commendations to members of the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky's Military Order of the Purple Heart for their \ndedication and service to America's military and America's veterans. \nAmerica has the greatest military in the world, and the MOPH serves as \na vital support system to veterans that make this a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/20/senate-section/article/S3611-2", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO STEVE NEWBERRY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nlongtime friend and a fixture of the broadcasting industry in Kentucky \nand nationally, Mr. Steve Newberry. For more than 25 years, Steve, a \nresident of Hiseville, KY, has been a leader in Kentucky radio. He has \nearned the respect and admiration of his peers in the Commonwealth and \nthroughout the country many times over. I am sad to note that next \nmonth, Steve will complete his service on the board of directors of the \nNational Association of Broadcasters.\n  Over the course of his career, Steve has helped lead radio and \ntelevision broadcasters on a national level, and he has had a \nsignificant impact on the broadcasting industry. This was recognized \nwhen in 2011 Steve received from his peers the prestigious National \nRadio Award, which is given annually to an outstanding leader in the \nradio industry.\n  Steve loved radio from an early age. He began his broadcasting career \nat the age of 14, when he got a job working at the local radio station \nin his hometown of Glasgow, KY. His parents were supportive of Steve's \ndream and drove him to work at that first job.\n  By the age of 21, Steve owned his first radio station. When he bought \nit, it was a 250-watt AM station that only broadcast in the daytime. \nSteve soon upgraded it to 500 watts and 24 hours of broadcasting a day.\n  Steve attended the University of Kentucky, where he received a \nbachelor's degree in telecommunications. While completing his senior \nyear, he bought WKVE, an AM station in Cave City. Today he is the \npresident and CEO of Commonwealth Broadcasting, based in Glasgow, and \nowns and operates 22 radio stations throughout the Bluegrass State.\n  As his business grew, Steve became more and more engaged in \nbroadcasting industry matters. He was first elected to the board of \ndirectors of the National Association of Broadcasters, NAB, in 1999. He \nwould go on to serve as part of the board's leadership, chairman of the \nboard, and ultimately as the NAB joint board chairman, the \nassociation's top industry leadership post. Steve also served on the \nboard of directors and executive committees for the Radio Advertising \nBureau.\n  Steve's community service in Kentucky is equally impressive. He has \nserved as the chairman of the Authority for Kentucky Educational \nTelevision and has worked with the Glasgow-Barren County Industrial \nDevelopment Economic Authority, the Glasgow Rotary Club, and the \nGlasgow-Barren County Boys & Girls Club.\n  Steve is a past president of the Kentucky Broadcasters Association \nand in 2009 received their highest honor, the Distinguished Kentuckian \nAward. And as I already stated, Mr. President, in 2011 he received the \nvery high honor from his peers of the prestigious National Radio Award.\n  It is the Commonwealth's loss that in June, Steve will end his \nservice on the NAB board of directors. Whatever endeavors may lay ahead \nfor him, I know he will dispatch them with the same success that has \nmarked his career to date. I am sure his family, including his wife \nVickie and his son Walker, are very proud of him.\n  Steve Newberry is one of Kentucky's finest broadcasters and a man of \nintegrity. I know my colleagues in the Senate join me in congratulating \nhim for his dedication to the radio profession, to his community, and \nto the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/20/senate-section/article/S3611-3", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE FAMILY ACT\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, building a family is an exciting \nmilestone in the lives of millions of American families. Unfortunately, \nthe road towards conceiving a child is often difficult and painful for \nthe nearly 7 million Americans diagnosed with the disease of \ninfertility.\n  Earlier this month, men and women across the country shared their \nstories during National Infertility Awareness Week. This movement, \norganized by RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association, brings \nattention to the disease of infertility and encourages the public to \ntake charge of their reproductive health. Let me take this opportunity \nto commend RESOLVE for its work providing community and giving voice to \nwomen and men experiencing infertility.\n  Over the last few decades, significant medical advancements, such as \nin vitro fertilization, have provided a solution for some would be \nparents. However, the high cost to undergo infertility care often poses \nan additional barrier for couples to overcome. It costs more than \n$12,000 for a couple to undergo one cycle of infertility treatment and \ninsurance coverage is often dismal. For some patients, multiple cycles \nare required to achieve a successful pregnancy outcome. Federal \nGovernment insurance plans do not specifically cover infertility \ntreatments and only 15 States offer any level of coverage.\n  I have introduced a bill that would alleviate some of the costs \nassociated with infertility care. The Family Act (S. 881) creates a \nFederal tax credit for individuals who are diagnosed with infertility \nby a licensed physician. A tax credit will help make this vital patient \ncare more accessible and affordable to those who lack insurance \ncoverage for these services.\n  I hope you will join me by becoming a cosponsor of The Family Act. \nThis is a necessary step towards ensuring that all of our citizens have \nthe ability to raise a family, without compromising their financial \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/20/senate-section/article/S3611-4", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3611-S3612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JANE HOLL LUTE\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep gratitude \nand best wishes to Ms. Jane Holl Lute for her service as Deputy \nSecretary of the Department of Homeland Security, DHS, over the past 4 \nyears.\n  Ms. Lute arrived at DHS in April 2009 with an already impressive \npublic service record that included over 30 years of distinguished \nservice, including time in the U.S. Army during Operation Desert Storm. \nShe served on the National Security Council staff under both President \nGeorge H.W. Bush and President Bill Clinton. Ms. Lute held senior-level \npositions within the United Nations, UN, where she oversaw logistical \nand administrative support to UN peacekeeping operations worldwide and \ncoordinated efforts to build sustainable peace in countries emerging \nfrom violent conflict. Her record of achievement extends to her \nacademic accomplishments. She holds a Ph.D. in political science from \nStanford University and a J.D. from Georgetown University. I would be \nremiss if I did not mention that she achieved many of\n\n[[Page S3612]]\n\nthese extraordinary accomplishments as a single mother. Impressive \nindeed.\n  As Deputy Secretary of DHS, Ms. Lute has served as the Department's \nsecond-highest official and chief operating officer, responsible for \nthe day-to-day business and management of the third largest department \nin the Federal Government of the United States. Comprised of more than \n240,000 employees and operating with an annual budget of over $56 \nbillion, DHS works to secure our Nation, while enhancing Federal, \nState, and local capabilities to prepare for, respond to, and recover \nfrom threats and disasters of all kinds.\n  Throughout the past 4 years, Ms. Lute has committed herself \nwholeheartedly to the mission set forth in DHS's Quadrennial Homeland \nSecurity Review, QHSR, which is to ensure that our Nation is a safe, \nsecure, and resilient place where the American way of life can thrive. \nAgainst a backdrop of continued and evolving threats and hazards of all \nkinds, Ms. Lute has worked determinedly to fulfill the challenging and \nwide-ranging mission of the Department.\n  To that end, Ms. Lute has worked closely with the many partners in \nboth the public and the private sector who play an essential role in \nkeeping our Nation safe. This includes all levels of government, law \nenforcement, private industry, and most importantly, individuals and \ncommunities, who have proven time and time again that they are our \ngreatest allies and the key to our success. This bottom-up approach to \nhomeland security reflects the manner in which Ms. Lute has helped lead \nDHS during her time at the Department. As I see it, her focus has \nalways closely mirrored two of my core values--to figure out the right \nthing to do and do it, as well as to focus on excellence in everything \nwe do.\n  Under Ms. Lute's leadership, DHS also made significant progress in \naligning operations with smart and efficient strategy through \npublication of the QHSR, the Nation's first ever comprehensive review \nof America's strategy for homeland security, followed by the Bottom-Up \nReview, which is DHS's effort to align programmatic activities and \norganizational structure with the mission sets and goals identified in \nthe QHSR.\n  In her role as Deputy Secretary at DHS, Ms. Lute made it a priority \nto institute the sound management practices that have helped place DHS \non solid financial, programmatic, strategic, and organizational \nfooting. Perhaps most notably, Ms. Lute's efforts helped DHS earn a \nqualified audit opinion on all Fiscal Year 2012 financial statements, a \nfirst for the Department and in record time for such a large and new \ndepartment. Ms. Lute also helped to implement the framework for \nIntegrated Investment Life Cycle Management to ensure that the DHS \nbudget of nearly $60 billion is spent wisely and efficiently.\n  Like a true leader, Ms. Lute has the vision to plan ahead and address \nfuture challenges. One of Ms. Lute's hallmark achievements at DHS has \nbeen her early focus in the area of cybersecurity. As Ms. Lute has said \nherself, it is impossible to imagine a safe, secure, and resilient \nNation without a safe, secure, and resilient cyberspace. In particular, \nMs. Lute oversaw all Departmental efforts to strengthen the nation's \ncybersecurity, including policy, planning, operations, and budget. \nThrough the numerous transitions in the Department's cyber governance \nstructure, Ms. Lute was a steady, reliable, informed, and persistent \nvoice on cyber matters, and she helped ensure that cyberspace would \nremain civilian space.\n  In order to ensure our Nation's success in cybersecurity, Ms. Lute \npersonally led the implementation effort to improve the Department's \nability to build a world-class cybersecurity workforce and to ensure a \nstrong pipeline of talent for the future. Ms. Lute also helped promote \na Continuous Diagnostics and Monitoring capability, which will enable \nFederal agencies and other organizations to see and respond to day-to-\nday cyber threats. These efforts and others have contributed directly \nto a stronger national cyber ecosystem.\n  Ms. Lute's accomplishments are not limited to domestic operations. \nHer familiarity with international negotiation was of great value to \nDHS and her efforts abroad have helped enhance security practices here \nat home. As the lead negotiator for the U.S. Passenger Name Record \nAgreement with the European Union, she secured a landmark new data-\nsharing agreement with the European Union that increased the security \nof air travel while protecting civil liberties and privacy. In these \nnegotiations, she bridged fundamental differences between how Europeans \nand Americans view privacy through tenacity and perseverance. These \nsame traits are seen in her approach to the Department's bilateral \nrelations as well. She expanded cooperation with our British and German \nallies through the Joint Contact Group and Security Cooperation Group, \nforged stronger ties with India through the Homeland Security Dialogue, \nand she opened the door to frank discussions with China over cyber and \nport security.\n  The commitment to secure our Nation and create a more resilient \nAmerica is a goal that is shared not only among Members of Congress and \nthe men and women of the Department of Homeland Security, but also \namong everyday citizens. That security is ensured by the men and women \nwho step forward each day and say ``Send Me.'' Ms. Lute once told me \nthis is the very credo the men and women of DHS embrace in every \ncrisis. So today, I sincerely thank Deputy Secretary Lute for her \npublic service and for her extraordinary service over 3 decades to keep \nour Nation safe. She leaves behind a strong legacy of ``just get it \ndone'' leadership, paving the path for future leaders and employees at \nDHS. I, for one, will remember her fondly for her commitment to \nensuring American homeland security and for living DHS's ``Send Me'' \nattitude. Jane Holl Lute is a role model for us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/20/senate-section/article/S3612-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HANES MAGNET MIDDLE SCHOOL\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Hanes Magnet \nMiddle School in Winston-Salem, NC, for being recognized as the top \nmagnet school in the country. On May 7, 2013, Hanes was awarded the \nprestigious Dr. Ronald P. Simpson School of Merit Excellence Award, \nwhich recognizes one school for innovative programming, academic \nachievement, and promoting diversity. Hanes Magnet School, which \nfocuses on science, technology, engineering and mathematics, or STEM, \nhas worked within the Winston-Salem community to provide real world \napplication of STEM, taking students out of the classroom for \ninnovative, hands-on application of STEM. This approach has increased \nstudent engagement, and I believe achievement within the school \noverall.\n  Hanes has only been a magnet school for 6 years but in that time has \nseen large increases in enrollment, matched by equally impressive gains \nin its achievement data. Magnet schools like Hanes provide parents with \nexpanded options for their child's education--options that will ensure \nstudents aren't confined to schools that might not be serving their \nindividual needs. For that reason, I am proud of the success Hanes has \nachieved as recognized by this award. Congratulations to principal \nMelita Wise, the parents, students, and everyone else at Hanes for this \naward. It is well deserved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/20/senate-section/article/S3612-2", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3612-S3613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        HAVERHILL, NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Haverhill, \nNH--a town in Grafton County that is celebrating the 250th anniversary \nof its founding. I am proud to join citizens across the Granite State \nin recognizing this special milestone.\n  Haverhill is comprised of the villages of Woodsville, Pike, North \nHaverhill, and the historic town center at Haverhill Corner. The \nvillage of North Haverhill is the county seat of Grafton County. The \nBedell Bridge State Park, Black Mountain State Forest, Kinder Memorial \nForest, and the Oliverian Valley Wildlife Preserve are all located in \nHaverhill.\n  Haverhill was granted a charter by Governor Benning Wentworth on May \n18, 1763. A veteran of the French and Indian War, CPT John Hazen \noriginally oversaw and settled Haverhill, naming it after his \nbirthplace in Massachusetts.\n  The population has grown to over 4,600 residents. The patriotism and\n\n[[Page S3613]]\n\ncommitment of the people of Haverhill is reflected in part by their \nrecord of service in defense of our Nation.\n  Some of Haverhill's most notable residents have included U.S. Senator \nand New Hampshire Governor, Henry W. Keyes; U.S. Congressmen Noah Davis \nand Jonathan H. Rowell; and professional baseball players Chad Paranto \nand Bob Smith.\n  As sturdy and resilient as the people who built it, Haverhill is home \nto the Haverhill-Bath Covered Bridge. Completed in 1829, it is the \noldest Town Lattice Truss Saltbox covered bridge in the United States.\n  Haverhill is also home to the Museum of American Weather. This unique \ninstitution chronicles the history of four unique New England weather \nevents.\n  Haverhill is a place that has contributed much to the life and spirit \nof the State of New Hampshire. I am pleased to extend my warm regards \nto the people of Haverhill as they celebrate the town's 250th \nanniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/20/senate-section/article/S3613-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BETSY BROUN\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Betsy Broun, \nthe Director of the Smithsonian Art Museum. Betsy will be honored \nThursday evening at the Frederic E. Church Award Gala in New York for \n``transforming the perception of American Art.''\n  Betsy and I became friends years ago over--you guessed it--American \nArt. She has always been more than gracious with her time, her great \nstories, and her expertise. I am an American History teacher by trade, \nbut Betsy has taught me a great deal about the intersection of American \nArt and American History.\n  Under Betsy Broun's leadership, the Smithsonian American Art Museum \nhas undergone a $250 million renovation. She has taken the \nSmithsonian's work far afield through new media, distance learning, and \nher lectures. And there is nothing better than a walk through a Betsy-\ncurated exhibit.\n  Despite all of her professional and academic success, Betsy has never \nlost touch with her native Kansas, and she and I have had a lot of fun \nover the years talking about Thomas Hart Benton, a native Missouri \nartist and the great nephew of the first Senator from Missouri, and \ndiscussing other ``middle America'' artists.\n  My wife Abby and I are so grateful for Betsy's friendship, and we \ncongratulate her on the Frederic E.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor an American \nhero--SGT Charles Harris of the U.S. Army 2nd Infantry 3rd Brigade. \nThis May 30, just 3 days after our Nation's Memorial Day salute to \nAmerica's fallen heroes, Sergeant Harris will observe the 1-year \nanniversary of his ``Alive Day.'' That is the inspiring way our wounded \nwarriors describe the day they were injured--wounded but alive, they \ncelebrate their second chance at life.\n  It was on May 30, 2012, that Sergeant Harris lost his legs and almost \nhis life in an IED explosion in Afghanistan. And over the past year, he \nhas come so far and so fast in his recovery at Walter Reed Army \nHospital, where I first met him. With the help of his family and his \ndevoted mother Lisa, who has been at his side throughout his recovery, \nhe has come back from the dead.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 2013 \nPride Foundation Scholars--a remarkable group of 89 students who share \nincredible perseverance, a strong desire to give back, and a focus on \nhow education can improve their lives and their communities.\n  Pride Foundation plays a crucial role in encouraging and supporting \nthe next generation of leaders in the LGBT community. Students who have \nbeen stigmatized because of their sexual orientation or gender identity \nsometimes do not receive the support they need from their families and \ncommunities, and too often, individuals of great\n\n[[Page S3614]]\n\npromise give up on their dreams because they do not believe success is \npossible.\n  Over the past 20 years, Pride Foundation has worked to lift up future \nleaders by giving over $3 million in educational scholarships to LGBT \nand allied students in Washington, Alaska, Idaho, Montana, and Oregon. \nThey have provided these students with financial support, mentorship \nopportunities, and a community that focuses on generosity, \nencouragement, and acceptance. As Pride Foundation marks the 20th \nanniversary of their scholarship program and honors these students at \nthe 2013 Scholarship Celebration Reception, I wish to congratulate this \nyear's scholars on all their achievements.\n  Pride Foundation's longstanding determination to help students \nsucceed mirrors the LGBT community's tireless efforts in the fight for \nequality. And as we commemorate this year's Pride Month, we should look \nback and celebrate the tremendous strides that we have made toward \nequality in Washington State and across the Northwest.\n  I join with many in Washington State in congratulating this year's \nPride Foundation Scholars on all they have achieved so far. I look \nforward to seeing all they will accomplish as leaders in their \ncommunities. Although we have a long way to go to move our country in \nthe right direction, working together we have accomplished so much. I \nam proud to stand up and fight for the LGBT community, and I will \ncontinue to make sure that your stories are heard in the Senate. Again, \ncongratulations to the 2013 Pride Foundation Scholars. I look forward \nto seeing all you will accomplish in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/20/senate-section/article/S3614-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/20/senate-section/article/S3614-2", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/20/senate-section/article/S3614-3", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS \n  ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13303 OF MAY 22, 2003, WITH \n RESPECT TO THE STABILIZATION OF IRAQ, RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT OF \n                   THE SENATE ON MAY 17, 2013--PM 10\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The unpaid volunteer members of the Civil Air Patrol \n     (hereafter in this Act referred to as the ``CAP'') during \n     World War II provided extraordinary humanitarian, combat, and \n     national services during a critical time of need for the \n     Nation.\n       (2) During the war, CAP members used their own aircraft to \n     perform a myriad of essential tasks for the military and the \n     Nation within the United States, including attacks on enemy \n     submarines off the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts of the \n     United States.\n       (3) This extraordinary national service set the stage for \n     the post-war CAP to become a valuable nonprofit, public \n     service organization chartered by Congress and designated the \n     Auxiliary of the United States Air Force that provides \n     essential emergency, operational, and public services to \n     communities, States, the Federal Government, and the \n     military.\n       (4) The CAP was established on December 1, 1941, initially \n     as a part of the Office of Civil Defense, by air-minded \n     citizens one week before the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, \n     Hawaii, out of the desire of civil airmen of the country to \n     be mobilized with their equipment in the common defense of \n     the Nation.\n       (5) Within days of the start of the war, the German Navy \n     started a massive submarine offensive, known as Operation \n     Drumbeat, off the east coast of the United States against oil \n     tankers and other critical shipping that threatened the \n     overall war effort.\n       (6) Neither the Navy nor the Army had enough aircraft, \n     ships, or other resources to adequately patrol and protect \n     the shipping along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts of \n     the United States, and many ships were torpedoed and sunk, \n     often within sight of civilians on shore, including 52 \n     tankers sunk between January and March 1942.\n       (7) At that time General George Marshall remarked that \n     ``[t]he losses by submarines off our Atlantic seaboard and in \n     the Caribbean now threaten our entire war effort''.\n       (8) From the beginning CAP leaders urged the military to \n     use its services to patrol coastal waters but met with great \n     resistance because of the nonmilitary status of CAP civilian \n     pilots.\n       (9) Finally, in response to the ever-increasing submarine \n     attacks, the Tanker Committee of the Petroleum Industry War \n     Council urged the Navy Department and the War Department to \n     consider the use of the CAP to help patrol the sea lanes off \n     the coasts of the United States.\n       (10) While the Navy initially rejected this suggestion, the \n     Army decided it had merit, and the Civil Air Patrol Coastal \n     Patrol began in March 1942.\n       (11) Oil companies and other organizations provided funds \n     to help pay for some CAP operations, including vitally needed \n     shore radios that were used to monitor patrol missions.\n       (12) By late March 1942, the Navy also began to use the \n     services of the CAP.\n       (13) Starting with 3 bases located in Delaware, Florida, \n     and New Jersey, CAP aircrews (ranging in age from 18 to over \n     80) immediately started to spot enemy submarines as well as \n     lifeboats, bodies, and wreckage.\n       (14) Within 15 minutes of starting his patrol on the first \n     Coastal Patrol flight, a pilot had sighted a torpedoed tanker \n     and was coordinating rescue operations.\n       (15) Eventually 21 bases, ranging from Bar Harbor, Maine, \n     to Brownsville, Texas, were set up for the CAP to patrol the \n     Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts of the United States, with \n     40,000 volunteers eventually participating.\n       (16) The CAP used a wide range of civilian-owned aircraft, \n     mainly light-weight, single-engine aircraft manufactured by \n     Cessna, Beech, Waco, Fairchild, Stinson, Piper, Taylorcraft, \n     and Sikorsky, among others, as well as some twin engine \n     aircraft, such as the Grumman Widgeon.\n       (17) Most of these aircraft were painted in their civilian \n     prewar colors (red, yellow, or blue, for example) and carried \n     special markings (a blue circle with a white triangle) to \n     identify them as CAP aircraft.\n       (18) Patrols were conducted up to 100 miles off shore, \n     generally with 2 aircraft flying together, in aircraft often \n     equipped with only a compass for navigation and a single \n     radio for communication.\n       (19) Due to the critical nature of the situation, CAP \n     operations were conducted in bad weather as well as good, \n     often when the military was unable to fly, and in all \n     seasons, including the winter, when ditching an aircraft in \n     cold water would likely mean certain death to the aircrew.\n       (20) Personal emergency equipment was often lacking, \n     particularly during early patrols where inner tubes and kapok \n     duck hunter vests were carried as flotation devices, since \n     ocean worthy wet suits, life vests, and life rafts were \n     unavailable.\n       (21) The initial purpose of the Coastal Patrol was to spot \n     submarines, report their position to the military, and force \n     them to dive below the surface, which limited their operating \n     speed and maneuverability and reduced their ability to detect \n     and attack shipping, because attacks against shipping were \n     conducted while the submarines were surfaced.\n       (22) It immediately became apparent that there were \n     opportunities for CAP pilots to attack submarines, such as \n     when a Florida CAP aircrew came across a surfaced submarine \n     that quickly stranded itself on a sand bar. However, the \n     aircrew could not get any assistance from armed military \n     aircraft before the submarine freed itself.\n       (23) Finally, after several instances when the military \n     could not respond in a timely manner, a decision was made by \n     the military to arm CAP aircraft with 50- and 100-pound \n     bombs, and to arm some larger twin-engine aircraft with 325-\n     pound depth charges.\n       (24) The arming of CAP aircraft dramatically changed the \n     mission for these civilian aircrews and resulted in more than \n     57 attacks on enemy submarines.\n       (25) While CAP volunteers received $8 a day flight \n     reimbursement for costs incurred, their patrols were \n     accomplished at a great economic cost to many CAP members \n     who--\n       (A) used their own aircraft and other equipment in defense \n     of the Nation;\n       (B) paid for much of their own aircraft maintenance and \n     hangar use; and\n       (C) often lived in the beginning in primitive conditions \n     along the coast, including old barns and chicken coops \n     converted for sleeping.\n       (26) More importantly, the CAP Coastal Patrol service came \n     at the high cost of 26 fatalities, 7 serious injuries, and 90 \n     aircraft lost.\n       (27) At the conclusion of the 18-month Coastal Patrol, the \n     heroic CAP aircrews would be credited with--\n       (A) 2 submarines possibly damaged or destroyed;\n       (B) 57 submarines attacked;\n       (C) 82 bombs dropped against submarines;\n       (D) 173 radio reports of submarine positions (with a number \n     of credited assists for kills made by military units);\n       (E) 17 floating mines reported;\n       (F) 36 dead bodies reported;\n       (G) 91 vessels in distress reported;\n       (H) 363 survivors in distress reported;\n       (I) 836 irregularities noted;\n       (J) 1,036 special investigations at sea or along the coast;\n       (K) 5,684 convoy missions as aerial escorts for Navy ships;\n       (L) 86,685 total missions flown;\n       (M) 244,600 total flight hours logged; and\n       (N) more than 24,000,000 total miles flown.\n       (28) It is believed that at least one high-level German \n     Navy Officer credited CAP as one reason that submarine \n     attacks moved away from the United States when he concluded \n     that ``[i]t was because of those damned little red and yellow \n     planes!''.\n       (29) The CAP was dismissed from coastal missions with \n     little thanks in August 1943 when the Navy took over the \n     mission completely and ordered CAP to stand down.\n       (30) While the Coastal Patrol was ongoing, CAP was also \n     establishing itself as a vital wartime service to the \n     military, States, and communities nationwide by performing a \n     wide range of missions including, among others--\n       (A) border patrol;\n       (B) forest and fire patrols;\n       (C) military courier flights for mail, repair and \n     replacement parts, and urgent military deliveries;\n       (D) emergency transportation of military personnel;\n       (E) target towing (with live ammunition being fired at the \n     targets and seven lives being lost) and searchlight tracking \n     training missions;\n       (F) missing aircraft and personnel searches;\n       (G) air and ground search and rescue for missing aircraft \n     and personnel;\n       (H) radar and aircraft warning system training flights;\n       (I) aerial inspections of camouflaged military and civilian \n     facilities;\n       (J) aerial inspections of city and town blackout \n     conditions;\n       (K) simulated bombing attacks on cities and facilities to \n     test air defenses and early warning;\n       (L) aerial searches for scrap metal materials;\n       (M) river and lake patrols, including aerial surveys for \n     ice in the Great Lakes;\n       (N) support of war bond drives;\n       (O) management and guard duties at hundreds of airports;\n       (P) support for State and local emergencies such as natural \n     and manmade disasters;\n       (Q) predator control;\n       (R) rescue of livestock during floods and blizzards;\n       (S) recruiting for the Army Air Force;\n       (T) initial flight screening and orientation flights for \n     potential military recruits;\n       (U) mercy missions, including the airlift of plasma to \n     central blood banks;\n       (V) nationwide emergency communications services; and\n       (W) a cadet youth program which provided aviation and \n     military training for tens of thousands.\n       (31) The CAP flew more than 500,000 hours on these \n     additional missions, including--\n       (A) 20,500 missions involving target towing (with live \n     ammunition) and gun/searchlight tracking which resulted in 7 \n     deaths, 5 serious injuries, and the loss of 25 aircraft;\n       (B) a courier service involving 3 major Air Force Commands \n     over a 2-year period carrying more than 3,500,000 pounds of \n     vital cargo and 543 passengers;\n       (C) southern border patrol flying more than 30,000 hours \n     and reporting 7,000 unusual sightings including a vehicle \n     (that was apprehended) with 2 enemy agents attempting to \n     enter the country;\n\n[[Page S3631]]\n\n       (D) a week in February 1945 during which CAP units rescued \n     seven missing Army and Navy pilots; and\n       (E) a State in which the CAP flew 790 hours on forest fire \n     patrol missions and reported 576 fires to authorities during \n     a single year.\n       (32) On April 29, 1943, the CAP was transferred to the Army \n     Air Forces, thus beginning its long association with the \n     United States Air Force.\n       (33) Hundreds of CAP-trained women pilots joined military \n     women's units including the Women's Air Force Service Pilots \n     (WASP) program.\n       (34) Many members of the WASP program joined or rejoined \n     the CAP during the post-war period because it provided women \n     opportunities to fly and continue to serve the Nation that \n     were severely lacking elsewhere.\n       (35) Due to the exceptional emphasis on safety, unit and \n     pilot training and discipline, and the organization of the \n     CAP, by the end of the war a total of only 64 CAP members had \n     died in service and only 150 aircraft had been lost \n     (including its Coastal Patrol losses from early in the war).\n       (36) It is estimated that up to 100,000 civilians \n     (including youth in its cadet program) participated in the \n     CAP in a wide range of staff and operational positions, and \n     that CAP aircrews flew a total of approximately 750,000 hours \n     during the war, most of which were in their personal aircraft \n     and often at risk to their lives.\n       (37) After the war, at a CAP dinner for Congress, a quorum \n     of both Houses attended with the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives and the President thanking CAP for its \n     service.\n       (38) While air medals were issued for some of those \n     participating in the Coastal Patrol, little other recognition \n     was forthcoming for the myriad of services CAP volunteers \n     provided during the war.\n       (39) Despite some misguided efforts to end the CAP at the \n     end of the war, the organization had proved its capabilities \n     to the Nation and strengthened its ties with the Air Force \n     and Congress.\n       (40) In 1946, Congress chartered the CAP as a nonprofit, \n     public service organization and in 1948 made the CAP an \n     Auxiliary of the United States Air Force.\n       (41) Today, the CAP conducts many of the same missions it \n     performed during World War II, including a vital role in \n     homeland security.\n       (42) The CAP's wartime service was highly unusual and \n     extraordinary, due to the unpaid civilian status of its \n     members, the use of privately owned aircraft and personal \n     funds by many of its members, the myriad of humanitarian and \n     national missions flown for the Nation, and the fact that for \n     18 months, during a time of great need for the United States, \n     the CAP flew combat-related missions in support of military \n     operations off the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n       (a) Award.--\n       (1) Authorized.--The President pro tempore of the Senate \n     and the Speaker of the House of Representatives shall make \n     appropriate arrangements for the award, on behalf of \n     Congress, of a single gold medal of appropriate design in \n     honor of the World War II members of the Civil Air Patrol \n     collectively, in recognition of the military service and \n     exemplary record of the Civil Air Patrol during World War II.\n       (2) Design and striking.--For the purposes of the award \n     referred to in paragraph (1), the Secretary of the Treasury \n     shall strike the gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, \n     and inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.\n       (3) Smithsonian institution.--\n       (A) In general.--Following the award of the gold medal \n     referred to in paragraph (1) in honor of all of its World War \n     II members of the Civil Air Patrol, the gold medal shall be \n     given to the Smithsonian Institution, where it shall be \n     displayed as appropriate and made available for research.\n       (B) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the Smithsonian Institution should make the gold medal \n     received under this paragraph available for display \n     elsewhere, particularly at other locations associated with \n     the Civil Air Patrol.\n       (b) Duplicate Medals.--Under such regulations as the \n     Secretary may prescribe, the Secretary may strike and sell \n     duplicates in bronze of the gold medal struck under this Act, \n     at a price sufficient to cover the costs of the medals, \n     including labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, and \n     overhead expenses, and amounts received from the sale of such \n     duplicates shall be deposited in the United States Mint \n     Public Enterprise Fund.\n       (c) National Medals.--Medals struck pursuant to this Act \n     are national medals for purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, \n     United States Code.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/20/senate-section/article/S3631-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL PUBLIC WORKS WEEK\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.
