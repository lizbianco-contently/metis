Mr. President, the Senate has the privilege of considering \nthe nominations of many exceptionally talented individuals for a \nvariety of jobs. This week the Senate has already approved three \nqualified and dedicated nominees--including Richard Griffin, to serve \namong the people's watchdogs against labor abuses, and Tom Wheeler, to \nlead the body that oversees the Nation's telecommunications industries. \nThis week we will consider five other fine public servants for a \nvariety of crucial roles in the executive branch. So when one nominee's \npersonal story and professional dedication stands out in this \ndistinguished crowd, it is remarkable. And it is remarkable when we \ntalk about a woman by the name of Patricia Millett.\n  Ms. Millett has been chosen by the President to be a nominee to serve \non the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. She graduated at the top of her \nclass from the University of Illinois and then attended Harvard Law \nSchool. She clerked for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and served \nas an appellate attorney in the Justice Department's civil division. \nShe then served as assistant to the Solicitor General under Democratic \nPresident Bill Clinton as well as Republican President George W. Bush. \nMs. Millett then was chosen to lead the Supreme Court practice at the \nprestigious law firm of Akin Gump, and has argued more than 32 cases \nbefore the U.S. Supreme Court. This is a stunning number that rarely \nanyone ever reaches. I am sure there are others who have reached this \nnumber, but the two who come to my mind are the Chief Justice of the \nSupreme Court who argued many cases, and a long-time friend, the late \nRex Lee, who was Solicitor General for President Reagan. Prior to, \nduring his tenure as Solicitor General, and after he argued many cases \nbefore the Supreme Court. But 32 arguments before the Supreme Court is \na stunningly high number.\n  Patricia Millett's professional credentials are matched by her \npersonal integrity and determination. She is a military spouse, mother \nof two children, who argued a case before the Supreme Court while her \nhusband, who\n\n[[Page S7638]]\n\nserves in the Navy, was deployed in Afghanistan. Ms. Millett has been a \nliteracy tutor for more than two decades, and volunteers at her \nchurch's homeless shelter. She has the support of law enforcement \nofficials, legal professionals, and military organizations from across \nthe political spectrum. Her colleagues have called her fair-minded, \nprincipled, and exceptionally gifted, with unwavering integrity. So it \nis truly a shame that some Republicans would filibuster this \nexceedingly qualified nominee for unrelated political reasons.\n  Patricia Millett is nominated to what many call the second most \nimportant court in the land--the DC Circuit. This court reviews the \ncomplicated decisions and rulemakings of Federal agencies, and since \nSeptember 11, 2001, has handled some of the most important terrorism \nand detention cases in the history of our country.\n  This is what former DC Chief Judge Patricia Wald said about the \ncourt's caseload:\n\n       The D.C. Circuit hears the most complex, time-consuming, \n     labyrinthine disputes over regulations with the greatest \n     impact on ordinary Americans' lives: clean air and water \n     regulations, nuclear plant safety, health-care reform issues, \n     insider trading and more. These cases can require thousands \n     of hours of preparation by the judges, often consuming days \n     of argument, involving hundreds of parties and interveners, \n     and necessitating dozens of briefs and thousands of pages of \n     record--all of which culminates in lengthy, technically \n     intricate legal opinions. . . . The nature of the D.C. \n     Circuit's caseload is what sets it apart from other courts.\n\n  Unfortunately, today the court is functioning far below its full \ncomplement of judges. The number of judges was chosen legislatively a \nlong time ago. Today, only 8 of the 11 seats on the DC Circuit are \nfull. The three remaining vacancies are due in part to Republican \nobstruction of qualified nominees such as Caitlin Halligan, an \nextremely qualified woman. Twice she was defeated.\n  Republicans claim that filling these three remaining vacancies on the \nDC Circuit would amount to court packing. This is ridiculous. We are \nnot changing any law. We are filling vacancies. Circuit court nominees, \nincluding nominees for the DC Circuit, have waited seven times longer \nfor confirmation under President Obama than they did under the last \nPresident Bush. So it is no mystery why we have a judiciary crisis in \nAmerica. Making nominations to vacant judgeships is not court packing. \nIt is the President's job.\n  I repeat, filling vacant judgeships is the President's job. It has \nnothing to do with court packing.\n  Senate Republicans were happy to confirm judges to the DC Circuit \nwhen President Reagan and President George W. Bush were in office, but \nnow that a Democrat serves in the White House, they want to eliminate \nthe remaining three DC Circuit seats, although the court's workload has \nactually grown since President Bush was in office.\n  Republicans are using convenient but flawed political arguments to \nhamstring our Nation's court and deny highly qualified nominees such as \nMs. Millett a fair up-or-down vote. But she deserves better. She \ndeserves a return to the days when all Senators--including \nRepublicans--took their duty to advise and consent seriously.\n  I am cautiously optimistic that enough Republicans understand their \nresponsibilities and will allow us to move forward on this very \nimportant nomination. She deserves a return to the days when qualified \nnominees were guaranteed a full and fair confirmation process to avoid \nthe political games. It is basically fairness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/30/senate-section/article/S7638-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, each of us was sent here to serve and \nprotect our constituents. That is why Republicans voted unanimously \nagainst ObamaCare in 2009, because we believed it was our job to stand \nfor middle-class families we were sent here to represent, because we--\nand not just us, but countless health care professionals, policy \nexperts, and citizens across the country--saw this train wreck coming \nliterally years ago, knew the pain it would cause, and warned against \nit.\n  I wish the President and Washington Democrats had listened back then. \nI really do. I wish we had been wrong about ObamaCare too, because the \nfailings of this law are about so much more than a Web site. They are \nabout real people.\n  Yes, the healthcare.gov fiasco can seem almost comical at times--like \na surreal parody of government bungling. But as the President says, \nthis is about so much more than a Web site. He is right about that. The \npain this law is causing is not digital--it is real.\n  Workers first began to feel the pain when employers started cutting \nhours, and then benefits, and some jobs altogether. Spouses felt it \nwhen they lost their health coverage they had had through their \nhusband's or wife's job. College graduates felt it when they could only \nfind part-time work, if they could find anything at all in the Obama \neconomy. And this was before basically anyone had even heard of this \nObamaCare Web site.\n  Now that the health care law is actually coming online, many \nAmericans are finding they will be seeing premium increases or that \nthey will be getting hit with higher copays and deductibles or that \nthey can no longer see the doctors who use the hospitals of their \nchoice. In fact, I have been hearing from constituents in western \nKentucky that a number of the hospitals and health care providers they \nhave relied upon will no longer be available in their network--and, in \nmany cases, they will be responsible for 100 percent of the costs \nassociated with services performed at those facilities they used to \nuse.\n  Let me repeat. One hundred percent of the costs. How is that an \nimprovement? How is that reform?\n  Many in the middle class are also learning that the health plans they \nwere promised they could keep are being taken away from them anyway. \nThey feel absolutely betrayed. They feel hurt. And they feel \nvulnerable. When these folks are offered ``comparable'' plans at all, \nthey are often completely unaffordable. And if they poke around on the \nexchanges--assuming they could even log on--many are finding that \nObamaCare coverage is going to cost them way too much, not offer them \nwhat they want, or both.\n  Here is a note I recently received from a constituent in Caldwell \nCounty:\n\n       According to . . . our health insurance provider, we can \n     elect to stay on our current plan for this year with less \n     coverage or switch to the `Affordable' Care Plan that \n     provides a little more coverage but at a cost increase that \n     is almost double. We currently pay $653 per month and it \n     would increase to over $1100 . . . after talking to the \n     insurance company today, it seems . . . I was lied to by the \n     President and Congress when we were told that the \n     `Affordable' Care Act would not require us to switch from our \n     current insurance provider. My husband and I work hard, pay a \n     lot in taxes and ask for little from our government. Is it \n     asking too much for government to stay out of my health \n     insurance?\n\n  Her family is not alone. A CNN report this morning estimates that \nroughly one-half of the 600,000 people in Kentucky's private insurance \nmarket will have their current insurance plans discontinued by the end \nof the year.\n  This is not right and it is certainly not fair. It is even more \nunfair when you consider that the administration chose to exempt \nbusinesses from this law for a year but did not think the middle class \ndeserved the same treatment.\n  Republicans do. We think the middle class actually deserves a \npermanent exemption from this law. But as long as partisans in \nWashington continue to jealously defend ObamaCare, we will do at least \nwhatever we can to fight for greater fairness for the middle class.\n  I hope more Democrats will join us to make that happen because a Web \nsite can be fixed but the pain this law is causing--higher premiums, \ncanceled coverage--that is what is really important, and that is what \nDemocrats need to work with us to address by starting over, completely \nover, with true bipartisan health care reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/30/senate-section/article/S7638-3", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7638-S7639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Millett Nomination\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we are debating whether the Senate is \ngoing to be allowed to vote on the confirmation of Patricia Millett. \nShe is nominated to fill the vacancy that our current Chief Justice \nJohn Roberts previously occupied on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDC Circuit.\n  If she is confirmed, as of course she should be, she will be only the \nsixth woman to serve on the DC Circuit in its more than 120-year \nhistory. She is an extraordinary nominee. She has impeccable \ncredentials for this important appellate court.\n  I, like so many others across this country, hope that her \nconfirmation is not going to suffer from the partisanship and gridlock \nthat consumed Congress earlier this month.\n  Ms. Millett was born in Dexter, ME and now calls Virginia home, but \ngrowing up she lived in Kansas, Virginia, Ohio, and Illinois. She \nearned her undergraduate degree, summa cum laude, from the University \nof Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and her law degree, magna cum laude, \nfrom Harvard Law School. She served as a law clerk for Judge Thomas \nTang on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Phoenix, AZ.\n  Patricia Millett has had a brilliant legal career. She has argued 32 \ncases before the Supreme Court. Until recently, she held the record for \nthe most Supreme Court arguments by a woman attorney before the court. \nShe has argued dozens of cases in the Federal courts of appeal. She has \nbriefed numerous cases in the Supreme Court and also appellate courts \nacross the Nation.\n  Ms. Millett has extensive experience on issues that come before the \nD.C. Circuit. She served for 15 years in the U.S. Department of Justice \nin both Democratic and Republican administrations. She worked for 4 \nyears on the appellate staff of the civil division. She argued cases in \nFederal and State appellate courts, including the successful \nconstitutional defense of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and \nthe inclusion of ``In God We Trust'' on Federal currency.\n  She spent over a decade in the Solicitor General's office. Her \nstellar reputation led a bipartisan group of seven former Solicitors \nGeneral to praise her as ``unfailingly fairminded.''\n  In 2004, Republican Attorney General John Ashcroft awarded Ms. \nMillett the Attorney General's Distinguished Service Award for \nrepresenting the interest of the United States before the Supreme \nCourt.\n  Since 2007, she has led the Supreme Court practice in the Washington, \nDC, office of Akin Gump. Her work in private practice spans commercial \nlitigation, administrative law, constitutional matters, statutory \nconstruction, and even criminal appeals. She has represented Army \nreservists and business interests, including the Chamber of Commerce as \nwell as civil rights plaintiffs.\n  Ms. Millett is a nominee with unquestionable integrity and character. \nShe has committed herself to pro bono work. She has done this \nthroughout her career. She has also engaged in some very significant \ncommunity service. She helps the neediest among us, volunteering \nthrough her church to prepare meals for the homeless and serving \nregularly as an overnight monitor at a local shelter. Twenty years \nafter serving as a law clerk in Arizona, Patricia Millet will return \nnext summer with her family for a mission trip with the White Mountain \nApache tribe in Fort Apache, AZ.\n  It is interesting that in a press conference I held yesterday when we \nhad spouses of people in the military, we talked about another aspect \nof her career. Her husband is now a retired Navy reservist, but as a \nmilitary spouse when he was called up, Ms. Millett has a personal \nunderstanding of the sacrifice we ask of our servicemembers and their \nfamilies.\n  At the very height of her legal career, her husband was called on to \ndeploy as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Of course he left, as those \nwho are called to serve do, but she was left at home with two young \nchildren. And what did she do? She did what spouses all over this \ncountry do. She filled the role of both parents at home while her \nhusband served in the Navy overseas.\n  In fact, just the other day the Senate passed a bipartisan resolution \nto honor families like Ms. Millett's family. We commemorate October 26 \nas the Day of the Deployed.\n  Not only is she committed to her own military family, she has helped \nto secure employment protections for members of our National Guard and \nReserve through her pro bono legal work.\n  I know the distinguished Presiding Officer is concerned about the \nGuard and Reserve in his State of Massachusetts as I am in my State of \nVermont. Ms. Millet also knows the strains that they face. In a case \ndecided by the Supreme Court in 2011, Ms. Millett represented an Army \nreservist who was fired, in part, because some of his coworkers who \nstayed at home didn't like his military absences. She stood up for \nevery Guard member and every reservist in Vermont or Massachusetts or \nany other State in this country. The successful arguments Ms. Millett \nhelped craft have made it easier for all members of our Reserve and \nNational Guard to protect their right under the Uniformed Services \nEmployment and Reemployment Rights Act.\n  Through her legal work, she has earned broad bipartisan support. This \nincludes the support of Peter Keisler, Carter Phillips, Kenneth Starr, \nTed Olson, Paul Clement, and a bipartisan group of 110 appellate \npractitioners, as well as 37 Deputy Solicitors General and assistants \nto the Solicitor General from both Republican and Democratic \nadministrations.\n  She is supported by both the national president of the National \nFraternal Order of Police, Chuck Canterbury; the Deputy Commissioner of \nthe New York Police Department, Douglas Maynard; the President of the \nNational Bar Association, John Page; and Andrea Carlise, the current \nPresident of the National Conference of Women's Bar Associations. Ms. \nMillet has the support of the military community including Major \nGeneral Clark H. McNair, Jr., U.S. Army, Retired; Michael Hall, Command \nSergeant Major, U.S. Army, Retired; Blue Star Families; and the Gallant \nFew.\n  Based on Ms. Millett's advocacy in private practice, she has the \nsupport of former executive vice president at the Chamber of Commerce \nLitigation Center, Robin Conrad, who declares that Ms. Millett is:\n\n     a non-ideological, non-partisan, `lawyer's lawyer,' who has \n     proven herself to be a trusted advisor to business with a \n     practical appreciation of the challenges faced by businesses, \n     large and small. She is open-minded, fair, even-tempered and \n     superbly qualified to serve on the District of Columbia \n     Circuit.\n\n  In fact, the list is so long, I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  If a President was to be given a textbook about the type of nominee \nto send to the Senate, or if Senators were given a textbook of the type \nof person to confirm, this would be the golden standard right here. We \nshould not even be having this debate. She should have been confirmed \nunanimously weeks ago. She is the kind of nominee we should support \nbecause hers is a great American story of dedication, diligence, \npatriotism, and extraordinary professional ability.\n\n[[Page S7640]]\n\n  I hope nobody is going to get involved in partisan politics and \nchoose to filibuster her nomination. She deserves to be confirmed.\n  I understand that some Republicans have newfound concerns about the \nnumber of judges on the D.C. Circuit. During the Bush administration, \nSenate Republicans voted unanimously to fill four vacancies on the D.C. \nCircuit--giving the court a total of 11 judges in active service. Today \nthere are only eight judges on the court. What has changed? It is not \nthe caseload--that has remained fairly constant over the past 10 years. \nThe only thing that has changed is the party of the President \nnominating judges to the court.\n  Incidentally, a Republican President nominated a man named John \nRoberts to the seat Ms. Millett has now been nominated to. When his \nnomination came up for a vote on the Senate floor, as I recall, all \nDemocrats and all Republicans supported him for that seat. While \nDemocrats did not agree with him philosophically on all issues, we knew \nhe was highly qualified, and he was confirmed.\n  I don't think it is any stretch to say she is just as qualified. It \nis the same seat, but the only difference is it is a Democratic \nPresident who has nominated her. The standards should be the same. The \nsame standards that allowed John Roberts to be confirmed to that seat \nwith a Republican President are the same standards that should allow \nher to be confirmed to the seat with a Democratic President. She should \nbe confirmed.\n  I want to talk about the caseload. The caseload was 121 pending \nappeals per active judge when President Bush was in office. The \nRepublican-controlled Senate had no problem in confirming the 11th \njudge to that court.\n  Now, when the caseload is 185 pending appeals per active judge \ninstead of 121 with a Democratic President, we are told: Gosh, we have \nto cut back. We have too many judges. It doesn't pass the giggle \ntest. The fact is that this is what Republicans said. They voted for \nnominees to fill these 11 seats. Now, when three of those seats are \nvacant and we are trying to fill one--the same one John Roberts had--\nsome are saying maybe we have too many judges. Back then we had 121 \nappeals pending per active judge and now we have 185. No matter how we \ndo it, the issue simply comes down to, is this nominee qualified?\n\n  I have had the great privilege of serving in this body for almost 40 \nyears. I have voted on thousands of judges nominated by both \nRepublicans and Democrats. I voted to confirm the vast majority of them \nwhether we had a Republican President or a Democratic President. \nThinking back through all of those thousands of judges, I have a hard \ntime finding even a handful who were as well qualified as this woman is \nor where there is as much of a need to have somebody in there.\n  This is important. This is not only important on the merits--and on \nthe merits it is an easy case--but there should be no delay based on \npolitics. At a time when the American people are looking at the \nCongress and saying: What are you people doing--first the shutdown and \nthen other things--we should not allow one more example that will bring \nthe scorn of the American people toward this great body by saying no to \nsomebody when every single person, no matter what their politics are \nand no matter what part of the country they are from, knows how \nqualified she is.\n  I was thinking yesterday about when the group representing spouses in \nthe military spoke about what she did to maintain her legal career but \nfirst and foremost to take care of her family while her husband was \nabroad and even then to do such things as help provide food to food \nkitchens for those less able and less fortunate. When we see a \nbackground such as this, we think it is too good to be true, but in \nthis case it is all true. So let's confirm her.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Letters Received for Patricia Millett\n\n       June 24, 2013--Robin Conrad, Former Executive Vice \n     President, National Chamber Litigation Center, Chamber of \n     Commerce\n       July 2, 2013--Independent Group of Private Attorneys, Law \n     Professors, and Former Judges\n       July 2, 2013--Jefferson Keel, President, National Congress \n     of American Indians\n       July 3, 2013--Barbara Arnwine, President and Executive \n     Director, and Jon Greenbaum, Chief Counsel and Senior Deputy \n     Director, Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law\n       July 3, 2013--Stuart Bowen, Jr.\n       July 3, 2013--Solicitors General at the Department of \n     Justice, 1989-2009\n       July 3, 2013--Dan Schweitzer, Supreme Court Counsel, \n     National Association of Attorneys General\n       July 3, 2013--Lisa Soronen, Executive Director, State and \n     Local Legal Center\n       July 8, 2013--Jessica Adler, President, Women's Bar \n     Association of the District of Columbia\n       July 8, 2013--Silvia Burley, Chairperson, California Valley \n     Miwok Tribe\n       July 8, 2013--Major General Clark H.

The next vote in order will be \ncloture on the Archuleta nomination. Senators should expect a rollcall \nvote at noon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I know we are in the postcloture time on \nthe Estevez nomination. I wanted to explain why it was necessary for me \nto put a hold on this nomination this last March. This is a very \nimportant position, the second ranking acquisition official at the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  Actually my objection does not have anything to do with Mr. Estevez \npersonally, who I trust will do an admirable job in this very important \nposition. But the reason I put a hold on the nomination was so I could \ntry to get the attention of the Department of Defense to protest the \nDepartment's business relations with a notorious Russian arms dealer. \nFor the last few years, the Pentagon has been buying helicopters, Mi-17 \nhelicopters, from Rosoboronexport, a Russian arms dealer, to supply the \nAfghan military. But this is the arms dealer, of course, who is \nsupplying Bashar al-Assad with the weapons he is using in Syria in that \ncivil war to kill his own innocent civilian population.\n  The Pentagon itself has confirmed that Bashar al-Assad security \nforces have used these very same Russian-made weapons to massacre an \nuntold number of civilians. Yet the Department of Defense has \nstubbornly refused--I do not think arrogant is too strong a word--\nstubbornly and arrogantly refused to end its relationship with Assad's \npersonal arms supplier.\n  In fact, since 2011, the Pentagon has given more than $1 billion--$1 \nbillion--to Rosoboronexport in no-bid contracts. It is planning to \nspend another $345 million on the company's Mi-17 helicopters in 2014.\n  Let me be clear. By purchasing Mi-17s from Rosoboronexport, our own \nDepartment of Defense is effectively subsidizing the mass murder of \nSyrian civilians, which is, by all accounts, simply outrageous.\n  To make matters worse, the Mi-17 program is apparently plagued by \ninternal corruption. According to published news reports, there are at \nleast two separate ongoing criminal investigations into the U.S. Army \noffice that manages the procurement and sustainment contracts for the \nMi-17s. Last month, I joined 31 of my congressional colleagues in a \nbipartisan letter to the Attorney General of the United States, urging \nhim to utilize all available resources to support these criminal \ninvestigations.\n  For that matter, I have also joined with 12 of my Senate colleagues \nin a bipartisan letter to General Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff at the Pentagon, asking him for assurances that its \ncontracts with Rosoboronexport are not being abused by corrupt Russian \nofficials.\n  Americans have good reason to be concerned. It is their tax dollars \nthat are being used to buy these helicopters from Russia for the Afghan \nmilitary.\n  Russia has a particularly bad track record. They received an abysmal \ngrade of D-minus in Transparency International's latest Government \nDefence Anti-Corruption Index. In 2011, Russia's chief military \nprosecutor publicly stated that 20 percent of his country's annual \nmilitary equipment budget is being stolen by corrupt officials and \ncontractors. One independent watchdog believes that figure could be as \nhigh as 40 percent.\n  In short, there are plenty of legitimate reasons and questions about \nwhy American tax dollars are going to Rosoboronexport. On a per-\naircraft basis, the U.S. Army is paying Rosoboronexport more than \ndouble what the Russian military itself is paying to buy nearly \nidentical helicopters. About 1 year ago, I convinced the Pentagon to \nconduct a formal audit of the Army's 2011 no-bid contract. \nUnfortunately, that audit went nowhere due to persistent stonewalling \nby--you guessed it--Rosoboronexport.\n  In other words, we still have a lot of questions and the Pentagon and \nRosoboronexport still owe us a lot of answers which we don't yet have. \nOne question is what prompted the Department of Defense to buy Russian \nhelicopters in the first place? To my knowledge, there are plenty of \nAmerican manufacturers of helicopters that would be anxious to compete \nfor this no-bid contract. By relying upon Moscow to supply the Afghan \nmilitary with essential equipment, we have given the Kremlin \nsignificant leverage over U.S. foreign policy. Moreover, equipping the \nAfghans with Russian helicopters will make it virtually impossible to \nachieve any real level of interoperability between the U.S. and Afghan \nhelicopter fleets.\n  The Department of Defense has repeatedly and disingenuously claimed \nthat a 2010 study of Afghanistan's helicopter requirements shows the \nnecessity of buying Mi-17 helicopters from Russia. In fact, the \nunclassified portion of that study found that the ideal aircraft for \nthe Afghan military was a particular American-made helicopter.\n  Why are we buying Russian helicopters when there are American \nmanufacturers that can meet that very same requirement? It makes no \nsense whatsoever, and the Department of Defense has steadfastly refused \nto cooperate with reasonable inquiries into why in the world they \ncontinue to persist along this pathway.\n  The reality is the Department of Defense has plenty of alternatives \nto buying Mi-17s from Russia, but for some reason or reasons known only \nto them, they steadfastly refuse to consider any of these alternatives. \nThe most sensible and cost-effective alternative would involve keeping \nmany of the Mi-\n\n[[Page S7642]]\n\n17s the Afghans already have on hand and life-extending them, instead \nof retiring them early, which is what is happening now. In other words, \nMi-17s that the Afghans already have are being retired early rather \nthan being life-extended because of the Pentagon's stubborn insistence \non buying new ones to replace these existing helicopters. In fact, a \nmajority of the Mi-17s the Afghan military already has have more than \nhalf of their useful lifetime left in terms of flight hours, and they \nare being retired early so the Pentagon can buy these new helicopters \nto replace them.\n  It makes no sense whatsoever, particularly at a time when I know we \nare all concerned about our defense expenditures and making sure the \nDefense Department has the resources they need in order to keep America \nsafe and maintain our commitments around the world. Why would the \nDefense Department be acting so irresponsibly as they are in the \npurchase of these Mi-17 helicopters?\n  While I don't have any personal objection to the nomination of Mr. \nAlan Estevez, I could not support cloture on the nomination.\n  Along with my friends and colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I am \ngoing to do everything I can to shine a bright light on the Pentagon's \ntroubling relationship with a Russian arms dealer, which is also Bashar \nal-Assad's arms dealer from which he purchases weapons to kill innocent \ncivilians in Syria. What reasonable person wouldn't be troubled by this \ntangled relationship?\n  Ideally, the Mi-17 program would simply be terminated. At the very \nleast, it should be placed on constant and vigorous congressional \noversight, and that would serve the interests of U.S. taxpayers and \nU.S. national security alike.\n  For all of these reasons, I could not support a cloture vote on the \nnomination of Mr. Estevez. I am going to continue to come back to the \nfloor and use other vehicles.\n  I see the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee on \nthe floor. I know we are going to be taking up the Defense \nauthorization bill later on this year, and I will be reaching out to \nhim and other colleagues on both sides of the aisle to try to bring an \nend to this troubling relationship with Rosoboronexport and to seek \nalternative means--hopefully, from American manufacturers--for this \nrequirement for the Afghan military.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record two letters, \none dated August 5, 2013, to GEN Martin E. Dempsey, and a letter dated \nSeptember 16, 2013, addressed to the Attorney General of the United \nStates, Eric Holder.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 5, 2013.\n     General Martin E. Dempsey,\n     Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Joint Staff Pentagon, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear General Dempsey: We write to express deep concern over \n     your support for the ongoing Department of Defense (DoD) \n     procurement of helicopters from Rosoboronexport, the Russian \n     Federation's official arms export firm, as well as DoD's \n     seeming blindness to the real risk of both Russian corruption \n     in these deals and overreliance on a potentially hostile \n     power. You are on the record, as recently as your Senate \n     reconfirmation hearing on July 18, saying that we should \n     ``stay the course with the existing program.'' In the \n     interests of national security and proper stewardship of \n     taxpayer dollars, we ask you to reconsider.\n       In June, DoD awarded Rosoboronexport a $572 million \n     contract for the procurement of 30 more Mi-17 helicopters for \n     the Afghan Special Mission Wing, ignoring the recommendation \n     of the Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction \n     (SIGAR) to halt this procurement. SIGAR, in its June 28 \n     report, cast doubt on the validity of the requirement for the \n     aircraft, providing ample evidence that it is based on \n     unrealistic and outdated projections. We request an \n     explanation of DoD's decision. We also understand that DoD \n     plans to buy approximately 15 more of these aircraft using \n     FY14 funds.\n       As you know, while Rosoboronexport receives huge payments \n     from DoD, it also continues to serve as a key enabler of \n     atrocities in Syria, transferring weapons and ammunition to \n     prop up the bloodthirsty regime of Bashar al-Assad. DoD has \n     confirmed that Assad's forces have used these very weapons to \n     murder Syrian civilians, and the United Nations estimates \n     that over 100,000 people have been killed. DoD has now \n     awarded well over $1 billion in no-bid contracts to this \n     Russian state-controlled firm, which handles more than 80 \n     percent of Russia's arms exports. What's more, as recently as \n     2005, Russia reportedly forgave more than $10 billion of \n     Syria's past arms sales debt. As such, DoD has put American \n     taxpayers in the repugnant position of subsidizing the mass \n     murder of Syrian civilians.\n       While DoD's relationship with this firm is troubling on \n     many levels, the prospect that American taxpayers have been \n     made into unwitting victims of Russian corruption demands \n     special scrutiny. Rosoboronexport is an arm of the Russian \n     Federation and a key component of Russia's defense \n     establishment, in which corruption is rampant. In June, the \n     British nonprofit group Transparency International published \n     its Government Defence Anti-Corruption Index, giving Russia a \n     D-minus rating as one of the worst-ranked exporters. This \n     group found ``evidence of organised crime penetration into \n     defence and security establishments, and little evidence of \n     the government's ability to address this,'' and it concluded \n     that several top Ministry of Defence officials have \n     convictions on their records.\n       In May 2011, Russia's chief military prosecutor publicly \n     stated that 20 percent of Russia's own military equipment \n     budget is stolen by corrupt officials and contractors each \n     year, citing practices such as ``fake and fictitious \n     invoices'' and ``kickbacks for state contracts.'' The head of \n     Russia's National Anti-Corruption Committee independent \n     watchdog put his estimate at 40 percent. Concerns about \n     corruption in Russia's arms trade also reportedly led Iraq to \n     cancel a $4.2 billion arms deal with Russia last year. We \n     have very serious concerns over where the proceeds of DoD's \n     Mi-17 contracts might be going.\n       In September 2012, one of us raised concerns about the \n     price per aircraft that DoD was paying to Rosoboronexport and \n     persuaded DoD to direct the Defense Contract Audit Agency \n     (DCAA) to conduct a formal audit of the Army's 2011 no-bid \n     contract with the firm. In May of this year, we learned that, \n     due to a total lack of cooperation by Rosoboronexport and \n     months of stalling tactics, DCAA had to abandon the audit. At \n     the same time, DoD was negotiating the $572 million no-bid \n     contract with this firm, but failed to use that leverage to \n     secure its cooperation with the audit. DoD should complete \n     this audit.\n       We need your personal assurance that American taxpayers are \n     not being cheated out of their hard-earned dollars by corrupt \n     Russian officials and contractors who may be lining their own \n     pockets. Further, we request a briefing on exactly what due \n     diligence DoD did on this issue prior to awarding these \n     contracts to Rosoboronexport, as well as what continuing \n     safeguards DoD has in place to prevent this.\n       The strategic vulnerabilities that DoD's Mi-17 program have \n     potentially created are also deeply troubling. DoD argues \n     that its direct relationship with Russia's official arms \n     exporter provides essential benefits, such as recognition of \n     ``Russian Military Airworthiness Authority,'' special tools \n     and test equipment, and engineering ``reach back'' for Mi-\n     17s, which it says includes service bulletins, certification \n     of modifications, root cause corrective actions, lifting of \n     life limits on parts, counterfeit part mitigation, special \n     access to technical info, support for future modifications \n     and fielded aircraft. If DoD's dependence on Russia for \n     Afghanistan's future rotary airlift capacity is as complete \n     as DoD suggests, this raises serious questions: (1) If the \n     Afghan military continues to operate Russian aircraft for \n     decades to come, can it ever be fully independent of Russia? \n     (2) Should Russia decide at some point to withhold support \n     for the Afghan Mi-17 fleet, does DoD have a fallback plan to \n     ensure the Afghan fleet's readiness? (3) Does the \n     overreliance on Russia fostered by this Mi-17 program put the \n     U.S. at risk of Russian coercion or blackmail on other \n     security issues, such as the crisis in Syria, Iran's drive to \n     obtain nuclear weapons, U.S. missile defense, arms control \n     negotiations, or the security of former Soviet republics?\n       We are concerned by DoD's apparent failure to consider the \n     strategic implications of sourcing mission-critical military \n     equipment from a potentially hostile power such as Russia. \n     DoD's preference for Russian helicopters will also make it \n     highly difficult to achieve robust interoperability between \n     the U.S. and Afghan helicopter fleets, which is in the long-\n     term interests of both nations. These problems are self-\n     inflicted, and this policy is extremely shortsighted.\n       For these reasons, we ask that DoD cancel all current \n     contracts with Rosoboronexport, as it has previously \n     confirmed it has the right to do at any time, and fully sever \n     its business relationship with this firm.\n           Sincerely,\n         John Cornyn, U.S. Senator; Mark Begich, U.S. Senator; \n           Kelly Ayotte, U.S. Senator; Mark Kirk, U.S. Senator; \n           John Boozman, U.S. Senator; Jeff Sessions, U.S. \n           Senator; David Vitter, U.S. Senator; Charles E. \n           Schumer, U.S. Senator; Richard Blumenthal, U.S. \n           Senator; Kirsten E.

Eric Holder,\n     Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice, Pennsylvania \n         Avenue, NW., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Attorney General Holder: We write with great concern \n     about reported allegations of criminal activity by one or \n     more government officials within the Department of the Army's \n     Non-Standard Rotary Wing Aircraft (NSRWA) Project Management \n     Office, which leads the Department of Defense's troubled Mi-\n     17 helicopter program. These allegations, if substantiated, \n     would represent not just a violation of the law, but also a \n     breach of the public trust.\n       According to an August 29, 2013, report from Reuters, the \n     Defense Criminal Investigative Service has been conducting a \n     criminal investigation and is examining ``questionable \n     transactions'' by NSRWA, including potentially improper \n     payments to Russian companies involved in Mi-17 overhauls, as \n     well as problematic personal ties between one or more Army \n     officials and these foreign entities.\n       In addition, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan \n     Reconstruction has launched a probe into NSRWA's procurement \n     of new Mi-17 helicopters, according to the Reuters report. \n     Since 2011, NSRWA has negotiated and executed more than $1 \n     billion worth of contracts for procurement of these Russian \n     aircraft from Rosoboronexport, Russia's state-controlled arms \n     exporter who simultaneously continues to supply weapons and \n     ammunition to the Syrian government.\n       The prospect that American taxpayers have been made into \n     unwitting victims of corruption demands special scrutiny. On \n     a per aircraft basis, the Army is paying Rosoboronexport more \n     than double what the Russian military itself is paying right \n     now to buy nearly identical helicopters. These facts, taken \n     together with the news report, raise very serious questions \n     about the Army's entire Mi-17 program, including whether the \n     various contracts for procurement and overhaul were the \n     products of criminal misconduct.\n       In light of these ongoing concerns, we urge you to utilize \n     all available resources, including the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation, to support any criminal investigation into \n     these matters. If the allegations are founded, we urge you to \n     ensure the guilty parties are prosecuted to the fullest \n     extent of the law. Thank you for your consideration of this \n     important request.\n           Sincerely,\n         John Cornyn, U.S. Senator; Richard Blumenthal, U.S. \n           Senator; John Boozman, U.S. Senator; Mark Kirk, U.S. \n           Senator; Kelly Ayotte, U.S. Senator; Mark Begich, U.S. \n           Senator; Roger F.

I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I very much support the nomination of Alan Estevez to be \nPrincipal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology \nand Logistics.\n  Mr. Estevez is a career civil servant who has served under Presidents \nof both political parties since 1981, when he started work at the \nMilitary Traffic Management Command. Over the last 30 years, Mr. \nEstevez has developed an expertise in military logistics, eventually \nrising to become the first career Federal official to hold the position \nof Assistant Secretary of Defense for Logistics and Materiel Readiness, \na position in which he provides civilian oversight for more than $190 \nbillion of DOD logistics operations. He previously played a key role in \nreengineering Department of Defense transportation processes and in \nhelping to address logistics deficiencies identified during Operation \nDesert Shield.\n  Mr. Estevez is the recipient of the 2010 Presidential Rank \nDistinguished Executive Award and the 2006 Presidential Rank \nMeritorious Executive Award, two Office of the Secretary of Defense \nmedals for Meritorious Civilian Service, and the 2005 Service to \nAmerica Medal awarded by the Partnership for Public Service.\n  He is extremely well qualified for this position. I am pleased we \nhave now achieved cloture so his nomination may be voted on at noon.\n  I don't know of opposition to him and his personal qualifications. I \nunderstand the debate over the helicopter issue. He is not the one who \nordered nor can he reverse it. That issue is an issue which has been \nraised by a number of Senators, including the Senator from Texas. \nSenator Blumenthal has raised it in committee as well.\n  The letter that went out to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs has not \nyet been answered. However, I have spoken to General Dunford about this \nmatter, and I will have more to say about that when this issue is \nraised either on the Defense authorization bill or on some other \nmatter.\n  For the time being, let me say simply that helicopter is a \nrequirement which has been set by our generals, not by our Pentagon \npeople, civilians. It is a top priority that the Afghans be supplied \nthat helicopter because it is the one they have flown. The Army of \nAfghanistan has used that helicopter. So without getting into the \nmerits of this, because this is left for a later time by the Senator \nfrom Texas, I am grateful the debate cannot be connected to the Estevez \nnomination, where it has no relevance, since he didn't accept the \nrequirement nor can he reverse the decision. It will be set for a later \ntime--hopefully, after the Senators receive the answer to the letter \nthey sent to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  I very strongly support the Estevez nomination and look forward to a \nconfirmation vote, either by voice vote or rollcall vote, as necessary, \nat noon. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I come to the floor today to speak \non two separate and distinct matters relating to the military.\n\n\n                      Remembering Our Armed Forces\n\n                            Justin Eldridge\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, no one in this body other than I had \nthe privilege to know Justin Eldridge of Waterford, CT. Justin was a \ntrue American hero, a patriot--a U.S. marine who served our country in \nAfghanistan and who scarcely more than 24 hours ago took his own life \nat his home. My thoughts and prayers are with Justin's wife Joanna and \ntheir four children and all of Justin's family and friends, fellow \nmarines, who grieve his loss at this difficult time.\n  I first came to know Justin when he formed a chapter of the Marine \nCorps League in southeastern Connecticut. He believed deeply in the \nMarine Corps and in service to his country, his family, and in the \nvalues and traditions and ethos of all of our great U.S. marines and \nthe men and women who wear the uniform.\n  Yesterday, Justin Eldridge lost his own battle--a long battle with \npost-traumatic stress that he fought heroically after serving in the \nMarine Corps for 8\\1/2\\ years before his medical retirement in 2008. \nEven after he returned home from Afghanistan, Justin had a long fight \nahead of him. He returned home with the signature wounds of this war--\nboth traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress--and he worked \nfor years to get the specialized treatment he needed. He tried hard to \nbe there for his family. According to his wife Joanna, his four \nchildren loved having him around.\n  He faced another all-too-common problem in this country--health care \nat the Veterans' Administration and accessing the care he needed. He \nwas admitted to the VA hospital and began a long road of treatment. I \ncannot express in words how deeply sorry I am that treatment evidently \nproved unsuccessful--perhaps not the result of the VA or its doctors or \nits hospital because we are only beginning to learn as a country and \nsociety how to confront post-traumatic stress and traumatic brain \ninjury with the specialized diagnosis and care these diseases demand.\n\n[[Page S7644]]\n\n  Even in grief we should not forget Justin's service to his country \nand his joy and his pride in that service--and he deserved both joy and \npride--as well as his long-fought battle here at home.\n  I wish to take this occasion to encourage anyone who is suffering \nfrom post-traumatic stress, traumatic brain injury, or any other wounds \nof war to reach out for help. The Veterans Crisis Line is there to help \nyou. Anyone who needs that help can call 1-800-273-TALK. Courage is \nshown not only on the battlefield but afterward upon return when an \nindividual in need of help seeks it, as Justin did.\n  Justin's story also reminds us of the heroic caregivers who take care \nof our Nation's veterans. We owe thanks to the people who dedicate \ntheir lives to helping those who have served.\n  Joanna also deserves our thanks because she was there for Justin, by \nhis side throughout his treatment. She never gave up; she never \nrelented; she never surrendered. She was his full-time caregiver, \nparticipating in the VA's caregiver program.\n  Justin himself continued to give back. I will never forget my \nconversations with him at that Marine Corps League event and afterward \nby email and phone.\n  Joanna is a strong advocate for all veterans, as we should all be. \nShe studied psychology in college and hopes to go to law school. She \nwants to dedicate her life to being a veterans advocate, and I commend \nher and all of our military families, all of our military spouses who \nare there for their loved ones who seek to reach out. We need to keep \nfaith with those veterans. We need to know and discover what will \nconquer the demons that often threaten to subdue our bravest and most \nselfless veterans when they come back and to give them the courage and \nthe strength they need to conquer these dreaded diseases that we \nourselves have a complicity in creating. We have an obligation and an \nopportunity to do more and we must keep faith and make sure no veteran \nis left behind.\n\n  My heart and prayers go to Justin's family and, of course, I know I \nam joined by all the Members of this body not only in grieving but in \noffering our help and service if there is anything we can do.\n  Madam President, I would like to speak on a topic that has been \ndiscussed by two of my colleagues this morning, the senior Senator from \nTexas, Senator Cornyn, and the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, Chairman Carl Levin. I thank my colleagues for joining me in \nraising a vital issue that must be addressed by this body and by Alan \nEstevez--a well-qualified nominee for the position of Principal Deputy \nUnder Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics.\n  I will vote for the confirmation today of Alan Estevez. I believe he \nis well qualified and has the credentials to perform with distinction \nin this role. I hope that uppermost on his list of priorities will be \nthe Mi-17 helicopter acquisition that is so misguided and wrongheaded \nin the way it has been handled by our own Department of Defense.\n  If one were to stop at Stella's corner restaurant on Main Street in \nStratford, CT, for lunch or a cup of coffee and ask the folks there: \nWhat do you expect from your government? I think one of the things they \nwould say is they expect the Congress and all of us here to keep our \ncountry safe; and that when it comes to buying the equipment for our \ntroops and allies, we should do so, hands down, no doubt about it, by \nbuying American. It should be made in America, manufactured in \nConnecticut or in the United States. Nothing could be more simple or \nstraightforward. Yet somehow that Main Street common sense is simply \nignored across the river at the Department of Defense, the Pentagon, \nwhere so many decisions are made.\n  Since becoming a member of the Armed Services Committee I have become \naware the Department of Defense committed almost $1 billion to provide \nAfghanistan a fleet of Mi-17 helicopters. Let me clarify: Russian \nhelicopters going to Afghanistan with American tax dollars, bought from \nthe Russian export agency that at the same time is selling arms to \nBashar Assad to kill his own people in Syria.\n  Since 2005, the United States has been procuring Mi-17s to build the \ncapacity of the Afghan military and is working toward a total fleet \nsize of approximately 80 helicopters. The Afghan military had \napproximately 50 Mi-17s as of last year, and this year the Army awarded \na $572 million contract to purchase another 30, with approximately 15 \nmore to come, to replace the aging helicopters the Afghan military has \nalready run into the ground and failed to maintain.\n  The contract to award these helicopters was managed in a way to \nprevent any American helicopter companies from bidding on the work, \neven though the analysis of the Department of Defense in 2010 concluded \nthe made-in-America CH-47D Chinook helicopter is the most cost-\neffective single platform type fleet for the Afghan Air Force over a \n20-year life cycle.\n  I acknowledge I may be partial to helicopters made in Connecticut. \nThe best helicopters in the world are made in Connecticut by the \nSikorsky employees who happen to stop at Stella's on Main Street for \nlunch or a cup of coffee, and I see them there all the time. The H-92 \ntroop transport helicopter or H-60 should also be considered by the \nDepartment of Defense for this mission. But at the end of the day, \n``made in the USA'' ought to be the ruling principle. Made in the USA--\nAmerican helicopters for the American military and American allies.\n  In 2011, the Army contracted with the Russian state-owned arms export \nfirm Rosoboronexport. Yes, the very same Rosoboronexport that arms our \nenemies in Iran and is a key enabler of Assad's ongoing slaughter of \nhis own civilians in Syria. Women and children in Syria die by the arms \nprovided by Rosoboronexport--purchased by Assad with money financed by \nRussian banks and purchased from Rosoboronexport. These are well-\ndocumented crimes against humanity--war crimes that eventually should \nbe prosecuted.\n\n  I am working with my colleague Senator Ayotte on legislation to \nstrengthen the contracting provisions that prohibit ``contracting with \nthe enemy.'' These contracts are, in effect, supporting enemy \npurchases. Before us is a glaring example of contracting with the \nenemy.\n  We have all heard testimony that preventing mass atrocities in Syria \nwas complicated by their air and naval defense systems that prevent the \nprotection of civilians in Syria and threaten its neighbors in Turkey \nand Jordan. Where did those systems come from? The answer is \nRosoboronexport--the same systems that could shoot down our planes if \nwe pursue additional measures against Syrian war crimes, the same \nentity that arms Iran, where we currently are seeking solutions against \nnuclear armament, and where we have said all options should be on the \ntable in terms of our military action. The Department of Defense thinks \nthe best thing for our long-term national security is to pay the \nRussian arms dealer that threatens global stability and our own freedom \nof action.\n  But it gets worse. Without question we have overpaid for these \nRussian helicopters. A general told me the best way to think about \nthese helicopters is they are ``flying refrigerators'' that we never \nshould have bought in the first place. We paid about $18 million a \ncopy, while Russia sold other nations Mi-17s for $4 million each. What \na bargain. Other countries buy each helicopter for $4 million, we pay \n$8 million.\n  And it is still worse. The Army acquisition office that handled this \ncontract is now under investigation for ``questionable transactions,'' \nincluding potentially improper payments to Russian companies involved \nin the repair of these helicopters as well as problematic personal ties \nbetween the Army officials in this office and those foreign entities.\n  If I went to Stella's and I told this absolutely remarkable story, I \nam hoping the folks there would say: No, you must be making this up. \nThis couldn't happen at the U.S. Department of Defense. No way in the \nUnited States of America, not with our tax dollars. But in fact it is \nall true, and I have tried to cite the facts as objectively and \ndispassionately as possible.\n  I suspect for anybody at Stella's who might have believed this \nincredible tale, they would have said: Well, if a tenth of that is \ntrue, what are you going to do to stop it? What are you going to do to \nend this waste of taxpayer money and the insult and outrage to the \nAmerican taxpayer? Well,\n\n[[Page S7645]]\n\nwe did something. At my urging, and through the work of my colleagues \nwho have spoken, including Senator Cornyn, Congress, in the Defense \nAppropriations Act, expressly prohibited the Department of Defense from \nspending any more taxpayer money on Russian helicopters and doing \nbusiness with Rosoboronexport.\n  In fact, I wrote to the Secretary of Defense about this program. I \nhave written numerous letters, and I have met with the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff. Did that stop these purchases? No. The $\\1/2\\ \nbillion contract recently signed, recently completed, now under way by \nthe U.S. Army for more Russian helicopters, used previously \nappropriated funds to ignore the will of Congress. Clearly, the spirit \nand intent of the National Defense Authorization Act was to end these \npurchases. The U.S. Department of Defense, in effect, has defied the \nwill of Congress.\n  So here we are today, almost $1 billion out the door and the near \ncertainty these helicopters are going to be used to smuggle drugs--that \nis right, smuggle drugs in Afghanistan. That purchase has occurred. The \ncontract has been completed. And we can be sure, just as they failed to \nmaintain those helicopters in the past, they will fail again in the \nfuture because the Afghan national security forces don't have the \npeople trained to maintain the helicopters. In fact, right now it \ndoesn't have the people trained to fly those helicopters. And in a few \nyears what the American taxpayer will have to show for this folly is \nrusted scrap heaps at Bagram Air Force Base.\n  I understand that some in the Pentagon started this program with good \nintentions. Their thinking may have been that the Afghans already had \nsome of these helicopters in the process of standing up their \ncapability to defend themselves, they ought to have a few more, and \nthen transition to a more capable helicopter. I have heard from our \ngenerals that we need these helicopters because the Afghans know how to \nfly them. But the fact is this program was never designed to be \nsustainable after we leave Afghanistan. My hope is we will leave \nAfghanistan sooner rather than later. There is simply no transition in \nplace now or in the foreseeable future to buy American, to train those \nAfghan pilots how to fly those American helicopters, how to maintain \nAmerican helicopters.\n\n  When the Russians forced us to procure the helicopters from them \ndirectly, rather than excess helicopters from countries like the Czech \nRepublic, we should have made a course correction immediately, even if \nwe thought those kinds of helicopters were necessary in the short term. \nThere were options and alternatives that should have been pursued and \nthey were not.\n  That is why I believe the plan requested by the senior Senator from \nTexas makes a lot of sense. He has asked the Department of Defense for \nan alternative plan for meeting the Afghan requirements. We cannot walk \naway from a problem that we created. We cannot walk away from the need \nfor a transition. But there is a better way to get there. The answer, \nvery simply, is buy American, buy American helicopters.\n  I expect Mr. Estevez will be confirmed today. But I want to say to \nhim please, as one of your priorities, figure out a way to end these \npurchases from Rosoboronexport. You owe it to the Members of this body. \nYou owe it to the American people to find a way to buy American and to \nkeep faith with the brave men and women who will use the equipment that \nyou will help purchase with taxpayer dollars. I know you take this \nresponsibility seriously, and I hope that you will bring that \nseriousness of purpose to these issues because they are important, not \njust to the military and not just to taxpayers, but most especially to \nthe American men and women who wear the uniform of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I have come to the floor many times over \nthe past several months to outline the problems that we are facing with \nthe rollout of the ObamaCare law, problems that my constituents are \nfacing, as are people all across the country. While it is important to \ndiscuss the generic and macro effects of this law--and we see it \nunrolling before us every day--it is also important to understand what \nthe direct effects are on people at a personal level.\n  Last week, during our break, I traveled throughout Indiana and talked \nto a number of people. Many of them came up to me voluntarily to tell \nme the effects of the confusing, complex, and seemingly intractable \naspects of ObamaCare. Let me read for the record just a couple of \nstatements that were made.\n  An email that I received from Daniel in Elkhart, IN, summarizes the \nexperiences of hundreds of thousands of Hoosiers and millions of \nAmericans are having with the Web site alone. He wrote:\n\n       I have tried for two weeks to apply through the \n     marketplace, only to electronically sign my application and \n     be kicked back to my profile page. This is the most bizarre \n     system I have ever experienced. If a company put a business \n     Web site together like this, they would go out of business.\n\n  Anthony in Indianapolis shared similar concerns. He said:\n\n       I have been unable to get through the healthcare.gov Web \n     site. My wife must notify our insurance company by November \n     15 if she will keep her existing plan . . . I understand \n     there are problems with the Web site. I think we all \n     understand that at this point.\n       I heard the President say you could sign up in person, on \n     the phone or on paper. But the two navigators I called said \n     that until the Web site works, they cannot help. I called the \n     1-800 number but the healthcare.gov rep [said his] computer \n     froze up and could not help. I hear about the tech surge, how \n     there will be a few rough spots--Another understatement--\n\n     and how they will be fixed. Senator, if you listen to the \n     news the problems with the system are much deeper than the \n     President let on [in his] Tuesday [address]. I need help and \n     I don't think the system will be in operation in time for me \n     to make an informed decision.\n\n  These are two statements from only two of the many Hoosiers who \ndescribed similar problems to me--which is probably why, when asked \nabout the ObamaCare Web site, an experienced online and database \nprogrammer told CBS News, ``I would be ashamed and embarrassed if my \norganization delivered something like that.''\n  We know this law passed the Senate on Christmas Eve in 2009 without \nany bipartisan support. One party alone put this law into place. We now \nknow that over $400 million have been spent to create a Web site so \nAmericans who are mandated to enroll in ObamaCare can go and sign up \nfor it. We know that nearly 4 years of notice has been in place to get \nthe Web site up. This roll-out, as one Democratic Senator said over the \nweekend, has been a disaster.\n  If the administration, after nearly 4 years of effort and over $400 \nmillion, can't get the Web site right, how in the world can anybody \nbelieve that the Federal Government can manage this monstrous and \ndysfunctional law that has been imposed on the American people?\n  Despite the Web site's numerous glitches and many other \nimplementation problems, the administration still insists on fining \ntaxpayers if they do not sign up and purchase ObamaCare under the \nmandate. What an irony it is. You need to sign up or you are going to \nget fined. The Web site is so dysfunctional you can't sign up, but you \nare still going to get fined. That is mind-boggling, head-scratching, \nand simply unacceptable.\n  We know that there have been numerous attempts to repeal this law and \nreplace it with something far more acceptable, affordable, and \nimplementable. We now know that the defund effort, that resulted in the \nshutdown, failed to gain the necessary votes to achieve that goal. But \nattempting to repeal this law is the responsible thing to do. In \nSeptember I introduced a bill to delay the roll out of the ObamaCare \nmandates for a year. As the problems with the health care law pile up, \nI am going to continue to push for this delay. The delay makes sense \nbecause the program is simply too dysfunctional to be implemented.\n\n  The bottom line, however, is that I want this delay so the American \npeople have another chance to learn what is in this law, to evaluate as \nto whether or not they want this to go forward as the health care law \nof the United States or\n\n[[Page S7646]]\n\nwhether they think a viable alternative is that we have the \nresponsibility to put forward--and many of us have advocated components \nof that--whether or not that alternative is the better way to go.\n  I know it has been said by the President and others that in 2012 the \npublic went to the polls to vote for the Presidential election. \nTherefore, that vote certified that the American people supported and \nwanted ObamaCare.\n  First of all, that was not the primary issue. It was one of the \nissues that was a determinative factor in the outcome of that election \nbut not nearly ``the'' factor, because most Americans at that point \nstill had not had the opportunity or the experience that they are \nhaving now, finding out exactly just how this law works and does not \nwork; finding out all the dysfunction and learning that all of those \ncampaign promises made or promises made when the law was passed have \nsimply been broken. ``You can keep the insurance policy that you have \nnow. No problem. Won't cost a penny more. No problem.''\n  On and on it goes. ``Keep the doctor that you want.'' Americans are \nfinding out that none of this is true. ``Premiums will not rise.'' \nPremiums are rising for many Americans. ``This will be easy. Go to a \nWeb site, sign up, punch in, put your name in, you are on board. \nEverything will be great.''\n  None of this has worked. Why not delay this process, not just to \nlearn what is here, but to give the American people another opportunity \nto vote, to walk into the polling booth. A number of Members will have \nto stand up and either explain why they supported this or why they \ndidn't support it. Americans will have a choice. We will put \nalternatives in front of them.\n  That is the purpose of the delay for a year: No. 1, because it is \ndysfunctional; No. 2, because Americans deserve a second chance to \nexpress their opinions on this bill. This has already been passed by \nthe House of Representatives. My colleague, Representative Todd Young \nof Indiana sponsored that. It gained bipartisan support, and 22 \nDemocrats, House Democrats, recognized the need to give Americans the \nsame relief from ObamaCare that businesses are receiving. Delay on the \nemployer mandate, which the President has proposed and put into \npractice, and doing that for the individuals and families who do not \nfall under the employer category only, is a matter of fairness. That \nalso is something that has to be addressed.\n  Recently, several Senate Democrats have come out in support of \ndelaying parts or all of the President's health care law as well. I \nthink the opportunity is before us to put the brakes on trying to jam \nthrough something that simply is dysfunctional and not working and \nsecondly to give the American people the opportunity to go back to the \npolls and decide whether or not this is the way they want their health \ncare programs to go forward.\n  We have had nothing but broken promises. We are learning about how \ndifficult it is for the Government to manage even the first step, let \nalone the one-sixth of the economy that deals with our health care. \nThis is important for all Americans. I am urging my colleagues to \nsupport this effort to give the American people another chance to look \nat a more viable and more affordable alternative.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to \naddress the Senate for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity \nto say a few words today in support of my fellow Coloradan, Katherine \nArchuleta, and her nomination to be Director of the Office of Personnel \nManagement. I have known her for years and have tremendous respect for \nher. She has given much of her life to public service, and her \ndedication to her community, her State, and her country is a testament \nto her character. I am very confident that she will be a steady hand at \nthe helm of OPM. I urge all my colleagues to support her confirmation.\n  Not everyone watching may be familiar with the Office of Personnel \nManagement, but it is an important agency. Let me talk about Colorado \nin that context. Thousands of Federal employees are in Colorado, \nincluding those who are helping to rebuild our State in the wake of \nSeptember's tragic flooding count on OPM. It is a critical part of the \nintegrity and strength of the entire Federal workforce. It is \nresponsible, among other duties, for employee recruitment and employee \nretention and for managing Federal benefit and retirement programs.\n  We all expect Federal agencies and departments to function \neffectively and efficiently for our constituents. As someone who ran a \nnonprofit in Colorado for 10 years, I know the importance of \nmaintaining a talented and motivated workforce. Strong workforce \nmanagement leads directly to better work, better service, and better \noutcomes, which is why it is so important to have someone leading OPM \nwho is an advocate for Federal employees and also a strong manager with \nhigh expectations.\n  Again, that is why I stand here this morning. I believe Katherine \nwill be this type of leader. She has years of high-level management \nexperience. She is sharp, hard working, and she is dedicated to the \ngoal of making government work as effectively and efficiently as \npossible.\n  She has an impressive resume, as I noted at her hearing when I had an \nopportunity to introduce her. She has local and State-level experience. \nShe served senior roles in two Denver mayoral administrations as well \nas extensive experience here in Washington serving as the chief of \nstaff to the former U.S. Secretary of Transportation Federico Pena in \nthe 1990s, and more recently to U.S. Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis.\n  In between her years of public service in Denver and also in \nWashington, Katherine consulted with charities, nonprofits, cities, \nregional governments, and businesses to help them pursue community \ndevelopment, workplace diversity, and crisis management strategies.\n  If you look for a common thread throughout Katherine's career, it is \nher capacity and talent to work with individuals and organizations, \nidentify priorities, and then, notably, to create the conditions for \nsuccessful implementation of those priorities. That is what we need at \nthe helm of OPM. It is what Americans expect and demand.\n  As we look at Katherine's career, she has demonstrated an ability to \nlead, to motivate, and to work constructively with a diverse range of \npeople and personalities. She is a true westerner. She has personal \nintegrity. She has a strong sense of right and wrong, she has obvious \npride in the work she does, and that makes her a topnotch choice to \nlead our Federal workforce.\n  For all those reasons, I am honored to speak in support of Katherine \nArchuleta's nomination, and hopefully we will confirm her quickly. She \nis eminently qualified for this position, and she deserves an up-or-\ndown vote as soon as possible.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). All time has expired.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Alan F. Estevez, of the District of Columbia, to be a Principal \nDeputy Under Secretary of Defense?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report the nomination.\n  The bill clerk read the nomination of Katherine Archuleta, of \nColorado, to be Director of the Office of Personnel Management.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to the provisions of S. Res. 15 of \nthe 113th Congress, there will now be up to 8 hours of postcloture \nconsideration of the nomination equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise to speak on this nomination and to \noppose it because of the recent actions of the Office of Personnel \nManagement with regard to the Washington exemption from ObamaCare. I \nvoted just now against cloture on the nomination, and I will vote \nagainst the nomination itself later today because of these very serious \nmatters.\n  OPM, the office to which this nominee is nominated and which she \nwould head, has issued an illegal rule that is very offensive and flies \nin the face of the ObamaCare statute language itself, and this nominee \nhas pledged to continue to enforce that illegal rule and illegal \npolicy.\n  Furthermore, OPM has completely stonewalled Members, including \nmyself, my colleague Senator Heller, and others regarding how they came \nto that decision and, importantly, whom they talked with, whom they e-\nmailed with, and whom they met with in coming to the decision to create \nthis illegal Washington exemption.\n  Let me back up a little bit and explain exactly what we are talking \nabout. Really, this story started several years ago in the ObamaCare \ndebate. During the original debate on the ObamaCare statute, several \nconservatives, including myself, pushed an amendment that said every \nMember of Congress and all of our official congressional staff have to \nuse the same fallback plan as is there for all other Americans--\noriginally, it was called the public option, and then it became known \nas the exchanges--no special rules, no special treatment, no special \nsubsidy. In fact, that is one of the very few battles in that debate we \nwon because that provision was adopted during the consideration of the \nObamaCare statute. It was adopted right here in the Senate.\n  So in the statutory language as it finally passed into law is that \nsection, and that section says very clearly that every Member of \nCongress and all of our official congressional staff have to go to the \nObamaCare exchanges for our health care--the same fallback plan as is \nthere for all other Americans--no special rules or privileges or \nsubsidies or exemptions. We go there. Well, I guess this became an \nexample of what Nancy Pelosi was talking about when she famously said: \nWell, we have to pass the law in order to figure out what is in it--\nbecause the law did pass. It had that specific statutory provision. \nThen people on Capitol Hill started reading it, and they came to that \nsection and a lot of them said: Oh, you know what. We can't live with \nthis. We can't have this. We can't be pushed to the same fallback plan \nas all other Americans. We can't stand for this.\n  From that moment on, a furious lobbying campaign and scheming behind \nthe scenes started to avoid that provision fully going into effect, to \navoid the pain of that provision, the pain of ObamaCare that millions \nof other Americans are facing as we speak. Meetings happened, \nleadership meetings happened, Member meetings happened, furious \nscheming behind the scenes, and a lot of lobbying. Ultimately, that \nlobbying of the Obama administration paid off because in early August \nof this year, right after Congress got out of town for the August \nrecess, conveniently right after Congress left the scene of the crime, \nthe Obama administration issued a special rule with no basis in the \nlaw, in my opinion, no basis in the ObamaCare statute. This special \nrule was a special exemption for Congress, a carve-out to take all of \nthe financial sting out of that ObamaCare section.\n  What this special OPM rule is--and, again, OPM, the Office of \nPersonnel Management, was the agency that came up with this illegal \nrule after this furious lobbying, after President Obama became \npersonally involved, literally personally participated in the \ndiscussions leading to this rule. What this illegal rule does is \nessentially two things. First of all, the rule says: Well, ``official \ncongressional staff''--we do not know who that is. We cannot possibly \ndetermine who official congressional staff are, so we are going to \nleave it up to each individual Member of Congress to figure out who is \ntheir official staff.\n  Well, I would submit that is just ludicrous on its face. \nCongressional staff is congressional staff. Official staff is anyone \nwho works for us through the institution of Congress versus outside \nentities and institutions, such as our campaign staff. So leaving it up \nto each individual Member of Congress is contrary to the statute on its \nface. It is outrageous on its face. But under this OPM rule, that is \nexactly what they do. So an individual Member of Congress can say: \nWell, these 10 people are not official staff. They are on my staff, but \nfor some magical reason they are not official for purposes of this \nmandate. In fact, under this rule a Member can say: Nobody on my \ncongressional staff is official staff for purposes of this mandate. And \nwe see Members doing that as we speak. We see examples of that being \nreported in the press as we speak--Members deciding, ``Well, nobody is \nofficial staff. I do not have official staff'' because it will mean \nthey will have to go to the ObamaCare exchange and live by the same \nrules through the same experience as other Americans. That is flatout \nridiculous.\n  But that is not the only thing the OPM rule did. It did a second \nthing that is perhaps even more outrageous. It said Members of Congress \nand staff who do go to the exchange--they get to take along with them a \nhuge taxpayer-funded subsidy that no other American at similar income \nlevels has, enjoys, going to the ObamaCare exchanges. This is a huge \nsubsidy worth at least $5,000 for individuals and $10,000 or $11,000 \nfor families. Again, no other American at similar income levels is \nprivy to that sort of subsidy.\n  Again, I believe this part of the OPM rule is flatout illegal. It is \nnot in the ObamaCare statute. There was discussion of it. There were \ndrafts that allowed that to happen, but the language that was put in \nthe law did not include that subsidy. It was specifically left out. \nAnd, in fact, magically transforming what was, under previous law, a \nFederal employees health benefits plan subsidy, magically transforming\n\n[[Page S7648]]\n\nthat into some ObamaCare exchange subsidy--that is contrary to law, and \nthat is beyond OPM and the administration's legal authority, but they \njust did it because they could to bail out Washington, to bail out \nCongress. Well, this is outrageous and it is illegal.\n\n  As soon as I heard of this proposed rule in early August, I joined \nwith many colleagues, House and Senate, and I appreciate all of their \nleadership. I am joined by many colleagues in the Senate whom I \nspecifically want to acknowledge, who are fighting for this change: \nSenators Enzi, Heller, Lee, Johnson, Inhofe, Cruz, and Graham. We are \nalso joined by House Members, led by Representative Ron DeSantis of \nFlorida. All of us quickly got together and said: This is illegal, this \nis wrong, and we have to stop it.\n  So we came up with language to do just that, to reverse this illegal \nOPM rule and to make sure that every Member of Congress and all of our \ncongressional staff go to the ObamaCare exchanges and that we go there \njust like other Americans go there--no special exemption or special \nsubsidy or special treatment. Our fix also expands that to the \nPresident, the Vice President, their White House staff, and all of \ntheir political appointees because that is appropriate as well. So our \nlanguage says to all those folks--Congress and the administration--you \nhave to get your health care the same way other Americans are in the \nbackup plan, in the fallback plan, in the so-called exchanges. You go \nto the exchanges, and you get no special treatment, no special \nexemption, no special subsidy.\n  This is very important for two reasons. First of all, basic fairness. \nIt should be the first rule of American democracy that what Washington \npasses on America, it lives with itself. Washington should have to eat \nits own cooking. It is like going to a restaurant and hearing that the \nchef in the kitchen never eats there. Something is wrong with that \nrestaurant. Something is wrong with that picture. And something is \nwrong with Washington when Washington exempts itself over and over from \neating its own cooking.\n  The second reason this is important is a very practical one because \nthe sooner we demand that Washington live by exactly the same rules it \nimposes on America, the sooner Washington will start getting things \nright on ObamaCare, on taxes, on regulation across the board. So for \nthat very practical reason, we need to make sure the same rules apply \nto Washington the same way they apply to the rest of America.\n  Let me come back to OPM because what we are debating is the nominee \nto head the Office of Personnel Management, OPM, the bureaucracy that \ncame up with this illegal rule. That nominee has pledged to continue to \nenforce that illegal rule, to continue to defend that illegal rule.\n  Also, OPM, to date, has been completely unresponsive--\n``stonewalling'' is the more appropriate term--to all of my and other \nMembers' inquiries about the process they used to come up with this \nillegal rule. I have written OPM several times. I wrote them \nimmediately after their draft rule was issued. I wrote them very soon \nafter their final rule was issued. I specifically wrote them demanding \nall emails and other correspondence and other documentation and \ninformation they had from Members of Congress, from leadership, from \nthe administration with regard to the work and discussion that went \ninto their rule.\n  Other colleagues of ours here in the Senate and also in the House \nhave done the same. My distinguished colleague from Nevada Dean Heller \ntalked to the then-OPM Director face to face. He asked the OPM \nDirector: Did you speak with, were you lobbied by Members of Congress \nor the administration about this rule? That Director said: No, \nabsolutely not. It now turns out that apparently is a lie. According to \nother sources, there absolutely were discussions, communications, \nemails, and the like between congressional leadership and the \nadministration and OPM. So Dean Heller was lied to face to face about \nthis by OPM.\n  I have asked for all of the emails, all of the correspondence, all of \nthe discussions that happened leading up to this rule involving Members \nof Congress, leadership, and also the President and the Vice President \nand members of their administration. That request for information has \nbeen completely stonewalled.\n  So, first, OPM caves to intense lobbying from Washington insiders. \nSecond, it caves and issues an illegal rule contrary to the statutory \nlanguage of ObamaCare. Third, it stonewalls regarding the process and \nthe conversations and the emails that led to that illegal rule.\n  We cannot stand for that. That is precisely why I am opposing this \nOPM nomination and why I voted no on cloture and why I will vote no on \nthe nomination. We need answers. We need to reverse this illegal rule. \nYes, we need a vote on the Vitter amendment the distinguished majority \nleader and others have blocked for months now. We need that vote. We \nneed that vote that has been actively blocked by the majority leader \nfor months.\n  Let's do things right. Let's get that information from OPM. Let's \nreverse this illegal rule. Let's vote on this important matter.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             The Farm Bill\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, this afternoon the 2013 farm bill \nconference committee will finally convene for the first time, bringing \nus one step closer to finishing the farm bill. I know the Presiding \nOfficer, being from Wisconsin, understands how important this is to our \ncountry's future, and certainly the farmers, businesses, and families \nin Minnesota understand how important this bill is. We have waited a \nlong time to go to this conference committee. The Senate has passed two \nfarm bills now that continue the strong policies of the last farm bill \nbut in fact reduce the debt by $24 billion over the farm bill that is \ncurrently in place. I am part of the group that negotiated the details \nof the bill to help finish the process which started over 2 years ago.\n  Before I go on about the details of the Senate bill, I thank Chairman \nStabenow for her incredible leadership and perseverance in getting us \nto this point that has been so long awaited. Under Chairman Stabenow's \nleadership, the Senate Agriculture Committee put together a farm bill \nthat strengthens the safety net for our Nation's farmers and ranchers, \nreforms and streamlines our agriculture, conservation, and nutrition \nprograms while still keeping them strong, and, as I mentioned, reduces \n$24 billion from the Nation's debt.\n  Throughout the process we faced unprecedented challenges and delay. \nWe had the lack of a dance partner over in the House, but then of \ncourse we had the traditional issues--regional disputes about how \ncertain crops and commodities should be handled, a few partisan issues \nhere and there, but somehow we were able to come together to the point \nwhere the Senate bill was supported by 68 Senators, including 18 \nRepublicans. I believe this is a testament to the open process we had, \nthe endless amendments we voted on on the floor, as well as the strong \ncommittee that was brought together to work on this bill.\n  No matter where I go in my State--and I am sure the Presiding Officer \nhas seen this in Wisconsin--I am always reminded of the critical role \nagriculture plays in our economy. Minnesota is No. 1 in turkeys--\nsomething we think of a lot as we head into the Thanksgiving season. We \nare No. 1 in sweet corn, green peas, and oats, and No. 2 in hogs. I \ndon't think people would think about that with our State, but we have \nsurpassed some other States. But we are No. 2 in hogs and spring wheat, \nand No. 3 in soybeans, and No. 4 in corn.\n  But we don't just grow the crops and raise the livestock. We are also \nhome to a number of major agricultural companies which have kept our \neconomy strong, and is one of the reasons our unemployment rate is down \nto 5.1 percent in Minnesota. These companies include Hormel, Cargill, \nGeneral Mills, coops such as CHS, and Land o' Lakes. That is why one of \nthe first things I did when I came to the Senate was ask to be on the \nAgriculture Committee. I am honored to serve on this conference \ncommittee and to team up with my friend and House colleague, \nRepresentative Collin Peterson, who will be\n\n[[Page S7649]]\n\nleading the Democratic side in the House, as well as Congressman Tim \nWells who represents the southern part of our State.\n  The expiration of the current farm bill on September 30 is hurting \nour agricultural economy and is creating a huge amount of uncertainty \nfor our farmers and for our consumers. Last week I visited with \nMinnesotans from across the State who want Congress to pass a farm \nbill. I was in Kiester, MN, where I got to ride in a combine and see \nthe good work of our farmers as they harvested the corn. I have to say \nthat sitting in the combine after the 3 weeks of the shutdown was \nactually quite rewarding, as I saw firsthand you could actually get \nresults very quickly in a combine, which I hope will happen in Congress \nas we move ahead.\n  From farmers in Redwood County to the Red River Valley to volunteers \nat a food bank in Minneapolis, where we also had a joint event with \nhunger groups, conservation groups, including Pheasants Forever, which \nis based in Minnesota, and the Farm Bureau and the Farmers Union, we \nall came together to say we had to get this done.\n  I journeyed up to the Moorhead area and joined Senator Hoeven in \nFargo. We like to call it Moorhead-Fargo in Minnesota instead of Fargo-\nMoorhead--two towns divided by a river but joined by many common \ninterests. We met there with farmers about the importance of sugar \nbeets and about the importance of a strong farm bill for that region of \nthe country.\n  Through my week I quickly heard--as I am sure the Presiding Officer \ndid in Wisconsin--that the people of this country are sick and tired of \ngridlock politics, they are sick and tired of people standing in \nopposite corners of the boxing ring and throwing punches. They are sick \nand tired of the red-light, green-light game that has been played with \npolicy. It is time to come together and get this done.\n  I am convinced if there is any silver lining or hope that came out of \nthe chaos of last month, it is that the American people saw firsthand \nwhy we need change and why we need to work together. That is why in \nfact Senator Hoeven and I came together across the river, to make a \nvery strong statement that we thought we had to get this bill done.\n  As a member of the conference committee, I know that if we don't pass \na new farm bill, farmers will not be able to sign up for crop \ninsurance, something that is so central to this new bill and is part of \nthe $24 billion in debt reduction. They won't be able to sign up for a \nconservation program at a time when we need more conservation, when we \nsee a decline in our pheasant population, where we have seen the signs \nthat we need to have strong conservation programs. We would also see a \nskyrocketing of dairy prices as we would be going back to the farm bill \nthat was passed in 1949. As I like to say at home, we don't want to \nparty like it is 1949, and we certainly don't want to farm like it is \n1949.\n  The failure to come together and resolve the differences between the \ntwo bills now would likely result in either 1949 prices or some kind of \nextension. And guess what. Ask the farmers and ranchers about that in \nSouth Dakota who just saw a decimation of their cattle because of the \nsudden cold weather and blizzard they experienced in South Dakota. This \ncurrent bill that is in place does nothing to provide a safety net for \nthem that used to be in place but isn't in place because of the fact we \nhaven't passed a permanent farm bill.\n  It does nothing, if we simply extended it, about energy programs or \nabout changes we need to see in the milk program or about reforms or \nthe streamlining of our conservation programs. We simply cannot afford \nto do that again.\n  Finally, it does nothing to reduce the debt if we simply extend the \ncurrent program.\n  Farmers and ranchers do not want another extension like the one we \nsaw last year that left out the programs I just mentioned, the \nlivestock disaster program, any significant deficit reduction. I \nbelieve the Senate bill lays a strong foundation for a conference \nagreement that can be supported on a bipartisan basis and signed into \nlaw by the President. To put it more directly, over the weekend I got a \ncall from Greg Schwarz, who works with the Minnesota corn growers. He \nwas hard at work, bringing in the harvest. He actually was calling me \nwhile driving his combine. His words offer some perspective, as they \nwere passed on to me, about where we have been and where we need to go. \nHe said:\n\n       We have been working on this farm bill for over 2 years \n     now, and we just want to get it done. Farmers are working \n     around the clock on this year's harvest, and if you don't \n     hear from us, it is not because we don't care, it's because \n     we have work to do.\n\n  Greg is right. Members of the farm bill conference committee have \nwork to do as well. I believe that Washington should strive to be more \nlike the farmers and ranchers that we represent who work and hope they \nget the job done. They can't leave a bunch of corn or soybeans in the \nfield just because they get sick of it or they don't like their \nneighbor. They have to finish the job. If it starts getting cold or if \nit is raining, they have to bring that harvest in before there is a \nblizzard. That is what they do, and that is what we need to do. We have \na time deadline here, an important reason we need to get moving on this \nbill.\n  I would like to highlight some areas of the Senate bill that I \nbelieve need to be preserved as part of the final agreement as near as \npossible to the way they are right now. I recognize there will be some \ncompromise, but I think whatever compromise needs to be worked out \nshould be closer to the bipartisan Senate bill that, as we know, had \nthe support of 18 Senate Republicans, including Senators in my part of \nthe country such as Senator Grassley and Senator Hoeven.\n  I know that important differences need to be worked out, especially \nin the areas of nutrition. I think we can do that. But, again, given \nwhat we are seeing in terms of the cuts over on the House side, we have \nto get them much closer to where we are in the Senate bill, which is \nsomething that will keep a safety net not just for our farmers, not \njust for our conservation and our pheasants and our wildlife, but also \nfor the people of this country.\n  I believe the people who grow our food deserve to know that their \nlivelihoods cannot be swept away in the blink of an eye, either by \nmarket failures or by natural disasters. That is why in the Senate farm \nbill the foundation of the safety net is a strengthened crop insurance \nprogram. We made the program work better for underserved commodities \nand specialty crops.\n  In recognition of the importance of crop insurance, we extended \nconservation compliance rules to this program to ensure that all \nproducers benefiting from this safety net play by the same set of rules \nand keep our water clean and soil productive for future generations.\n  This agreement has the support of agriculture, environmental wildlife \nleaders, including the National Farmers Union and the National Corn \nGrowers Association, as well as the Environmental Defense Fund and \nDucks Unlimited. That is quite a crew.\n  In our charge to do more with fewer resources, the Senate bill pulls \nback on crop insurance subsidies for the wealthiest farmers, while \nensuring that everyone can still participate in the program, keeping \nthe risk pool strong. We also eliminated direct payments and further \nfocused commodity title programs on our family farmers by strengthening \npayment limits on rules that ensure that farmers and not urban \nmillionaires are eligible for farm payments.\n  We continued the successful sugar program, funded the livestock \ndisaster programs, which I mentioned earlier, and put in place a new \nsafety net for dairy producers to address the wild volatility in that \nmarket. No one knows that better than those in the State of Wisconsin, \nthe home of a lot of cheese, the home of a lot of cows and a lot of \ndairy.\n  We streamlined conservation programs from 23 to 13. Specifically, I \nworked with Collin Peterson to ensure that local communities such as \nthose in the Red River Valley have tools they need to address \nconservation challenges like flooding. The bill funds energy title \nprograms to extend homegrown renewable energy production.\n  When you look at our reduction in dependence on foreign oil, from 60 \nto 40 percent in just the last few years--yes, you look at the \nincreased domestic drilling and natural gas; yes, you look at the facts \nthat we finally increased\n\n[[Page S7650]]\n\ngas mileage standards that made a big difference in this country, but \nyou also look at biofuels which are now 10 percent of our Nation's fuel \nsupply.\n  These bills ensure that we are working to support our farmers and \nworkers in the Midwest and not the oil cartels in the Middle East. That \nis why I strongly support mandatory funding for the energy titles to \nhelp provide incentives for homegrown energy production from the next \ngeneration of biofuels to blender pumps. This is a vital industry in \nStates such as mine, supporting thousands of jobs and millions of \ndollars in economic growth. I appreciate the support of my colleague \nSenator Franken for this important industry. As many of us understand, \nwe want an ``all of the above'' energy approach that includes oil, \nincludes natural gas, but also includes biofuels.\n  The Senate bill ensures that our energy innovators have the certainty \nand stability they need to develop the next generation of American \nenergy.\n  The Senate bill also includes a number of initiatives for beginning \nfarmers and ranchers, including two of my provisions. The first \nprovision I produced with Senator Baucus, which would reduce crop \ninsurance costs for beginning farmers by 10 percent. The second \nprovision that I have introduced with Senators Johanns, Baucus, and \nHoeven would allow beginning producers to use conservation reserve \nprogram acres for grazing without a penalty. I believe that both of \nthese provisions will go a long way in building the next generation of \nfarmers who will grow our food supply. Both of these provisions should \nbe included in the final bill.\n  I believe that if we want to recruit a new generation of farmers and \nranchers we must take further action to improve the quality of life in \nour small towns and our rural areas. That is why I worked with Senators \nHoeven and Heitkamp, and I led the amendment to provide additional \nresources for critical priorities in the farm bill, including \nresearch--something the Presiding Officer knows something about from \nthe University of Wisconsin--as well as rural development, \nconservation, and energy.\n  Our provision funds the new nonprofit foundation, the Foundation for \nFood and Agricultural Research, to leverage private funding with a \nFederal match to support agricultural research. It provides additional \nfunds to address the $3.2 billion backlog of water and wastewater \nprojects in rural America. You literally cannot go to a region of any \nState in rural America without hearing about this backlog of rural \nwastewater and water projects. This amendment that we passed helps with \nthat.\n  It also increases funding for a regional approach to conservation to \naddress a variety of challenges, including the flooding that we saw in \nthe Red River Valley. The provision also added an additional $100 \nmillion to the energy title to help farmers, ranchers, and rural \nbusinesses produce homegrown energy. I was pleased to get the strong \nsupport of our committee for that amendment, and I am pleased it is \nincluded in the final Senate bill.\n  In the Senate we also preserve the essential nutrition programs that \nmillions of families and children rely on every day. In recent years, \nprograms such as the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, also \nknown as SNAP, became especially important as hard-working families and \nseniors were suddenly cashed-strapped but still in need of groceries. \nOne of my predecessors--in fact I have his desk--Vice President Hubert \nH. Humphrey, was an early champion of the food stamp program now known \nas SNAP. As one of the founders--Humphrey was one of the founders of \nthe Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party in Minnesota--he understood the \nimportance of a stable government policy for both agricultural \nproducers as well as families struggling to put food on the table.\n  That is why we have always seen this combination of these programs. \nIt makes sense--food comes from farms. Food is a safety net for the \npeople of this country, as are the farm provisions, which are actually \na minority of the provisions in this bill. The farm provisions provide \na safety net for those who provide food. What we have done with this \nbill, of course, is reduce some costs and made it more efficient but \nstill kept a strong safety net.\n  For more than 40 years we have linked together food and farm policy \nin 5-year farm bills. Nearly 72 percent of the SNAP participants are \nfamilies with children, and more than one quarter of participants are \nin households with seniors or people with disabilities. This is not the \ntime to make the deep cuts, as proposed in the House bill, to programs \nthat provide important nutritional support for working families, low-\nincome seniors, and people with disabilities with fixed incomes.\n  Yet what we have seen is that those cuts--which we will be \ndiscussing--on the House side include 170,000 veterans who would be cut \noff from food assistance if the House bill were to pass. The Senate \nbill, on the other hand, makes reforms that were necessary, that bring \nthe debt down by $4 billion, reforms that were necessary. So it is not \nlike there were no reforms to this program in the Senate bill. As I \nnoted, 68 Senators voted for this bipartisan bill, including 18 \nRepublicans.\n  The cuts proposed by the House are in addition to the $11 billion \ncuts to the program that will go into place this Friday, when the \nAmerican Reinvestment and Recovery Act supplemental nutrition payments \nexpire.\n  This program is already moving in the right direction. As the economy \nhas improved, nutrition assistance has been further focused on families \nin areas with the greatest need. In fact, the CBO projects that without \nany changes to the program, the number of people eligible for nutrition \nassistance and the cost of nutrition programs will continue to fall as \nthe economy improves. In this way, nutrition programs operate a lot \nlike the farm safety net for agricultural producers. Just as \nagriculture payments spiked during the 2012 drought, which was the \nworst since the 1950s, the need for nutrition assistance, for example, \nsimilarly increased when our economy was struck with the worst \nrecession since the 1930s.\n  When farmers are blessed with a strong harvest or when workers bring \nhome a paycheck from a new job, we have designed agriculture and \nnutrition programs to adjust accordingly and be reduced.\n  I believe that instead of trying to find ways to make people \nineligible for nutrition assistance, we need to focus on real solutions \nthat put people back to work. This farm bill is an opportunity to do \nthat, as are a number of these efforts--Innovate America, workforce \ntraining--and bringing in other things we should be focused on, \nbringing the tax reform in, bringing the corporate tax rate down and \npaid for. But if we continue to engage in the brinkmanship as we did in \nthe last month we will never get to the core issue. I believe our \ncountry is on the cusp of economic expansion. I believe we have so many \nopportunities out there when you look at how we are situated with the \nincrease in manufacturing and exports. We need to do work with the \nimmigration bill to help the economy move forward, instead of what we \nwent through last month.\n  I think this farm bill is the first chance to show that, out of this \nchaos, came something positive. It is a 5-year farm bill. It worked in \nthe past. It brings the debt down by $24 billion. It is a bipartisan \nbill. Let's show the people of America that we mean business about \nworking across the aisle.\n  I see my colleagues here from Tennessee. I have just about 3 minutes \nmore on a very different topic, and that is the nomination of Patty \nMillett to the DC Circuit Court.\n  In the past few weeks, as I mentioned, we have made some efforts to \ncome together and get work done on behalf of the American people. There \nare many of us who work together in relationships of trust, and I hope \nthat continues with regard to nominations.\n  Patty Millett would make an excellent addition to the court on the DC \nCircuit, and I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture and to confirm \nher without delay.\n  Patty Millett has extensive Federal appellate and Supreme Court \nexperience. She previously served 15 years as an attorney on the \nappellate staff of the U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Division, and \nthen as an assistant to the Solicitor General. She has argued 32 cases \nin the Supreme Court--32--in addition to dozens of cases in other \nappellate courts across the country. In addition to her work for the \nJustice Department and in private practice, she has also devoted \nsubstantial time\n\n[[Page S7651]]\n\nto pro bono work. Ms. Millett clearly has an impressive professional \nbackground, but even outside the legal world she volunteers as a \nliteracy tutor and for the homeless in the DC area.\n  She was given the Attorney General's Distinguished Service Award for \nrepresenting the interests of the United States before the Supreme \nCourt and the National Association of Attorneys General award for \nassistance to the States in preparation for their appearances before \nthe Supreme Court. Ms. Millett is the kind of woman we should have on \nthe bench. It should be no surprise that the nonpartisan American Bar \nAssociation committee that reviews every Federal judicial nominee \nunanimously gave her its highest rating, and over 100 leading lawyers \nand law professors wrote a letter in support of her nomination. This \nletter included 7 former Solicitors General who served under Democratic \nand Republican Presidents alike.\n  Clearly there can be no question she has the experience and ability \nto sit on the Federal bench. She also has the support of the Fraternal \nOrder of Police, the Police Executive Research Forum, the National \nWomen's Law Center, the Women's Bar Association, and the National \nCongress of American Indians.\n  Ms. Millett is well qualified, and we should confirm her now.\n  One justification--and there is only one that I have heard and I \ndon't think it is a good one, and I am about to debunk it. The only \njustification I have heard is not about her at all, it is about the DC \nCircuit. Some of my colleagues think they should remain with three \nopenings on the bench. I don't think this argument squares with the \nfacts. Currently, 3 of the 11 seats on the DC Circuit are empty. \nAccording to the Administrative Office of the Courts, senior judges--\njudges who are partially retired--are now involved in over 40 percent \nof the cases that are decided on the merits.\n\n  Before he was our Supreme Court Justice, John Roberts was confirmed \nto sit on the DC Circuit. Ten years ago when Chief Justice Roberts was \nconfirmed to sit on that circuit, the average judge on that court had \nonly 125 pending cases. Today, with 3 vacancies on the court, that \nnumber is 185 cases. Those are the complex cases that are pending. Even \nif we fill all the empty slots, the judges on the DC Circuit will still \nhave more pending cases on average than John Roberts did when we \nconfirmed him to sit on the DC Circuit back in 2003.\n  There are no excuses. We have a finely qualified nominee, with 32 \nSupreme Court arguments, support of the nonpartisan group that looks at \nthese nominees, someone whose spouse served in the military for 22 \nyears, someone who raised her kids while he was over in Kuwait, and we \nare going to turn her down? That makes no sense to me at all, and I \nurge my colleagues to help Patty Millett get into this job to do what \nshe says is the highest honor you can have; that is, public service.\n  She should be confirmed without delay. The Senate should have \nconfirmed her this week. We heard from the American people--we all \nheard this when we were home--how they are sick and tired of this kind \nof delay and partisanship. She is a fine, highly qualified nominee. She \nshould get an up-or-down vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Donnelly). The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of Congressman \nMel Watt to serve as director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.\n  It has been over 5 years since the FHFA's inception, and it still has \nnever had a confirmed Director. First, Senate Republicans blocked \nPresident Obama's original nominee for the post, Joe Smith, who was a \ntechnocrat. Today they are trying to block Congressman Watt because \nthey say he is a politician and not a technocrat.\n  But they forget that Congressman Watt has over 40 years of experience \nin housing, real estate, and other financial services issues. Before \ncoming to Congress, he practiced business and economic development law \nand personally walked hundreds of families through real estate \nclosings.\n  In Congress, he has served on the House Financial Services Committee \nfor the past 21 years. In that capacity, he was one of the first \nMembers to recognize the need for action on predatory lending. With \ngreat foresight, he introduced the Prohibit Predatory Lending Act in \n2004 and introduced it every Congress until it became the foundation \nfor the qualified mortgage provision of the Wall Street Reform and \nConsumer Protection Act of 2010. If we had all listened to Congressman \nWatt before the housing crisis, then thousands of consumers might have \navoided being scammed into unsafe mortgages that ultimately led to \nforeclosure.\n  Congressman Watt has also shown a commitment to housing finance \nreform. In 2007, he partnered with Congressman Frank and introduced a \nbill to reform Freddie and Fannie. This bill eventually led to the \nHousing and Economic Recovery Act, which established the FHFA.\n  Industry groups, consumer advocates, and fellow Members of Congress \nhave recognized Congressman Watt's impressive track record and support \nhim for this position.\n  One of his home State Senators, and the Republican Senator who \nprobably knows him best, has supported his nomination from the \nbeginning. Shortly after Congressman Watt's nomination was announced, \nSenator Burr stated:\n\n       Having served with Mel, I know of his commitment to \n     sustainable federal housing programs and am confident he will \n     work hard to protect taxpayers from future exposure to Fannie \n     Mae and Freddie Mac. I look forward to working with \n     Representative Watt in his new role to find new ways to \n     facilitate more private sector involvement in the housing and \n     mortgage markets.\n\n  Recently, the National Association of Home Builders sent a letter in \nsupport of Congressman Watt's nomination, stating:\n\n       During Representative Watt's tenure on the House Financial \n     Services Committee, he has proven to be a thoughtful leader \n     on housing policy. The FHFA needs a permanent director with \n     his leadership capabilities.\n\n  The National Association of Realtors has also sent a letter of \nsupport praising Congressman Watt by stating:\n\n       The Director of the FHFA must weigh the costs of action and \n     inaction with the benefits of protecting the taxpayer, and \n     ensuring that the housing sector can stabilize and grow. Mr. \n     Watt has the experience and skill necessary to ensure that \n     both are handled in a manner that will benefit our nation.\n\n  It is time we finally confirm a Director for the FHFA, to ensure \nstability and confidence in the housing market. Congressman Watt has \nthe experience, intellect, and temperament to succeed as Director, and \nthere is no legitimate reason why Congressman Watt should not be \nconfirmed. At a minimum, as a sitting Member of Congress, he deserves \nthe courtesy of an up-or-down vote. I urge my colleagues to vote yes on \nthe motion to invoke cloture so we can proceed to an up-or-down vote on \nCongressman Watt's nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the majority leader says it is time to \ncut off debate and vote on the President's nominees to fill three \nvacancies on the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. I will not vote \nto end debate now because I think such a vote would be premature.\n  Before the Senate has an up-or-down vote on the three judges, there \nis something else we ought to do first. We should first consider the \nbipartisan proposal that was made 10 years ago to have the right number \nof judges on this Federal appellate court. For more than a decade, \nSenators of both parties have argued that this court has more judges \nthan it needs and that other Federal appellate courts have too few. In \n2003, 2005, and 2007, with a Republican President in the White House, \nRepublican Senators Sessions and Grassley introduced legislation to \nreduce the number of seats on the DC Circuit.\n  In 2006, they were joined by a distinguished group of eight Judiciary \nCommittee Democrats who made the same argument. These included the \nchairman, Senator Leahy, Senator Schumer, Senator Feingold, Senator \nKennedy, Senator Feinstein, Senator Durbin, Senator Kohl, and Senator \nBiden. When President Bush nominated Peter Keisler to the DC Circuit, \nthe Democrats wrote Senator Specter, the committee chairman, a strong \nletter.\n  The letter says:\n\n       We believe that Mr. Keisler should under no circumstances \n     be considered--much less\n\n[[Page S7652]]\n\n     confirmed--by this Committee before we first address the very \n     need for that judgeship . . . and deal with the genuine \n     judicial emergencies identified by the Judicial Conference.\n\n  The Democratic Senators argued, first, the committee should--before \nturning to the nomination itself--hold a hearing on the necessity of \nfilling the 11th seat on the DC Circuit, to which Mr. Keisler has been \nnominated. They cited a number of objections by Senators to the need \nfor more judges on that circuit.\n  They then argued 6 years ago:\n\n       [That] since these emphatic objections were raised in 1997, \n     by every relevant benchmark, the caseload for that circuit \n     has dropped further.\n       Only after we reassess the need to fill this seat and tend \n     to judicial emergencies should we hold a hearing on Mr. \n     Keisler's nomination.\n\n  That was the Democratic Senators' position in 2007. These \ndistinguished Democratic Senators were not only forceful in 2006 and \n2007, they were persuasive. They worked with President Bush and \nCongress agreed to reduce the DC Circuit by one seat and add it to the \nNinth Circuit, where the caseload was 526 filings per judge--well above \nthe caseload average for all the judicial circuits.\n  In 2007, Senator Feinstein, a Democrat, and Senator Kyl, a Republican \nwrote:\n\n       It makes sense to take a judgeship from where it is needed \n     the least and transfer it to where it is needed the most.\n\n  Mr. Keisler, by the way, was never confirmed. For 2\\1/2\\ years his \nnomination was held in the Judiciary Committee, from June 2006 until \nJanuary 2009. The same arguments made in 2006 and 2007 should be \npersuasive today.\n  Today, the average caseload for the DC Circuit--even if it were \nreduced by three judgeships to the eight seats currently occupied--\nwould be less than one-half the national average for circuit courts. \nThe national average is 344 cases filed per judge this year in Federal \nappellate courts. The DC Circuit average, if it were reduced to the 8 \ncurrent judges, would be 149 per year. The national average is 344 \ncases per year. The DC Circuit average--even if it is reduced to 8--\nwould be 149 per year, less than half.\n  Since 2005, there has been a decrease of 27 percent in the number of \nwritten decisions by an active judge on the DC Circuit. Since 2005, the \nnumber of appeals filed in the DC Circuit has fallen by 17\\1/2\\ \npercent.\n  Before it considers any of the President's nominees for the DC \nCircuit, the Senate should do in 2013, today, what Republican President \nBush and the Democratic Senate did in 2007; first, consider the \nappropriate number of judges for the DC Circuit, and then, as Senator \nKyl and Senator Feinstein wrote, ``take a judgeship from where it is \nneeded least and transfer it to where it is needed most.''\n  I heard the argument that the cases in the DC Circuit are more \ncomplex than in another circuit, and therefore the caseload ought to be \nlighter. With eight judges, it will be a lot lighter--half the national \naverage for circuit courts. That ought to allow plenty of time to write \ndecisions in complex cases.\n  Other circuits have complex cases as well. For example, the Second \nCircuit, including New York, regularly handles many of the most complex \ncases that come to the Federal courts. Finally, there are a number of \nsenior judges who are active in the DC Circuit--that is true in almost \nall the circuits, and that is part of the way our system works today. \nThey can carry some of the workload when that becomes necessary.\n  I think it is striking that even if this court only has eight seats, \nthat the average caseload is less than half of the national average. So \nwhy does it need three additional judges? That is the question \nDemocratic Senators asked in 2007, and that is what the Senate and \nPresident Bush addressed. That is the question we should be asking \ntoday before we fill any more seats for an underworked circuit court.\n  So I will not vote to end the debate on the President's nominees \nuntil the Senate does in 2013 what Democratic Senators suggested and \nwhat the Senate did in 2007: Assess the need for judges on the DC \nCircuit and transfer judges from where they are needed least to where \nthey are needed most. That means that before we act on the President's \nthree nominees, the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate should \nconsider Senator Grassley's legislation that would transfer one judge \nto each of the overworked Second and Eleventh Circuits and eliminate \none judge, leaving the DC Circuit with a caseload that still is less \nthan half the national average for the eight remaining judgeships. \nThen, if there are still vacancies to be filled in the DC Circuit, the \nSenate can consider them one by one.\n  The Senate has treated President Obama very well in considering his \nnominations. According to the Congressional Research Service, as of \nAugust of this year President Obama's Cabinet members were, on average, \n54 days--moving from announcement to confirmation at about the same \npace as those of President Bush and President Clinton.\n  As far as President Obama's judicial nominees, President Obama has \nhad 38 article III judges confirmed at this point in his second term, \nincluding 9 circuit judges, 25 district judges, and 4 judges to other \narticle III courts. By comparison to those 38, President George Bush \nhad 16 article III judges confirmed, 7 circuit judges, 7 district \njudges, and 2 judges to other article III courts.\n  What about a waiting list of judges who are waiting to be confirmed \nby the Senate? Is there a big backlog? The answer is no. As of today, \nonly two circuit judges have been reported by the committee and await \nfloor action. Remember, the committee is controlled by Democrats and \nthey can report whomever they want. Both of these are for the DC \nCircuit and are not judicial emergencies. Only seven district court \nnominations await floor action. None have been waiting long. Three were \nreported in August, and four were reported in September.\n  So while there are always a few nominations that provoke controversy \nand take a while to consider, one of the Senate's most important and \nbest known powers is the constitutional authority to advise and consent \non Presidential nominations. That is a part of the checks and balances \nour Founders set up so we didn't have a king, we didn't have a tyranny. \nWe made it slower. We gave the President the right to nominate, but the \nSenate has the right to advise and consent. Sometimes that takes a \nwhile. Sometimes those nominees are rejected.\n  I believe and have argued consistently that with rare exceptions, \nPresidential nominations deserve an up-or-down vote after an \nappropriate time for consideration. President Obama's nominations have \nbeen receiving timely up-or-down votes. But first, as Senators of both \npolitical parties have argued for 10 years, we should make certain we \nhave the right number of judges on the court. We don't have money to \nwaste in this country with the debt we have today. We should transfer \njudges from where they are needed the least to where they are needed \nthe most. That is the sensible thing to do. The President's nominees \nfor the DC Circuit will receive up-or-down votes insofar as I am \nconcerned unless there are exceptional circumstances.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter of \nJuly 27, 2006, from eight Democratic Senators to Chairman Arlen Specter \nsuggesting that the hearing on Mr. Keisler be postponed until the \nSenate had considered the number of judges on the DC Circuit. I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record as well ``Additional \nViews of Senators Feinstein and Kyl'' which were written at that time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 27, 2006.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on Judiciary, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Specter: We write to request that you \n     postpone next week's proposed confirmation hearing for Peter \n     Keisler, only recently nominated to the D.C. Circuit Court of \n     Appeals. For the reasons set forth below, we believe that Mr. \n     Keisler should under no circumstances be considered--much \n     less confirmed--by this Committee before we first address the \n     very need for that judgeship, receive and review necessary \n     information about the nominee, and deal with the genuine \n     judicial emergencies identified by the Judicial Conference.\n       First, the Committee should, before turning to the \n     nomination itself, hold a hearing\n\n[[Page S7653]]\n\n     on the necessity of filling the 11th seat on the D.C. \n     Circuit, to which Mr. Keisler has been nominated. There has \n     long been concern--much of it expressed by Republican \n     Members--that the D.C. Circuit's workload does not warrant \n     more than 10 active judges. As you may recall, in years past, \n     a number of Senators, including several who still sit on this \n     Committee, have vehemently opposed the filling of the 11th \n     and 12th seats on that court:\n       Senator Sessions: ``[The eleventh] judgeship, more than any \n     other judgeship in America, is not needed.'' (1997)\n       Senator Grassley: ``I can confidently conclude that the \n     D.C. Circuit does not need 12 judges or even 11 judges.'' \n     (1997)\n       Senator Kyl: ``If . . . another vacancy occurs, thereby \n     opening up the 11th seat again, I plan to vote against \n     filling the seat--and, of course, the 12th seat--unless there \n     is a significant increase in the caseload or some other \n     extraordinary circumstance.'' (1997)\n       More recently, at a hearing on the D.C. Circuit, Senator \n     Sessions, citing the Chief Judge of the D.C. Circuit, \n     reaffirmed his view that there was no need to fill the 11th \n     seat: ``I thought ten was too many . . . I will oppose going \n     above ten unless the caseload is up.'' (2002)\n       In addition, these and other Senators expressed great \n     reluctance to spend the estimated $1 million per year in \n     taxpayer funds to finance a judgeship that could not be \n     justified based on the workload. Indeed, Senator Sessions \n     even suggested that filling the 11th seat would be ``an \n     unjust burden on the taxpayers of America.''\n       Since these emphatic objections were raised in 1997, by \n     every relevant benchmark, the caseload for that circuit has \n     only dropped further. According to the Administrative Office \n     of the United States Courts, the Circuit's caseload, as \n     measured by written decisions per active judge, has declined \n     17 percent since 1997; as measured by number of appeals \n     resolved on the merits per active judge, it declined by 21 \n     percent; and as measured by total number of appeals filed, it \n     declined by 10 percent. Accordingly, before we rush to \n     consider Mr. Keisler's nomination, we should look closely--as \n     we did in 2002--at whether there is even a need for this seat \n     to be filled and at what expense to the taxpayer.\n       Second, given how quickly the Keisler hearing was scheduled \n     (he was nominated only 28 days ago), the American Bar \n     Association has not yet even completed its evaluation of this \n     nominee. We should not be scheduling hearings for nominees \n     before the Committee has received their ABA ratings. \n     Moreover, in connection with the most recent judicial \n     nominees who, like Mr. Keisler, served in past \n     administrations, Senators appropriately sought and received \n     publicly available documents relevant to their government \n     service. Everyone, we believe, benefited from the review of \n     that material, which assisted Senators in fulfilling their \n     responsibilities of advice and consent. Similarly, the \n     Committee should have the benefit of publicly available \n     information relevant to Mr. Keisler's tenure in the Reagan \n     Administration, some of which may take some time to procure \n     from, among other places, the Reagan Library. As Senator \n     Frist said in an interview on Tuesday, ``[Tlhe DC Circuit . . \n     . after the Supreme Court is the next court in terms of \n     hierarchy, in terms of responsibility, interpretation, and in \n     terms of prioritization.'' We should therefore perform our \n     due diligence before awarding a lifetime appointment to this \n     uniquely important court.\n       Finally, given the questionable need to fill the 11th seat, \n     we believe that Mr. Keisler should not jump ahead of those \n     who have been nominated for vacant seats identified as \n     judicial emergencies by the non-partisan Judicial Conference. \n     Indeed, every other Circuit Court nominee awaiting a hearing \n     in the Committee, save one, has been selected for a vacancy \n     that has been deemed a ``judicial emergency.'' We should turn \n     to those nominees first; emergency vacancies should clearly \n     take priority over a possibly superfluous one.\n       Given the singular importance of the D.C. Circuit, we \n     should not proceed hastily and without full information. Only \n     after we reassess the need to fill this seat, perform \n     reasonable due diligence on the nominee, and tend to actual \n     judicial emergencies, should we hold a hearing on Mr. \n     Keisler's nomination.\n       We thank you for your consideration of this unanimous \n     request of Democratic Senators.\n       Sincerely,\n     Patrick Leahy.\n     Chuck Schumer.\n     Nita Feingold.\n     Dianne Feinstein.\n     Herb Kohl.\n     Ted Kennedy.\n     Dick Durbin.\n     Joe Biden.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     The Court Security Act of 2007\n\n\n                 March 29, 2007--Ordered to be printed\n\n       Mr. Leahy, Chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, \n     submits the following report together with additional views\n\n\n                          VI. ADDITIONAL VIEWS\n\n             ADDITIONAL VIEWS OF SENATORS FEINSTEIN AND KYL\n\n       Section 506 of this bill transfers a judgeship from the \n     U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to \n     the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Once this \n     provision is enacted into law, the Ninth Circuit will have 29 \n     judgeships and the D.C. Circuit will have 11.\n       Section 506 will help to ease the backlog of pending cases \n     in the Ninth Circuit, where more judgeships are sorely \n     needed. At the same time, it will eliminate a judgeship on \n     the D.C. Circuit that many Senators--including both Democrats \n     and Republicans on this committee--have indicated that they \n     believe to be unnecessary.\n       The numbers tell a striking story. According to the \n     Administrative Office of the United States Courts, 107 \n     appeals per judge were filed in the D.C. Circuit in 2006. By \n     contrast, in the Ninth Circuit, the filings were nearly five \n     times higher--a total of 523 filings per judge in 2006. \n     Filings per judge in the Ninth Circuit are also substantially \n     higher than the national average of 399 filings per judge. \n     The D.C. Circuit's rate of filings, by contrast, falls far \n     below the national average.\n       The merits of transferring a judgeship from the D.C. \n     Circuit to the Ninth Circuit are also brought into relief by \n     considering the total number of appeals left pending in each \n     circuit at the end of the 2006 reporting cycle. In the Ninth \n     Circuit, 1,853 appeals were pending at the end of this \n     period. This was the highest total for any circuit in the \n     nation. By contrast, in the D.C. Circuit, only 387 appeals \n     were pending at the end of the 2006 period. This was the \n     lowest total for any circuit in the nation.\n       The backlog of cases in the Ninth Circuit is not merely a \n     problem for lawyers and judges. It injures ordinary people \n     who have to wait longer to have their cases resolved. \n     Plaintiffs who have been injured, criminal defendants seeking \n     review of their convictions, and victims waiting for \n     justice--for all of these people, justice delayed is justice \n     denied.\n       It just makes sense to take a judgeship from where it is \n     needed least, and to transfer it to where it is needed most.\n       California is hit hardest by the inadequate number of \n     judgeships on the Ninth Circuit. In 2005, 10,000 federal \n     appeals--70% of the circuit's total docket--were filed in \n     California. On February 14, during his testimony before this \n     Committee, even U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy \n     commented on the overloaded docket of the Central District of \n     California. Yet of the Ninth Circuit's 28 judgeships, only 14 \n     are assigned to California.\n       California needs more judges. Transferring a judgeship from \n     the D.C. Circuit to the Ninth Circuit in California would be \n     a first step toward correcting this deficiency.\n       The D.C. Circuit, by contrast, has seen its caseload \n     decline in recent years. In fact, filings in that circuit \n     dropped by 7.1% in 2006 alone. Removal of the 12th judgeship \n     would only modestly increase filings per judge in that \n     circuit to 115--a figure still well below half the national \n     average for U.S. courts of appeals. And in any event, the \n     burden on that court of removing a seat is largely \n     hypothetical. The 12th seat on the D.C. Circuit was created \n     in 1984 and has remained vacant for most of the intervening \n     years, including all of the last decade. On the other hand, \n     adding one seat to the Ninth Circuit would reduce filings per \n     judge on that court to 503--still a heavy burden on the \n     justice system of the Western States.\n       Section 506 is a reasonable step toward the solution of a \n     pressing problem in the administration of United States \n     courts. We are pleased to see it made part of this bill.\n\n     Dianne Feinstein.\n     Jon Kyl.\n\n\n                      National Day of Remembrance\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to give \nthanks and show respect to World War II and Cold War heroes who served \nin our Nation's nuclear weapons programs on this fifth National Day of \nRemembrance. They weren't serving in the heat of battle but in the \nlaboratory, handling materials on a daily basis that ranged from benign \nto toxic and highly radioactive. These materials posed risks that many \nscientists did not understand at the time.\n  Today in Oak Ridge, TN, the American Museum of Science and Energy, \nand Cold War Patriots are gathering to celebrate former workers and \nview a quilt that honors nuclear workers for their contribution to \nAmerica's safety. This one-of-a-kind remembrance quilt has 1,250 \ncommemorative handwritten quilt squares that form an American flag that \nmeasures 17 feet by 11 feet.\n  I want to specifically remember Bill Wilcox for his service to our \ncountry and passion for preserving Oak Ridge history. Bill passed this \nSeptember. Bill was a former manager of the K-25 operations, a \nManhattan Project veteran, and the official historian for the city of \nOak Ridge.\n  In 1943, Bill was hired by Tennessee Eastman on a ``Secret, secret, \nsecret!'' project in an unknown location. When he started at Eastman he \nwas told:\n\n       As chemists you'll have to know that you'll be working [on] \n     this project with a substance called uranium. That is the \n     last time that you will hear that word or you will speak it \n     until after the war. And if you are\n\n[[Page S7654]]\n\n     ever heard speaking the word you will be subject to discharge \n     from our employment immediately, and very likely prosecuted \n     by the United States government, and may end up in jail. Is \n     that clear?\n\n  In Oak Ridge ground was broken for the Y-12 plant in February of \n1943, and by the end of the summer they started installing complex \nphysics machines, called calutrons. About 1,000 calutrons were \ninstalled at Y-12.\n  How were these calutrons operated? Tennessee Eastman said that the \ncalutrons couldn't be run as an experiment but should be run like an \nindustrial plant. Rather than manuals, there should be a simple red \nline on meter A. The operator would turn knob A until the needle is on \nthe red line on meter A.\n  However, General Leslie Groves, head of the Manhattan Project, along \nwith physicists disagreed. So they took five calutrons and ran them for \na week with the best physicists and then another week with girls right \nout of high school that kept the needle on the red line of the meters. \n``After a week the girls had won hands down in terms of productivity.''\n  These women were called the ``calutron girls.'' One calutron girl \nfirst learned of the war effort in Oak Ridge when she was at a cafe in \nSweetwater, TN. She was working in a hardware store at the time. The \nstore had a big window where people from the surrounding counties put \nphotos of their sons who went away to war. She had the job of \nstraightening up the photos when the heat from the window caused the \ncardboard frames to buckle. With great dignity, the families would take \ndown the pictures of their fallen soldiers.\n  Wanting to help the war effort, she went to Oak Ridge, where there \nwas ``mud everywhere, and green Army trucks, and vehicles, and \nsoldiers, and that was just inside the gate.'' As a calutron girl, she \nwore a blue uniform. The chemical workers wore white. She said:\n\n       You weren't allowed to go in the other room . . . you'd \n     stick out like a sore thumb, a blue something in a white-\n     uniformed place . . . But they let us go over--towards the \n     end . . . they told us to take all the bobby pins out of your \n     hair before you go out there because it would yank your bobby \n     pins out.\n\n  She remembers:\n\n       You couldn't talk. You couldn't say anything to anybody \n     about where you worked, what building, when you left the \n     plant. In fact, there were huge banners up all over the \n     plant: `When you leave here what you see here stays here.' \n     And you weren't allowed to tell even . . . somebody [that] \n     worked on the same thing you did.\n\n  There were signs everywhere: ``Keep your mouth shut!'' ``Loose lips \nsink ships!'' ``See no evil; hear no evil; speak no evil'' with posted \nfines of $10,000 and warnings of jail time.\n  One of the things that was curious about Oak Ridge was that these \nrail cars came in every week, but nobody ever saw any product going \nout. The reason was that the product went out in a standard-sized \nbriefcase every week chained to the wrist of a military officer, in \nplainclothes. He would get on the train and go to Chicago to exchange \nthe briefcase.\n  During 1945, a different process at the K-25 building was \nsurprisingly successful and cost less than 10 percent of the cost of \nthe Y-12 process. The K-25 building was a mile-long U-shape--once the \nworld's largest buildings under one roof. The operators had to use \nbicycles just to get around their building.\n  The successful K-25 process ran full blast for another 20 years, \nwhile the Y-12 plant received a new mission.\n  These efforts along with others by our nuclear weapons workers across \nthe country won World War II and the cold war. At the peak of the Cold \nWar, nearly 600,000 workers across the country were involved in the \nresearch and production of nuclear weapons.\n  Today, many former nuclear weapons workers are retired. Many of them \nare sick. Some are dying. The government is helping these sick nuclear \nworkers through the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation \nProgram created by Congress in 2001.\n  This program provides compensation to those who were exposed to \nradiation and toxic materials while building our nuclear weapons, \nespecially those that were instrumental in our winning the cold war. \nThis program receives claims from all 50 States nearly 100,000 \nindividual workers.\n  This program is especially important to Tennessee. Tennessee has the \nhighest number of claims than any other State--over 14,000 workers. \nTennesseans, mostly former workers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Y-\n12 and K-25, have received over $1.7 billion in compensation and paid \nmedical bills, according to the Department of Labor.\n  Today, the nuclear workers across the country continue this heroic \nlegacy to advance nuclear power, nuclear medicine and other technology \nthat continues to make our lives better and keep our country safe.\n  So I am privileged to work with Senator Mark Udall in honoring these \npatriots who worked countless hours with little-understood hazardous \nmaterials to build our country's nuclear deterrent.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a \ncolloquy with my colleagues from Delaware and Ohio for up to 30 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Manufacturing in America\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, this is one of those all-too-rare occasions \nanymore where we all agree, and it is about making things. We will be \ntalking for the next few minutes about what happens in our country and \nwhat needs to happen so we can not just make things again--because we \nstill make lots of things, and we make them very well--but what we need \nto do to be able to make more things. What do we need to do to be sure \nwe are at the competitive front of the line as we work to make things.\n  All of us are working on things together. Senator Brown and I have \nbeen working on advanced manufacturing--something that he has spoken \nabout and we have spoken about together and that he has been a leader \non for a long time--and all of our States benefit.\n  Missouri and Ohio have certainly been among the significant \nmanufacturing States. In Missouri we have more than $32 billion a year \nin manufacturing. For about the last 4 years that has been the top \nmanufacturing employment, has been in the agricultural industry, in \nfood processing, as well as transportation equipment, fabricated \nmetals, machinery of all kinds, and automobiles have been in the top of \nour manufacturing sectors.\n  I believe we are really at a point where so many things could easily \ncome together, and the Federal Government and the Congress can help \nmake those things come together by taking down barriers and by creating \neasier ways to work together. In the case of advanced manufacturing, we \nhave talked about the centers of excellence and we have worked on that \ntogether, and we have both seen some of these ideas work.\n  I wish to ask Senator Brown some of the things he has seen and the \nthings he thinks we can do better through the legislation we have been \ntalking about.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Blunt yielding. I \nappreciate the opportunity to engage in this colloquy with the Senator \nfrom Missouri as well as the Senator from Delaware, both of whom have \nbeen leaders in manufacturing in Missouri and in Delaware.\n  It is pretty clear what these public-private hubs can do in terms of \na multiplier effect. When we look at manufacturing history in this \ncountry--and of course I will use an illustration in my State, as I \nunderstand my State better than I do any other--when Akron was the \nleading tire manufacturer and was sort of the center for tire \nmanufacturing along the Ohio turnpike in northeast Ohio; to Toledo, \nwhere glass manufacturing was prominent and prevalent for decades; to \nautos in Cleveland; to steel; and then to rubber in Akron, we can see \nthat once we have an innovative focus, then other kinds of \nmanufacturing come out of that. As the tire industry declined over the \ndecades, Akron is now one of the leaders in polymer. Toledo, which was \na leader in glass manufacturing--plate glass for cars, bottles, and a \nlot of other kinds of glassware--has become a solar center.\n  So the legislation Senator Blunt and I have come up with will help \nAmerican workers and American business have the drive and the creative \nthinking and the determination to innovate ahead of the rest of the \nworld.\n  Before turning to Senator Coons, I wish to tell a quick story that \ntells me\n\n[[Page S7655]]\n\nwhy it is so important that manufacturing take place here. We out-\ninnovate the rest of the world. We are still the most creative. We are \nthe best innovators. We lead in foundational research and in other \nkinds of research. The problem is that as we invent things in this \ncountry, if we then outsource the manufacturing, so much of the \ncreativity and innovation, both in process and in product, takes place \nin that other country because it takes place in the shops.\n  I will give a quick example. The largest yogurt manufacturer in North \nAmerica is in western Ohio near the town where Neil Armstrong grew up, \nwestern Ohio near Wapakoneta. That yogurt manufacturer--I was there one \nday, and they used to bring in--the suppliers would send the plastic \ncups to the shop floor, to the manufacturer, and they would fill them--\nin these big silver vats--they would fill these plastic cups with \nfermented milk, with yogurt, package it, and send it. A young \nindustrial engineer and a couple of people who worked on the line for \nyears said: We can do this a lot less expensively and save money for \nthe company and be more productive and efficient. So the three of them \ndeveloped something pretty simple to an engineer, not so simple, \nperhaps, to me, but they simply fed a roll of plastic, a sheet of \nplastic, it was slowly heated, and it was then extruded and then cooled \nand filled with yogurt. The line was about 75 feet, and it made for a \nmuch more efficient innovation. That innovation took place on the shop \nfloor of an American manufacturing plant, making the productivity of \nthat plant much greater.\n  That is really how we need to look at this. If we are going to do \nthis partnership with government and local manufacturers and local \nlabor unions and local businesses and local suppliers, we can do the \nkind of work Senator Blunt mentioned with these manufacturing hubs, \nthis network of manufacturing innovation initiative we have had.\n  We introduced the bill this summer. We are working to build support. \nWe welcome the support of our colleagues. Senator Blunt has already \nmentioned what it could mean in Missouri, and perhaps Senator Coons \ncould tell us what it would mean in Delaware and in this country and \nwhat better manufacturing and more innovation means to our country.\n  I thank my two colleagues. I have a conference committee I need to \njoin, but I appreciate very much my colleagues opening this discussion.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Ohio for his \ntireless and engaged leadership on manufacturing, on fighting for \naccess to foreign markets on fair terms, for fighting for skills and \nincreasing the skills of our manufacturing workforce, and in this \ninstance, in this strong bipartisan bill, for working with our \ncolleague from Missouri on a national network of manufacturing \ninnovation centers.\n  My own work of 8 years at a manufacturing company in Delaware in a \nmaterials-based science company that makes things helped make it clear \nto me how important research and development and continuous innovation \nare for manufacturers at all levels. I have seen this across the State \nof Delaware. Our Presiding Officer--long owner and leader of a \nmanufacturing business in his home State of Indiana--knows this better \nthan any of us: that if we don't innovate, if we don't invest in \nresearch and development, in improving the skills in the workforce and \nimproving the productivity and the operating efficiency of any \nmanufacturing company, we can't survive in the tough headwinds of the \nglobal marketplace today.\n  One of the programs I championed here in the Senate that has \nbipartisan support is the Manufacturing Extension Partnership. It is a \nlong-established program that takes the latest cutting-edge research \nand development work at universities and moves it to the shop floor. I \nhave visited companies up and down Delaware, from FMC in Newark to \nSpeakman in New Castle, where they have taken those innovations from \nthe university to the shop floor.\n  One of the things I am grateful to Senator Blunt for is his \nleadership in taking that insight that in order to have the most \nproductive manufacturing workforce in the world, in order to continue \nto compete globally, we have to find ways to continue to invest in \ndemonstrating the power of innovation and we have to find ways to do \nthat in a bipartisan way.\n  I thank the Senator for being willing to work with Senator Brown and \nothers here. This is exactly the sort of stuff I hear from Delawareans \nthey want us to be doing. There is lots that divides us. This is \nsomething that unites us: working together to strengthen our \nmanufacturing sector, to make it more competitive, to bring jobs back \nto the United States, and to grow this sector.\n  We have grown half a million jobs in the last 3 years in the \nmanufacturing sector. These are good jobs, at high wages, high \nbenefits, high skills. But we can and should do more, pulling together \nto sort of lift further this ongoing manufacturing revival.\n  If Senator Blunt would share some more with us about this specific \nbill and about his experience in what else we can and should be doing \ntogether to strengthen manufacturing in Missouri, I would be grateful.\n  Mr. BLUNT. The Senator's point is well made. These manufacturing jobs \nare goods jobs. The American workforce is competitive. As Senator Brown \nsaid, we have always been on the cutting edge, the outside of \ncompetition, making things in a better way than we did last year. \nEverybody who is competing today is trying to figure out how they can \ndo whatever they did last year better. We see that and what we can add \nto that, how we can make that process work better.\n  In our State, the average manufacturing job pays 21.5 percent more \nthan the average wage. Mr. President, $52,000 or so for the average \nmanufacturing job salary in Missouri is a significant improvement in \nwhere you might otherwise be. In Missouri we have 6,500 manufacturing \nfirms. Almost a quarter of a million people work in manufacturing in \nMissouri. We used to have more than that. We used to have more than \nthat, and I think we will have more than that again. The country used \nto do more in terms of manufacturing than it does now. But we are going \nto see that happen.\n  The Senator from Delaware just wrote an article in Congressional \nQuarterly that talked about what needs to be done, the great \nopportunities we have in energy. If we take advantage of those great \nenergy opportunities, suddenly the utility bill is more predictable, \nthe delivery system is more guaranteed.\n  I was talking to a manufacturer today in my office and this topic \ncame up. At some point now, as you get further and further into \ninnovation, people not only have to be better trained--the Senator \ntalked about that too: the importance of a skilled workforce--but how \nthe workforce competes with maybe a lower paid workforce in some other \ncountry maybe is not nearly as important as how the utility bill \ncompetes.\n  If you can run that facility--and I just gave him an example of \nanother manufacturing facility in my hometown of Springfield, MO, that \nwas making a significant expansion, I think about a $150 million \nexpansion. They did not expect to hire any more people, but they expect \nto use that current workforce in a much more competitive way. Nobody \nwas losing a job because of advanced competition. They are just \nexpanding that workforce in a way that ensures they will keep their job \nand be more competitive. Of course, somebody, by the way, is building \nthat expansion. There are jobs there as well. And those all matter.\n  We have all kinds of examples.\n  Perryville, MO, is a town of less than 10,000 people. In that town, \nthey have become a hub--it is about 80 miles south of St. Louis--of \n21st century manufacturing. A Japanese company is there, Toyoda Gosei, \nthat makes plastic components for automobiles. Sabreliner makes \naviation parts and is in the airplane industry. There is Gilster-Mary \nLee, a much more traditional employer. But here is a town that has a \nsignificant number of manufacturing jobs.\n  The town of Cassville, near Springfield, for a number of years had \nmore manufacturing jobs than they had population. Now, of course, that \nmeant in the part of the country where I live lots of people may have \nbeen driving a significant number of miles to get to those jobs. But \nthere are not very\n\n[[Page S7656]]\n\nmany cities. This is a smaller community. It is the county seat of \nBarry County. But they had more manufacturing jobs than the number of \npeople who lived in the community itself. It meant that is a \ncompetitive community. That is a community that knows how to build \njobs.\n  Perryville is a community that has launched itself well into the 21st \ncentury. And the skills the Senator was talking about--the skilled \nworkforce, the energy needs, the research component--one of the \ncomponents of these hubs of excellence that we have been looking at and \ntalking about, Senator Brown and I have been working on, is to create \nways to encourage that higher education be part of that research \ncomponent.\n  I think Americans are eager to produce. I bet the Senator and I both \nhear the same thing over and over: How can we have a strong economy if \nwe do not produce? Well, you can have a strong economy in parts of the \neconomy that do not produce, but I think not only do you need to \nproduce, but there is something that defines who we are in a positive \nway when people see American production that is not only heavily \ncompetitive here but competitive all over the world.\n  I think that is what Senator Coons and I are talking about, the kind \nof bipartisan effort we need to make. I do not know any Republicans or \nany Democrats anywhere, or any Independents, who have said: Oh, we \ndon't need to worry about making things. We don't need to worry about a \ncompetitive economy. Actually, private sector jobs should be the No. 1 \ndomestic goal of the Federal Government today. And the jobs we are \ntalking about are a significant component because they lead to lots of \nother jobs. All of the ripple effects of manufacturing jobs are great: \nthe other businesses that spring up, the suppliers that come.\n  Of course, the Senator and I have talked about his father was a \nsignificant part of launching new things into the marketplace. I think \nthat is what the Senator and I want to see this Congress encourage, as \nwe can encourage things without law and look for legislative ways to \nfacilitate a growth back toward manufacturing.\n  Mr. COONS. I thank Senator Blunt for his work on this bill with \nSenator Brown. There are other bills that I hope this body will take up \nand discuss and debate where I hope we can find ideas that are out \nthere, with progress that is being made and policy innovation that is \nbeing made, and that we can take them up, debate them, and find \nbipartisan sponsors who will carry them forward.\n\n  I absolutely agree with the Senator's point that we are seeing in \nmanufacturing a revival in this country for a variety of reasons. One \nof them is less expensive energy. The shale gas revolution is reducing \nthe feedstock costs for chemical manufacturing and reducing the energy \ncosts broadly for manufacturing of all kinds.\n  We are also seeing that lots of American companies fear the loss of \ntheir inventions, their innovations, if they move offshore. So some of \nthe attractiveness of operating in other countries has dimmed a bit, as \nthey have recognized that the United States is one that has a rule of \nlaw that protects their inventions and innovations.\n  There is also less of a wage gap, frankly, as wages have come up in \nthe developing world. In China, the wage gap is less. So that \ncombination gives us a window, gives us a moment of opportunity. We \nlost millions of manufacturing jobs in the first years of this century, \nbut in the last three we have been growing them and growing them \nsteadily. If we can work in partnership across the aisle on \nmanufacturing skills, on access to credit, on innovation, on a \ncoordinated strategy, I cannot imagine a community in this country that \nwould not rather have high-quality manufacturing jobs.\n  As Senator Blunt was mentioning, for every manufacturing job that is \ncreated, there is 1.6 new support jobs created. For every $1 spent in \nmanufacturing, there is $1.34 spent in the local economy that moves \naround. It is the sector that has the most positive secondary impact in \nour communities.\n  I do think there is broadly in our country a sense that we have sort \nof lost our leading edge in manufacturing because of the large-scale \nlayoffs and the large plant closings. But in my State, and I presume in \nthe Senator's State and in the Presiding Officer's State of Indiana, \nand others, there are dozens and dozens of small and medium-sized \nmanufacturers who have seized this moment, who are growing, and who \nsimply want us to help facilitate their access to the market, their \naccess to innovation and new research, their access to a skilled \nworkforce.\n  If we can pull together, I think we can do great things for the \nUnited States going forward.\n  Also, before we close, I thank Senator Blunt for being a cosponsor \nwith me of the startup innovation tax credit--something Senator Enzi \nand I and many others--Senator Rubio, Senator Schumer, Senator \nStabenow, as well as Senator Moran--have cosponsored and introduced and \ndiscussed over time. It would help with access to capital for early \nstage startup manufacturers.\n  There are lots of good ideas we can and should discuss on the floor, \nin hearings, and going forward. But for today I am grateful to Senator \nBlunt for his leadership with Senator Brown on this bill that would \nhelp strengthen the National Network of Manufacturing Innovation \ncenters. The Senator is a strong leader for manufacturing in his home \nState of Missouri, and I am grateful for a chance to spend some time \nwith him on the floor today discussing that good bill and his good \nideas.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Let me just talk a little bit about the startup act that \nSenator Coons and I have worked on. The Senator mentioned, I think, all \nthe cosponsors of that: Senator Rubio, Senator Stabenow, Senator Moran, \nSenator Kaine, Senator Schumer, and Senator Enzi.\n  What that does is try to extend the opportunity of research and \ndevelopment to startup businesses. The way the tax credit works, you \ncan deduct those costs from the taxes you pay. Well, if you are a \nstartup business, you often do not have any profit to deduct from. That \nis part of the courage, frankly, of starting a business. You are almost \ninsured, guaranteed, that for the first weeks, months, sometimes the \nfirst years, depending on how big a venture this is, you are not making \nmoney yet. So what the Senator and I and our friends have done in the \nstartup act is say--these people would have employees--so what we do is \nallow the same tax credit for a big corporation or a big business or a \nhighly successful business with lots of profit to be applied against \nwhat they pay as taxes for their employees--the Social Security tax, \nthe other taxes that are paid--and, again, trying to encourage \ninnovation.\n  We all know that small business is the engine that drives the \ncountry. But also small business can be the engine that drives \nmanufacturing, if we figure out a way to let them have some of the same \nbenefits that existing businesses have that have already gotten \nthemselves in a profit-making situation. This just gives them a place \nto go and utilize that credit.\n  That is the kind of thing we ought to be looking at. Startup \nbusinesses are important, encouraging traditional businesses to figure \nout how to upgrade their equipment, upgrade the way they do things so \nthey are more competitive in an international marketplace. I really do \nfirmly believe that for reasons the Senator mentioned--the wage gap is \nnot what it was, the transportation costs are more than they were to \nget something made from somewhere else back to the greatest market in \nworld, the United States of America; and the more we know about the \nutility bills--Senator Donnelly from Indiana, who is the Presiding \nOfficer, and I have been working on things that pay attention to the \nutility bills. Again, that is a key component of future manufacturing. \nThe more competitive you are, the more innovative you are, the more you \nare likely to be concerned about that part of your input costs. And \nsometimes when you expand, the utility bill is a bigger than the \nadditional labor cost. But that may be exactly what ensures you can \nkeep the labor you have and grow that labor by being able to make a \ncommitment that you feel good about because you feel good about your \nability to run that facility once you build it. You feel good that not \nonly is it going to work this year, but, by the way, we are doing so \nwell and doing so many things that 10 years from now we feel whatever \nthe utility costs are going to be, they are\n\n[[Page S7657]]\n\ngoing to be within the range we can deal with and still produce right \nin Missouri, right in Ohio, right in Delaware, or right in Indiana.\n  That is the kind of thing we ought to be focusing on. How do we make \nthings again? How do we create other kinds of private sector jobs, the \nNo. 1 domestic priority of the country today?\n  Every time the Senator and I talk about manufacturing, I really do \nget excited about an America that is thinking about not are we going to \nbe able to continue to make what we have always made, but what can we \nmake better than anybody else that we are not making yet that is going \nto allow us to be out there in a world marketplace? Trade has become a \nmuch greater opportunity for the American workforce, as all of these \nother factors we have been talking about on the floor have come \ntogether to make our workforce what it is.\n  If Senator Coons has any final remarks, I would like him to finish \nour time here on the floor.\n  Mr. COONS. I thank Senator Blunt. I thank the Senator for his \nenthusiasm for manufacturing and for his enthusiasm for working \ntogether with me on the startup innovation credit bill, as the Senator \nreferenced, and with Senator Brown on the national network of \nmanufacturing innovation centers as he spoke about.\n  Manufacturing is the center, the beating heart of the middle class of \nAmerica. Manufacturing jobs are good jobs. We do need to get back to \nbeing a country where inventing, growing, and making things is an area \nof bipartisan, sustained, purposeful focus. I know for the folks who \nwatch us at home and for the folks here in this Chamber, nothing could \nmeet the demands and the needs of our communities and our States more \nthan for us to come together in a bipartisan, balanced, and responsible \nway to advocate for a stronger manufacturing sector in the United \nStates.\n  I thank Senator Blunt very much.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1592\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, we have all now been aware over the last \nfew days in the news about the problems being faced with the Web site \nupon which people are supposed to go in order to sign up to be on one \nof these exchanges. That is important, because next year Americans are \ngoing to owe money to the IRS if they do not have health insurance by a \ncertain date.\n  One of the ways people are supposed to get health insurance is by \ngoing on one of those Web sites and logging on, registering, and being \nable to see what their options are for insurance, and then signing up. \nIf you do not do that, then you are going to owe money to the IRS next \nyear.\n  The problem is those Web sites are not working. In fact, just today \nas the Secretary was testifying before a House committee, the Web site \ncrashed again. There are a lot of different reasons why that is \nhappening. I am sure eventually, with all of the experts who are \ninvolved in it, they will be able to set up a Web site that functions, \nbecause this is the 21st century. The ability to go online and buy \nsomething, frankly, is something people do every single day with all \nkinds of things. So to me, it is inexplicable that they are not able to \ndo that when it comes to health insurance.\n  But in the meantime, people are struggling not just with the Web \nsite, by the way, there are problems now with the 800 number and the \npaper application.\n  I believe the prudent approach is to say we are going to delay, that \nwe are going to put off punishing people, that we are going to put off \nthe individual mandate until the Web site works. I will admit, I do not \nthink the law works at all in its totality and it will eventually have \nto be repealed. That is what I favor. But in the interim, what I am \nproposing is something that I think is pretty reasonable; that is, the \nnotion that until these Web sites are working, how can we punish people \nfor not buying health insurance? Why are we going to punish someone for \nnot buying health insurance if the Web site they are supposed to buy it \non, by the administration's own admission, is not properly working?\n  This is creating a lot of anxiety for people. That is why I filed a \nbill to do that. That is why I come on the floor today for the purpose \nof making a motion.\n  As if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 225, S. 1592, \nwhich is a bill to delay the individual mandate until the health \nexchanges are functioning properly. I further ask unanimous consent \nthat the bill be read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider \nbe considered made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I think it \nis pretty clear that this motion is inappropriate. This is not what we \nshould be doing and how we should potentially change the act. Actually, \nthe effect here is to disrupt implementation of the Affordable Care \nAct. The Affordable Care Act is a law. It has been in place for several \nyears. The Supreme Court has upheld it. Attempts to repeal it failed. I \nthink the House has voted up to 20 times to try to repeal the ACA. They \nhave all failed. The act is here. So the goal here is to make it work, \nmake the act work. Then later on we can ask questions about what \nhappened, why it didn't work, why wasn't implementation of the \nexchanges as good as a lot of us would have liked it to have been. Then \nfind out who is responsible, et cetera. Right now it works.\n  The effect of this motion is severalfold. One, it will deny people \nhaving health insurance, people who otherwise would get health \ninsurance. If you delay the individual responsibility requirement, it \nis going to cause a delay. People will not have insurance.\n  Second, it is going to increase the cost of health insurance for a \nlot of people. Why? Because fewer people will be signed up. The \nindividual responsibility requirement will not be followed as much as \notherwise would be the case. The result is fewer people will be in the \ninsurance pool, and therefore prices will be higher.\n  Another consequence is it lowers the quality of health insurance, \nespecially for those individuals who are seeking to be insured. They \nare going to have a lower quality product as a consequence of this \nrequest. It is an attempt to destabilize, it is an attempt to undermine \nthe ACA.\n  I think for those reasons it is inappropriate and again is another \neffort to obstruct. We should not proceed in this way, so I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I do not intend to offer another motion \nsince the objection has been heard. I do want to point out a couple of \nthings. First of all, this notion that ObamaCare is the law--it is true \nit is the law. It was passed by Congress in the years before I got \nhere. This is called the Calendar of Business. This is the Executive \nCalendar. Basically every single bill that is in here is an effort to \nchange existing law, for the most part. That is what we do around here. \nThat is what the legislative process is about. Virtually every bill \nthat is filed is either an effort to create a new law, but usually it \nis an effort to change existing law. So if we begin to argue around \nhere that once something is existing law it can never be changed, we \nmight as well close up shop, because that is what we do. That is what \nthe legislative process is about.\n\n  The second point that was made was that this law will prevent people \nhave having health insurance. That is not true. Let me say this: No. 1, \nI am in favor of people having health insurance. I do think we cannot \nignore the health insurance problem this country faces.\n  No. 2, admittedly, I am in favor of repealing ObamaCare and replacing \nit with a better alternative. But that is not what this bill does. All \nthis bill says--this is the only thing it says: The only thing it says \nis you cannot enforce the individual mandate, you cannot tell people \nnext year that we will fine you, that the IRS is going to impose a fine \non you. You will not be able to do that until the Web site is fully \nworking.\n  In terms of this preventing people from getting health insurance, \nthat is simply not accurate. This does not prevent anyone from going \nonto the Web site and signing up. If the bill I am proposing is \nadopted, it would not keep\n\n[[Page S7658]]\n\nanybody from signing up for health insurance under ObamaCare. The only \nthing it would do is keep the IRS from fining you if you are unable to \ndo it. The reason why that makes sense is because the way we are \nsupposed to do it on a Web site simply is not working.\n  So it is not accurate to say this will somehow prevent people from \nbuying health insurance. It does not. It does not prohibit you from \ntrying to get it on the Web site. It is just the recognition that the \nWeb site is not working well and there is a consequence to it. The \nconsequence to it is if they cannot get these Web sites up and running, \nthere are people who will not be able to buy health insurance and they \nare going to get fined for it. That does not sound fair to me.\n  So while I continue to want to repeal ObamaCare, I think for the good \nof our people it is unfair to continue to hold over their head the \nthreat of an IRS fine when the method of compliance we are asking them \nto follow is not fully functioning. That is all this would do.\n  I would point out this is not a theoretical concern. I get letters \nand emails every day. But I want to read one I got. I will paraphrase \nit. It is from Barbara in Ruskin, FL. She is 63 years old. She tried to \napply to the health insurance marketplace on October 1. As of the \nwriting of this email, she is no further along. She sought the services \nof a certified navigator on October 14. After spending hours on line \ntrying to get an account established and making the application, the \nnavigator, with her on speaker phone, after many hours finally assisted \nher in making an application. She was told she would receive additional \ninformation via email. Ten days later she has still heard nothing. She \nis worried because she is currently covered, but that is being \nterminated at the end of the year because of ObamaCare. It is going to \nend on December 31. According to the information provided to her, she \nhas to be enrolled in another insurance plan or she is going to face \nthe fine.\n  This is just one example. I could go on and on. I do not want to \nburden the time of the Senate. But there are thousands upon thousands \nof people who are dealing with this problem.\n  Here is the last point I would make. I have now heard on a number of \noccasions the administration say with full confidence that by the end \nof this coming month, by the end of November, the Web sites will be up \nand running. If that is true, then there is no reason to be against my \nbill. If, in fact, you are so confident the Web sites are going to be \nup and running by the end of November, then this problem will be taken \ncare of. If, in fact, you are right, and the Web sites are going to be \nup and running at the end of November, then the mandate will be back in \neffect.\n  The only thing my bill does is say: As long as the Web site is not \nworking and until it is working, you cannot enforce the ObamaCare \nmandates on people through a fine from the IRS. That is it. That is all \nit says. That is why I think this makes all the sense in the world. I \nam surprised that we somehow believe we should continue to hold the \npenalty over people's heads when the way we are asking them to comply \nwith the law, by the admission of the administration, by the admission \nof the Secretary today, is simply not working well enough.\n  I hope in the days to come my colleagues will reconsider, because I \nthink our people, irrespective of how you feel about ObamaCare, deserve \nbetter. To that end, I would read to you one email I got from someone \nwho actually supports ObamaCare. Nicholas in Palm Bay, FL, wrote an \nextensive email. He talked about how he submitted an application to the \nWeb site. It took hours to complete because of Web issues. They finally \nfinished the application 23 days later. The application is still in \nprogress, but it will not let him go any farther to choose the \ninsurance. So while he does not agree with me about defunding or \nrepealing ObamaCare, he agrees with me that we should suspend the \nindividual mandate penalty until this Web site issue is fixed.\n  I think there are a lot of people who are going to feel that way. I \nthink there are a lot of people who would be shocked that the \ngovernment is going to punish them for not buying insurance when the \nWeb site they are being sent to buy it on does not work.\n  Again, I think it is a commonsense approach. I am surprised there is \nobjection to it. I suppose I should not be, but I am. I hope in the \ndays and weeks to come my colleagues will reconsider, because in my \nopinion, and I think in the opinion of many Americans, it is simply \nunfair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of Ms. \nPatricia Millett's nomination to the DC Circuit Court. As a member of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, I have the opportunity to closely \nexamine each of the judicial candidates nominated by our President. I \ndid so with Ms. Millett, attending her nomination hearing and speaking \nto a wide range of the practitioners and colleagues who have direct \nknowledge of her professionalism and experience. Without exception, at \nevery stage of her career and with every personal and professional \ncolleague with whom she has had work experience, Patty--Ms. Millett--\nhas distinguished herself as a person of integrity, intelligence, and \ndedication. She is a person whose capability and devotion to a family \nis an inspiration to those around her. She is unanimously recommended \nby former living Solicitors General, and received the ABA's highest \nrating.\n  Some of my colleagues here have argued that President Obama is trying \nto ``pack the court'' by nominating Ms. Millett and two other nominees \nto fill three current vacancies on the DC Circuit Court. These charges \nof court packing strike me, frankly, as without foundation. Court \npacking is an historical term used to describe when politicians try to \nchange the size of a court, expand a court, in order to control its \nexpected outcome. That was the cause of the objection to President \nRoosevelt's plan to add up to six Justices to the U.S. Supreme Court \nback in 1937.\n  In fact, a current legislative proposal to strip the President's \nability to fill three vacant seats on the DC Circuit could better be \ncalled court stripping. In this particular case, making nominations to \nvacant judicial positions is not court packing, it is a President doing \nhis job. Confirming highly qualified nominees to serve on this circuit \nin this vacancy would be this body doing its job.\n  The charges of court packing are absurd on their face. They are even \nmore absurd when put in context.\n  Ms. Millett has been nominated to the ninth seat of the 11 authorized \non this court. There are currently three vacancies on this vital \ncircuit court.\n  I held a hearing earlier this year on judicial staffing levels in my \nrole as the chair of the Subcommittee on Bankruptcy and the Courts of \nthe Judiciary Committee. I invited the chair of the Judicial Conference \nCommittee on Judicial Resources, Judge Tymkovich, to come testify. For \nthose who ascribe significance to such things, Judge Tymkovich was \nnominated by President George W. Bush to sit on the 10th Circuit Court \nof Appeals.\n  Judge Tymkovich testified--convincingly, in my opinion--that the \nFederal judiciary needs more judges, not fewer. Every other year, the \nJudicial Conference submits to Congress a report on recommendations on \njudgeships. That report did not conclude that any judgeships should be \nremoved or remain unfilled on the DC Circuit.\n  Judge Tymkovich also explained why the caseload statistics used by \nsome of our colleagues to argue that the DC Circuit has a low \ncaseload--and thus need not have its vacancies filled--are, in fact, \nunconvincing. The DC Circuit hears a unique caseload, with four times \nthe number of complex administrative appeals than other circuit courts \naround the country.\n  The DC Circuit is the circuit from which all the Federal agencies' \nactions are repealed. More than any other court in the country, its \ncaseload is made up of very complex, very difficult cases with far-\nreaching consequences and that require a great deal of time. Simply \nlooking at the raw number of cases filed, opened, and closed is not an \naccurate predictor of whether a vacant seat on the DC Circuit should, \nin fact,\n\n[[Page S7659]]\n\nbe filled. The DC Circuit's caseload has remained steady over the past \n10 years, so the Judicial Conference has seen no reason to recommend \nany alteration in its staffing level.\n  The court packing argument made by some is also at odds with history, \nespecially when one considers that caseloads lower than they are now on \nthe DC Circuit were sufficient when all Republican Members then in \noffice voted to confirm then Judge Roberts to the 9th seat, Janice \nRogers Brown to the 10th seat, Thomas Griffith to the 11th seat, and \nBrett Kavanaugh to the 10th seat when it became vacant. When Ms. \nMillett is confirmed, the DC Circuit will still have more pending \nappeals per active judge than after the confirmations of any of those \nfour earlier Bush nominees I just referenced. The caseload on the DC \nCircuit would also remain above that of the current 6th Circuit and \n10th Circuit, to which courts the Senate has confirmed Republican \nsupported judicial nominees this year.\n  A filibuster of Ms. Millett on caseload grounds would bring the \nSenate to an unprecedented and regrettable place. It would destroy \ncomity and trust at a time when our Nation needs it most, when we need \nto demonstrate to the people of the United States that this Congress \ncan function and that this Senate can fulfill its constitutional role.\n  It would not only facilitate the administration of justice by our \ncourts, but also allow us to tackle other issues if we could move past \nendless and needless filibusters on issues such as this. It would allow \nus to move forward to the broader issues of the day, tackling long-term \ndebt and deficit challenges, the fight against global terrorism, \nreinvesting in our future, and working together to invest in \nmanufacturing and grow our economy. There are so many other issues that \ncall for the time of this body.\n  With that, I wish to urge my colleagues to look at Ms. Millett's \nnomination on its merits and to not be distracted by what I think are \ngroundless arguments that this is an instance of so-called court \npacking by this President.\n  This President is doing his job. He is nominating supremely qualified \ncandidates to serve in the highest courts of this land, and this body \nshould do its job and confirm those qualified nominees.\n\n\n                 National Technological Innovation Day\n\n  If I might, I simply wanted to comment to this body that something \npassed with little notice here yesterday. October 29, 2013, was \nNational Technological Innovation Day. This was recognizing the role \nthat technological innovation plays in the United States economy.\n  We know that innovation is absolutely essential to developing new \nmedicines, treatments, and cures to help us live longer and more \nhealthy lives. Innovation is essential to strengthen the manufacturing \nsector of the American economy and make us more competitive. Innovation \nis essential to allow us to take advantage of new materials and new \nopportunities in the world and to access new export markets overseas. \nInnovation overall is what has brought all that is best about modern \nlife and the modern world.\n  Yesterday, in a bipartisan way, we recognized that on October 29, \nmany years ago, was the very first day that DARPAnet was able to \nexchange communications from one computer to another. It was literally \nthe dawning of the modern Internet age. This was made possible in part \nby Federal investment and innovation.\n  I am grateful that Senator Moran, Senator Isakson, Senator Heinrich, \nand Senator Kirk joined me in recognizing the unique and important role \nthat technological innovation has played in America's past, America's \npresent, and America's future.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Johnson of Wisconsin pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 1617 are printed in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to support my colleague and my \nfriend, Congressman Mel Watt of North Carolina, who has been nominated \nby the President to be the next Director of the Federal Housing Finance \nAgency--the FHFA. I have total confidence that Mel is fully capable and \nqualified to serve as the FHFA Director, and I am not alone.\n  This week, the National Association of Home Builders wrote a letter \nto Leaders Reid and McConnell unequivocally endorsing Congressman Watt, \nstating:\n\n       During Representative Watt's tenure on the House Financial \n     Services Committee, he has proven to be a thoughtful leader \n     on housing policy. The FHFA needs a permanent director with \n     his leadership capabilities.\n\n  Senator Burr, Congressman Watt's Republican colleague from North \nCarolina, and Senator Hagan recently shared a ``Dear Colleague'' in \nwhich both North Carolina Senators stated clearly, in their words:\n\n       Congressman Watt has shown himself to be an honest, kind, \n     and capable individual with deep understanding of the housing \n     market. We urge you to support his nomination.\n\n  He is indeed qualified to serve as the FHFA Director. He is an \nincredibly decent and honest person who I know will always work \ndiligently toward a decision based on the facts, not on ideology or \nmomentary trends. Democrats know this, and Republicans who have worked \nand served with him know this.\n  Despite this, there is some question whether Congressman Watt has the \ntechnical experience to run FHFA. So let us look at Congressman Watt's \nrecord to see if we can peel that back and look closely.\n  He is a graduate of Yale Law School, who for 22 years practiced \nbusiness, economic development, and real estate law. He is not a \ntheoretician. He understands the impact of foreclosure, not just the \nmacroeconomics but the personal dimension. He understands the role of \nfinancial intermediaries, banks and housing agencies. He has been a 21-\nyear member of the House Financial Services Committee, so legislatively \nhe has been engaged and involved in every major business, financial, \nand housing initiative in the last two decades, and he has seen this \nfrom the perspective of a legislator.\n  He has earned the support of his colleagues, but also he has earned \nthe support of his constituents and his neighbors back home. He has the \nendorsement of the former Republican Chairman of the House Financial \nServices Committee, Spencer Bachus of Alabama, who noted:\n\n       Congressman Watt has played an integral role in the \n     financial services committee's deliberations on housing \n     policy and is known as a serious and substantive legislator . \n     . . In my experience in working with him on a variety of \n     issues, I have always personally respected Congressman Watt \n     for his intellect, attention to detail, and dedication to \n     serving the public.\n\n  Again, this is a reflection of two decades of service at the heart of \nthe process of legislating with respect to housing policy in the United \nStates. So when we combine his legal training, his practical experience \nas a lawyer, his two decades of service as a member of the House \nFinancial Services Committee, he is fully qualified for this key \nposition, which is so vitally important now because we have to \nseriously tackle the issue of housing finance reform, and we have to \ntake into consideration the needs and concerns of all the stakeholders, \nfrom investors to homeowners.\n  Again, Congressman Watt has that perspective--knowing the intricacies \nfrom his legal training of financial laws, doing what he has to do to \nprotect the interests of his clients, and as a legislator with over two \ndecades of experience in creating housing policy in the United States.\n  The FHFA should be led by a Director, confirmed by the Senate, not an\n\n[[Page S7660]]\n\nActing Director. We have to send the signal this is a position that is \nimportant and deserves a confirmed Director, notwithstanding the skills \nand abilities and the great dedication of the current Acting Director. \nWe need to have someone in the position who has been confirmed by the \nSenate. There are too many critical decisions each day, and too much at \nstake in terms of housing finance reform not to have a confirmed \nDirector of the FHFA.\n  I urge my colleagues to allow this nomination to come before this \nbody for a vote. Congressman Watt deserves no less, and I indeed urge \nsupport for his confirmation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                            Youth Employment\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, today I rise to call attention to a \nproblem that seems to have gotten lost in the shuffle recently. That \nissue is our unemployed and underemployed American youth.\n  On September 14, the Wall Street Journal published a must-read story \nentitled: ``Wanted: Jobs for the New 'Lost' Generation.'' I would like \nto read a brief excerpt from that article.\n\n       Like so many young Americans, Derek Wetherell is stuck. At \n     23 years old, he has a job, but not a career, and little \n     prospect for advancement. He has tens of thousands of dollars \n     in student debt but no college degree. He says he is more \n     likely to move back in with his parents than to buy a home, \n     and he doesn't know what he will do if his car--a 2001 \n     Chrysler Sebring with well over 100,000 miles--breaks down. \n     ``I'm kind of spinning my wheels,'' Mr. Wetherell says. ``We \n     can wishfully think that eventually it's going to get better, \n     but we really don't know, and that doesn't really help us \n     now.''\n\n  Derek Wetherell's experience is hardly unique. It is unfortunately an \nexperience shared by Americans across this Nation, including in my home \nState of Nebraska. Despite promises of economic recovery, jobs remain \nscarce, particularly for young people. A quick survey of family \nmembers, neighbors, and friends reveals that too many adult children \nare now living at home, stuck in their parents' proverbial basements.\n  A study released by The Opportunity Nation shows that 6 million young \npeople between 16 and 24 are neither in school nor are they working. \nThat means roughly 15 percent of America's youth are idle when they \nshould be gearing up for their most productive years. The study went on \nto state:\n\n       Youth unemployment is at its highest in more than a decade, \n     and young people in many European countries now have a better \n     shot at moving up the ladder from poor to rich than they do \n     in America.\n\n  The United States has always stood as the land of opportunity--the \nnew home sought by immigrants from Europe and from around the world, \nrisking life and limb for personal freedom and economic progress.\n  It seems that the ancient European capitals now offer young people \nmore hope--a better chance at upward mobility--than our failing \neconomy. That must change.\n  The jobless youth don't belong exclusively to any class, race, or \ngender. This problem does not discriminate. Nearly 1 in 4 African-\nAmerican youth is unemployed, while the unemployment rate for young \nLatinos in September was 15.8 percent. Young men are unemployed at a \nrate of over 17 percent, while nearly 13 percent of young women are out \nof work.\n  Washington Monthly recently discussed the long-term impact of \njoblessness on our youth.\n\n       The consequences are dire for these young Americans.\n       They're not only more likely to have a hard time in the job \n     market; researchers have found that disconnection has \n     scarring effects on health and happiness that endure \n     throughout a lifetime.\n       Unemployed, uneducated youth are at greater risk for \n     criminality and incarceration, and they often go on to become \n     unreliable spouses and improvident parents.\n       The costs to society are also considerable.\n       The direct support expenses and lost tax revenues \n     associated with disengaged young people cost U.S. taxpayers \n     $93 billion in 2011 alone--a bill that will only compound as \n     the years progress.\n\n  In short, our weak economy is not only frustrating young Americans \npresently eager for work; it is jeopardizing their future. It is \nthreatening more than just their ability to find present jobs; it is \nthwarting their efforts to build rewarding careers and to start \nfamilies. They are getting a late start--if any start at all.\n  And what about those young Americans who have found work? According \nto a report by Accenture, over 40 percent of college graduates in the \nlast 2 years are overqualified for their jobs. In other words, many of \nthem are underemployed.\n  I believe all work has dignity. And while a college degree is \nimportant, it is not for everyone. But hard-working young people should \nhave the opportunity to use their degrees and pursue their passions. \nThey are not asking for special treatment--they are just asking for a \nchance. This economy is holding them back.\n  As if young people weren't facing enough adversity, now they are told \nthey are legally required to purchase costly health insurance. In fact, \nthe new law completely depends on their participation. Yet the report \non premiums released by the Department of Health and Human Services \nshows that many young people will not qualify for subsidies to make \ntheir premiums affordable.\n  A study published by the National Center for Public Policy Research \nfound that subsidies did not exist for people from 18 to 34 years of \nage in 11 of 15 exchanges. These young people will be required to pay \nthe full price of their premiums, which we all know are skyrocketing \naround this country. The American Academy of Actuaries published an \narticle noting that the young people who don't qualify for subsidies \nwill see an increase in costs of 42 percent.\n  Tom from Omaha wrote me to tell me about his 26-year-old son, who had \nbeen paying $159 a month for his health coverage. ``Effective January \n1, 2014, his rate will be $231. What is affordable about this?'' Tom \nadded that his son's deductible would ``increase by $3,000 and his out-\nof-pocket costs by $3,850.'' We are no longer dealing with projections, \nwe are dealing with real people.\n  The National Center for Public Policy Research also found that even \nwith the subsidies, about 3.7 million young people would actually save \nat least $500 by forgoing insurance and paying the fine, and as many as \n3 million young people would save at least $1,000 by opting out of \nObamaCare.\n  The bottom line? We have record numbers of unemployed young Americans \nnow being forced to purchase health plans they do not want and, in some \ncases, with coverage they don't even need. We need to empower, not \nburden, young Americans.\n  The American dream of launching a career, starting a family, buying a \nhome, and forging a brighter future is not some quaint relic of a \nbygone era. The dream is alive and well. Our young people are still \ndreaming. It is time for us to honor our duty to ensure that the next \ngeneration has the tools and experience to succeed, to keep America \nstrong, and to pursue that dream. Right now, we are falling woefully \nshort. But we can do better. Our children and our grandchildren are \ncounting on us. This generation isn't lost yet, and I am here to fight \nfor them.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on why I had a hold \non this particular nomination.\n  Contrary to some who are speculating on this issue, I am not voting \nagainst this specific nominee. My concerns are with the way OPM \ndetermines who can ask questions and who can receive answers.\n  Imagine, there is a Federal Government agency which determines who \ncan ask a question to them and who can get an answer. Whether a Member \nof the minority or majority, every Member should be able to ask \nquestions and to receive those answers. Frankly, if you ask a question, \nyou should be able to get an answer; and when you get the answer, it \nprobably should be truthful. That is my argument, and that is the \npurpose I have this hold.\n  I want to be very clear that I am not voting against the nominee as \nan individual. I am voting against the agency itself.\n\n[[Page S7661]]\n\n  OPM, in my opinion, has become one of the most politicized agencies \nin Washington, DC. I believe the Office of Personnel Management has \nrefused to do its part to ensure that all Americans are treated fairly \nunder ObamaCare. Specifically what I mean by that is I believe what is \ngood for the American people should probably be good for Congress, and \nwhat is good for Congress should be good for the American people. I \nbelieve that is a standard which many of us in the Senate live by. I \nthink there are some who don't, but I think the majority do. If \nsomething is good for the American people, it should be good for \nCongress. And I think ObamaCare is a good example of that.\n  For me, the most concerning issue is whether OPM engaged in \nnegotiations with the Senate and House leadership to secure exemptions \nand subsidies for Members of the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives. I wish to thank a colleague of mine from Louisiana, \nSenator Vitter, for his hard-fought effort on this particular issue.\n  I am not the only person here in this Chamber who can't get questions \nanswered from OPM. I would like to walk for a minute the time line and \nthe difficulty I have had with OPM over the last couple of months \ntrying to get direct and truthful answers from this agency.\n  I will start on August 28. I wrote OPM asking specifically from the \nagency to ensure that all congressional staff, including leadership and \ncommittee staff, be fairly treated under ObamaCare.\n  This is what I said:\n\n       This is a missed opportunity for the Office of Personnel \n     Management (OPM), which currently administers and operates \n     Congressional health care, to ensure that all Congressional \n     staff, including Committee and Leadership, play by the same \n     rules as the American taxpayer.\n\n  I go on to say later:\n\n       As you issue your final rule in order to comply with \n     Section 1312 of the Affordable Care Act, I encourage you to \n     clarify this issue once and for all and require in addition \n     to Members of Congress that all Congressional staff--\n     Committee and Leadership--to go into the exchanges.\n\n  I wanted the dialog. I wanted this conversation. That is why I wrote \nto OPM. Of course I was looking to hear back from them, and I received \nno answer. I received no answer from the agency, so I followed up on \nSeptember 13. From August 28 to September 13, I got no answer.\n  On September 13, I wrote:\n\n       I would like to first express my disappointment with your \n     agency's lack of response to my stated concerns. In addition, \n     I would like to reiterate my request that the Office of \n     Personnel Management (OPM) clearly mandate in its final rule \n     that all Congressional staff, including Committee and \n     Leadership, be subject to the consequences of ObamaCare.\n\n  I think that is a fair dialog and a fair question to ask. That was on \nSeptember 13. Finally, on September 18, I got the response. Not the \nresponse that I wanted, as you can imagine, but I did get a response. \nIn their letter, it says:\n\n       In issuing our final rule, OPM will address this specific \n     issue as well as others raised by members of Congress and the \n     public at large.\n\n  So in this letter on September 18, I wanted to have a discussion with \nOPM, and OPM says: You can read the final rule. We are not going to \nhave a discussion with you. We are not going to reach out. We are not \ngoing to come to your office. We just want you to read the final rule, \nlike every other American, and we are not going to have a discussion \nprior to issuing the rule.\n  Obviously, I wasn't going to take that for an answer, so I reached \nout and I requested a formal briefing with the Acting Director. Sure \nenough, we had that meeting on September 26. So this is from August 28 \nall the way to September 26. I will tell you, frankly, it was a good \ndiscussion. They were frank. They had a couple of members of their \nstaff there. I raised concerns about possible back door negotiations \nthat would allow for special treatment under the law. I asked \nspecifically whether OPM had engaged leadership on this issue. I asked \nthat question: Have you engaged leadership on this issue? I asked the \nquestion three times: Did you engage with leadership on either the \nHouse side or Senate side on how you wrote these rules? Three times I \nasked that question and three times OPM had insisted that they had not, \nthat the answer was no. So they said no three times. They formulated \ntheir proposal based on the advice of their lawyers.\n\n  I was OK with that. We had discussions on other principles of the \nbill itself, but that was the essence of the conversation I had and I \nwas fine with that. Frankly, I was ready to release my hold. But what I \ndid want was answers in writing. I wanted to memorialize the \nconversation that we had in my office, so I sent them another letter on \nSeptember 28, formally requesting OPM to provide me with a detailed \nlist of all conversations or negotiations that they had with staff \nmembers of the Senate or House leadership when crafting the proposed \nrule.\n  I want to be super specific. On September 28 we had numerous \nquestions but question No. 4 that I had:\n\n       Provide me a detailed list of all conversations or \n     negotiations you had with any staff member of Senate or House \n     Leadership when crafting your proposed rule specifically, the \n     provision giving each Member of Congress the authority to \n     determine who on their staff goes to the Exchange. If you \n     engaged in any discussions--both formal and informal--with \n     Leadership staff was there any undue pressure received from \n     staff during these discussions? Do you believe this to be a \n     conflict of interest?\n\n  So that question, that letter, was sent out. We had a great \ndiscussion. Please memorialize, please respond, and I received none. \nThat was September 28. Please respond to that. They refused to do that.\n  On October 1, I started reading press reports, press reports both in \nPolitico and also in the National Review. After I asked OPM have you \never dealt specifically with leadership in either House on these \nproposed rules and they told me no three times, then we find out in \nPolitico that leadership worked for months--months to save these very \nsame longstanding subsidies, according to documents and emails provided \nto Politico.\n  I go back to the original question and my concern, if you talk to an \nagency, do you have a right, whether you are in the majority or \nminority, to talk to OPM? Do you have a right to receive an answer, and \nwhen you get an answer, should that answer be truthful? Three times \nthey told me no, they had not dealt with leadership, and you can see in \nthe press reports, the emails that were released that was not the case.\n  What was reported in these stories is directly counter to what OPM \ntold me in our meeting. I followed up with another letter dated October \n8. I asked for OPM to provide me with detailed lists of all \nconversations or negotiations that they had with leadership staff. So \nthis is what I said specifically:\n\n       In light of recent press reports that Congressional \n     Leadership staff negotiated with the Office of Personnel and \n     Management (OPM) regarding changes made to the Federal \n     Employees Health Benefit Program, I respectfully reiterate my \n     request that you provide me with a detailed list of all \n     conversations or negotiations with any staff member of Senate \n     or House Leadership. These news reports run directly counter \n     to statements that you made with [me and] three other OPM \n     staff members during our meeting two weeks ago.\n\n  This time I got a response. I finally get a response. OPM told me \nthey couldn't answer my question. They told me they couldn't answer the \nquestions because the government was shut down.\n  Pretty convenient and, frankly, very disturbing. All I am asking is \nwhat OPM told me in our meetings--is it true or whether the press is \nreporting the truth? Where is the truth? Senators have a right to ask \nquestions. They have a right to receive answers. Those answers should \nbe truthful. That is why I put on the hold. That is why I voted against \ncloture on this nominee. This is why I will vote against the nominee, \nnot because I have an issue with the nominee herself. I have a problem \nwith this agency.\n  I want to reiterate and again express my appreciation with others in \nthis Chamber who are as frustrated as I am with OPM--Senator Vitter \nbeing one of them--of not being able to get answers, to receive answers \nback from this particular agency. I want to say I still believe--and I \nthink most in this Chamber believe this--that what is important and \ngood for the American people should be good for Congress; what is good \nfor Congress should be good for the American people. I stand by that \nand will be voting against final confirmation on this nominee.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S7662]]\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent at this time to \nenter into a colloquy with my colleague from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The famed author George Bernard Shaw once wrote:\n\n       The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the \n     unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to \n     himself.\n\n  A few weeks ago, lost among the headlines about shutdowns and \nshowdowns was another very important news story. This story didn't \nreceive big headlines. It didn't make the evening news, and it wasn't \ntrending on Twitter.\n  Yet the story in the October 8 edition of the New York Times has \nserious implications for the future of our economy and our ability to \nadapt to the modern world. The eye-opening article discussed the merger \nof a California-based chip maker called Applied Materials. Applied \nMaterials merged with a Japanese company called Tokyo Electron.\n  Applied Materials is one of the biggest companies in Silicon Valley, \nan industry leader with a global presence. They have more than 13,000 \nemployees across 18 countries. Their headquarters, where they got their \nstart 46 years ago, is in Santa Clara, CA. In addition to 8,000 workers \nin the Bay Area of California, Applied Materials has employees at \nresearch, development, and manufacturing facilities in Texas, Utah, \nMassachusetts, and in my home State of Montana.\n  Now, with the merger with Tokyo Electron, what is this all-American \ncompany doing? It is shifting its corporation, not to Japan, but to the \nNetherlands. That is right. This new American-Japanese company will be \nincorporated in Holland.\n  Why are they moving to the Netherlands? What is going on.\n  In the New York Times article on the merger, reporter David Gelles \nwrote:\n\n       Executives at Applied Materials highlighted a number of \n     advantages in announcing a merger recently with a smaller \n     Japanese rival, but an important one was barely mentioned: \n     lower taxes.\n       The merged company will save millions of dollars a year by \n     moving--not to one side of the Pacific or the other, but by \n     reincorporating in the Netherlands.\n\n  The article goes on to note that Applied Materials' effective tax \nrate will drop from 22 percent to 17 percent as a result of the merger. \nFor a company that had nearly $2 billion in profit in 2011, that \namounts to savings of about $100 million per year.\n  Mergers resulting in U.S. companies being owned by companies in tax \nhaven jurisdictions such as Ireland, Bermuda, or the Cayman Islands, \nare a new spin on the old ``inversion'' problem, and it is becoming an \nincreasingly popular practice.\n  The Times article highlighted the following additional examples.\n  Last year, the Eaton Corporation, a power management company from \nOhio, acquired Cooper Industries from Ireland for $13 billion and then \nreincorporated in Ireland. The company expects to save $160 million a \nyear as a result of the move.\n  In July, Omnicom, the large New York advertising group, agreed to \nmerge with Publicis Groupe, its French rival, in a $35 billion deal. \nThe new company will be based in the Netherlands, resulting in savings \nof about $80 million a year.\n  Also in July, Perrigo, a pharmaceutical company from Michigan, said \nit would acquire Elan, an Irish drug company, for $6.7 billion. Perrigo \nwill also reincorporate in Ireland, lowering its effective tax credit \nfrom 30 percent to 17 percent, and saving the company an estimated $150 \nmillion a year, much of it in taxes.\n  Earlier in the year, Actavis, based in New Jersey, bought Warner \nChilcott, a drug maker with headquarters in Dublin, and said it would \nreincorporate in Ireland, leading to an estimated $150 million in \nsavings over 2 years.\n  It would be easy for us to attack these companies by calling them \nimmoral and unpatriotic, but it is much more constructive to step back \nand ask: What's motivating these companies? Why are they moving their \nheadquarters abroad? How can we keep them in the United States? How can \nwe adapt to the world and fix the problem?\n  It is a very simple issue. Globalization has made America's Tax Code \nsystem out of date.\n  The United States is stuck with a 35 percent corporate tax rate--one \nof the highest in the world--and a maze of incentives that only an army \nof tax lawyers can navigate. Some of these tax incentives are extremely \ncostly but are much less valuable to businesses than a rate reduction \nwith the same price tag.\n  When U.S. companies look abroad, what do they see? They see other \ncountries with more modern, more efficient, and more competitive tax \ncodes. Then, what do they do? They reincorporate overseas by acquiring \nor merging with another business.\n  They are not necessarily breaking laws. In fact, many of these \ncompanies are following the rules that America's outdated, overly \ncomplicated Tax Code provides.\n  The United States is losing hundreds of millions in revenue as a \nresult. Even worse, it is losing jobs. When headquarters moves abroad, \ngood-paying jobs often go abroad too. We need to reverse that tide. We \nneed to bring our tax system into the 21st century to make the United \nStates more competitive. That is what tax reform can do. It can help \nAmerica overcome the competitiveness crisis that is driving businesses \nand jobs overseas.\n  This competitiveness crisis was made very clear in a Harvard Business \nSchool study last year with the sobering title: ``Prosperity at Risk.'' \nThis indepth report examined the risks that threaten to undermine U.S. \ncompetitiveness in the global marketplace. It also looked at what \naction we could take in the United States to restore our country's \neconomic vitality.\n  Harvard Business School surveyed 10,000 of its graduates who live and \nconduct business worldwide. They asked about the challenges of doing \nbusiness in America. These individuals are leaders on the front lines \nof the global economy. They are CEOs, CFOs, business owners, and \npresidents. They are personally involved in decisions about whether to \nhire, where to locate, and which markets to serve.\n  Unfortunately, these business leaders are pessimistic about America's \neconomic future. They think America's prosperity--our success, our \ngrowth, and our economic status--is at serious risk. The vast majority \nof those surveyed, 71 percent, expected U.S. competitiveness to \ndeteriorate over the next several years.\n  A survey found that the U.S. fared poorly when competing to attract \nbusiness and pointed to increased competition from emerging markets. \nAccording to the survey: ``For the first time in decades, the business \nenvironment in the United States is in danger of falling behind the \nrest of the world.''\n  What did they identify as the root of America's competitiveness \nproblem? Respondents--remember, these are 10,000 Harvard Business \nSchool graduates working all around the world and in the United \nStates--pointed to America's Tax Code as the root of the problem. \nSpecifically, they pointed to the complexity of the code as one of the \ngreatest current or emerging weaknesses in the U.S. business \nenvironment.\n  The Harvard study made clear that our Tax Code puts American \nbusinesses at a competitive disadvantage on the world market. That \nobviously concerns us.\n  Where do we go from here? I believe we have to reform our Tax Code. \nWe have to adapt. We have to help make America more competitive. It is \nvery clear. It is very simple. We have to give companies such as \nApplied Materials a reason to keep their headquarters in the United \nStates.\n\n[[Page S7663]]\n\n  We have been through a difficult and counterproductive period on \nCapitol Hill. The recent shutdown and the threat of default undermined \nconfidence in the U.S. and did $24 billion in unnecessary damage to our \neconomy.\n  According to a report from the White House Council of Economic \nAdvisers, the shutdown cost 120,000 jobs in October alone.\n  I spent last week home in my State, as others were in their States. I \nwas meeting with my bosses, the folks and citizens of Montana. They are \nnot too happy with the antics going on in Washington, DC--and rightly \nso.\n  Fortunately, that battle is behind us and the government is back to \nwork. It is time for us to come together to tackle the challenges \nfacing our country.\n  Right now there are more than 11 million unemployed Americans looking \nfor work. Our economy is expected to continue growing at a sluggish \nrate for the next year, less than 3 percent.\n  We have to ask: How do we create jobs? How can we spark faster growth \nin our economy? How can we boost our competitiveness and keep American \ncompanies at home in America?\n  Tax reform must be part of the solution. It is not the whole \nsolution, but it is part of the solution.\n  That was the clear message I heard traveling around the country this \nsummer with my friend Dave Camp. Dave is the chairman of the House Ways \nand Means Committee. Dave and I met with families and businesses, large \nand small, to hear about their experiences in dealing with the Tax \nCode.\n  We visited a family-owned bakery in Minneapolis, a small appliance \nstore in New Jersey, a tech start-up in Silicon Valley, and a farm in \nTennessee. We visited some large companies as well, companies such as \n3M, Intel, FedEx, who employ thousands of people in the United States \nand around the world.\n  At every stop Dave and I heard the same message. U.S. companies and \nworkers, companies large and small, workers employed at large and small \ncompanies, want a more simple, more fair Tax Code that closes loopholes \nand helps them compete and strengthens our economy.\n  This issue is not going away. It is too important. With so many \npeople out of work, with economic growth still too slow, with a \ncompetitiveness gap costing us jobs and revenue, it is time for us to \nact. It is time for us to reform our Tax Code.\n\n  The chairman of the House and Senate Budget Committees brought their \nconferees together for the first time today. They have come together to \ntry to find common ground on a budget and a plan to rebuild confidence \nin our economy. Patty Murray and Paul Ryan are incredibly smart and \nhard-working people. They care. And I am confident they can craft a \ncompromise to help get America back on track.\n  I look forward to working with Chairman Murray and Chairman Ryan in \nthe tax entitlement components of their discussions, but at the same \ntime I will continue to work on a parallel track with the Finance \nCommittee advancing tax reform.\n  We are working hard--in Bernard Shaw's words--to adapt to the world \nand build a tax code that works. And Dave Camp is doing the same thing \nin the House. We are going down separate paths but coming together with \na common goal--reducing the deficit, creating jobs, and promoting \neconomic growth. We are coming together to put America back on track.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n\n\n                       Tribute to Senator Chiesa\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as we all know, today is Senator \nChiesa's last day in the Senate.\n  And while the Senator has only been here four months, it has been an \ninteresting few months to say the least. He has found himself right in \nthe middle of everything from the farm bill to the immigration bill, to \nthe debate over Syria, to an October I am sure he will not soon forget.\n  He has had to work out of a temporary office, complete with vinyl \nsiding and plastic chairs. He was here for less than an hour before \nhaving to take his first vote. He has had to deal with 99 Senators \npronouncing his name 99 different ways. And one of our colleagues from \nArizona threatened to quote ``waterboard'' the Senator if he didn't \nsupport a particular bill. I haven't asked how that situation ended up \nworking out, but I see the Senator from New Jersey is still here.\n  Bottom line: Senator Chiesa is going to have quite a few stories for \nhis family--for his wife Jenny and his kids, Al and Hannah. I know he \nis eager to get back home to see them--and catch up on some Notre Dame \nfootball--too. Even though he tells us his rank is ``fourth'' out of \nfour in the family pecking order.\n  Well, that is at least better than 100th out of 100. But Senator \nChiesa has not let his lack of Senate seniority stand in the way of \npushing important issues.\n  Human trafficking was his focus as Attorney General, and it has been \nhis focus here too. He has helped convene committee hearings about it, \nhe has raised the issue with administration officials, he has embarked \non a series of school visits to educate young folks on the issue, and \nhe has worked with the Junior Senator from Ohio to advance awareness \nthrough the Caucus to End Human Trafficking. His determination is \nsomething we all admire. I know a lot of it comes from his strong \nCatholic faith. Much of it must come from his upbringing too: this is a \nSenator who lost his father and was forced to become the man of the \nhouse when he was just 8 years old.\n  Last year, Senator Chiesa said this:\n\n       If someone had ever said 20 years from now you'd be the \n     attorney general of New Jersey, I would have laughed . . . I \n     didn't think I'd even have met the attorney general by the \n     age of 46.\n\n  Well, he has done more than that. He can add Senator to his resume \ntoo--a Senator who has made the most of his time here, who has done \ngood work, who we have all enjoyed getting to know. So, Senator Chiesa \ncan be proud of his service. We thank him for it, and we look forward \nto welcoming our newest colleague from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, before I make these remarks, let me join \nin thanking the Senator from New Jersey. Although his tenure in the \nSenate was brief, he was here during a very exciting and interesting \ntime in American political history. We thank him for his service on \nbehalf of New Jersey and wish him the very best in his future \nendeavors.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the President has nominated three \nextraordinarily well-qualified Americans--appellate lawyer Patricia \nMillett, Georgetown Law professor Nina Pillard and DC District Judge \nRobert Wilkins--to serve on the DC Circuit, the second most important \ncourt in the Nation. The DC Circuit currently has 8 active judges out \nof 11 authorized judgeships.\n  These nominees should be given an up-or-down vote on the Senate \nfloor.\n  Patricia Millett is the first nominee up for consideration. Ms. \nMillett, who is currently in private practice, is recognized as one of \nthe leading appellate lawyers in the country.\n  She has argued 32 cases before the Supreme Court and dozens more in \nother appellate courts.\n  Ms. Millett served in the Solicitor General's office under both \nDemocratic and Republican presidents. Seven former Solicitors General--\nincluding prominent Republicans Paul Clement, Ted Olson and Ken Starr--\nsent a letter in support of Ms. Millett saying she ``has a brilliant \nmind, a gift for clear, persuasive writing, and a genuine zeal for the \nrule of law. Equally important, she is unfailingly fair-minded.''\n  At her hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, no Senator \nquestioned Ms. Millett's qualifications or fitness for the Federal \nbench. She is simply an outstanding nominee.\n  Let me tell you why I have a personal interest in her nomination.\n  Ms. Millett is also a proud daughter of Illinois. She grew up in \nMarine, a small town in the southern part of the State that I know \nwell. Her mother was a nurse and her father was a history professor at \nSouthern Illinois University--Edwardsville, one of my favorite \ncampuses.\n  Ms. Millett graduated summa cum laude from the University of Illinois \nand magna cum laude from Harvard Law School. She clerked for two years \nfor Judge Thomas Tang on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  She is part of a military family. Her husband, Robert King, served in \nthe Navy and was deployed as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Ms. Millett also comes highly recommended by distinguished members of \nthe Illinois legal community.\n  I received a letter from Patrick Fitzgerald, the former U.S. Attorney \nfor the Northern District of Illinois, expressing ``strong support'' \nfor Ms. Millett's nomination and urging ``prompt consideration of her \ncandidacy on the merits.''\n  I also received a letter from 28 prominent attorneys including former \nIllinois Governor James Thompson, a Republican, and current Illinois \nState Bar Association president Paula Holderman.\n  They expressed their strong support for Ms. Millett, saying that: she \nembodies the evenhandedness, impartiality, and objectivity required for \nthe Federal judiciary, as evidenced by her more than 10 years of \nservice in the Solicitor General's office in both the Clinton and Bush \nadministrations.\n  The bottom line is that Ms. Millett is an outstanding nominee with \nbroad support from across the ideological spectrum. There is no \nquestion that she is well-qualified to serve on the bench, and she will \nserve with distinction.\n  I urge my colleagues to give her a chance with an up-or-down vote. \nShe does not deserve to have her nomination filibustered. If there is \nanyone who can step forward and question this nominee's qualifications, \nthey should do so. They have not to date.\n  Some of my Republican colleagues have accused the President of trying \nto ``pack'' the DC Circuit by making nominations to fill the \noutstanding vacancies in that court. This argument is simply not \ncredible. Filling vacancies for existing judgeships is not court \npacking. These judgeships are authorized by law, and it is incumbent \nupon the President to nominate qualified candidates to fill them.\n  Others across the aisle have argued that the DC Circuit does not have \na high enough caseload--there are just not enough cases--to justify a \nfull complement of 11 judges. I note that these same Republican \nSenators did not make that argument in 2005 when the Senate confirmed \nJanice Rogers Brown and Thomas Griffith to the 10th and 11th judgeships \non the DC Circuit. When the Senate confirmed the 10th and 11th \njudgeships in the DC Circuit in 2005, they were the choices of the \nRepublican side of the aisle, even though these confirmations, which we \napproved, reduced the Court's workload to fewer cases per active judge \nthan what we would see if President Obama's nominees were confirmed.\n  On April 5, the Judicial Conference of the United States, which is \nled by Chief Justice John Roberts, made its Federal judgeship \nrecommendations for the 113th Congress. The Judicial Conference is \nnonpartisan, and according to its letter, its recommendations ``reflect \nthe judgeship needs of the Federal judiciary.'' The Judicial Conference \ndid not recommend stripping any judgeships from the DC Circuit. So this \nargument on the other side of the aisle finds no support in the non-\npartisan Judicial Conference's recommendations.\n  My Republican colleagues like to argue about workload statistics when \nit comes to the DC Circuit, but according to the Washington Post fact \nchecker Glenn Kessler, who I have come to\n\n[[Page S7665]]\n\nknow, ``The voluminous and detailed statistics on the appeals courts \nallows each side to pick and choose the stats that support their \nposition.''\n  Republicans may claim the DC Circuit's workload is too light, but in \nthe Washington Post Mr. Kessler points out that by some metrics, the DC \nCircuit ``could be very well in first place'' when it comes to \nworkload.\n  I also note that one of my Republican colleagues came to the floor \ntoday and explained his opposition to Ms. Millett's nomination. In \ndoing so he cited a letter that the Senate Judiciary Committee \nDemocrats sent in 2006 seeking a hearing postponement on Peter Keisler, \nwho was nominated to fill the 11th seat on the DC Circuit. I would like \nto point out that this letter dealt with filling the 11th seat on the \nDC Circuit. Ms. Millett is seeking the 9th seat. I also wish to point \nout that the Senate had already voted to confirm a nominee to be the \n11th judge on the DC Circuit, Thomas Griffith, just 1 year before this \n2006 letter. I voted for Mr. Griffith on the floor.\n  The bottom line is that these judicial vacancies currently exist, it \nis the President's job to nominate qualified men and women to fill \nthem, and there is no question that the President's nominee for this \nposition, Patricia Millett, is one of the most well-qualified persons \nhe could have found to fill this important position. No one comes \nforward to criticize her background and her resume because, frankly, it \nis hard to find a nominee with any stronger credentials for the Federal \nbench.\n  Let's not play political games with this important nomination, nor \nwith people such as Patricia Millett, who have put their names forward, \nhave gone through this process, and have waited for us politicians to \nwork our will on the floor. She deserves an up-or-down vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter from \nIllinois lawyers supporting Patricia Millett for the U.S. Circuit Court \nof Appeals for the DC Circuit as well as the letter, dated October 24, \nfrom former U.S. attorney for the Northern District Patrick Fitzgerald \nof Chicago.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Patrick J.

Mark Kirk,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Durbin and Kirk: I write in strong support of \n     the President's nomination of Patricia Millett to the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and \n     urge the Senate to promptly confirm her to this position.\n       I support the nomination of Patricia Millett because I \n     believe our system of justice will be positively impacted \n     with her as a member of our judiciary. Her career \n     accomplishments as a lawyer are extraordinary. Over the past \n     20 years, Patricia has argued 32 cases before the United \n     States Supreme Court and even more in the federal appeals \n     courts, including the D.C. Circuit. Her cases have spanned \n     the spectrum of legal issues that the D.C. Circuit confronts, \n     including constitutional law, administrative law, civil and \n     criminal procedure, commercial disputes, national security, \n     and civil rights. Importantly, she has represented parties on \n     both sides of those many issues, handling cases for the \n     government at every level (federal, state, and local), \n     private individuals, businesses, employers, employees, civil \n     rights plaintiffs, prosecutors and criminal defendants. \n     Patricia is a lawyer's lawyer who is committed to the rule of \n     law and stare decisis. She embodies the evenhandedness, \n     impartiality and objectivity required for the federal \n     judiciary, as evidenced by her more than 10 years of service \n     in the Solicitor General's office in both the Clinton and \n     Bush Administrations.\n       Patricia grew up downstate in the small farm town of \n     Marine. Her father was a history professor at Southern \n     Illinois University--Edwardsville and her mother was a \n     registered nurse and hospice practitioner. Patricia graduated \n     summa cum laude from the Univeristy of Illinois with Highest \n     Distriction in political science, before going on to the \n     Harvard Law School. The country would be well served to have \n     someone with her tremendous qualifications--and deep ties to \n     our state--hold such an important judicial appointment.\n       I would urge a prompt consideration of her candidacy on the \n     merits.\n           Sincerely,\n     Patrick J.

We strongly \n     believe that stellar nominees with broad bipartisan support, \n     like Patricia, should be quickly confirmed to ensure our \n     justice system works effectively and efficiently. We feel \n     even more strongly about that knowing that Patricia is an \n     lllinois native.\n       We support the nomination of Patricia Millett because we \n     believe our system of justice will be positively impacted \n     with her as a member of our judiciary. Her career \n     accomplishments as a lawyer are extraordinary. Over the past \n     20 years, Patricia has argued 32 cases before the United \n     States Supreme Court and even more in the federal appeals \n     courts, including the D.C. Circuit.

The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague Senator \nDurbin from Illinois in support of Patricia Millett's nomination to the \nDC Circuit Court of Appeals. As he said so eloquently, Ms. Millett has \nbroad bipartisan support, extensive public and private sector \nlitigation experience, and she would make an outstanding addition to \nthe DC Circuit Court of Appeals. After graduating with honors from the \nUniversity of Illinois and Harvard Law School, Ms. Millett clerked at \nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. She then spent 15 years at the \nDepartment of Justice, including 11 years as assistant to the Solicitor \nGeneral in\n\n[[Page S7666]]\n\nboth Republican and Democratic administrations. Again, I think it is \nimportant to point out she has support on both sides of the aisle.\n  Ms. Millett has argued 32 cases before the Supreme Court as well as \ndozens of others at the circuit court level, and she currently manages \nher law firm's Supreme Court and national appellate practice.\n  She was unanimously rated ``well qualified'' by the American Bar \nAssociation's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, and that is \ntheir highest rating.\n  In addition to her professional work, Ms. Millett is very active in \nher community. She has been a literacy tutor for over 20 years, and \nthrough her church she volunteers at homeless shelters.\n  Ms. Millett has strong support across the political spectrum. Again, \nas Senator Durbin pointed out, she has been endorsed by seven former \nSolicitors General of the United States, three former Republican \nattorneys general, law enforcement groups, and civil rights groups. She \nalso has tremendous support from retired members of the military and \ngroups representing military families.\n  In addition to being a highly qualified nominee, Ms. Millett will \nfill one of three current vacancies on the 11-member DC Circuit Court. \nAgain, as Senator Durbin pointed out, the DC Circuit is considered the \nsecond-most important court in our Nation. It is critical that it be \nfully staffed with qualified judges. The court handles important \nterrorism and detention cases, it hears a large volume of complex \nissues involving administrative actions of the Federal Government. The \nDC Circuit is also considered the most important civilian court for \nmembers of the Armed Services and veterans.\n  Former DC Circuit Chief Judge Patricia Wald noted ``the DC Circuit \nhears the most complex, time-consuming, labyrinthine disputes over \nregulations with the greatest impact on ordinary Americans' lives: \nclean air and water regulations, nuclear plant safety, health care \nreform issues, insider trading and more.''\n  The Senate should have the opportunity to vote up or down on all of \nPresident Obama's nominees to this important court. It is way past time \nwe took action on this nomination.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Millett nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I wish to discuss the nomination of Patricia \nMillett to be a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Pattie, as \nshe is known, is clearly well qualified. She has received support from \nAttorneys General appointed by Republican Presidents, and from \nconservative Solicitors General such as Ken Starr, Theodore Olson, and \nPaul Clement. Her resume is stellar, her qualifications unquestioned, \nand her support broad.\n  Although Senator Dick Durbin claims she is an ``Illinois native'' in \na letter of support to President Obama--and Senator Tim Kaine, in his \nown letter of support to the President claims her as living in \nVirginia--she is actually a daughter of the State of Maine. Her mother \ngrew up in the small town of Dexter, where Pattie went to school \nthrough high school. She also attended school in Bangor, and for a \ntime, even worked at Eastern Maine General Hospital as it was then \nknown. She truly comes from good Maine stock.\n  Millett also juggles an extremely full life while excelling at most \neverything she tries. The wife of a veteran, Pattie herself holds a \nblack belt in taekwondo--a pastime that she took up in order to spend \nmore time with her kids. She is also very engaged with her community \nand volunteers at local homeless shelters. And when her husband was \ndeployed to Iraq, she singlehandedly took care of their kids and \nmanaged to continue with her incredible career.

Mr. President. I would like to take a moment to pay \ntribute to a Vermont woman who personifies inspirational. Carmen \nTarleton's journey as a survivor of domestic violence began nearly 6 \nyears ago, when her estranged husband broke into her home, attacked her \nwith a baseball bat and doused her with industrial-strength lye. She \nsuffered severe burns over 80 percent of her body.\n  I have followed Carmen's recovery with great interest and even \ngreater awe. Despite the scars that left her blinded and severely \ndisfigured, Carmen made no effort to hide the effects of that attack. \nShe never sought pity, nor did she dwell on the past. Instead, Carmen \nwrote a book and went on television, talking bravely and candidly about \nher long road back. She learned how to play the banjo and piano, and \nthrough the many surgeries and long hospital stays, Carmen's \ndetermination and spirit remained unbroken.\n  Last February, Carmen underwent a miraculous face transplant at \nBrigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, which was detailed in an \nOctober 26 front-page story in The New York Times. As that piece \npointed out, ``There is evidence that Ms. Tarleton's new face is more \nthan just donated tissue, (it) is becoming part of who she is.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have The New York Times article inserted \nin the Record. I believe everyone will be as inspired by Carmen \nTarleton as I have been.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 25, 2013]\n\n        For Victim of Ghastly Crime, a New Face, a New Beginning\n\n                          (By Abby Goodnough)\n\n       Thetford, Vt.--At 1:30 a.m. on Valentine's Day this year, \n     Carmen Tarleton left her rural home here and drove through \n     the frigid dark to Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. \n     Her doctor had called hours earlier with the news she had \n     been waiting for: a suitable donor had been found. She would \n     get a new face.\n       Almost six years had passed since her estranged husband \n     broke into her house one spring night, beat her with a \n     baseball bat and soaked her with industrial lye that he \n     squirted from a dish-soap bottle. The attack nearly blinded \n     Ms. Tarleton, a nurse and mother of two, and burned her \n     beyond recognition. She lost her eyelids, upper lip and left \n     ear. What remained of her face and much of her body was a \n     knobby patchwork of scar tissue and skin grafts, painful to \n     look at and far more painful to live with.\n       Now, after overcoming some initial fears, she was ready to \n     receive someone else's features. After 15 hours of transplant \n     surgery, Ms. Tarleton, 45, emerged from the operating room \n     with what looked to her mother, Joan VanNorden, like a puffy, \n     surreal mask. At first she wanted to faint as she stared at \n     the new face, smooth and freckled, stitched to her daughter's \n     pale scalp. But when Ms. Tarleton started talking in her old \n     familiar voice--``Can't you just get in here?''--Mrs. \n     VanNorden relaxed.\n       ``I said, This is who Carmen is now,' and it really looked \n     beautiful,'' she recalled. ``Although it didn't look anything \n     like her, it was her face.''\n       Face transplants are still an experimental procedure, the \n     first having taken place just eight years ago in France. Some \n     two dozen full or partial transplants have been completed \n     worldwide, including five at Brigham and Women's, which used \n     nearly $4 million in research grants from the Department of \n     Defense to do four of the surgeries. Arteries, veins, nerves \n     and muscles from the donor face must be painstakingly \n     connected to the recipient's, in what Dr. Bohdan Pomahac, Ms. \n     Tarleton's chief transplant surgeon, called ``by far the most \n     complicated operation that I do.''\n       Yet the psychological impact of a face transplant is \n     perhaps as far-reaching as the surgical one. Unlike a kidney \n     or liver or heart, a donated face is visible to all, \n     challenging recipients and their loved ones to incorporate an \n     entirely new countenance into long-held perceptions of a \n     person's identity.\n       Ms. Tarleton's appearance is still evolving: her scalp was \n     so badly burned that hair will never return to parts of her \n     head, but her donor's hair, the same shade of brown as her \n     own, is growing around her forehead and temples. Her right \n     eye remains closed, and her left droops. Her face is \n     sometimes masklike, betraying little emotion, because the \n     muscles are still reconnecting and she cannot yet move them \n     well. And that mask, oddly enough, looks like neither her nor \n     the woman who donated it.\n       But eight months after the operation, there is evidence \n     that Ms. Tarleton's new face is more than just donated \n     tissue, and is becoming part of who she is.\n       When her family thinks, or even dreams, about her, they \n     imagine her new visage. ``When someone at work asks me, How's \n     Carmen?' the picture that comes up in my mind more and more \n     is that face,'' said Ms. Tarleton's sister, Kesstan Blandin.\n       Yet for Ms. Tarleton herself, the process of acceptance has \n     been trickier. For one thing,\n\n[[Page S7667]]\n\n     her poor vision keeps her from seeing herself clearly unless \n     she holds a mirror up close. ``I don't yet feel it is my \n     face,'' she wrote in a recent blog post. ``I feel like I am \n     still borrowing it.''\n       Ms. Tarleton's former husband, Herbert Rodgers, 58, pleaded \n     guilty to a charge of maiming and is serving a prison \n     sentence of at least 30 years. Mr. Rodgers told the police \n     that he had been angry at Ms. Tarleton, believing she was \n     seeing another man after they separated.\n       Ms. Tarleton underwent a number of reconstructive \n     surgeries, but with little success. When Dr. Pomahac called \n     in May 2011 to propose a face transplant, Ms. Tarleton's mind \n     first leapt to a ``Twilight Zone'' episode that had jarred \n     her as a child, about a man who could change his appearance \n     to look like other people.\n       ``Initially I felt that it was very sci-fi,'' she said in a \n     recent interview while curled on the couch in the modest home \n     she shares with her two daughters. But she and her family \n     started researching, and after a few weeks of weighing the \n     pros and cons--for one thing, she is likely to be on \n     immunosuppressant drugs for the rest of her life, raising her \n     risk of infection and cancer--Ms. Tarleton decided to forge \n     ahead.\n       After a number of trips to Boston for physical and \n     psychological screening to determine if she was a good \n     candidate, she got on the donor list that fall. ``It was like \n     a big surprise, a big gift,'' she said. ``I'd already \n     accepted my disfigurement, fine. But I accepted it believing \n     there wasn't an alternative.''\n       The things Ms. Tarleton wanted from a new face were more \n     pragmatic than aesthetic. Tight bands of scars ringed her \n     neck, causing debilitating pain. She drooled constantly and \n     could not blink, jeopardizing a synthetic cornea in her left \n     eye. And with her face frozen from scarring, it was hard for \n     others to read her emotions.\n       For a time, she was devastated that she could not see ``the \n     old me,'' as she put it. But she moved on, writing a book \n     about her physical and emotional recovery from the attack and \n     speaking publicly about the experience. She seemed mostly \n     unconcerned about her appearance.\n       But in December 2012, she gained a more urgent desire for a \n     new face. She had started taking piano lessons at a music \n     shop not far from her home. Her teacher was Sheldon Stein, an \n     earthy, soft-spoken musician with whom she felt an instant \n     affinity. The feeling, it turned out, was mutual. The two say \n     they are in love.\n       ``I kept looking in the mirror all of a sudden when I met \n     Sheldon,'' she said. ``I wasn't insecure before. But now--now \n     you have feelings for somebody and now you have something to \n     lose, when before, one of the reasons I did so well is I had \n     nothing to lose anymore.''\n       After the operation, she went through a harrowing three \n     weeks when her immune system rejected the face. But \n     medications helped her accept the new tissue. And some of the \n     improvements she had hoped for came shortly after. Her neck \n     pain disappeared, and her left eyelid, immobile for years, \n     began to blink again. The drooling diminished, and is likely \n     to stop once she gets more feeling in her lips.\n       The transplant did not make Ms. Tarleton look like her \n     donor, Cheryl Denelli Righter of North Adams, Mass., who died \n     at 56 after a stroke. That is a typical outcome for face \n     transplant recipients, partly because their bone structures \n     are different from their donors'. Mysteriously, she now has a \n     cleft in her chin, something neither Ms. Denelli Righter nor \n     Ms. Tarleton's old face had.\n       Yet to Ms. Denelli Righter's daughter, something of her \n     mother lives on in Ms. Tarleton's new face. ``I get to feel \n     my mother's skin again, I get to see my mother's freckles, \n     and through you, I get to see my mother live on,'' the \n     daughter, Marinda Righter, told Ms. Tarleton in May. The two \n     have kept in touch, and Ms. Tarleton said she could feel Ms. \n     Righter's loss ``so strongly''--another complicating factor \n     as she adjusts.\n       One Tuesday in August, Ms. Tarleton made her way yet again \n     to Brigham and Women's, where doctors monitor the level of \n     anti-rejection medications in her blood and take biopsies of \n     the skin on her neck--which is the donor's--to look for any \n     sign of rejection.\n       Ms. Tarleton has undergone nearly 60 operations, mostly \n     skin grafts, at Brigham and Women's and has visited 21 times \n     since her latest release in March. On this day she was \n     exhausted, recovering from a bad headache the previous night \n     and a recent fall that had left her with an aching foot. But \n     she had a bit of good news for her doctors.\n       ``If I put my head on Sheldon's chest, I can feel his \n     hair,'' she said, ``and I couldn't before.''\n       Ms. Tarleton also met with Bridget Bowler, a speech \n     therapist who is helping her learn to move her new lips--\n     where nerve function typically takes the longest to return in \n     transplant recipients--and practice facial expressions. She \n     still has an air of the ventriloquist when she speaks, a \n     habit that Ms. Bowler is trying to help her shake.\n       ``One of these days in the near future,'' Ms. Tarleton \n     said, ``when I start to cry or I laugh, you're going to be \n     able to tell by looking at me how I feel.''\n       These days, Ms. Tarleton has returned to her hard-charging \n     self. Her summer included speaking engagements, weekend road \n     trips and late-night jam sessions with Mr. Stein and his \n     musician friends. She decided to take up the banjo in \n     addition to the piano, because she wanted to join in the \n     jams. ``Our whole lives,'' she said, ``are just about \n     experience.''\n       Ms. Blandin said Ms. Tarleton's new face has helped mute \n     the grief she still feels about the horrible damage done by \n     the lye attack. ``Now I just feel like a warm nostalgia: I \n     know you and I haven't forgotten you,'' she said of her \n     sister's original face. ``She's still Carmen in some ways, \n     but in other ways she's someone new and the face transplant \n     represents that.''\n       But Ms. Tarleton's daughters, Liza, 21, and Hannah, 19, who \n     live with her in a red barn that has been converted to \n     apartments, on a hill thick with wildflowers, were more \n     matter-of-fact when discussing her transformation, perhaps \n     intentionally.\n       ``Mom's going to do what she's going to do,'' Liza said.\n       Hannah chimed in. ``And we're going to get used to it,'' \n     she said, laughing.\n       ``And we're going to support it,'' Liza added, ``for \n     sure.''\n       With that, Liza got up to make her mother a hot dog. Ms. \n     Tarleton took her spot on the couch, a barely perceptible \n     smile flickering across her face.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/30/senate-section/article/S7667-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7667-S7668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HOMEOWNER FLOOD INSURANCE AFFORDABILITY ACT\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the \nHomeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act. This bipartisan, bicameral \nlegislation seeks to protect homeowners across the country from severe \nflood insurance rate hikes until Congress is provided assurances from \nthe agency related to flood mapping methodologies and affordability.\n  The long-term solvency of the National Flood Insurance Program is \ncritical to protecting taxpayer investments, communicating perceived \nflood risk to homeowners, and encouraging communities to invest in \nmitigation measures. The rates imposed by the legislation we adopted \nlast summer are working against those worthy goals.\n  A constituent from Ocean Springs, MS, contacted my office to give her \nperspective on the legislation. She wrote: ``Built in 1986, [my house] \nsurvived all hurricanes including Katrina. I used my retirement savings \nto buy the house. Before closing, flood insurance was grandfathered at \n$245.00 per year. After closing, the rate skyrocketed to $18,450. You \ncan understand my shock.'' If you do the math, her new rates are more \nthan 75 times the rate when she purchased her home.\n  I heard from Thomas Schafer, the Mayor of Diamondhead, MS. This city \nin Hancock County was ``ground zero'' for Hurricane Katrina in 2005. \nMayor Schafer called this legislation a ``devastating loss to [his] \ncommunity,'' pointing specifically to ``plummeting property values with \nincreased cost of flood insurance.''\n  These are communities that suffered the greatest natural disaster in \nour Nation's history in 2005, the effects of the Deepwater Horizon oil \nspill in 2010, and now this.\n  The bill I join my colleagues in introducing today aims to restrain \nthe rate increases to homeowners that are very troublesome.\n  Under this bill, the Federal Emergency Management Agency must provide \nassurances to Congress that it is using sound mapping methods to make \nflood insurance rate determinations. A study by the National Academies \nof Science produced in March of this year has called into question some \nof the engineering practices FEMA uses to determine rates. Before we \nlet these rates devalue private property and perhaps even devastate \nlocal economies, we need to be absolutely sure our practices and \nprocedures are as sound as possible.\n  Second, FEMA must complete the affordability study mandated by the \nsame legislation that is driving insurance rates up. If rates become so \nhigh that homeowners cannot participate in the program, or entire \ncommunities opt out of the program, all participants in the program \nwill suffer from a smaller risk pool. It is important that we \nunderstand the implications of these rates before we allow them to ruin \npeople's lives and communities.\n  I am pleased with the work accomplished by the bipartisan group of \nSenators who introduced this bill. The bill reflects the priorities of \nSenators from both parties and several regions. I believe it gives the \nSenate a strong starting point to address this important issue.\n\n[[Page S7668]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/30/senate-section/article/S7668-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                NATIONAL MEDICINE ABUSE AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Senate Caucus on \nInternational Narcotics Control, I rise in strong support of efforts \nbeing made across the country to reduce prescription drug abuse as part \nof National Medicine Abuse Awareness Month. In California, and \nthroughout the country, the misuse and abuse of prescription and over \nthe counter drugs is a significant problem. While the consequences are \ntragic and profound, they are also preventable.\n  According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, prescription \ndrug abuse is our Nation's fastest-growing drug problem. The U.S. \nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's 2012 \nNational Survey on Drug Use and Health found that over the past decade, \nthe non-medical use of prescription drugs among persons 12 years or \nolder rose from 1.9 million in 2002 to 11.1 million in 2011. The 2012 \nNational Survey on Drug Use and Health estimates that the abuse of \nprescription medications such as pain killers, tranquilizers, \nstimulants, and sedatives is second only to marijuana, the No. 1 abused \ndrug in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control have \nclassified prescription drug abuse as an epidemic.\n  To combat the epidemic of prescription drug and over the counter \nmedicine abuse, many community anti-drug coalitions are working to \nraise awareness about the negative consequences associated with the \nmisuse of these drugs.\n  The North Coastal Prevention Coalition in California is just one \nexample of a coalition pushing back against this problem. Together with \nSan Diego County's Prescription Drug Task Force, the Coalition has \nworked to create county-wide Pain Prescribing Guidelines. They have \nhelped facilitate National Take Back Days during which individuals are \nable to turn over unused prescription drugs. They also developed and \ndisseminated a brochure on ``Safe Pain Prescribing'' to emergency room \nphysicians.\n  I would like to acknowledge the critical efforts of the North Coastal \nPrevention Coalition and other anti-drug coalitions throughout the \ncountry in raising awareness about and combating the misuse of \nprescription medications. By designating October 2013 as National \nMedicine Abuse Awareness Month, Americans are able to reaffirm our \nnational, state and local level commitment to living healthy, drug-free \nlives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/30/senate-section/article/S7668-2", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           VA EMERGENCY CARE\n\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, on Monday I introduced a bill, S. 1588, \nwith Senators Moran, Isakson, and Begich to provide an emergency safety \nnet to roughly 144,000 veterans waiting for VA care. I thank my \ncolleagues for their support. This bill fixes a catch-22 in current law \nthat puts veterans who have recently returned from overseas at \nfinancial risk if they experience a medical emergency.\n  Under current law, a veteran enrolled in the VA system who receives \nemergency care at a non-VA facility can be reimbursed for those costs \nonly if the veteran had also received care at a VA facility in the \npreceding 24 months. The intent of this requirement is to encourage \nveterans to seek preventative care, which decreases the need for more \nexpensive emergency care. The problem is thousands of veterans have \nrecently come home from overseas and they can't meet the 24-month \nrequirement through no fault of their own. These veterans have \nscheduled their first new patient examination with VA, but they have \nnot yet received their examination because of VA waiting times.\n  In other words, they haven't received their first VA appointment \nbecause of VA waiting times, but if they need to go to a non-VA \nhospital for a medical emergency VA cannot reimburse them because they \nhaven't received their first VA appointment.\n  VA estimates 144,000 veterans are caught in this catch-22. With the \nwar in Afghanistan ending, even more veterans will be affected. This is \nwhy veteran service organizations such as the lraq and Afghanistan \nVeterans of America are supporting this measure.\n  This bill gives VA the flexibility to reimburse veterans who have not \nyet received their new patient examination if the veterans have to go \nto a non-VA hospital for a medical emergency. For Hawaii veterans in \nrural Oahu or the neighbor islands who live far from VA facilities, \nemergency care outside the VA may be their only option. Just last week \nI met a veteran from Waianae who had a medical emergency while waiting \n4 months for his first appointment at VA. Veterans such as he who were \ndenied VA reimbursement would get much needed relief under this \nlegislation.\n  In its FY2014 budget request, VA asked for the statutory authority \nprovided by this legislation. The VA has already budgeted for this new \nauthority in its FY2014 budget request, and the funding provided in \nH.R. 2216, as reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee on June \n27, 2013, is sufficient to cover any additional costs VA will incur \nusing this new authority.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this commonsense legislation. We \nowe it to our brave men and women in uniform who put their lives on the \nline for our country that the VA has the tools it needs to better serve \nnew veterans accessing the care they have earned.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/30/senate-section/article/S7668-3", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONGRATULATING AZERBAIJAN\n\n  Mr. BURR.

Mr. President, I wish to speak today about an effort long \nchampioned by my predecessors in the Senate, Senators Dodd and \nLieberman, and to express my commitment to carry on their work. That \nimportant project, the National Liberty Memorial, will commemorate the \npatriotism of African American soldiers during the American Revolution.\n  From the very first days of the American Revolution, African \nAmericans took part in the effort to establish a new nation and secure \nliberty's blessings. They did this despite the fact that the vast \nmajority of their brothers and sisters remained slaves.\n  Many of these African American patriots were from Connecticut. In \n1976, the town of Milford established a memorial to six black soldiers \nof the Revolutionary War. Nero Hawley, a slave who joined the \nContinental Army and served at Valley Forge, was later freed after the \nwar. You can visit his grave today at Riverside Cemetery in Trumbull. \nJupiter Mars lived an extraordinary life, serving in the Continental \nArmy during the war. He now rests in peace in beautiful Norfolk, CT. \nCato Meed enlisted in the Continental Army in Norwich in 1777, and \nserved at Valley Forge with General Washington.\n  These soldiers fought in every battle of the Revolutionary War, from \nthe\n\n[[Page S7669]]\n\ncolonists' defeat at the Battle of Long Island to our final victory at \nYorktown. At every point, African American men served bravely and with \nhonor. In fact, one of the first men to die in America's struggle for \nindependence was Crispus Attucks, who was shot by British troops during \nthe Boston massacre. This dedication to the war effort continued right \nup to the last battle when Salem Poor, a freed slave, earned \ncommendation recommendations from 14 officers for his bravery at Bunker \nHill. In recounting Poor's performance at the battle, officers wrote \nthere were too many heroic deeds to describe.\n  Committed to the cause of American independence, African American \nsoldiers filled every role that the war required of them, whether they \nserved on local militias, worked as cooks and carpenters in camps like \nValley Forge, or served as crewmembers on America's first Navy ships. \nMany African Americans escaped the bondage of slavery to join the \nAmerican Navy. Still others, like James Armistead, acted as spies for \nthe Revolution by providing American patriots with vital information \nneeded to win the war. Regardless of their roles, they served ably and \nwith distinction.\n  After the war, the agreements negotiated between slaves and masters \nwere largely honored and the patriots freed upon either enlistment or \nthe end of the war. However, once they had put down the weapons used to \nwin the Nation's independence, a few had to resort to legal means to \nenforce their claim to liberty. For one patriot--James Robinson, later \nof Detroit, MI, who also fought in the War of 1812--freedom did not \ncome until the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863. Many other African \nAmericans remained trapped in bondage as the institution of slavery \nexpanded in spite of lawsuits, petitions, and agitation.\n  Many of these African American soldiers would go on to organize early \nabolitionist and civil rights organizations. One such man was Samuel \nHarris, a soldier, Baptist minister, and early abolitionist who said, \n``Liberty is dear to my heart. I cannot endure the thought that my \ncountrymen live as slaves.'' Nevertheless, despite their valiant \nservice to this country's founding, many African American soldiers were \nnot treated with the dignity that their service demanded. While this \ncountry's founding documents stated that all men were created equal, \nthe Nation still sought to hold many Americans as property.\n  It is estimated that the names of at least half of these brave \nsoldiers would have been lost to history had it not been for the \nefforts of Plainville, CT native Lena Santos Ferguson. Five years ago, \nthe Daughters of the American Revolution fulfilled a promise made to \nher in 1984 to identify as many African American Revolutionary War \nsoldiers and patriots as possible. ``Forgotten Patriots,'' contains the \nnames of over 5,000, as well as the communities where they once \nresided. Nearly 20 Connecticut towns have approved resolutions that \nhonor them, and they have joined the ranks of those seeking \nconstruction of the National Liberty Memorial.\n  At the beginning of this year President Obama signed into law \nlegislation that was passed by the Congress last year that once again \naffirmed our public commitment to memorialize these brave patriots \nthrough a new memorial in the Monumental Core of our capital city. \nLiberty Fund D.C., a nonprofit established to lead the effort to \nconstruct the memorial, is currently working with architects and \nFederal agencies to make that goal a reality.\n  I believe that we must do what we can to build this memorial. \nFurther, I believe that a key feature of any such memorial is that it \nshould be visually tied to the Washington Monument, the most prominent \nRevolutionary-era monument in the District. There should be a clear \nsightline from the memorial to the Washington Monument.\n  For good reason, constructing any new memorial in the Washington, DC \narea is a rigorous process, and there are a number of prerequisites to \nbe met before construction can begin. I look forward to continuing to \nwork with Liberty Fund D.C. to achieve the goals of this important \nlegislation, to ensure that a monument to the African American patriots \nof the Revolutionary War be constructed in a prominent location in our \nNation's capital.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/30/senate-section/article/S7669-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    TRIBUTE TO COLONEL KIRK VAN PELT\n\n Mr. PRYOR.

A bill to amend the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \nAct to ensure that individuals can keep their health insurance \ncoverage; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Mr. President, I come before you today to \nintroduce a piece of legislation which is timely and very much needed.\n  One of the reasons I decided to run for the Senate was the passage of \nthe health care law. The reason I thought it was pretty important is \nbecause I said at the time that passage of the\n\n[[Page S7676]]\n\nhealth care law represented the greatest assault on our freedoms in my \nlifetime. I believe that is true, and I believe that is being borne out \ntoday. We are witnessing it today.\n  The passage of the health care law resonated with me. It made such an \nimpact on me because my wife and I are beneficiaries of the freedom \nthat we had with our current health care system. Our first child, our \ndaughter Carey was born with a very serious congenital heart defect. \nHer aorta and pulmonary arteries were reversed. Her first day of life, \nour daughter Carey was rushed down to Children's Hospital of Wisconsin \nin Milwaukee, where a wonderful man, Dr. John Thomas, came in at 1:30 \nin the morning and did a procedure and saved her life.\n  Eight months later, when her heart was the size of a small plum, \nanother incredibly dedicated team of medical professionals in 7 hours \nof open-heart surgery totally reconstructed the upper chamber of her \nheart. Her heart operates backwards today. She is 30 years old and a \nnurse practitioner practicing at that same hospital in which her life \nwas saved. She married about 3 weeks ago.\n  Our story has a happy ending because my wife Jane and I had that \nfreedom. I was able to call Boston Children's and Chicago children's \nhospitals and talk to the preeminent surgeons in the world--which means \nin America--and find out what is the most advanced medical treatment, \nthe most advanced surgical technique at the time. We were able to avail \nourselves of that, and now I have a beautiful daughter who is 30 years \nold. She is also taking care of those little babies in a neonatal \nintensive care unit.\n  I decided to file this piece of legislation today because as a \nSenator from the State of Wisconsin we have been getting a number of \nphone calls in our office from Wisconsinites who are getting letters of \ncancellation from their insurance companies. In particular, one couple \ntouched my heart and gave me a great cause for concern.\n  This couple--who do not want to be identified because they fear IRS \nretribution, which is a little different story and a little off topic, \nbut I think it is worth pointing out--both have cancer. The wife has \nstage IV lung cancer. The husband is recovering from prostate cancer. \nIt is in remission.\n  This couple had availed themselves and are currently covered under \nthe Wisconsin high-risk insurance pool. It is a high-risk pool that \nworks. I know in my business, when we had individuals who were lasered \noff of our insurance policy, those individuals were able to avail \nthemselves of this sharing-of-the-risk pool in the high-risk pool. It \nworks and it is affordable.\n  This couple received their notice of cancellation from the high-risk \npool, and they panicked. They were in a panic.\n  When one has stage IV lung cancer, the last thing one needs is \nstress. ObamaCare caused them a great deal of stress. It is causing \nthem a great deal of stress.\n  They tried to get on healthcare.gov almost 40 times without success. \nThey contacted our office. We have done everything we can to help them.\n  They have been in touch with some of the insurance carriers that will \nbe part of the exchange participating in Wisconsin. They have received \nquotes. This was preliminary. This isn't final, but under the high-risk \npool their maximum out-of-pocket exposure, including the cost of their \npremiums, is about $20,000 per year. He is working and has a good job. \nThey can barely afford that.\n  Preliminary indications show that exposure will double to $40,000. \nThe only reason they might remain whole is they may qualify for a \nsubsidy. Nobody can calculate it yet. They have received three \ndifferent answers. It is like taking a tax return to 100 different \npreparers and getting 100 different results of what tax is owed. But \nbased on those preliminary estimates it is looking as though their \ntotal exposure won't be $20,000, it will be more like $40,000, and \ntheir subsidy might cover half of that. So their health care expense \ndidn't decline, as President Obama promised, by $2,500 per year. It is \ngoing to virtually double. And if it doesn't double, it is because the \nAmerican taxpayer will be picking up that other half.\n\n  So one of the primary promises made by President Obama--that if we \npassed a health care law, the cost to a family health care plan would \ndecline by $2,500 a year by the end of his first term--has been broken. \nThat was not true.\n  Of course, the other very famous promise the President made \nrepeatedly was: If you like your health care plan, you can keep your \nhealth care plan. I would like to go through a number of times \nPresident Obama actually made that statement. He looked the American \npeople in the eye, trying to sell his health care plan, and guaranteed \nthem if they liked their health care plan they would be able to keep \nit.\n  On March 6, 2009, he said:\n\n       If somebody has insurance they like, they should be able to \n     keep that insurance. If they have a doctor they like, they \n     should be able to keep their doctor.\n\n  On May 11, 2009:\n\n       Americans must have the freedom to keep whatever doctor and \n     health care plan they have.\n\n  On June 2, 2009:\n\n       If they like the coverage they have now, they can keep it.\n\n  That was from a letter to Senate Democratic leaders.\n  On June 11, 2009, President Obama said:\n\n       Americans must have the freedom to keep whatever doctor and \n     health care plan they have.\n\n  On June 15, 2009--and this is probably the most famous one I \nremember--in an address to the American Medical Association, President \nObama said:\n\n       If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your \n     doctor. Period. If you like your health care plan, you will \n     be able to keep your health care plan. Period. No one will \n     take it away. No matter what.\n\n  I think I have made my point, but I have another 13 quotes I can \ncontinue reading that basically make the same point with the same \npromise and the same guarantee.\n  As recently as the beginning of this month, on the White House Web \nsite it says:\n\n       We've got some good news for you. If you currently have \n     private health insurance, you should be able to keep it, and \n     that's exactly what the health care law says.\n\n  Unfortunately, today over 2 million Americans have received \ncancellation notices of their insurance policies--the policies they \nchose, and that for just a little more time they will have the freedom \nto choose. They won't have that freedom come January 1.\n  So one of two possibilities is true. Either President Obama was being \nentirely dishonest with the American public when he made those repeated \npromises, those repeated guarantees or he was totally disengaged from \nthe process, did not have a clue what was in his own health care plan \nor did not understand the incredibly negative consequences of that \nhealth care plan.\n  That brings me to my bill. The reason President Obama can claim if \nyou like your health care plan you can keep it is that within the \nhealth care bill there actually is a grandfather clause. The first two \nparagraphs of that grandfather clause actually would work. The problem \nis those first two paragraphs or sections are followed by an \nevisceration of the grandfather clause. So basically what we have is a \nphony grandfather clause contained within the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act.\n  My piece of legislation--the If You Like Your Health Plan You Can \nKeep it Act--actually is a real grandfather clause and it uses \nPresident Obama's exact language. All my bill does is it simply strikes \nthe phony grandfather clause and inserts basically the exact same \nlanguage that was there, although we remove those exceptions, those \nmandates. In other words, we eviscerate the evisceration of the \ngrandfather clause.\n  I am here today to announce I have filed that bill. We have at least \n35 Republican cosponsors of the bill. I know the House is moving a \nsimilar piece of legislation. I know there is talk, and hopefully we \nwill be joined by our Democratic colleagues. It is a simple \nproposition. I am asking every Senator to join me in passing this bill, \nthe true grandfather clause, to help President Obama keep his promise \nto the American people.\n  I have to say that, unfortunately, this bill won't help the Wisconsin \ncouple I would so like to help, so like to guarantee they can keep \ntheir health care coverage. The only way we can help that couple is if \nwe repeal the entire law, because the guaranteed issue,\n\n[[Page S7677]]\n\nhigh-risk pools are extinct. They do not exist. That coverage is gone. \nBut if my Democratic Senate colleagues will join me in passing this \nbill--the If You Like Your Health Plan You Can Keep it Act--we can keep \nPresident Obama's promise to millions of Americans. I think it is worth \nit, and I ask all my Senate colleagues to join me in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mrs. McCaskill, Ms. Ayotte, and Ms. \n        Heitkamp):\n  S. 1618. A bill to enhance the Office of Personnel Management \nbackground check system for the granting, denial, or revocation of \nsecurity clearances or access to classified information of employees \nand contractors of the Federal Government; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today, Senator McCaskill, Senator Ayotte, \nSenator Heitkamp, and I are introducing the Enhanced Security Clearance \nAct of 2013, which would strengthen our process for allowing federal \nemployees and other individuals to have access to classified \ninformation. We must improve our current security clearance process to \nprevent, as much as possible, future incidents such as the murders at \nthe Washington Navy Yard. Our bill directs OPM to institute at least \ntwo audits of every security clearance at random times during each \nfive-year period the clearance is active. Any red flags raised would \nthen be reported back to the employing agency to determine if a re-\ninvestigation of the clearance is needed.\n  As a former Chairman and Ranking Member of the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, the issue of background investigations \nas it relates to security clearances is an issue with which I am well \nacquainted. There needs to be a balance between processing of \nclearances quickly enough to allow individuals to do their jobs, but \nalso thoroughly enough to flag potential problems.\n  Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, and several high-profile \nespionage cases, heightened national security concerns underscored the \nneed for a timely, high-quality personnel security clearance process. \nIn the early part of this decade, the Department of Defense processed \nhundreds of thousands of security clearance background investigation \nrequests--both initial and re-clearances, for service members, \ngovernment employees, and industry personnel who were conducting \nclassified work for the government. The timeliness of DOD's security \nclearance process was a problem which, when coupled with an increased \ndemand for security clearances, had led to a backlog of more than \n500,000 investigations.\n  Delays in updating overdue clearances for command, agency, and \nindustry personnel performing classified government work increased \nrisks to national security and the costs of doing classified government \nwork. This led GAO to designate the DOD clearance program as a high-\nrisk area, and in 2005 for DOD to transfer its personnel security \nfunction and about 1,600 personnel to OPM. At the time, this change \nseemed a logical step in addressing the problems caused by the backlog. \nAnd by 2008 OPM had eliminated the backlog and announced end-to-end \nelectronic processing of background investigations. Now, OPM oversees \napproximately 90 percent of all background investigations for security \nclearances with the assistance of private sector contractors.\n  Although we have made significant advances in the processing of \nbackground checks, there is still a gaping hole in the current security \nclearance process that has enabled people who exhibit obvious signs of \nhigh-risk behavior to remain undetected. We have seen this time and \ntime again in incidents like Edward Snowden's disclosure of stolen \nclassified information, and most recently we have Aaron Alexis, the \nNavy Yard shooter with apparently severe mental illness.\n  Once an individual is cleared, the process of maintaining the \nclearance requires a reinvestigation at various points in time based \nupon the type of clearance. These ``gaps'' between clearance and re-\nclearance can be 5, 10 or even 15 years, and most of the data is self-\nreported by the individuals themselves. These periods of time pose a \nsignificant concern in the current clearance process. OPM has \nannounced, in some cases, that it is going to reduce the time frame \ndown to one year, but this is not the case for all clearances. People's \nlives may change dramatically over these gaps of time, which poses \nsignificant and unnecessary security risks.\n  The United States issues approximately 5 million clearances to \ngovernment employees and contractors, and the ongoing review process is \nconducted manually, by a limited number of investigators. Further, the \nmanual process is flawed. The OPM Inspector General recently reviewed \n18 investigators and found disturbing abuses in the quality of \nclearance investigations they conducted, which included interviews that \nnever occurred, answers to questions that were never asked, and record \nchecks that were never conducted. Even if done properly, however, given \nthe limited number of investigative agents in the field, it is not \nfeasible to manually track nearly five million clearances effectively.\n  For example, in fiscal year 2010, fewer than one percent of all \ncontractors with clearances filed an incident report, despite the fact \nthat they are required to file these reports on a wide variety of \nevents including marital status change, excessive financial hardship, \nand criminal activity, to maintain their clearance. Generally, such \nevents occur in the lives of more than half of the U.S. population \nduring the same time periods. The fact is, cleared personnel under-\nreport lifestyle changes, allegiance changes, and derogatory \ninformation for fear of job loss, embarrassment, and, most important, \nthe discovery of nefarious intent. Further, because the system relies \non self-reported data, the chances of someone getting caught are \nminimal. Between 1997 and 2013, of the civilian clearances issued, \nfewer than one percent were revoked. This can mean that the people who \nare cleared very seldom-go bad, that cleared individuals are not self-\nreporting changes in their lives, or the current process is not \ndetecting everything.\n  In 2004, I sponsored the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention \nAct, which became law in December of that year. This law allows for the \nuse of advanced technology and third party databases to expedite, \nverify, and enhance the investigative and adjudicative process. The \ngovernment needs to utilize existing solutions, which are already used \nby law enforcement, to automate random audits on individuals with \nactive security clearances.\n  If random audits had been in place after Aaron Alexis's secret \nclearance was granted in 2007, red flags would have been generated with \nhis arrest in 2009 and the two liens on his property, which could \nindicate potential excessive financial hardship. Further, it may have \nidentified a potential alias with a vast social media trail indicating \nother concerning traits. The alerts generated would have prompted OPM \nto notify DOD, which would have provoked a reevaluation before Alexis's \n2017 re-clearance. This re-evaluation could have discovered that he \nopenly discussed ``hearing voices,'' a clear sign of his mental \nillness. A random audit would have alerted OPM of these new issues and \npotentially averted tragedy.\n  The OPM Background Investigation process must be capable of flagging \nhigh-risk individuals holding clearances and alert case officers of \nsituations requiring review before any adverse consequence takes place. \nThe current process, however, is dated, but the system can be \nstrengthened to better help the government identify these dangerous \nindividuals. OPM must address the blind spots that exist in the current \nmanual security clearance review process. The shooting tragedies at the \nWashington Navy Yard, along with the information security breaches \nperpetrated by Bradley Manning and Edward Snowden, have demonstrated \nthat the current security clearance process is inadequate.\n  This legislation has been endorsed by the Federal Managers \nAssociation; the FBI Agents Association; the Alcohol-Tobacco-Firearms \nand Explosives Association; The International Association of Chiefs of \nPolice; The International Federation of Professional and Technical \nEngineers, AFL-CIO & CLC; The National Native American Law Enforcement \nAssociation; TechAmerica; General Dynamics Information Technologies; \nLexisNexis; Lt.

A bill to establish the Alyce Spotted Bear and Walter \nSoboleff Commission on Native Children, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to an issue in my \nState of Alaska, in the State of North Dakota--quite honestly, in so \nmany of our home States. We have facts, we have statistics, and we have \nissues that face our indigenous peoples, most particularly our \nindigenous children that, truth be told, are not what we want to write \nhome about. In fact, in many, many cases, these statistics are \nshameful.\n  The effort and the initiative to make a difference in the lives of \nthe children of our first peoples is an effort I want to speak to \ntoday, and I join with my colleague from North Dakota in addressing \nthis issue. I want to help shine a light on the conditions facing \nindigenous children in our country to whom the United States has a \nlegal commitment. This is a Federal trust responsibility that is owed \nto these children.\n  I thank Senator Heitkamp for her commitment and for her compassion to \naddress these issues facing our Nation's indigenous children by \nintroducing legislation to establish the Commission on Native Children. \nI will defer to my colleague so we can have a conversation about this, \nbut it is important to note that the very first time I had ever met \nSenator Heitkamp, we literally exchanged handshakes, introduced \nourselves, and within 5 minutes we were talking about children's \nissues, Native children's issues in our respective States. That little \n5-minute discussion led to much further discussion later on and a \ncommitment to work to address these issues.\n  I do have many remarks I would like to make this afternoon, but I \nwould like my colleague from North Dakota, who has worked so diligently \non this issue, with her staff working with my staff, to describe to our \ncolleagues the legislation that today we are both introducing \nestablishing the Commission on Native Children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I will start with a story because I \nthink a lot of us come to the Senate with a lot of experiences, a lot \nof common experiences, and I think the Senator from Alaska and I have \nshared this common experience of seeing the despair, looking at the \nstatistics, but more importantly, in my case, in Indian Country, and in \nher case, working with indigenous people, seeing that so much more \nneeds to be done; seeing the disparities in education, seeing the \ndisparities in health care, seeing the disparities in housing, and \nrecognizing that all of those things have huge consequences; seeing \nwhat high poverty does to people who are not given the right \nopportunities.\n  I think frequently it is so important that we do something like this \nso we can begin that process of educating our colleagues on how this \nsituation is different, what our experiences are. If you have not seen \nor been in Indian Country, if you have not looked at the statistics, it \nis alarming. It is absolutely alarming.\n  The story I want to give before I talk about our legislation is the \nstatistic on mortality rates. In this country, child mortality has \ndecreased by 9 percent since 2000. That is good news. We are paying \nmore attention, doing a better job at infancy, doing a better job \nraising our kids. The child mortality rate among Native children has \nincreased 15 percent--increased 15 percent at the same time it has \ndecreased in this country 9 percent. We have tried various programs, \nwhether it is housing programs, education programs, higher education \nprograms, but we know this works better if we all work together and if \nwe work collaboratively.\n  I know a lot of people have suspicions about things called \ncommissions, but I\n\n[[Page S7679]]\n\nbelieve for the first time we will be pulling together the data \nregarding what is exactly the status of Native children all across the \nUnited States of America--in Alaska, Alaska indigenous people, as well \nas Alaskan folks--and saying: Where do we begin to understand this \nproblem differently and change outcomes, because if we keep doing what \nwe are doing right now, we will fail the next generation of Native \nchildren, and we will fail to do what we need to do. This is not a new \nissue for me. When I was attorney general, I spent a lot of time in \nIndian Country, a lot of time on Indian issues.\n  I want to tell a story before I describe briefly what this Commission \nwould do. It is a story about a woman who showed up at a conference. We \nwere talking about trying to get resources to do a conference on \njuvenile crime on the reservations. She told a story about how she was \ndyslexic as a child and her mother was not a very patient woman. She \nwas waiting to go to a birthday party, and she was sitting and looking \nout the window, and she would ask her mother every 5 minutes: Is it \ntime yet? Are they going to come? Finally, her mother, out of \nfrustration, took this little girl's hand and dragged it back and forth \nacross a nail that was on the window ledge and said: Maybe now you will \nremember. She held up her hand, and you could still see the scars. And \nshe said something I will never forget. She said: Who cares about me? I \nlooked out that window and thought, who is going to come and help me?\n  All across America there are children looking out a window in Indian \nCountry and in all of these very remote places wondering who is going \nto care about them. Who is going to help them? When we have trust \nobligations, isn't that the job of the U.S. Congress? Isn't that the \njob of all of us, to care about all of our children? Yet these children \nare left behind.\n  Time and time again, you will read a story in the paper about an \nabducted child, and you do not realize there could have been 10 \nchildren abducted off a reservation in North Dakota. You do not read a \nstory about trafficking in North Dakota, but it is happening. You do \nnot read a story about child abuse and neglect, and it is happening, or \nfailed schools, schools whose roofs are caving in because we have not \nmet our education obligation.\n  So what this Commission would do is bring attention to this very \nimportant part of our population, the part that gets left behind, that \nno one looks out for, and start saying: What are we going to do \ndifferently? What are we going to do differently for our children? \nThese are all our children.\n  I can tell you I felt a kindred spirit when I began to talk about \nthis issue with the Senator from Alaska and talk about how important it \nis for people to really understand those challenges and how important \nit is to prevent costs later on if we just do a little Head Start. \nChildren in Indian Country go to Head Start at a lower rate. Their \neducation system fails them. Fifty percent of Native kids graduate from \nhigh school, compared to 75 percent in the White population.\n  These statistics mean a lot. We all look at statistics. But behind \neach one of them is a young child struggling to make something out of \ntheir lives in this world and wanting to believe that they matter. So \nwhat we are doing today is establishing a commission on the status of \nIndian children to simply say: You matter.\n  We need to come up with different ideas and different solutions on \nhow we are going to solve the problem. I had a great opportunity to go \nto Alaska and spend some time with the Alaska corporations and the \nindigenous people in Alaska. It was a new experience for me because we \nare used to Indian Country. We are used to reservations.\n  But so many of the challenges--I am sure the Senator from Alaska \nwould agree--so many of the challenges are so similar in Alaska and \nNorth Dakota, partly because of our remoteness but partly because these \nare obligations that have not been lived up to. So I wish to ask the \ngreat Senator from Alaska how she thinks this commission could work to \nactually better the children, the Native children in our country?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I appreciate that \nas we work to advance opportunities for American Indian, Alaska Native, \nNative Hawaiian children throughout the country, we remember these are \nnot just statistics. As horrifying as these statistics are, these \nstatistics truly do come to life when we hear those real stories.\n  When we were working with the Senator's office to develop this \nlegislation, kind of looking at the indigenous children in this country \nthrough the lens of the justice system, the education system, the \nhealth care system, and then work to provide recommendations to the \nrespective government agencies that will help to address these issues \nthat affect our Native children, we talk about the trust \nresponsibility.\n  That trust responsibility does not mean anything unless we keep our \ncommitment. We just simply are not keeping the commitment. The Senator \nmentioned the issue of housing. Having had an opportunity to serve on \nthe Indian Affairs Committee now for 10 years, we hear in committee \nhearing after committee hearing the situation with regard to housing \nand the inadequate situation on so many of our reservations.\n  In the State of Alaska, our housing situation is truly a crisis in so \nmany places. Bethel, which is probably--I believe it is now our fourth \nor fifth largest community in the State--is viewed as a hub community. \nSo if you come in for health care from one of the surrounding villages, \nyou come into Bethel. If you are trying to escape an abusive situation, \ntrying to get your children to safety, leaving the village, you come \ninto Bethel, where there is a women's shelter where you can kind of \npull yourself together.\n  But the problem then is, when you have been able to pull yourself \ntogether, when your children feel they are in a safe place right now, \nthen there is no place for you to take your children. There is no \nhousing out on the market there in Bethel. So what happens. Time after \ntime after time the woman goes back to the abuser, the children go back \nto an abusive situation, a situation where domestic violence is \noftentimes out of control.\n  Let me speak to just some of the statistics that we are facing in \ndealing with rural justice in Alaska. Nearly 95 percent of the crimes \nin rural Alaska can be traced back to alcohol abuse. By the time an \nAlaska Native reaches adulthood, the chance of experiencing domestic \nviolence or sexual violence is 51 percent for women, 29 percent for \nmen. On Native children, 60 percent of the children are in need of \nfoster parents. I have been working on the issue of fetal alcohol \nsyndrome and how we raise awareness and how we eliminate this entirely \npreventable disease.\n  I think it is noteworthy that for years I worked with Senator \nDaschle, formerly of this body and the majority leader, on this \ninitiative. But he knew that on the reservations in his State, they \nwere facing the same situation that we were in Alaska with fetal \nalcohol spectrum disorder. In Alaska, we have the highest rate of fetal \nalcohol spectrum disorder in the Nation. But in the Native areas of the \nState, they are then 15 times higher than in any of the non-Native \nparts of the State; again, an area where we think, if we can make some \ninroads in awareness, this is a disease that is 100 percent \npreventable.\n  Suicide is an issue that strikes home to far too many. Alaska Native \nmales between the ages of 12 and 24 experience the highest rate of \nsuicide of any demographic within the country. We have the highest rate \nof suicides per capita in the country. It is our young Native men who \ndrive that statistic.\n  When it comes to rape statistics, also a horrific example, \nunfortunately, the term has been applied that Alaska is the ``rape \ncapital of America.'' It is our Native women--one in three--who are \nexperiencing much of the sexual abuse. We cannot accept this reality.\n  When we talk about infrastructure--I mentioned housing. We think \nabout the lack of public infrastructure and how that impacts the health \nof a child or the health of a family. We are still a relatively young \nState. You have heard me say 80 percent of our communities are not \naccessible by road. So we lack certain infrastructure, including in \nmany of our villages basic water, basic sewer systems. We simply do not \nhave it. If you do not have clean water for cooking, for drinking, for \ncleaning, just basic hygiene, it can be deadly for our families.\n\n[[Page S7680]]\n\n  The CDC has determined that lack of inhome water services causes high \nrates of respiratory and skin infections. We see this in our rural \nNative villages. The average toddler in the United States gets RSV, \nwhich is this respiratory syncytial virus, before they are about 2 \nyears old. The average Alaska Native baby gets RSV before they are 11 \nweeks old. So they are just mere infants and they are getting this \nrespiratory virus because of sanitation issues.\n  A lack of clean drinking water, proper wastewater systems leads to \nfever, to hepatitis, leads to infectious disease. Then what happens? \nYou are a child out in the small village. You are then sent in, your \nfamily has to take you into Anchorage, not just one airplane flight \naway, oftentimes two airplane flights, $1,000-plus airfare in the city \nwhere your costs are high.\n  You think about the impact to a family when you have a sick infant, \nan infant who has been sick because their family lacks basic sanitation \nin this day and age.\n  One of the household chores--and we all had chores when we were \ngrowing up as kids. In far too many of our villages in the State of \nAlaska, one of the chores the kids have is emptying the honey bucket. \nFor those who do not know what a honey bucket is, a honey bucket is the \nbig 5-gallon bucket that you get from Home Depot with a toilet seat lid \non it that is put in the corner of the house. That is the bathroom.\n  You have to take that bucket out and dispose of it. You have \nchildren, your 10-year old walking down the boardwalk with a bucket of \nhuman waste to dump. This is happening in this day and this age. Who, \nagain, bears the weight of so much of this is our Native children. \nThink about this from a health safety perspective.\n  I wish to share a story, as my colleague from North Dakota did, and \nthen--I just came from the Alaska Federation of Natives annual \nconference. It is the largest gathering of Natives in the country. They \ncome from all corners of the State. It is truly like a family reunion, \nusually a very upbeat, very happy occasion where people come together \nfor a great deal of sharing.\n  This year there was sharing on a personal side that perhaps we have \nnot witnessed before. Much of the sharing came from children, and \nsharing, rather than stories of happiness and opportunities for the \nfuture, was driven by a feeling of not helplessness--because if you are \nhelpless you will not speak up--but a feeling that we can no longer \nremain silent.\n  The instances of domestic violence in the home, of child sexual \nassault in the home, of alcoholism and drug abuse that brings about \nattempted suicide in the home caused a group of 4-H kids from Tanana, \nAK, to come together--about a half dozen of them--ages maybe 6, 7, up \nto high school, to stand in front of an audience of 3,000-plus people \nand say: We have had enough. We have to speak out, even though we have \nbeen told do not talk about this; do not talk about this because it \nmight shame your family. These children had the courage to step forward \nand say: This is not right. We are taught to respect our elders, but \nwhen our elders do not respect us, we are going to speak out. Their \ncourage in front of this huge gathering was amazing. It is not unlike \nthe story my colleague from North Dakota just told when that young girl \nlooked out the window and said: Who will come and take care of me? Who \nis waiting for me?\n  These children from Tanana were saying: We are not going to be quiet.\n  It ought to be us. It ought to be the grownups who are saying: Let's \ntake charge of this. Let's turn these horrible statistics around. Let's \nmake every day a better day for our children. Those kids are the real \nheroes.\n  So when I come together with my colleagues in an effort such as \nthis--I am with the Senator--oftentimes we say: Oh, commissions. What \ndo commissions do? Maybe this starts to give some of these young people \nhope, whether you are on the reservations in North Dakota or whether \nyou are in Tanana, AK. Maybe there is hope that the grownups out there \nare listening and can work with them.\n  We are trying to look at this holistically, through the education \nsystem, the health care system, and through the justice system. I am \nquite pleased to be able to work with my colleague on this initiative. \nI do not think there is anything more important that we can be doing \nfor our young people than to offer them a ray of hope.\n  I thank my colleague from North Dakota and all she has done to get us \nto this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, suicide is the second leading cause of \ndeath among Native American young adults ages 15 to 24. It is 2\\1/2\\ \ntimes the national average. The despair my great friend from the great \nState of Alaska has just outlined for us--it seems there is no way out, \nthat no one is looking, they are invisible, that their problems are \ninconsequential and no one cares. Yes, I thank my colleague from Alaska \nfor that wonderful vision that this commission tells them they are not \ninvisible to us, they are not invisible to the Congress, they are not \ninvisible to the administration; that people are there and they care.\n  Maybe it offers that hope. Maybe it offers that opportunity to tell \nmore of these stories and to shine a greater light of awareness onto \nthis problem.\n  It is a national disgrace. If we continue to do what we have always \ndone in housing, education, health care, and public safety, if we \ncontinue to do what we have always done, we will lose yet another \ngeneration to despair.\n  It is time for Congress to step up, honor our treaty obligations and \nrecognize that if we cannot protect the smallest among us, the most \nvulnerable, the most remote among us, that we aren't worthy of this \nbody. We aren't worthy of this government.\n  I invite all of our colleagues to join with us and send a message \nloudly and clearly to Native children in our country that they matter; \nthey matter at their homes, in their communities, their States, their \nclubs, and their schools, but they also matter in the halls of the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The senior Senator from \nAlaska is recognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. If I may close out my comments, Senator Heitkamp has \nhonored an individual, Alyce Spotted Bear, by naming this commission on \nNative American children after Alyce Spotted Bear. She has invited me \nto also include a leader on so many education and children's issues.\n  I wish to take a moment to speak to the contributions of a great \nAlaskan, Dr. Walter Soboleff. Senator Heitkamp has honored Alaskans by \nincluding Dr. Soboleff with the naming of this children's commission.\n  I was very honored to learn of Dr. Soboleff, who passed away in 2011 \nat 102 years old. In our State he was an elder statesman. He was a \nspiritual leader and an Alaska Native advocate who championed Alaska \nNative rights and cultural education. He was the first Alaska Native to \nserve on our State Board of Education, in which he served as chairman. \nHe established the Alaska Native Studies Department at the University \nof Alaska Fairbanks to ensure that our Native students could be taught \ntheir history, culture, and language within that university system.\n  Clearly, when one is 102 years old, they live through a transition of \ntime, but he lived through a transition for our Native people in our \nState. He advocated to ensure that our State's education system \nrecognized that Native students must know their culture. In order to \nknow who they are, they need to know where they have come from. They \nneed to know their culture. They need to know how to hunt, how to fish, \nand that their culture is the foundation of a strong identity, ensuring \nstudent success and pride in oneself.\n  When I thought about how we might be able to recognize one of \nAlaska's own who demonstrated to our young people that if you know \nyourself, if you know your culture, if you are proud of that, even \nunder some daunting challenges, you can move forward. You can \npersevere.\n  I thank my colleague for giving me this opportunity to show him \nrecognition as we also honor Alyce Spotted Bear.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Ms. Ayotte):\n  S. 1626.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 3190.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3190) to provide for the continued performance \n     of the functions of the United States Parole Commission, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the United States Parole Commission is \nscheduled to expire tomorrow. After significant bicameral negotiations, \n2 weeks ago, the House of Representatives passed by unanimous consent a \nbipartisan bill, H.R. 3190, to reauthorize the commission for 5 years. \nPublic safety demands that we pass this legislation swiftly and I urge \nthe Senate to support its immediate enactment. We should have passed \nthis bill weeks ago, but a single Republican hold has placed us in the \nprecarious position of seeking passage on the eve of expiration. This \nis not the way to protect public safety.\n  The Parole Commission is responsible for granting or denying parole \nfor Federal and District of Columbia prisoners who were sentenced \nbefore the Federal and DC Governments abolished parole. The commission \nwas created to consider the requests of these ``old law'' Federal and \nDC inmates, but it also has jurisdiction over more recent DC offenders \nwho are on supervised release from prison. In addition, the commission \nsupervises some military law offenders, State offenders in the witness \nprotection program, and foreign-law offenders serving sentences in the \nUnited States.\n  The consequences of failing to reauthorize the commission would be \ndire. ``Old law'' Federal and DC inmates are required by law to receive \nperiodic parole hearings. If the commission were unavailable to hold \nthese hearings and declare that certain inmates should not be paroled, \naround 3,500 inmates would be released. Potentially dangerous \nindividuals would be allowed to simply walk free without any assessment \nof the risk to public safety if this reauthorization does not pass the \nSenate immediately.\n  Failure to reauthorize the commission would have particularly harsh \nconsequences for the District of Columbia. The commission currently \nsets the conditions of supervision for DC offenders and determines when \nthose conditions have been violated. If the commission were to cease \noperations, around 9,000 offenders would no longer receive adequate \nsupervision. These include extremely dangerous criminals, such as \nmurderers and rapists.\n  Congress has consistently recognized the importance of the \ncommission, reauthorizing it on 6 prior occasions. We last reauthorized \nthe commission 2 years ago. At that time, the Republican-led House of \nRepresentatives unanimously passed a bill to extend the commission for \n3 years, but a single Senator blocked the bill and insisted on only a \n2-year extension.\n  So we are here now, 2 years later, and the House has appropriately \npassed a bipartisan 5-year extension. I have been working with the \nHouse since July on this straightforward reauthorization. As the House \nrecognizes, the need for the commission will not cease within the next \n5 years. In fact, it is estimated that Federal ``old-law'' offenders \nwill require parole decisions for the next 35 years.\n  I hope we can agree to this 5-year extension, which includes \nextensive annual reporting requirements that will allow Congress to \nconduct oversight of the commission. All of the reporting requirements \nfrom the last reauthorization are included, along with new requirements \nrelated specifically to the District of Columbia. There is nothing \nobjectionable in this bill, and there is no substantive reason for \nanyone to block it.\n  The events of the past few weeks have shown deep divisions in the \nHouse Republican caucus. But one thing on which all 232 House \nRepublicans agree is that the Parole Commission should be reauthorized \nfor another 5 years. They all agreed that releasing potentially \ndangerous prisoners was a bad idea. This bill is not controversial.\n  As I have mentioned before, Senator Paul and I and others are working \nin a bipartisan manner on sentencing reform. We believe that judges \nshould have more discretion in sentencing when a mandatory minimum \nsentence is unnecessary and counterproductive. The extension of the \nParole Commission is quite a different matter, however. If the \ncommission is not reauthorized, there will be no one to decide whether \nthousands of offenders are ready for parole. These inmates will simply \nbe released.\n  I want to commend the sponsor of the House bill, Congressman Steve \nChabot, along with co-sponsors Chairman Bob Goodlatte and Ranking \nMember John Conyers of the House Judiciary Committee, and Chairman Jim \nSensenbrenner and Ranking Member Bobby Scott of the Subcommittee on \nCrime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations. They understood \nthe urgency and imminent consequences of inaction. Unfortunately, some \nin the Senate did not share that position and now we are up against the \nfinal deadline.
