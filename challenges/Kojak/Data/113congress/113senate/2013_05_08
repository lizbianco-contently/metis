Mr. President, for years Republicans have been singing the \npraises of regular order, week after week, month after month. It has \ngone into years now. Even though they may not have been correct, they \ndid it anyway. They said how they missed the days of committee markups, \nhow they longed for an amendment vote-arama, amendments, and how they \npined for a budget resolution.\n  As the junior Senator from Texas said just before the election:\n\n       Senate Democrats have not even had a budget in 3 years. \n     They are not pretending to try to fix these problems. I think \n     that is irresponsible.\n\n  But then Republicans got what they wanted 46 days ago. Forty-six days \nit has been since the Senate passed its budget, but Republicans are \nstanding in the way of moving forward in the conference. They got what \nthey asked, and now they no longer want what they asked for.\n  Remember, 46 days ago, under regular order, after a thorough \ncommittee markup, an all-night session--we ended at 5 a.m. in the \nmorning--the Senate passed a budget resolution. Over the last 46 days, \nRepublicans have stunningly and repeatedly blocked attempts to name \nbudget conferees. If we did that, we could start down the path to \ncompromise.\n  That is what legislation is all about. Legislation, by definition, is \nthe art of compromise.\n  It is Republicans who, as Senator Cruz put it, aren't even intending \nto fix these problems.\n  Republicans often have said the regular order of the budget process \nis the only way to get long-term sound fiscal policy. Democrats and \nRepublicans will not find common ground if they don't sit down and \ntalk. Obviously, if we can't talk, it doesn't do any good. We need \nsomeone to talk to. Here is what we are trying to accomplish. Move \nlegislation forward.\n  Don't take my word for it. This is what the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives said just a few weeks ago:\n\n       Here is the process. The House passes a bill. The Senate \n     can pass a bill. And if we disagree, we go to conference and \n     work it out.\n\n  What Speaker Boehner and Senator Cruz have said is that they used to \nlove the idea of regular order, but they don't like it anymore. They \ngot what they wanted, but they don't like what they got.\n\n[[Page S3216]]\n\n  This is what my friend, the minority leader, said in January of this \nyear in praise of the conference committee:\n\n       If the Senate version is different than the one the House \n     sends over, send it off to conference. That's how things are \n     supposed to work around here. We used to call it legislating.\n\n  That is what the Republican leader said.\n  A few days later, Senator McConnell extolled the virtue of regular \norder by saying this:\n\n       Remember, regular order is how the Senate is supposed to \n     function. . . . The public is supposed to have a chance to \n     scrutinize the proposals before us.\n\n  Here we have the junior Senator from Texas, the Speaker of the House, \nand the Republican leader saying we should have regular order. We \nshould pass legislation, as we have done and the House has done, and \nthen work it out in conference.\n  So we agree. I agree with those three people. Do you know something \nelse. The American public agrees.\n  They suddenly don't like what they wished for. We passed our budget; \nthe House Republicans passed theirs. The next step under regular order \nis to move to conference to negotiate a compromise.\n  I can't understand--maybe I do. I think I understand why Republicans \ndon't want to debate their budget in the light of day.\n  You see, the Ryan budget, which they extol to each other, which \npassed the House, would turn Medicare into a voucher program--the end \nof Medicare as we know it.\n  The Ryan Republican budget would lower taxes for the rich while the \nmiddle class foots the bill. That is in their budget.\n  The Republican budget would rip the safety net from under the \nelderly, the middle class, veterans, and the poor. No wonder they don't \nwant to go to conference. No wonder they don't want transparency.\n  The Democratic budget, by contrast, would preserve or protect \nMedicare for our children and grandchildren. The Democratic budget \nwould ask the wealthiest Americans to contribute just a little bit more \nto help reduce the deficit. The Democratic budget would balance smart \nspending cuts with new revenue from closing loopholes.\n  It is obvious, then, why the Republicans don't want to compare the \nsensible Senate budget with the extreme House budget. The extreme House \nRepublican budget was resoundingly rejected by the voters in November. \nThat is what Governor Romney touted. Remember, Congressman Ryan was his \nVice Presidential candidate. They ran together.\n  Now it is time for each side to stand for what it believes. As the \njunior Senator from Texas said late last year, we have ``got to go on \nrecord and say this is what we want to do, this is our budget.''\n  Democrats aren't afraid to debate our principles in the light of day. \nWe aren't afraid to try to resolve our differences in a conference \ncommittee instead of behind closed doors. This has been the custom in \nthe Senate and House of Representatives for more than 200 years.\n  Why are Republicans so afraid? Why are they blocking us from \ncontinuing this process in public?\n  We heard from the junior Senator from Texas: Republicans will only go \nto conference if Democrats agree ahead of time to give in to every one \nof their demands. That is a strange one. Sure, we will go to \nconference, but before we go you have to agree to everything we want.\n  If Republicans can't rig the game in their favor, he said, there will \nbe no game, no conference, no legislating at all. Democrats want to put \ndeadline-day negotiations and last-minute fixes behind us. We want to \nengage in a responsible legislative process under regular order, and we \nwill keep pushing the process forward. Passing a budget in each Chamber \nis a good step to restoring regular order. It is only a first step. The \nnext step is to sit down and resolve our differences.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/08/senate-section/article/S3216-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID.

She didn't recoil \nin fear. She threw herself right back into the rough and tumble of \npublic life. So she is tough. I know this tenacious leader is committed \nto the United States-South Korea alliance which is so important to both \nof our countries. The transition from her predecessor, President Lee, \ncould not have been smoother. Both his administration and hers have \nbeen true partners, especially at a time of high contention.\n  We welcome President Park and look forward to hearing what she has to \nsay later today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/08/senate-section/article/S3216-4", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3216-S3217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF THOMAS PEREZ\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this morning I would like to say a few \nwords about the nomination of Thomas Perez as Labor Secretary.\n  The Perez nomination has generated a fair amount of controversy. For \nthose who haven't tuned in yet to the debate surrounding his \nnomination, I would like to take a few minutes this morning to explain \nwhy.\n  The first thing to say about this nomination is that neither I nor \nanyone else on this side of the aisle has anything against Mr. Perez \npersonally. As a graduate of Harvard Law School, there are a lot of \nthings he could have done other than advocate for those struggling on \nthe fringes of our society.\n  Yet when it comes to a vote such as this, we have to weigh a lot more \nthan a nominee's intentions. We have to look at how those intentions \nsquare with the higher obligation that any nominee, but especially a \nCabinet nominee, has to the rule of law. It is on this point where this \nnomination becomes so controversial and where the deference that \nSenators of both parties generally grant Presidents when it comes to \npicking Cabinet nominees begins to break down.\n  By all accounts, Tom Perez is not just a man with a heart for the \npoor, he is a committed ideologue who appears willing, quite frankly, \nto say or do anything to achieve his ideological end.\n  His willingness, time and again, to bend or ignore the law and \nmisstate the facts in order to advance his far-left ideology leads me \nand others to conclude he would continue to do so if he were confirmed \nto another and much more consequential position of public trust.\n  Take, for instance, his efforts while on the Montgomery County \nCouncil to get Canadian drugs imported to the United States. According \nto the Washington Post, Perez tried to get the county to import these \ndrugs even after--even after--a top FDA official said doing so would \nbe, in his words, ``undeniably illegal.''\n  What was Perez's response? ``Federal law is muddled,'' he said at the \ntime. ``Sometimes you have to push the envelope.''\n  Think about that statement. ``Sometimes you have to push the \nenvelope.'' Is that the kind of approach to Federal law we want in \nthose we confirm to run Federal agencies? Folks who think if a Federal \nlaw is inconvenient to their ends they can simply characterize it as\n\n[[Page S3217]]\n\nunclear and use that as an excuse to do whatever they want?\n  If that is not a red flag for those of us who have to review a \nPresidential nominee, I don't know what is.\n  Now, again, someone might say everybody in politics has to make \njudgments about how a given law is to be interpreted. Those who \ndisagree with those judgments call it pushing the envelope. Mr. Perez, \nhowever, does not merely push the envelope. All too often he \ncircumvents or ignores a law with which he disagrees.\n  Here are a few examples: As a member of the Montgomery County \nCouncil, Mr. Perez pushed through a county policy that encouraged the \ncircumvention of Federal immigration law. Later, as head of the Federal \nGovernment's top voting rights watchdog, he refused to protect the \nright to vote for Americans of all races, in violation of the very law \nhe was charged to enforce.\n  In the same post at the Department of Justice, Perez directed the \nFederal Government to sue, against the advice of career attorneys in \nhis own office. In another case involving a Florida woman who was \nlawfully exercising her First Amendment right to protest in front of an \nabortion clinic, the Federal judge who threw out Mr. Perez's lawsuit \nsaid he was ``at a loss as to why the government chose to prosecute \nthis particular case'' in the first place.\n  This is what pushing the envelope means in the case of Mr. Perez--a \nflippant and dismissive attitude about the boundaries everyone else has \nto follow for the sake of the liberal causes in which he believes. In \nshort, it means a lack of respect for the rule of law and a lack of \nrespect for the need of those in positions of power to follow it.\n  Just as troubling, however, is the fact that Mr. Perez has been \ncalled to account for his failures to follow the law, and he has been \nless than forthright about his actions when called to account. When he \ntestified that politics played no role in his office's decision not to \npursue charges against members of a far-left group who may have tried \nto prevent others from voting, for instance, the Department's own \nwatchdog said ``Perez's testimony did not reflect the entire story.'' \nAnd a Federal judge said the evidence before him ``appear[ed] to \ncontradict . . . Perez's testimony.''\n  Perez has also made misleading statements about this case under \noath--under oath--to Congress and the U.S. Civil Rights Commission.\n  Mr. Perez's involvement in an alleged quid pro quo deal with the city \nof St. Paul, MN, also fits the pattern. Here was a case where Perez was \nallegedly so concerned about a potential Supreme Court challenge to the \nlegality of a theory he championed in housing discrimination suits \nknown as ``disparate impact,'' he quietly worked out a deal with St. \nPaul officials whereby they would withdraw their appeal to the Supreme \nCourt of a disparate impact case if he arranged for the Federal \nGovernment to throw out two whistleblower complaints against St. Paul \nthat could have recovered millions of dollars for the taxpayers that \nhad been falsely obtained. The two whistleblowers' complaints were \ndropped, and the Supreme Court never heard the disparate impact case.\n  Perez told investigators he hadn't even heard of the disparate impact \ncase until the Court initially decided to hear it. But that has been \ncontradicted by HUD Deputy Assistant Secretary Sara Pratt, who told \ninvestigators she and Mr. Perez discussed the case well before that.\n  Taken together, all of this paints the picture, for me at least, not \nof a passionate liberal who sees himself as patiently operating within \nthe system and through the democratic process to advance a particular \nset of strongly held beliefs but a crusading ideologue whose conviction \nabout his own rightness on the issues leads him to believe the law does \nnot apply to him. Unbound by the rules that apply to everyone else, \nPerez seems to view himself as free to employ whatever means--whatever \nmeans--at his disposal, legal or otherwise, to achieve his ideological \ngoals.\n  To say this is problematic would be an understatement. As Secretary \nof Labor, Perez could be handling numerous contentious issues and \nimplementing many politically sensitive laws, including laws enforcing \nthe disclosure of political activity by labor unions. Perez's devotion \nto the cause of involuntary universal voter registration is also deeply \nconcerning to me personally, and I would imagine many of my colleagues \nin the Senate also believe in the absolute centrality of maintaining \nthe integrity of the vote.\n  Americans of all political persuasions have the right to expect the \nhead of such a sensitive department, whether appointed by a Republican \nor Democrat, will implement and follow the law in a fair and reasonable \nway. I do not believe they could expect as much from Mr. Perez.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/08/senate-section/article/S3217-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 601, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 601) to provide for the conservation and \n     development of water and related resources, to authorize the \n     Secretary of the Army to construct various projects for \n     improvements to rivers and harbors of the United States, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Boxer/Vitter amendment No. 799, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 2 \np.m. will be equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, what is the order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in a period of debate prior to \nvotes in relationship to S. 601.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, how much time is going to be controlled \nby Senator Coburn, the opposition to his amendments, and Senator \nWhitehouse?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma controls 40 minutes. \nThe majority controls 75 minutes.\n\n[[Page S3218]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. How much time is there as far as Senator Whitehouse is \nconcerned?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no specific time agreement for \nSenator Whitehouse.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much. I wanted to get the order squared \naway so I could share the information with colleagues before Senator \nCoburn is heard on his amendments.\n  Madam President, we are on the Water Resources Development Act--it is \na great day for the Senate--because we have received a D-plus rating on \nour infrastructure. This is the greatest Nation in the world. If we \ncannot move people or products, if our ports need to be deepened--and \nbecause they are not deepened, we cannot move commerce in and out--we \nhave problems.\n  As we move into periods of extreme weather--there is some debate as \nto why, and I will not get into that because it is almost like a \nreligious debate, so I will not go there. The fact is we have extreme \nweather, and now that we have some rules in place, this bill will make \nit a lot easier for people in the State of the Presiding Officer to \ndeal with the corps after an extreme weather event. For the first time \nthey will not have to come back for new authorizations. They can do \nsome moves right then and there to improve the situation, and that is a \nreform I think is very necessary.\n  I certainly thank Senator Vitter, my ranking member, and every member \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee. I want to thank all the \norganizations that have come to support this legislation. We have them \nlisted, and I am just going to read a few of those.\n  Madam President, may I speak for approximately 5 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We have the American Association of Port Authorities, the \nAmerican Concrete Pressure Pipe Association, the American Council of \nEngineering Companies, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the \nAmerican Foundry Society, the American Public Works Association, the \nAmerican Road and Transportation Builders Association, American Society \nof Civil Engineers, American Soybean Association, Associated General \nContractors of America, Association of Equipment Manufacturers, Clean \nWater Construction Coalition, Concrete Reinforcing Steel Institute, \nConstruction Management Association of America, International Liquid \nTerminals Association, International Propeller Club of the United \nStates, and the International Union of Operating Engineers.\n  I will not read all of these as there are too many.\n  We received a letter today from the chamber of commerce, which I will \ntalk about in a few minutes.\n  We also have listed the Laborers International Union of North \nAmerica, surveyors, real estate people, Grain and Feed Association, the \nRetail Federation, the National Waterways Conference, National Stone \nSand & Gravel Association, Portland Cement Association, the American \nInstitute of Architects, the Fertilizer Institute, the United \nBrotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, the Waterways \nCouncil.\n  This is just a sample. America is behind this bill. This is \nimportant. Everything we do here is important, and this is as \nimportant. It will, in fact, support over half a million jobs--not \ndoing things we don't need but doing things we need and must do.\n  We have some very important letters. One letter is from the American \nAssociation of Port Authorities and the American Road and \nTransportation Builders Association. They talk about how it is \nimportant that this legislative progress should not be slowed or \njeopardized by amendments that are not germane to the bill.\n  This is their language: If enacted, this long overdue legislation \nwill ensure critical investments are being made.\n  They say nice things about Senator Vitter and me, which I will not \nread because it is too self-serving, but I am very proud to have it in \nwriting. I will put it on my wall when I get back to the office.\n  There is another letter from the Transportation Construction \nCoalition, and it basically says: This bill will remove barriers to \nrealizing the benefits of water resources projects. It needs to be \nbipartisan and bicameral. Let's swiftly pass this.\n  That is a very important message for us.\n  We have the Associated General Contractors of America, and they say: \nPlease don't slow or jeopardize this bill.\n  We have a letter coming from the chamber of commerce, and it is going \nto say the same thing.\n  I know Senator Coburn feels very strongly about his amendments, and \nwe have agreed to take them up and vote on them. Every Senator has the \nright to do anything they want. I just want to lay it out here for the \nAmerican people: This is a public works bill dealing with water \ninfrastructure. It is not a bill about guns, it is not a bill about a \nwoman's right to choose, it is not a bill about gay rights or gay \nmarriage, it is not a bill about those very hot button issues we know \ndivide the American people.\n  I will have more to say after Senator Coburn talks about his \namendment. I am just going to make a plea to my colleagues: We are \ntrying so hard to accommodate everybody but, speaking for myself, I \nhope we can avert and avoid controversy on this bill. We have so much \ncontroversy every minute of every day. There have been terrible \narguments on this floor about issues as to whether we should extend the \ndebt ceiling, whether to default, do background checks. These issues \nare tough. I am not saying they should be avoided. We have to confront \nthem. Every once in a while I hope we can take a pause from this \ncontroversy and do something for this country and come together without \nthe rancor, without the upset, and without the divisiveness of some of \nthese issues.\n  We will proceed to deal with these issues that Senator Coburn has \nbrought forth on guns. After we dispose of these, I hope we will not \nhave this kind of divisiveness on a bill that is so needed.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, first of all, I thank my colleagues for \nthe opportunity to have regular order in the Senate. The ranking member \nof the committee would like to have 2 minutes before I start.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, through the Chair, I thank the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma. I briefly want to say two things: No. 1, I too am very \nsupportive of this bill, which I do think is a strong bipartisan and a \nreform-oriented effort. I think the best proof of that is that it came \nout of our EPW committee 18 to 0. We have a committee that reflects the \nwide spectrum of opinion of the entire Senate. The waterway \ninfrastructure bill is important, so I am very supportive of it.\n  No. 2, I am also very glad we have this open amendment process. I \nthink it reflects a lot of work and goodwill on a lot of folks' part, \nincluding the Chair and myself. I welcome this debate and vote. We want \nto take up and vote on amendments.\n  With that show of good faith, I hope Members can focus on germane--or \nat least relevant--amendments, and that is what we will be turning to \nin our next set of amendments.\n  I hope this open process and show of good faith engenders that \nresponse. I look forward to all of these amendments and debates and \nvotes.\n  With that, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for the time.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 805 to Amendment No. 799\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The chairman--Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. The only thing I am chairman of, Madam President, is my \ndogs at home, but I thank the Presiding Officer for that misquote.\n  At this time, I call up Coburn amendment No. 805.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment No. 805 to amendment numbered 799.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S3219]]\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To protect the right of individuals to bear arms at water \n  resources development projects administered by the Secretary of the \n                                 Army)\n\n       At the end of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 20__. PROTECTING AMERICANS FROM VIOLENT CRIME.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Second Amendment of the Constitution provides that \n     ``the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be \n     infringed'';\n       (2) section 327.13 of title 36, Code of Federal Regulations \n     provides that, except in special circumstances, ``possession \n     of loaded firearms, ammunition, loaded projectile firing \n     devices, bows and arrows, crossbows, or other weapons is \n     prohibited'' at water resources development projects \n     administered by the Secretary;\n       (3) the regulations described in paragraph (2) prevent \n     individuals complying with Federal and State laws from \n     exercising the Second Amendment rights of the individuals \n     while at the water resources development projects; and\n       (4) Federal laws should make it clear that the Second \n     Amendment rights of an individual at a water resources \n     development project should not be infringed.\n       (b) Protecting the Right of Individuals To Bear Arms at \n     Water Resources Development Projects.--The Secretary shall \n     not promulgate or enforce any regulation that prohibits an \n     individual from possessing a firearm, including an assembled \n     or functional firearm, at a water resources development \n     project covered under part 327 of title 36, Code of Federal \n     Regulations (as in effect on the date of enactment of this \n     Act), if--\n       (1) the individual is not otherwise prohibited by law from \n     possessing the firearm; and\n       (2) the possession of the firearm is in compliance with the \n     law of the State in which the water resources development \n     project is located.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. A couple of years ago I added an amendment in our \ndeliberative process that gave Americans their constitutional rights in \nthe U.S. National Forest. There were two main reasons I did that.\n  No. 1, the amount of murders, rapes, robberies, and assaults were \nrising; and No. 2, there is some confusion with the conceal and carry \nState laws.\n  We have 35 or 36 States that have conceal and carry State laws, but \nwhen someone accidentally walks onto U.S. forest land, they are \nactually violating Federal law even though they might not know they are \non State land versus Federal land.\n  I would note that since that time the amount of crime in our national \nparks has declined. So since then, we now have, throughout the country, \nthe same approach we have in national parks on the Bureau of Land \nManagement areas, the Forest Service, the National Park Service, and \nthe National Wildlife Refuge.\n  The reason this is important for the Corps of Engineers is because \nafter we passed those amendments, the corps proactively stated that \nnone of this applied to them. Well, the fact is the corps has more \nvisitors every year on their 422 lake and river projects, 11.7 million \nacres, 95,000 camp sites, and 6,500 miles of trails, and they have more \nthan 370 million visitors. Corps projects are the most visited of any \nsingle Federal agency sites--even more than the 280 million annual \nvisitors to our national parks.\n  Americans who camp, hunt, or fish on these federally managed lands \nare prevented from exercising their Second Amendment rights that have \nbeen guaranteed by the Supreme Court, but also are under the \njurisdiction of their State laws.\n  The purpose of this amendment is so law-abiding citizens who are \ngranted the authority in their State will not be vulnerable to \ncriminals or dangerous wildlife while on Army Corps land, and we, in \nfact, will ensure they have their rights guaranteed. This does not \ninclude an exemption for Federal facilities, Army Corps headquarters, \nresearch facilities, lock or dam buildings, or any other significant \ninfrastructure associated with the corps. This amendment would simply \nrequire the Corps of Engineers to follow State firearm possession laws \non lands and waters managed by them--the same approach the Bureau of \nLand Management, the Forest Service, the National Parks, and the \nNational Wildlife Refuges use.\n  It is a simple issue. This is the only area of Federal lands now \nwhere we put people in double jeopardy if they are accidentally on \ncorps land; they are violating Federal law even though they are \ncomplying with their State laws. They are totally in compliance with \nthe State laws, but if they step one foot onto corps land, they are \nviolating corps regulations. This amendment makes it consistent across \nall government lands--we have already done it everywhere else--the \ncorps land, which is the most visited, the most utilized lands we have \nin the country. It is straightforward.\n  I am very appreciative of the chairman of this committee for her \ncooperation in allowing this amendment. As a matter of fact, I am so \ncooperative I am not going to offer the other one so I can help move \nher bill forward. I congratulate her on the bipartisan work she has \ndone on her committee.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I think this is a principled stand. The question is, Why \nshould we not have the same policy everywhere, No. 1; and No. 2, Why \nwould we dare deny the rights we give everywhere else on Federal \nGovernment-owned land--why would we do something different on corps \nland?\n  I actually wouldn't even be offering this had the corps not \nproactively stated that what we passed did not apply to them. We \nactually intended for it to apply and, technically, they could get out. \nAll we are saying is let's make it the same everywhere, so you can \nfollow State law, be a good, law-abiding citizen; but if a person \nhappens to walk onto corps land, they are violating a Federal statute \naccording to the corps. Not on BLM lands, not on Forest Service lands, \nnot in the Parks, but if a person walks up to a lake in Oklahoma that \nis run by the corps, they are violating Federal law but they are not \nviolating State law. So we ought to have consistency with our law. This \nis about consistency, good government, and common sense. Wouldn't it be \na tragedy--and it happens all the time--that a person is on a campsite \nin Oklahoma and because there is no law allowing that person to carry \ntheir weapon onto that campsite, they are vulnerable to the prey of \npeople who are going to violate that law. That is exactly what was \nhappening in the national parks. We were having women raped, we were \nhaving people murdered, we were having people accosted and robbed. \nGuess what. That has all markedly declined since we allowed gun owners \nto carry their guns. There has not been, to my knowledge, one case of \nan inappropriate use by a law-abiding citizen of their weapons in those \nareas. So it is common sense.\n  My hope is we will pass this amendment and have a consistent law on \nall Federal lands so people can be protected under the Second \nAmendment, people can follow their State's law and do it adequately and \naccurately and be great law-abiding citizens.\n  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I wish to thank my friend from Oklahoma \nbecause it was tough for me on this bill to face the first amendment \nbeing a gun amendment. The Senator from Oklahoma has very strong \nemotions about it. So do I. We just come down on different sides. But I \nbelieve we want to show our good faith. I am also pleased we are not \ngoing to vote on the study amendment because, as I researched it, it \nlooks as if there is already a study underway and I look forward to \nlooking at the results of that study with the Senator from Oklahoma in \nterms of the buying of ammunition. I thank the Senator for that. It \nmeans a lot.\n  I ask the Chair, since Senator Coburn is now not going to take up one \nof his amendments and we only have one more, what is the status of \ntime? How does that change things?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority controls 65 minutes, the \nRepublicans control 64 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. Madam President, I am going to answer \na question that was posed rhetorically by my friend, which is a fair \nquestion. Why make a difference as far as who can carry a gun on \nFederal land versus national park land? My statement will address this \ndirectly to my friend.\n  Coburn amendment No. 805 would make it legal for anyone to carry \nweapons on critical water infrastructure property managed by the Army \nCorps of Engineers. My view of this is it is a dangerous amendment. He \nand I just see it very differently.\n\n[[Page S3220]]\n\n  I believe this amendment would put our national security at risk by \nmaking the Nation's dams, reservoirs, hydroelectric powerhouses, \nnavigation locks, major river systems, levees, and other flood risk \nmanagement features vulnerable to attacks.\n  Current law on Army Corps property is this: Army regulations prohibit \nthe private possession of loaded firearms, ammunition, loaded \nprojectile firing devices, and other weapons on Army Corps property \nunless--and this is important--unless the weapon is being used for \nhunting, fishing, or target shooting in designated areas. So let's \nestablish that, yes, people can bring a gun onto corps property, but it \nneeds to be for hunting, fishing, or target shooting.\n  I don't know what other usage there would be. I guess one could argue \nthat a person wants to defend themselves, but they could argue that \nanywhere. So I don't know what more my friend wants. We have hunting, \nfishing, and target shooting in designated areas so we don't have these \nweapons near this critical infrastructure.\n\n  Similar to the regulations that govern private gun possession on \nmilitary bases, corps regulations require guns to be unloaded when \ntransported to and from these designated hunting, fishing, and target-\nshooting areas. In addition, under current law, the regulations allow \nfor permission to be given to private individuals by the district \ncommander of the corps. So if somebody has a need to do this, they can \nget permission to do it. As I look at the current rules, I see it very \ndifferently. I see the Army Corps cooperating, making sure people can \ntake their weapons onto corps land, but making sure the uses are the \nrecreational uses. If they have a special problem or a special issue, \nthey can get permission to carry a gun for other circumstances.\n  So the law already allows for the transport of guns on and off Army \nCorps property when used appropriately for hunting or sport. I guess we \nwould have to say why would we have an amendment here that I believe \nwill put our critical water infrastructure installations and millions \nof Americans who visit corps land at risk? I think it is a public \nsafety issue.\n  Why do I oppose this Coburn amendment and why do I say it is \ndangerous? First of all, Army Corps rangers are not trained or equipped \nto be law enforcement officers. That is quite different from the \nnational park lands. Second, Army Corps facilities are infrastructure \nthat is critical to national security, the economy, and the safety of \nthe American people. Third, the amendment ignores significant increases \nin the budget deficit, and I know my friend is, if not the biggest \ndeficit hawk, certainly one of the biggest deficit hawks in history--\never since I have been here, which is a long time. So we have costs--\nnotifying the public of the change in law and somehow hiring security \nguards to protect dams and reservoirs and other critical \ninfrastructure.\n  I have sat in on numerous discussions, both classified and \nunclassified, that talk about the need to protect the critical \ninfrastructure of this world in which we live. In this world we live \nin, we may well see more homegrown terrorists who know our land and who \nknow where these dams are, and who know where these reservoirs are, and \nwho know where these locks are.\n  The Army Corps rangers are not trained or equipped to be law \nenforcement officers. They have no authority to carry firearms, to make \narrests, or execute search warrants. Corps rangers are tasked with \nresource management and recreation maintenance. They are not law \nenforcement officers.\n  The Coburn amendment would allow individuals to carry loaded or \nconcealed weapons on all corps land as long as the individual's \npossession is in compliance with the State law where the property is \nlocated. By the way, I appreciate the fact the Coburn amendment does \nthat, because some others have offered amendments where if a person is \nin a State that allows conceal and carry, they can go to any State. The \nCoburn amendment doesn't do that. I appreciate that very much.\n  Now in the 49 States that allow concealed carrying of loaded weapons, \nthe corps would not be able to prevent visitors from carrying concealed \nloaded weapons on corps campsites and hiking trails. Yet the corps has \nno employees who perform law enforcement duties. I have said this now \nthree times. It is a very important point. We are putting our corps \npeople in a situation where they are unarmed and people coming on the \nproperty are armed. So if someone carries a weapon onto corps land--and \nI agree with my friend that 99-something percent of the people are \nwonderful and would never think of committing any type of felony, but \nwe know violent crime happens every day. Good Lord, all one has to do \nis read the paper. We know there are--how many deaths every day from \nguns? There are 87 deaths a day from guns. A lot of that is suicide and \na lot of that is violence toward another person. So let me tell my \ncolleagues what the corps can do in the case where there is a felony on \nthe land there--someone doing something violent. They could write a \nticket or call for backup. Since they have no weapons and no authority \nto arrest suspects, it is a dangerous situation. If this were to pass, \nwe would have to spend a whole lot of dough making sure we train the \ncorps personnel or allow them to hire law enforcement. We are talking \nabout a lot of funds we don't have.\n  I don't know what the problem is. Honestly, maybe my friend has heard \nfrom colleagues or friends or people who are upset about this. But the \nfact is people can have weapons on corps land for all kinds of reasons \npertaining to recreation, which is the point. Yes, one has to get them \nto the site not loaded and so on, and there are rules and regulations, \nbut I don't think that is a problem. Some of the hunters I know are \nextremely proud of the safety record they have had and what they teach \ntheir kids.\n  Now let's talk about the facilities that I think are being put at \nrisk--facilities important to our national security, to our economy, \nand to our public safety. The Department of Homeland Security under \nPresident Bush took action in 2003 to list--and I am quoting--this \nsounds funny--``dam''--D-A-M--``assets.'' Those include navigation \nlocks, levees, and water retention facilities, as a sector that is \ncritical to the function of the economy, to the government, to our \nsociety, to the well-being of our people. The inspector general notes \nthat these assets are especially important because one catastrophic \nfailure at some locations could affect populations exceeding 100,000 \npeople and have economic consequences surpassing $10 billion. So we are \ntalking about changing the law on corps land that would expand the \nright to carry a gun, which people now have on corps land as long as it \nis for recreation purposes--expanding it in a way that could threaten \ncritical infrastructure. This is in a situation where there are no \narmed guards. One catastrophic failure could affect 100,000 people and \ncould have economic consequences surpassing $10 billion.\n\n  This is a report from the Bush administration, folks.\n  A 2011 DHS Inspector General report indicated there were numerous \nsecurity gaps already at critical dam assets across the Nation. So I do \nnot know why we would allow anyone to bring firearms to those critical \ninfrastructure facilities. They can use them for hunting and fishing, \nbut we should have some rules that protect this infrastructure.\n  Just notifying the public of the change in law that my friend wants \nto see happen will cost an enormous amount of money--millions of \ndollars. The Coburn amendment does not address the costs, and normally \nhe would do that in an amendment: address the costs the corps would \nincur in order to train their workers to carry weapons or to hire \noutside security for that.\n  I appreciate and respect the views of my friend, but I also think \nthis is something we should not do today on this bill now, especially \nwhen we are seeing a lot of talk about more homegrown terrorism. We \nwant to protect our infrastructure. It may be that the corps ought to \nlook at more protection for these facilities. I am willing to look at \nthat. But I do think we are making a problem where there is not a \nproblem. People can go on corps land and use their guns for hunting and \nfishing, recreation and target shooting, and I think that is working \nout fine. This seems to be an amendment that is solving a problem that, \nfrankly, does not exist.\n  I have 38 million people in my State. That is a lot of people. I \nasked: Do we\n\n[[Page S3221]]\n\nhave a lot of letters on this? I, at this point, do not know of any. \nBut I may have some now that the Senator has brought this up. We \nprobably have it on both sides now. But I hate to see us do this \nbecause I think it is going to put critical water infrastructure at \nrisk.\n  This is not the national parks. These are not facilities where we \nhave armed guards. If something were to happen to a reservoir, to a \ndam, the Bush administration tells us it could be quite devastating to \ncommunities.\n  So I hope we will oppose this amendment. Again, it is with respect \nthat I say these things. I say them because I truly do think this is \nmisguided. I hope we can get on with the underlying bill.\n  I thank my colleague and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, first of all, our amendment exempts the \nareas the chairman talked about--locks and dams. All those areas are \nexempt from this amendment. As ranking member on Homeland Security, I \nknow more about these issues than probably anybody other than our \nchairman and the past chairman and ranking member in terms of the \nsafety.\n  The people the chairman talks about do not care what the law is now. \nThey do not care what the law is. So the people about whom we are going \nto be worried--Boston has pretty tight laws. They did not care what the \nlaws were. They broke multiple sets of laws, as we saw what happened in \nBoston. We have to prepare for that regardless of whether this \namendment goes through.\n  I would also note, in several of our national parks we have corps \nland where we have hydroelectric facilities and we have these things. \nWe have not had any problem with that. What we have had is a marked \ndecline in the number of rapes and a marked decline in the number of \nmurders in national parks since we instituted the State laws in \nnational parks for guns.\n  On campgrounds we do have problems with rapes, with accosts, with \nassaults, with robberies; and we do have murders on corps land and \ncampgrounds. So the point is, standardizing where you can go--I would \nalso make the point, we only allow State law to apply. If Oklahoma law \nis different than California law, it is not Oklahoma law, it is \nwhatever California law is and recognizing that individual right so we \ndo not put people in jeopardy when they accidentally get on corps land.\n  I understand her inhibition toward it, toward any expression of the \nSecond Amendment generally. But the fact is we ought to have a common \npolicy in all areas. We already do it in Bureau of Land Management, we \nalready do it in the Forest Service, we already do it in national \nparks. So we should not exempt the corps.\n  The fact is, the people who are going to violate our laws are not the \nlaw-abiding citizens. They are not the law-abiding citizens. It does \nnot matter what we do; they are not going to pay attention to what we \ndo. The one thing we have proven in the National Parks is, when we \nallowed people the ability to carry and follow their own State's law in \nterms of their Second Amendment, we saw rapes go down, we saw murders \ngo down, we saw assaults go down, and we saw robberies go down in the \nnational parks.\n  The same thing will happen on corps land. Most of the people will not \ncarry. Most of the people will not come in. But to deny the ability to \ndo that, that is what this amendment is about.\n  I will be happy to debate the Senator further. The fact is, there is \na big difference in our view of what the Second Amendment should be \nabout in this country and our trusting of law-abiding citizens to do \nthe right things. Her issue on critical infrastructure--we are doing \neverything we can do to protect that now and building toward the \nultimate goals of where we need to be, and this is not going to change \nour approach. It is not going to change it at all. So I would dispute \nthe fact that it is going to change our approach.\n  As we look at critical infrastructure and the protection of it, we \nare going to do the same whether or not this amendment passes. It is \nnot going to have any impact on it.\n  My hope would be that since I actually have withdrawn the other \namendment we would yield back the time and move to Senator Whitehouse's \namendment as soon as we can.\n  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I wish to ask my friend to show me where \nhe excludes the areas that have the critical infrastructure because we \nhave a report from CRS that says they are not excluded. The dams are \nnot excluded.\n  Mr. COBURN. I will be happy to get it for the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. No problem.\n  Madam President, I think the point is, the Senator tries to say what \nI think about the right to bear arms. He does not know my views. It is \nvery clear the Supreme Court has stated the Second Amendment--that \nthere is a right to bear arms. But just as any other right--free \nspeech, freedom of the press--rights are not unrestricted. We all know \nthe story: You have free speech, but you cannot go into a theater and \nyell ``fire, fire'' unless there is a fire because you could be charged \nfor causing a riot. So there is no absolute right.\n  The corps has stated on their land you can already bring a gun as \nlong as it is about hunting, it is about fishing, it is about \nrecreation. But they say, if it is near their critical infrastructure--\nwhich the Bush administration says is a homeland security necessity to \nprotect--you cannot carry a loaded weapon.\n  My friend says he excluded these areas. I am telling you--you can \nread this--there is no exclusion. And if you read the CRS----\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will in 1 second. I want to read what CRS says:\n\n       Proposed legislation does not explicitly provide the Corps \n     with authority to restrict firearms at Corps facilities \n     (e.g., dams) or in specifically designated areas.\n\n  I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. COBURN. I will get the Senator the actual statute.\n  Federal structures are covered under another statute and I will get \nthat statute for it. The reason we did not specifically represent that \nis because they are already covered. We did not exclude those \nstructures. We said: Corps land. We did not specifically say that, and \nwe will get you the code where Federal structures are excluded.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, if I could say to my friend, through the Chair, \nfine, get me the code. But the Senator said his amendment specifically \nexcluded it, and it does not. I am researching now that part, but there \nis no question there is no explicit prohibition here.\n  So now you get into a circumstance where you have one Federal law \nthat says one thing, another Federal law that says something else, and \nwe know where that leads, folks. That leads to court.\n  I think my friend wanted to exclude being able to carry weapons near \nlevees and dams and so on. He ought to like the status quo because that \nis the status quo. The status quo is, if you want to use a gun for \nhunting, fishing, recreation, fine, the corps already allows it. You \njust cannot use it on critical infrastructure. He says that is his \npoint. What is the problem? What is the problem?\n  As I discuss this with my friend, I do not see why his amendment is \nnecessary. I hope he will withdraw it, frankly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I do not have any intention of \nwithdrawing the amendment. There is a Federal statute that already \nprohibits the carrying of firearms in Federal buildings and structures, \nand we will get the Senator the statute. That is very clear. We were \nadvised by legislative counsel we did not have to put that in there \nbecause it is already prohibited. I will challenge the statement of the \nCRS and will give the Senator the section of the code that provides \nthat.\n  Again, the point is, this critical infrastructure is already being \nbeefed up. We are going to be doing that in Homeland Security. We are \ndoing that in Homeland Security, and it has no bearing whatsoever on \nthe Second Amendment right to unify our policies across all government-\nowned land in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n[[Page S3222]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record the CRS report summary that was done on this identical \nbill, which clearly states in their analysis that this would allow \nindividuals to carry firearms--loaded--on to levees, dams, near \nreservoirs, and the rest. It is clearly stated here:\n\n       Proposed legislation does not explicitly provide the Corps \n     with authority to restrict firearms at Corps facilities [like \n     dams]. . . .\n\n  And it goes on to say that is their decision.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        [From the Congressional Research Service, July 12, 2012]\n\n Firearms at Army Corps Water Resources Projects: Proposed Legislation \n                        and Issues for Congress\n\n                         (By Nicole T. Carter)\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       As part of its civil works mission, the U.S. Army Corps of \n     Engineers manages water resource projects. Reservoirs lying \n     behind Corps dams, and Corps navigation locks and their \n     pools, are popular recreation sites, attracting 370 million \n     visits annually. Corps projects include some of the most \n     densely used federal recreation lands. Currently, 36 C.F.R. \n     Section 327 sets out the regulations for public use of Corps \n     projects. Section 327.13 generally prohibits possession of \n     loaded firearms by private (i.e., non-law enforcement) \n     individuals at Corps-administered projects unless they are \n     being used for hunting at designated sites (with devices \n     required to be unloaded while transported to and from the \n     sites) or at authorized shooting ranges. The regulation \n     applies at projects regardless of their location in states \n     allowing open or concealed carry of loaded firearms.\n       Proposed legislation--the Recreational Lands Self-Defense \n     Act (H.R. 1865, S. 1588), and Section 111 of H.R. 5325, the \n     Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act of FY2013 (which are all substantively \n     similar)--would bar the Secretary of the Army from \n     promulgating or enforcing regulations that prohibit \n     individuals from possessing firearms (including assembled or \n     functional firearms) at Corps projects. The bills would \n     require that firearms possession comply with state law. \n     Supporters of the proposed legislation see it as a partial \n     remedy to a current patchwork of regulations restricting \n     firearms on federally managed lands, as a means to provide \n     consistency for open and concealed firearms possession within \n     a state, and as facilitating self-defense. They argue that \n     enactment would establish Corps policies consistent with \n     Section 512 of P.L. 111-24, which made it legal for \n     individuals to possess firearms at National Park Service \n     (NPS) and National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) units of the \n     Department of the Interior (DOI). Other stakeholders are \n     concerned that the proposed legislation may produce \n     unintended public safety and infrastructure security issues \n     at Corps projects.\n       The issue for Congress is not only possession of loaded \n     firearms by private individuals but also how to maintain \n     public safety and infrastructure security at Corps projects.\n        Critical facilities security: Proposed legislation \n     does not explicitly provide the Corps with authority to \n     restrict firearms at Corps facilities (e.g., dams) or in \n     specifically designated areas.\n        Public safety and law enforcement: There are no \n     armed federal law enforcement officers commissioned for \n     public safety and security purposes at Corps projects. Unlike \n     DOI, the Corps does not have authority to perform most law \n     enforcement functions at its projects. Corps rangers are \n     limited to issuing citations for regulatory violations and \n     are not allowed to carry firearms. Most law enforcement is \n     provided by local and state law enforcement personnel; the \n     Corps' authority to contract for this assistance is $10 \n     million annually.\n       A safety and security assessment of the proposed \n     legislation for Corps projects has not been performed. DOI's \n     Bureau of Reclamation is faced with similar safety and \n     security issues at its water resource projects. It allows \n     possession of firearms on Reclamation lands and waterbodies \n     (e.g., reservoirs behind dams) when such possession complies \n     with federal, state, and local law. The regulations restrict \n     firearms at Reclamation facilities (e.g; dams, buildings). \n     DOI and Reclamation also use multiple authorities and \n     mechanisms to provide for armed and unarmed law enforcement \n     and public safety and security. Whether the Corps, given its \n     current authorities, could similarly provide for safety and \n     security at its projects if the proposed legislation is \n     enacted has not been assessed.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. CRS did a big study of it. I appreciate my friend says he \ncovers this. It is not in his legislation. It is just not in there. He \ndoes not refer to that other law. He does not say anything about the \nother law.\n  My point is that the corps already allows you to bring a loaded gun \nonto the premises. You can even get a special permit if you want to \nbring it to other areas. It is already the law.\n  So this is an amendment that, in my reading of it, would allow you \nthen to go onto these other areas--the levees, the reservoirs, the \ncritical infrastructure. CRS agrees. I have put it in the Record. My \nfriend says no.\n  I will tell you something, I do not think we should move forward with \nthis--he is--and we will see where the votes fall.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I would yield back the remainder of my \ntime if the chairman of the committee would do as well.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I do. I yield my time back as well and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. May I ask further consent that time during all of the \nquorum calls be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, for the interest of all Senators, we are \nmoving forward with our bill. We have a first vote on an amendment at 2 \no'clock. At this time we are determining whether Senator Whitehouse \nwill offer his amendment. If he does, there will be a vote on one of \nthe two Coburn amendments--he has withdrawn the other--and then a vote \non the Whitehouse amendment if, in fact, he offers it.\n  I would like say for the benefit of all Senators that this is a WRDA \nbill; this is a water bill. This is about dredging our ports. This is \nabout making sure we have restoration of our wetlands. This is about \nmaking sure we have flood control protection. This is about the \ninfrastructure of our country, the ability to move goods, and the \nability to have an infrastructure that is much better than the D-plus \nit is rated at this time.\n  This is not a gun bill. I beg my colleagues, whatever side you are \non, we cannot turn this bill into a gun bill because that is not going \nto happen. I hope my colleagues will look at the Coburn amendment and \ndecide that the best course is not to have it on this bill. It doesn't \nbelong on this bill, and it shouldn't be on this bill. It is \nnongermane, and, more important to me, it is very controversial.\n  I wish to ask the Senator from Rhode Island a question. I know the \nSenator has a wonderful amendment that deals with the protection of our \noceans on a water bill. Guess what--an amendment about water on a water \nbill. This is good. I would ask my friend if he intends to offer his \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, through the Chair, I will tell the \ndistinguished chairman that I, with great enthusiasm, intend to offer \nmy amendment. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will \nsupport it.\n  You should support it if you are from a coastal State because the \ncoastal problems that coastal States face are so often overlooked. If \nyou are not from a coastal State but you visit coastal States to go to \nthe beach, if you like to eat fish or, frankly, if you like imported \nproducts that come through our coastal ports, you too have an interest \nin this legislation. I hope you will support it.\n  Finally, this is a piece of legislation that was agreed to before by \nthis body in the form of the RESTORE Act. In the RESTORE Act, we \nliterally sent billions of dollars to our colleagues along the Gulf \nStates for remediation, repair, and economic reconstruction after the \ntwo disasters of Hurricane Katrina and the explosion of the oil\n\n[[Page S3223]]\n\nwell. Those two disasters. So for reasons that don't merit further \ndiscussion here today, that part of the agreement was left \nunaccomplished.\n\n  Whether you are from a coastal State or whether you enjoy coastal \nproducts or visits, I would urge my colleagues, for the sake of the \nSenate being a place in which a bargain once struck is honored, that we \nowe a vote strongly in support of the authorization--and this is only \nan authorization, no funding whatsoever--of a national endowment for \nthe oceans that will allow coastal and Great Lakes States to at least \nbe able to compete for funding to be obtained later through existing \nstructures--no new bureaucracies--so we can do what we need to do to \nprotect our coastal economies.\n  I thank the chairman.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Retaining my time, I would like to ask through the Chair \nif Senator Whitehouse has to actually send his amendment to the desk \nand ask for the yeas and nays. Because, if so, I think it would be an \nappropriate time to do that since we intend to vote at 2 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It can be offered at this time.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. If I may seek recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 803 to Amendment No. 799\n\n (Purpose: To create the National Endowment for the Oceans to promote \n the protection and conservation of United States ocean, coastal, and \n                        Great Lakes ecosystems)\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. At the Chairman's suggestion, and with her \npermission, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Whitehouse], for \n     himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Nelson, Mr. Blumenthal, and Ms. \n     Cantwell, proposes an amendment numbered 803 to amendment No. \n     799.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Tuesday, May 7, 2013, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mrs. BOXER. Does the Senator need to ask for the yeas and nays or are \nthe yeas and nays ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays would have to be requested.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask for the yeas and nays, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not a sufficient second at this time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I am very confused. Yesterday there was \nan agreement there would be a vote. What is my colleague's \nunderstanding?\n  OK, we just need to have some more time. So I recommend the Senator \nstay on the floor so we can get a colleague on the floor. That would be \ngreat. After we do that, I am going to encourage my friend to take some \ntime and go into why it is so critical we pay attention to the oceans \nof our country, what is happening to the state of our oceans, and what \nis happening to the quality of our oceans, given so many factors, \nincluding the changes we are experiencing in climate, because he is a \ngreat expert on that.\n  Does my friend want some time now? I would like to see if I can get \nus to the yeas and nays.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, while the chairman goes about the \nparliamentary task of organizing a sufficient second on the national \nendowment bill, I do wish to describe some of the changes our coastal \nand Great Lakes States are seeing and need to deal with.\n  Probably the most obvious of all are the storms we have been seeing--\nthe unprecedented and extreme storms we have been seeing--along our \ncoasts. Whether it was Hurricane Katrina or Superstorm Sandy, we have \nseen unprecedented damage done at the merger of land and sea, where \ndriven by these powerful storms the sea can wreak such havoc on the \nland. But it goes well beyond the damage of extreme storms. If we go \nout into the Gulf of Maine, we can see the cod catch, which is a \nhistoric fishery going back centuries, has now collapsed to the point \nwhere the Draconian measures that must be applied to that fishery \nactually risk extinguishing the fishing industry for cod in some of our \nNortheastern States.\n  We can move down the coast to the Carolinas, where highway \ndepartments are raising the bridges out to the Outer Banks in order to \nprepare for higher seas and stronger storm surges. We can go further \nsouth, to the Florida coast, where in some parts of that ocean--the \nCaribbean ocean nearby--as little as 10 percent of the coral remains \nalive. That is actually a pretty big industry for Florida. I think they \ndo 15 million scuba dives a year for recreational purposes--15 million \nscuba dives--which are not just economically valuable for the dive boat \nowners and operators but for the people who travel, who have meals and \nwho stay in hotels and buy equipment. They are not going to come to do \nscuba diving there as much if the famous Caribbean reefs and coral \nreefs off of Florida continue to die at the rate they are.\n  We can go all the way across the country to the West Coast, where we \nsee the oyster fisheries in Washington and Oregon threatened by the \nacidification of the oceans. There have been oyster hatcheries that \nhave had massive die-offs within the hatchery when acidified water from \nthe sea welled up and came into the intakes of these, in many cases, \nmultigenerational family operations and were too acidic to allow the \nlarval oysters to develop their shells, resulting in massive die-offs \nand economic loss.\n  I can tell two stories about my home State of Rhode Island that are \nvery current. In Rhode Island, the biggest storm we have seen, worse \neven than Superstorm Sandy in recent decades, was the famous hurricane \nof 1938, which did immense damage along our shoreline at a time when \nour shoreline was far less developed than it is now. Between the 1930s, \nwhen that hurricane took place, and now, the sea level at the Newport \ntide gauge in Newport, RI, has actually climbed 10 inches. So when the \nnext hurricane of 1938 comes--or perhaps even a bigger one, as our \ncurrent experience of storms would seem to suggest is possible--it will \nbe driving a higher ocean against the shore and probably not just 10 \ninches higher, because a storm surge will stack that 10-inch increase \nas it crashes against our Rhode Island shores, and that can be a game \nchanger.\n  States such as Rhode Island have to do a lot of work to reconfigure \nwhere the so-called velocity zones are, where it is safe to build or \nnot safe to build, what is actually now vulnerable in a 100-year flood \nor a 500-year flood as things change along our coasts. That is \nsomething that is a little hard to debate. It is actually a \nmeasurement. It is a measurement of 10 inches on a tide gauge. This is \nnot some theory. This is what has happened. That water lying out there \n10 inches higher is a terrific risk to our State and something we have \nto prepare for. Given the way State budgets are, we would like to be \nable to compete, once we have found some Federal funding, for the \nability to figure things out so investors and people living along \ncoastal communities can have a solid and fact-based appreciation of \nwhat the risks are to them from this worsening condition of stronger \nstorms and higher measured sea levels.\n\n  Another Rhode Island-specific example is the winter flounder. The \nwinter flounder is a major catch species in Narragansett Bay--or at \nleast it was. We can go back to the earliest Native American \nsettlements and find winter flounder bones around the settlements. For \nmany years the winter flounder was the biggest catch in Narragansett \nBay. I know a certain amount about it because when my wife did her \nPh.D. thesis, she studied the winter flounder in Narragansett Bay and \nwhat was happening to it and how its life cycle interacted with another \nbay creature called the sand shrimp--or the Crangon septemspinosa, \nwhich is the technical name. In the time between when she wrote her \nthesis and now, the catch of winter flounder in Narragansett Bay has \ncrashed more than 90 percent. It is no longer an active direct fishery \nin Narragansett Bay.\n  I can remember not that many years ago, it doesn't seem, driving over \nthe Jamestown Bridge or the Newport Bridge or the Bristol Bridge and \nlooking down and seeing trawlers working the upper bay trawling for \nwinter flounder. We don't see that any longer because that fishery has \ncrashed.\n  It has crashed for two reasons. One is the bay is warmer in the \nwinter. I am\n\n[[Page S3224]]\n\nhaving a dispute with PolitiFact right now, but I stand by my assertion \nit is 4 degrees warmer in the winter. They think it is more like 3 \ndegrees warmer in the winter than it was 30 years ago. Four degrees in \nwater temperature may not seem like much to us humans, but we don't \nlive in that environment. If that is your environment, 4 degrees sends \na signal to certain species they don't belong there any longer and to \nmove to cooler waters.\n  The other thing it has done is it has allowed this other bay \ncreature, the sand shrimp, to move in earlier to the bay when the \nlarval winter flounders are still small enough to be eaten by the sand \nshrimp. It used to be the sand shrimp would come in and they would feed \non the larval winter flounders, but enough of them would get big enough \nsoon enough that they got too big to eat for the sand shrimp. In fact, \nas they got bigger, they would turn around and eat the sand shrimp. \nThat was the cycle of life. Now the sand shrimp come in earlier. There \nare fewer winter flounder because of the temperature, and because they \nare getting in earlier, it is a much more dangerous environment because \nthe larval winter flounder are smaller and remain prey longer. So for \nall those reasons, there goes what once was a very key fishery.\n  These are just individual examples. Every coastal State, every Great \nLakes State could come and have their Senator give the same speech with \nat least two examples of things that are changing and making a dramatic \ndifference in the coasts. The phrase I use is: The faster you drive, \nthe better your headlights need to be. These changes are coming fast. \nThings that used to happen across centuries are happening in decades; \nthings that used to happen over decades are happening in years. We need \nto have better headlights as we see these changes coming at us, and the \nheadlights are the science, the research, the information, and the \nability to do this kind of work.\n  I hope my colleagues, on the merits, will support my amendment. I \nhope even if they do not particularly care, even if they are from an \ninland State and don't have a great interest, that simply in the \ninterest of the spirit of the Senate they will respect an agreement \nonce it has been reached and will make an effort to make sure \nagreements, when struck, aren't broken and that I will get my partisan \nsupport.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I rise today in support of the 2013 \nWater Resources Development Act, or WRDA. I agree with my colleagues \nwho believe that moving forward with a bipartisan WRDA bill is \nimportant for our communities.\n  As the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure, I believe we need to address the issues facing the Army \nCorps and the country. Today we have problems with aging \ninfrastructure, with a lack of transparency, and with fiscal \naccountability--all of which impact the public health, the safety, and \nthe economic welfare of our communities.\n  My staff and I have worked with our colleagues on the full committee \nand the subcommittee to create a bipartisan product to address these \nconcerns. We may have our differences on a number of the issues, but \nthe bulk of what we have accomplished is about protecting our States \nand protecting our constituents, not about partisan politics.\n  For example, issues such as flood mitigation are very important to my \nState. In 1984 the town of Baggs, WY, faced a major flood. The entire \ntown had to be evacuated, and there was over $1 million worth of damage \ndone. In mid-May of 2008, Baggs faced another major potential flood. \nThe Wyoming National Guard was called in to assist, as well as the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. At the request of the Department of \nHomeland Security, the Army Corps Sacramento office sent an official \nwho was able to oversee the reinforcement of existing berms and the \nconstruction of new ones. This time Baggs did not need to be evacuated \nand the damage was minimal.\n  Baggs is not the only town in Wyoming to need assistance to protect \nitself from the threat of flooding. Predicting floods and being better \nprepared for them is a major component in keeping Wyoming communities \nsafe. That is why I proposed and successfully included language in this \nbill, with the help of the chair and ranking member, for an \nauthorization for Upper Missouri Basin flood and drought monitoring. \nThis program will restore the stream gauges and snowpack monitors \nthrough the Upper Missouri Basin at all elevations. These gauges are \nused to monitor snow depth and soil moisture, to help inform agencies \nsuch as the Corps as to potential flooding and also drought in the \nfuture. This type of monitoring will protect communities and save \nlives. The language is supported by the Upper Missouri Water \nAssociation.\n  I am also pleased that the language I have authored for technical \nassistance to help rural communities comply with environmental \nregulations was included in the bill. Rural communities often do not \nhave the expertise or the funding to make important upgrades to their \nwater systems. Dedicated professionals, such as the folks at the \nWyoming Rural Water Association, use this funding to go into these \ncommunities and provide the critical assistance they need. I thank \nSubcommittee Chairman Baucus for his help in working with me to get \nthis important language included in the bill.\n  As I mentioned, transparency and fiscal responsibility are also \nimportant components to tackling the issues that need to be addressed \nwith the Army Corps. That is why I offered language to create an Army \nCorps project deauthorization process. It is one that mimics the Base \nRealignment and Closure Commission--you know, the BRAC Commission--that \nthe Department of Defense uses to close or reconsolidate military \nbases.\n  Under my language, an independent commission appointed by the \nPresident would identify projects for deauthorization based on \nestablished criteria and then submit those projects as one package for \nan up-or-down vote by the Congress. There are many of these projects \nthat are on the books. They are authorized for millions of dollars, and \nthey are going nowhere. The backlog of Army Corps projects is currently \nabout $60 billion according to the National Academy of Sciences. It is \ntime for the Corps and Congress to clean the books, cut the waste, and \nbring fiscal responsibility to the WRDA process.\n  I am specifically thankful to Chairman Boxer and to Ranking Member \nVitter and Subcommittee Chairman Baucus for supporting my language. I \nam also grateful to my colleagues for the bipartisan process under \nwhich this bill was considered. Our staffs worked well together. We put \ntogether a good product. I specifically want to thank a member of my \nstaff, Brian Clifford, who worked diligently on this process and worked \nin a unified way. We see the results in the Senate.\n  The bill unanimously passed the Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee.\n  Although the bill is not perfect and there is always room for \nimprovement, I believe we have achieved a compromise, a solution that \nis substantive, effective, and in the public interest. This is a \nproduct that will save lives, will maintain the flow of commerce, and \nwill protect communities for years to come.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Education Equality\n\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, as the son and grandson of classroom \nteachers, as a father myself, as someone for whom education played a \ncentral role in my life, and as a passionate believer in the power of \neducation to change others' lives, I rise today to talk about a bill \nthat is one of the most important to me that I have moved as a Senator.\n  The fact is if we look at the American national condition, the lack \nof access to higher education as well as the\n\n[[Page S3225]]\n\nlack of an opportunity for a quality education is one of the greatest \nproblems we face. Inequality in having some real hope, some real \npromise of a shot at college defines and distinguishes the drivers of \nsocial inequality in America in ways it has not in decades. If we want \nto ensure going forward that American workers can compete in the global \neconomy, if we want to ensure a country that is capable of living up to \nour promise of liberty and justice for all, if we want to deal with one \nof the biggest civil rights issues in our country, then we have to \nensure every child has an equal chance for high-quality education \nregardless of the ZIP Code they are born into.\n  Long before I was elected to public office, I spent years working \nwith a nonprofit education center called ``I Have A Dream'' Foundation. \nIn my role there, I visited schools all over the United States. More \noften than not, these were schools in very tough communities and \nneighborhoods, schools that were in public housing developments or that \nwere in some of the most forlorn and troubled neighborhoods in all of \nAmerica.\n  What struck me over and over when I would go into an elementary \nschool and talk to a group of young kids and ask: What do you dream of? \nWhat do you hope to be when you grow up? They would raise their hands, \nand none of them said: I dream of being in a gang; I dream of being in \njail; I dream of being a drug dealer; I dream of dying before I turn \n20. They would say: I dream of being a Senator or a lawyer or owning my \nown business or being a star in the NBA or being a success. The dreams \nwe hear from kids in elementary schools are the same regardless of the \ncommunity in America. Yet the outcomes are so desperately different.\n  What I saw in the nearly 20 years I was active with the ``I Have A \nDream'' Foundation was that the young people who came from a community, \nfamily, or school where there was little or no experience or \nexpectation of a college education sent a powerful, persistent, and \nnegative message at a very early age--that college is not for them. \nThey are told indirectly that it is not affordable, it is not \naccessible, it is not part of the plan for their future. Those messages \nhave a cumulative, powerful, and consequential impact.\n  Very few of the 50 ``Dreamers'' from the east side of Wilmington that \nmy family and I worked very closely with had any expectation of a \ncollege education. In 1988 when our chapter of ``I Have A Dream'' \nFoundation promised them the opportunity for a higher education through \na scholarship, we could see the change. First we saw the change in \ntheir teachers and parents, then in their mentors and classmates, and \nultimately we saw it in them. We saw a change in their hopes and their \nexpectations.\n  The most powerful thing the ``I Have A Dream'' Foundation did in our \nchapter, and in dozens of chapters around the country, was to hold up a \nmirror to young people of their future that was a brighter and more \npromising future than they had ever dreamed of on their own. They were \nchallenged to walk through that open door and make college not just a \ndistant dream, not something they heard of or watched on TV, but \nsomething that became a part of their lived life, and to change their \noutcomes.\n  That experience has inspired the bill I introduced in the last \nCongress, and I am most personally connected to in this Congress.\n  Last year I found a Republican partner who shares my passion for \nexpanding access to college and for making it more affordable. That \npartner is Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. Some folks have noticed that \nhere in the Senate we don't always get along and we don't always agree \nand sometimes partisanship divides us. I have been very pleased to have \nthis strong and able partner in moving forward a bipartisan bill which \nwe named the American Dream Accounts Act. This is a bill that bridges \nthe opportunity gap by connecting students, teachers, parents, and \nmentors to create a new generation of higher education achievers.\n  There are too many American kids today who are cut off from the \nenormous potential of a higher education. The numbers are grim. If \nsomeone comes from a low-income family, the chance that student will \ncomplete a college degree by the time that person turns 25 is about 1 \nin 10 at best.\n  In order to have the prospect of employment and opportunity of \naccumulating wealth and providing an education and security for our \nfamily and kids, a college education is essential these days. We in the \nFederal Government spend billions of dollars on making higher education \naffordable through Pell grants, yet do almost nothing to make it clear \nto children at the earliest age that this funding will be available to \nthem.\n  In my home State of Delaware, our Governor Jack Markell and our first \nlady Carla Markell have done a wonderful job of incorporating the power \nof this insight and lesson. They are ensuring there is a State-funded \nscholarship and network of engaged mentors and real reform in our \npublic schools. We don't tell kids, even in our State, in elementary \nschool of the possibilities that lie ahead of them in a way that \nchanges their expectations. That is what this bill will hopefully do. \nIt encourages partnerships between schools and colleges, nonprofits and \nbusinesses. It allows them to develop individualized student accounts, \nsuch as their Facebook account, married to a college savings account; \nindividual accounts that are secure, Web-based, personal, and portable; \naccounts that contain information about each student's academic \npreparedness and financial literacy. It is something that combines a \nportfolio of their entire education experience with the very real \nsavings for the future of higher education we want to pull them toward \nfrom their earliest years.\n\n  Instead of forcing motivated parents or concerned teachers or \ninterested mentors or empowered students--instead of forcing all of \nthese folks to track down these different resources separately, this \nlegislation, this idea would connect them across existing silos and \nacross existing education programs at the State and Federal level.\n  So tomorrow Senator Rubio and I will reintroduce this legislation as \nthe bipartisan American Dream Accounts Act of 2013. We are working hard \nto earn the support of our colleagues in the Senate and in the House, \nand I will keep at this for as long as it takes.\n  The American Dream Accounts Act addresses the longstanding challenges \nand barriers to college access: connectivity, financial resources, \nearly intervention, and portability. Let me briefly speak to each of \nthose.\n  First, connectivity. The journey from elementary school, to high \nschool, to higher education is a long one, and for a student to be \nsuccessful it takes lots of engaged and attentive adults--motivated \nparents, concerned teachers, supportive family. So many students in our \nschools all over this country disengage or drop out along the way \nbecause they are not connected, they are not supported by those \nconcerned and engaged adults. The American Dream Accounts Act takes \nadvantage of modern technology to create Facebook-inspired \nindividualized accounts--an opportunity to deliver personalized hubs of \ninformation that would connect these kids and sustain and support them \nthroughout the entire journey of education by continuing to remind them \nof the promise of higher education and its affordability.\n  Second, these dream accounts would connect kids with college savings \nopportunities. Studies show that students who know there is a dedicated \ncollege savings account in their name are seven times more likely to go \nto college than peers without one. Think about that for a moment. \nStates such as Delaware and our Nation invest billions of dollars in \nprograms to make higher education affordable. Yet so few of the kids I \nhave worked with all over this country in the ``I Have a Dream'' \nprogram have any idea. They have never heard of Senator Pell. They \ndon't know Pell grants exist. They don't live in States that have the \nHOPE scholars, the Aspire scholars, or the Dream scholarships that a \nnumber of States have, and they don't know they will be there for them \nwhen they are of age to go to college. Why don't we tell them early? \nWhy don't we change their expectations? That is one of the things this \nprogram would do. And it is not a new idea; it is a demonstrated one \nthat we know works.\n  The third piece of this American Dream Accounts Act is early \nintervention. As I said, States and Federal programs that provide \nbillions of dollars\n\n[[Page S3226]]\n\nin support to make college affordable don't connect with kids early \nenough. By letting them know early, we can change their ultimate \norientation and outcomes.\n  The last important piece is portability. One of the things I saw in \nmy own experience with my Dreamers, the students in the ``I Have a \nDream'' program I helped to run in Delaware, was just how often they \nmoved. Children growing up in poverty, in families facing unexpected \nchallenges, relocate over and over and bounce from school to school, \ndistrict to district, often facing overstretched teachers with full \nclassrooms who, when they move midyear into a new school, don't get any \nbackground information or insight on the student who has moved into \ntheir classroom. So instead of being welcomed and engaged in a positive \nway, sometimes they feel and are disconnected and develop into \ndiscipline problems or students who are difficult to teach. The \nmobility that comes with poverty sometimes also leads to disconnection \nfrom education.\n  This robust, online, secure, individualized account would empower \nteachers to connect with parents, to connect with mentors, and to know \nthe entire education history of the student newly before them. So no \nmatter what disruptions or challenges a student might face as they \ntravel through the long journey of education, their own individual \nAmerican dream act--their own portfolio of their dreams and their \nactivities and their progress--would be there with them.\n  Our Nation's long-term economic competitiveness requires a highly \ntrained and highly educated workforce, and our Nation's commitment to a \ndemocracy and to a country of equal opportunity demands that we do \neverything we can to make real the hope of higher education for kids no \nmatter the ZIP Code into which they are born, no matter their \nbackground. While we spend billions on making higher education \naffordable, we aren't delivering it effectively enough to change that \nfuture. What I saw in my years with the ``I Have a Dream'' program was \nbright faces, raised arms, hope, and opportunity that sadly was not as \noften as it could be realized. This program, this connectivity, this \nnew type of account is a way to make real on that promise.\n  We can meet this challenge by connecting students with a broad array \nof higher education options, informing them about them early, whether \nit is vocational school or job training, community college or 4-year \nuniversities. Not everyone is made for a 4-year higher education \ndegree. This would connect kids with all of the different opportunities \nfor skill training and higher education that are out there. It also \nwould support students as they identify the type of education best for \nthem, the career they most want, and give them the tools to get there.\n  As I visit schools across my own State of Delaware, one thing is \nclear: All of these different resources currently exist in different \nways and at different stages of education, but they are not connected \nin a way that weaves together students, parents, mentors, and the \nresources of our highly motivated, highly engaged State.\n  So this vision--one that has stayed with me from my time at ``I Have \na Dream'' to my service here as a Senator--is that when we ask a \nroomful of elementary school kids in the future, ``What do you dream \nof, what is your hope,'' when their hands shoot up in the air and they \nlist all of the different dreams they have, regardless of background or \nincome or community, we can make that possible. We can make our \ninvestments real, and we can make the dream of equal opportunity a \nreality.\n  This year, with the support of lots of groups, including the \nCorporation for Enterprise Development, a wonderful group called \nOpportunity Nation, the First Focus Campaign for Children, we are \nhopeful that bipartisan support for this American dream accounts idea \nwill simply continue to grow. Let's work together to empower students \nand parents of all backgrounds to achieve their dreams from the \nearliest age.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Madam President, I rise today to speak about our current impasse over \nthe progress of the Federal budget. I have been a Senator for just a \nlittle over 2 years. I have presided over this Chamber a great deal, as \nhas the Senator now presiding. I have listened to dozens of speeches \nfrom colleagues--in particular, Republican colleagues--upset that this \nChamber and the Budget Committee on which I serve hadn't passed a \nbudget in several years. But this year we passed a budget, finally. We \nwent through the long and grinding process known here in Washington as \nvote-arama where we considered, debated, and disposed of over 100 \namendments over hours and hours of deliberation and debate and voting \non this floor, and we passed a budget.\n  It has been 46 days since the Senate passed our budget, but we still \nneed to reconcile it with the House of Representatives' budget for it \nto become a forceful resolution, a budget resolution that drives the \ndecisions of the Congress. It is important we do that because it has \nbeen 66 days since the sequester kicked in.\n  I know ``sequester'' is Washington-speak, but all of us as Senators \nare hearing from our home States the very real, very human impact of \nthese across-the-board spending cuts that have begun to really bite. We \nhear about potential furloughs of men and women who serve at Dover Air \nForce Base. We hear about the tens of thousands of children being \nkicked out of needed Head Start Programs. We hear about the thousands \nof women not getting the breast cancer screenings they need, and we \nhear about the hundreds of thousands of children not getting the \nvaccines they are supposed to get. The impacts of the sequester are \nbecoming stronger and broader and more negative all across our country.\n  The sequester exists because of a lack of political will to come \ntogether and resolve a fundamentally different vision between the \nSenate and the House enacted in our respective budgets. This sequester \nexists because we haven't come together across the House and the Senate \nin the way that for 200 years and more this Congress has done. When we \npass a bill and when the House passes a bill, it is supposed to go to \nconference or reconciliation, resolution, and ultimately passage. Here \nis our chance.\n  Why would Republicans actively keep us from going to conference to \nfinalize a budget, especially after years of coming to this floor and \ngiving speeches, claiming over and over how terrible it was that we \nwould not pass a budget in the Senate? Americans are tired of this \ndysfunction. In my view, today Republicans are manufacturing a crisis \nby preventing the Senate and House from coming together to reconcile \nour budgets in conference.\n  As I said, I am a member of the Budget Committee, and I can say with \nsome detailed knowledge, as can the Presiding Officer, that there are \nreal differences between the budget adopted here in the Senate and the \nbudget adopted in the House. I believe the Democratic budget promotes \ngrowth and the Republican budget focuses on cuts. I believe ours \nprioritizes the middle class while the other prioritizes more tax cuts \nfor the wealthiest. In my view, ours prioritizes balance; the other, \npolitics. I think our budget puts us on the path toward job creation \nwhile the other takes a path to austerity. But we will never reconcile \nthese two budgets, achieve a shared path forward, and set aside this \nterrible sequester if we don't go to conference.\n  Reconciling these two budgets is the definition of what I have heard \nMember after Member come to the floor and call for, what we have heard \nhere in the Senate called regular order--the process set out by the \nFounders of this Nation and to which we should return.\n  These political games, in my view, are destroying this institution. I \nthink it is no wonder the opinion of the average American across this \ncountry of this institution simply sinks lower and lower.\n  What is standing in the way of our progress on this budget at this \npoint is repeated Republican objections. It is my hope that they will \nstep aside and allow us to walk the corridor to the House, get to the \nconference table, and resolve our budget differences.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S3227]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 805\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have up to 5 \nminutes to speak before the vote. Am I correct in assuming the vote is \nat 2 o'clock?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Madam President.\n  I wish to again let Senators know where we are. At 2 o'clock, we will \nbe voting on a gun amendment. I would hope this gun amendment would not \nget the 60 votes required because I believe it is dangerous. Even \nthough Senator Coburn says it would not allow guns to be carried on \ncritical infrastructure such as dams and locks and reservoirs, we now \nhave two studies that say, in fact, it would allow that.\n  According to the Bush administration, this critical water \ninfrastructure is a target for terrorists. We are now entering into a \nstage when our leaders are talking about homegrown terror, and we do \nnot have to look too much further than Boston to understand this is a \nproblem.\n  Why would we want to have on a water infrastructure bill an amendment \nthat allows people to come in with guns and go right to the heart of \nthose critical water infrastructure projects--those dams, those \nreservoirs, those locks, et cetera--particularly since the corps \nalready allows, for recreational use, the use of guns for hunting, \ntarget practice or fishing. That is already allowed.\n  There are rules. This is not comparable to the National Park Service. \nWe could get into another debate on that. That one--I know some people \nhere voted for that, to allow extensive guns being carried on parkland. \nThat change was made. The corps is a different situation. The Park \nService act like police. They can come in. They can quell a \ndisturbance. They are armed. They are trained. The corps is not a law \nenforcement entity. That means what they would have to do, if there was \na violent outburst, is call the local governments, the State \ngovernments, and we do not know how long it would take to have those \nlaw enforcement people arrive at such a situation.\n  So I am pleading with my colleagues, this is a water infrastructure \nbill. This is not a gun bill. This is not the place to add these types \nof amendments. We have a very bipartisan bill. It is supported by the \nchamber of commerce, it is supported by the unions, it is supported by \nlocal governments, by the Governors Association. I could go on and on. \nThere is a list of literally 150 organizations. It came out of the \ncommittee with a bipartisan vote.\n  I hope when the clock strikes 2 we can have a vote that keeps us on \ntrack, that does not turn the WRDA bill into a gun bill. It is not \nnecessary. It is not appropriate. The fact is, there is nothing in the \namendment that would stop people from carrying guns onto critical water \ninfrastructure. It sets up a national security threat. It endangers \npeople.\n  I just want to be clear: I am not going to allow a bill to move \nforward that endangers the lives of the people I represent. I owe them \na lot more than that, let alone the entire country. We all serve this \nNation.\n  So I hope we will not pass this amendment. I ask for a ``no'' vote on \nthe Coburn amendment.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). All time is expired. The \nquestion is on agreeing to the Coburn Amendment No. 805.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order requiring 60 votes \nfor the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is rejected.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. One of the three scheduled votes has been withdrawn, an \namendment, so we only have one more vote. Senator Boxer and Senator \nVitter have a number of other people wanting to offer amendments today, \nso if you have amendments, talk to the managers of the bill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for the yeas and nays on the Whitehouse amendment \nand urge its passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 803 offered by the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. \nWhitehouse.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President and colleagues, if I could have my \ncolleagues' attention for a moment, I would appreciate it. This is a \nmeasure that this body has voted on before in a strong bipartisan vote. \nThis was part of the RESTORE Act, which was a part of the highway bill.\n  For reasons that don't merit further discussion now, this piece of it \nfell out of the bargain that had been reached at the last minute in \nconference.\n  I hope this will be a bipartisan vote with support on both sides. If \nyou supported the RESTORE Act, you have already supported this bill. If \nyou believe that deals should be deals in the Senate, then you should \nsupport this bill. For all of us in coastal States who are facing very \nunique pressures, it is very important that we as a body support this \nbill.\n  It does not create a single extra bureaucracy or person. It works \nwithin the existing government, and it adds no funding. I am going to \nhave to work with all of you to find funding for it later and within \nour existing budget constraints.\n  This is just the authorization. Please give me a strong bipartisan \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I understand there are some asking for a voice vote. \nWould that be all right with Senator Whitehouse?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would require unanimous consent.\n  Mrs. BOXER. All right. I think we should go on with the vote then.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

CON. RES. 25\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks and to make a \nmotion. Everyone in this body knows one of the issues, the issue I \nbelieve is most holding back our economic recovery and most holding \nback our ability to sort through so many issues our country faces, is \nthe issue of our debt and deficit. We are like $17 trillion in debt. \nThe debt goes up over $4 billion every night when we go to sleep. This \nproblem is structural in nature. Time alone will not solve this issue.\n  In the last 4 years, my time in the Senate, there has been no issue \non which I have spent more time, spent more effort trying to reach out. \nI understand many of my colleagues actually try to avoid me in the \nhallways now because they fear they are going to get a Mark Warner \nharangue on the debt and deficit.\n  I also know the only way we are going to get this issue resolved is \nif both sides are willing to meet each other in the middle. This is a \nproblem that cannot be solved by continuing to cut back on \ndiscretionary spending. It will require, yes, more revenues, and it \nwill require entitlement reform. Those are issues where, unfortunately, \nin many ways our parties have not found agreement.\n  We have all agreed as well at least that, while we do not have to \nsolve this problem overnight, we need at least $4 trillion in debt \nreduction over the next 10 years. The good thing is, while we have been \nlurching from budget crisis to budget crisis, we have gotten halfway to \nour goal. The good news as well is that this year both the Senate and \nthe House adopted budget resolutions. As I said on the floor in March, \nI believe the Senate budget was a solid first chapter toward producing \na balanced fiscal plan for our country. My vote for the Senate budget--\nand it was not a budget on which I would agree with every component \npart--was a vote for progress, a vote for regular order, regular order \nthat so many of my distinguished colleagues who served here much longer \nthan I say is the glue that holds this institution together.\n  It has now been 46 days since the Senate passed its budget. \nUnfortunately, there are certain colleagues on the other side of the \naisle who seem to block our ability to go to conference. In a few \nminutes--just 2 minutes--I will ask my colleagues to agree to authorize \nthe Chair to name a conference to the Budget Committee. Unfortunately, \nI expect that request to be objected to. I find that extremely \ndisappointing. I can only speak at this point for folks from Virginia, \nbut no single other issue is as overriding, as I travel across Virginia \nand I imagine for most of my colleagues as they travel across their \nStates. At the end of the day, Americans, Virginians, want us to work \ntogether and get this issue solved.\n  We have seen, over the last 2\\1/2\\ years, as we have lurched from \nmanufactured budget crisis to budget crisis, the effects on the stock \nmarket, on job creation, and our overall recovery. We have a chance to \nput this behind us. We need to find the kind of common ground between \nthe House budget proposal and the Senate budget proposal on which so \nmany have called upon us to work.\n  Again, I am going to make this motion in a moment. I want to add one \nlast point. I appreciate some of the calls we have had from colleagues \non the Republican side over the last couple of years for the Senate to \npass a budget. I believed we needed to pass that budget. Mr. President, \n46 days ago, after 100 amendments and a session that went until 5 \no'clock in the morning, we passed such a document. I think it is time \nnow that we allow the Senate to announce its conferees to meet with the \nHouse, to get a budget\n\n[[Page S3229]]\n\nresolved for the United States of America so we have a framework to \nmake sure we get this issue of debt and deficit behind us; that we \nallow the economy to recover in a way that it needs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nconsideration of Calendar No. 33, H. Con. Res. 25; that the amendment \nwhich is at the desk, the text of S. Con. Res. 8, the budget resolution \npassed by the Senate, be inserted in lieu thereof, and H. Con. Res. 25, \nas amended, be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be considered made \nand laid upon the table; that the Senate insist on its amendment, \nrequest a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two \nHouses; and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of \nthe Senate, all with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, I ask the Senator to \nmodify his request so it not be in order for the Senate to consider a \nconference report that includes tax increases or reconciliation \ninstructions to increase taxes or raise the debt limit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I point \nout what the Senator requests is for us to redo the budget debate where \nthose amendments were considered and defeated in the Senate, and it is \nnow up to us to go to conference to work out our differences with the \nHouse. There is no need to go back through another 50 hours of debate \nand 100-plus amendments to be considered. This body needs to go to \nwork. We have been told time and time again we need a budget, we need a \nsolution. We do not need to manage by crisis. There is no need to \nrelitigate the budget on this side. We need to go to conference and \nlitigate our differences with the House Republicans.\n  I object to the Senator's request and urge we move to conference and \nallow the request of the Senator from Virginia, Senator Warner, to go \nforward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Virginia?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, while it is not unexpected, I am \ndisappointed. The nub of this issue, as commentators from left to \nright, Democrat and Republican, pointed out, is if we are going to \navoid the path we are on, the path of sequestration, which was set up \nto be literally the worst possible option--which right now is seeing \ncuts made in the most unsophisticated, unplanned, and inefficient way \npossible, plans that, if we continue on the path we are on, would so \ndramatically cut back this country's investments in education, \ninfrastructure, research and development, that I don't believe, as a \nformer business person, that America will be able to compete with the \nkind of economic growth we need to maintain our economy.\n  If we are going to avoid those kinds of Draconian cuts, if we are \ngoing to have a rational business plan for our country, I think most of \nus, or at least an overwhelming majority of the Senate, would recognize \nwe have to generate both some additional revenues and--while there may \nbe some on my side who disagree--we have to find ways to reform \nentitlement programs to make sure Medicare and Social Security are \ngoing to be there 30 years from now.\n  The only way to get that done is to take the House product, which \nfocuses particularly on entitlement reform, combine it with the Senate \nproduct that makes reasonable increases in revenues and starts us on a \npath on changes in some of our entitlement programs but also puts in \nplace a more reasonable and balanced approach on cuts. The only way we \nare going to get to that finish line, particularly for those who have \nadvocated for regular order, is to have a conference.\n  It is with great distress that we heard opposition raised to regular \norder, an appeal for regular order, an appeal that was made \nconsistently for the past 2\\1/2\\ years. I don't understand why my \ncolleagues on the other side will not take yes for an answer. They \nasked for us to pass a budget. We passed that budget. I think it is a \ngood first step in the process and I hope in the coming days there will \nbe a change of heart, that the regular order will be allowed to \nproceed, conferees will be named for both the House and Senate, and \nthat we can reach agreement on this issue that I think is important, \nnot only to the future of our economy but quite honestly now has taken \non the metaphor for whether institutions can actually function in the \n21st century.\n  I see my good friend, the Senator from Virginia, who may want to add \nsome comments to this discussion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the motion of Senator \nWarner and his argument for budget compromise and a budget conference \nthat would enable us to find that compromise for the Nation. During my \ncampaign for the Senate I heard this over and over. Every time I would \nturn on the TV it seemed there would be someone, even a colleague from \nthis body, arguing that the Senate had not passed a budget in 2 years \nor 3 years or 4 years. That was a point that was repeated over and \nover. Then, coming into this body, often sitting there in the \npresider's chair, I have heard that speech delivered from the floor of \nthis body in January and February, often with charts demonstrating the \nnumber of days it had been since the Senate passed a budget.\n  We know as part of the debt ceiling deal a bill was passed, signed by \nthe President so, arguably, even the claim of no Senate budget was \ninaccurate. But taking that claim at its word, that the Senate had not \npassed a budget in 4 years, you would think that, having passed a \nbudget, everyone would be excited and would be willing now to move \nforward to try to find a compromise for the good of the Nation.\n  Instead, what we have is an abuse of a Senate rule, an individual \nSenator standing up--even though they had a chance to vote against a \nbudget and to vote on 100 amendments about a budget--they are utilizing \nand abusing a prerogative to block a budget conference.\n  For those listening to this who do not understand what a conference \nis, it is exactly what it sounds like. We passed a budget. The House \npassed a budget. The next step in normal business would be for the two \nbudgets to be put in a conference and House and Senate Members to sit \ndown and, God forbid, listen to one another and dialog and hopefully \nfind compromise.\n  That is all we are asking to do, to have a process of listening and \ncompromise. Yet individual Senators are objecting, blocking even the \nopportunity to have this discussion. In the 4 months I have been in \nthis body we have had two major budgetary issues and I think it is \nimportant to point them both out. The first was the issue surrounding \nthe sequester, a designed regimen of nonstrategic, stupid, across-the-\nboard budget cuts that were never supposed to go into place. In late \nFebruary this body developed a plan that was able to attain more than \n50 votes, to turn off the sequester, to avoid the harm to the economy \nand other key aspects of the military, and to do it and find first year \nsavings. That proposal was able to get more than 50 votes in this body. \nIt had sufficient votes to pass. But the minority chose to invoke the \npaper filibuster process to block it from passing. They were not \nrequired to. Fifty votes is normally enough for something to pass. We \ncould have avoided the filibuster altogether. We could have avoided the \nsequester altogether and the harmful cuts. Yet the other side decided: \nWe are going to invoke the filibuster to block it from happening. That \nwas the first instance of an abuse of the Senate rules to proceed with \nnormal budgetary order.\n\n  Now we are in the second such instance. On March 23, this body passed \na budget in accord with normal Senate order, and as we have seen over \nthe past few days, the very group of people who criticize the Senate \nfor not wanting to pass a budget have done everything they can and \npulled out every procedural mechanism they can come up with to block \nthe us from coming up with a budget. This is an abuse of rules, and it \nis directly contrary to the Members' claims--now for years--that they \nwanted to pass a budget. This is not just a matter of budget nor is it \na\n\n[[Page S3230]]\n\nmatter of numbers on a page. This is hurting our economy.\n  Everyone in this Chamber will remember that when the American credit \nrating was downgraded in the summer of 2011--in the aftermath of the \ndiscussion about the debt ceiling limitation--the reason cited for the \ndowngrade was not that the mechanics of the deal were bad; instead, our \ncredit was downgraded because of the perception that legislators were \nengaging in foolish behavior and threatening to repudiate American debt \ninstead of focusing upon their jobs and trying to do the right thing \nfor the economy.\n  It was legislative gimmickry, not the details of the deal, that \ncaused us to have a bond rating downgrade for the first time in the \nhistory of the United States. It hurts the economy when we elevate \nlegislative gimmickry above doing the Nation's business, especially on \nmatters such as the budget.\n  There are some signs of economic progress these days. The \nunemployment rate is moving down, the stock market is moving up, the \ndeficit projections going forward are moving down, but we know we have \na long way to go. There is more work to be done, and finding a budget \ndeal that addresses the components which Senator Warner mentioned is \none of the factors that can create confidence to additionally \naccelerate the economy.\n  A budget deal will provide an additional acceleration to the economy. \nI have to ask the question: Is that what people are truly worried \nabout? Are they worried about doing the budget deal that will \naccelerate the economy because it might not work to their particular \npolitical advantage? That is the concern I have; otherwise, why \nwouldn't they be true to the cause they have had for the past few years \nto actually have a conference and find a deal?\n  This is not only hurting the economy, this is hurting defense. The \nhearing I had earlier with Senator King was the hearing of the Seapower \nSubcommittee of Armed Services. In that hearing we talked about the \neffect on the Nation's security and on our defense that is being \nvisited upon us as we are going through budgetary challenges, including \nthe sequester.\n  We talked about the effect of the sequester on what the witnesses \ncalled the platform, the shipbuilding, and the assets we need to keep \nus safe in a challenging world. We talked about these budget crises and \nhow they hurt our planning. Because instead of planning in a forward-\nlooking way, we are tying up all of our planning time to meet one self-\nimposed crisis after the next. We talked about the effect on readiness. \nBecause of the sequester, one-third of the air combat command units in \nthis country are standing down at a time when we may well need them \ntoday or tomorrow.\n  Finally, and most important, we talked about the effect of this \nbudgetary uncertainty on our people, whether it is civilians being \nfurloughed, whether it is private sector ship repairers getting warning \nnotices because the ship repairing accounts cannot be done consistent \nwith the sequester. This also affects people who are trying to make a \ndecision about whether they want to make the military a career, and \nthey look at Congress's unwillingness to provide budgetary certainty so \nthey may decide maybe it is not the best thing to do right now.\n  Whether it is our platform, whether it is our readiness, whether it \nis our planning or whether it is our people, this sequester and these \nbudgetary challenges and crises are hurting our ability to defend our \nNation at the very time when the world is not getting simpler or safer \nbut it is getting more challenging.\n  Many of my colleagues came from a joint session this morning with the \nPresident of South Korea, who is visiting at a time of incredible \nconcern because of Northern Korea's nuclear ambitions that will call \nupon us, the United States--just as with so many other challenges \naround the world--to have a well-planned and well-financed defense of \nthe Nation.\n  I join Senator Warner in expressing disappointment. We passed this \nbudget. We passed it 46 days ago. We were here until 5 in the morning. \nWe voted on 100 amendments. Everyone had a chance to have their say and \nhave their vote. Guess what. After our conference, they will have a \nchance to have their say and vote again. They will have a chance to \nexpress their opinions.\n  I urge my colleagues to rethink their position and allow this budget \nto move into conference so we can do the business of the United States \nof America.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I wish to thank my budget colleagues who \nare here with me today. They have spent many hours putting together a \nbudget and coming to the floor with all of the Senate to work on over \n100 amendments way into the middle of the night in order to get a \nbudget passed. We are all here ready because we came to the Senate--to \nthis Congress--to solve problems. We decided, as a committee and as a \nDemocratic caucus, it is very important we move forward on a budget.\n  We want to solve this problem so we can get back to regular order so \nour country--businesses, communities, and everyone--knows where our \npriorities are and what path we are on so we can bring some certainty \nto this country again.\n  It is so disappointing to me that four times now the Republicans have \nobjected to us now taking the necessary next step, which is to work \ntogether with our House colleagues, find a compromise, and move \nforward. We are working for certainty. It is disappointing to me that \nthose on the other side of the aisle--and we all remember they spent \nmonth after month and had chart after chart on the floor telling us we \nhad not passed a budget, we need to go to regular order--are now \nsaying: No. No regular order, no budget, no process, no certainty, no \nconclusion to this very important problem on which we have all come \ntogether to work. This is disturbing for a number of reasons, and my \ncolleagues have talked about it.\n  We have constituents at home--whether it is a business, a school, \ndelivering Meals On Wheels, planning their military operations for the \nnext year, as well as the agricultural industry--wondering what their \nplan is for the future. What they are being told--now for the fourth \ntime in a row--by the Republicans in the Senate is: We are not going to \ngive you any certainty. We like to live with uncertainty.\n  There is no doubt that moving to conference is not going to be easy; \nsolving this problem is not going to be easy. I want our colleagues to \nknow what I have consistently heard from the Democratic side is that we \nunderstand the word ``compromise.'' We know that in order to solve this \nhuge problem, we have to come to the table and compromise and listen to \nthe other side.\n  We cannot do this in the dead of night. We cannot do it with a couple \nof people sitting in a room. That has been done before, and it doesn't \nwork. We need to have regular order, and we need to have this process \nout in the open. We need to have the American people hear what the \ndifferent sides say, and then we are all going to have to take some \ntough votes.\n  I can assure the American people that on this side we understand what \nit means to take tough votes and we understand the word ``compromise'' \nand the need to get our country back on track.\n  As the Senator from Virginia said, we need to show the country that \ndemocracy can work. We are willing to take that step to make it work, \nand I urge our Republican colleagues to step forward and allow us to \nmake that move. Do not object to us trying to solve problems because \nthat is what is happening.\n  I urge our Republican colleagues--and the House as well--to move to \nconference so we can have a debate and discussion on this deeply urgent \nmatter for our country.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first, I wish to thank the chair of our \nBudget Committee for doing such a terrific job in bringing us all \ntogether. I wish to thank my colleagues on the committee. We worked \nvery hard together in order to be able to put together a balanced \nbudget that reflects the values of the American people. It is fair\n\n[[Page S3231]]\n\nand balanced in values as well as in numbers, and we did that 46 days \nago.\n  So we passed that 46 days ago after hearing for over 3 years about \nhow the Senate had not passed a budget. By the way, we did pass a law--\nthis is a caveat--called the Budget Control Act which actually had done \nthe same thing as a budget. Those of us who were on the ballot this \nlast time heard that over and over from our opponents.\n  So I am stunned that we would now be 46 days--and counting--into a \nsituation where we have been trying to take the budget we passed by a \nmajority vote--by the way, this passed on a majority vote. Each one of \nus ran for election, and we can win by one vote, and that is the \nmajority. Decisions are made by a majority vote.\n  We went through 110 amendments. We were here all hours of the night. \nThere were a lot of tired faces by the time we got done, but we got it \ndone, and we made the commitment we were going to get a budget done.\n  The House did a budget--a very different budget, no question about \nit. There is no question we have a very different vision of the \ncountry. The budget in the House eliminates Medicare as an insurance \nplan. That is certainly not something I or the majority here would \nsupport. We rejected that approach, but that was in their budget. They \nhave a right to put forward their vision for how things should be done.\n  There were many differences in values and perspectives, and that is \nwhat the Democratic process is all about. So we passed a budget by a \nmajority and they passed a budget by a majority. The next step is to \nnegotiate and come up with a final budget. That is the next step, and \nthat is how the process works. We have different views, different \nperspectives, and then we sit down in something called a conference \ncommittee.\n  We cannot get to that next step. We have had 46 days of trying to get \nto a point to get it done by working with the House, and all we get is \nobjection after objection after objection. I appreciate that colleagues \non the other side of the aisle who have voted for similar budgets to \nthe Ryan Republican budget would have preferred if we would have \neliminated Medicare. We didn't do that, and we are not going to do \nthat.\n  The majority here said we are putting forward a budget that is going \nto move the country forward and address the deficit and reflect the \nvalues around education and innovation and outbuilding the competition \nin a global economy. We are putting forward our vision. The House has \ntheir vision, which cuts innovation and cuts education and does not \nallow us to build.\n  We have very different visions. The Democracy we have says: We take \nboth of those visions and then we sit down and try to figure something \nout. That is the next step.\n  We are not interested in just being on the floor and counting the \ndays, although we will be on the floor and counting the days. That is \nnot how we want to spend our time. We would rather spend our time \nlistening to our colleagues in a respectful way about very different \nvisions and very different values so we can find a way--if we can--to \ncome together. We need to come together so we can tackle the last part \nof deficit reduction.\n  We have gone about $2.5 trillion toward the $4 trillion that everyone \nsays we need to do to begin to turn the corner as it relates to the \neconomy and the deficit. In order to get the rest of it, we need to sit \ndown in a room together and figure it out.\n  We are going to continue to come to the floor and ask for an \nagreement. Unfortunately, if there is an objection, we have to go \nthrough the whole process of trying to get it done. We are going to \nkeep pushing and pushing until we can get a budget done.\n  Why is this so important? It is very important because in our bill we \nstop what everyone feels is a very crazy approach to the final step in \ndeficit reduction, which is to have across-the-board--regardless of \nvalue, importance or impact--cuts in the investments and in the \ndiscretionary budget of our country.\n  We know there needs to be spending reductions. We have voted for \nthem. We have already put in place about $2.5 trillion in deficit \nreduction, and right now about 70 percent of that has been in spending \nreductions.\n  The concern that I have and that others in the majority have is that \nmost of those have fallen right in the laps of the middle class, our \nchildren, the future through innovation, and seniors. We have said in \nour budget: No more. No more. We have to look at an approach that is \nbalanced and that says to those who are the wealthiest in our country, \nwho are the most blessed economically: You have to be a part of the \nsolution in a significant way.\n  We want to look at spending under the Tax Code. How many times do we \ntalk about special deals in the Tax Code, things that don't make sense \nin terms of spending, special deals that support jobs going overseas \nrather than keeping them here at home. There is spending in the Tax \nCode that needs to be addressed so it is more fair for American \nbusinesses, for small businesses, for families, for the future of the \ncountry. Our budget does that by saying we are going to tackle spending \nin the Tax Code, we are going to tackle the question of fairness in the \ncode and asking those who are the wealthiest among us to contribute a \nlittle bit more to be able to help pay down this deficit, not just \ncutting Meals On Wheels or Head Start or cancer research, which is what \nis happening right now.\n  So the intensity we feel about getting this budget done is to be able \nto stop the things happening now that are very harmful. We saw the \nlines at the airports. We don't as readily see the lines of people who \ncan no longer participate, such as people I know, in cancer research \nefforts that may save lives. We know there is incredibly important \nresearch going on in science, in medicine, in agriculture, including \nfood safety and pest and disease control and every area of research \nwhere our country, the United States of America, has led the world. And \nthat doesn't show up in lines at the airport, but it does show up in \nthe future of our country. It does show up in the lives of someone who \nhas Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease or breast cancer or other \ndiseases where we are this close to cures, where there is treatment \ngoing on that can save lives--is saving lives--and it is stopping.\n  We don't see the seniors who get Meals On Wheels lining up. They are \ngetting one meal a day right now--one meal a day that allows them a \nlittle bit of a visit from a volunteer and one meal a day to eat \nthrough Meals On Wheels. Now, because of these irrational cuts, we are \ntold there are waiting lists for one meal a day. How do we have a \nwaiting list for one meal a day? I don't get that.\n  So we are saying we want to fix the airports; we appreciate that. We \nwant to fix the one meal a day going to somebody's grandma who can't \nfigure out what is going on in terms of the priorities of this country. \nThe children who are getting a head start to be successful in school--\nhow many times do we all say: Education, the most important thing; \nchildren, the most important thing. But because they don't directly \nhave a voice here, as do a lot of other special interest groups, who \ngets cut first? Our budget values children and families, opportunity, \ninnovation, fairness, and the ability to grow this economy, to create \njobs so everyone has the dignity of work.\n  We want to get to conference committee. We want to get about the \nbusiness of negotiating a final budget because we do not accept what is \nhappening right now without a budget. Tackle the deficit, yes. Do it in \na way that works for growth in America and jobs, do it in a way that \nsupports families, that lifts our children, that respects our elders, \nyes. That is the budget we voted for in the Senate and the budget we \nwant to see come to completion in this process. We can't get there \nunless we can negotiate, and that is what this whole discussion is \nabout.\n  It has been 46 days since we passed a budget. We are ready to go. We \nare more than ready to go. Let's sit down in a room and work it out. We \nknow it is a negotiation. We know we have to have give-and-take. But we \nare blocked right now from even getting in the room, and that is wrong. \nWe are going to keep coming every day, and we are going to keep \ncounting the days until our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \ndecide they are willing to get in the room and get a budget done that \nworks for the growth and the families of our country.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n[[Page S3232]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, this discussion, this debate isn't about \nbudgets. It is not about deficits. It is about governing. That is the \nfundamental question that is before this body. It is about governing.\n  I rise surprised and disappointed. I expected to come here and debate \nissues. Instead, we are debating debating. We are having to argue and \ndebate about the very act of getting to talk about these issues. And \nthe problem with the economy of this country right now, to my mind, is \nvery largely attributable to the uncertainty about whether the \ngovernment in Washington is competent. It is the uncertainty that is \nkilling us.\n  A reporter asked me this last week in Maine: What do you think you \ncan do in Washington to help us create jobs?\n  My immediate answer was that the most important thing we can do is \npass a budget in a kind of rational process, in the normal way it has \nbeen done for 200 years, and show the country we can govern. What is in \nthe budget is less important than whether we can do it at all. That is \nwhy I am so surprised and disappointed to have come to this impasse \nwhere we can't even get to the point of negotiating with the majority \nabout the budget in the other body. It makes me wonder if the Members \non the opposite side of the aisle in the Senate lack so much confidence \nin their colleagues in the House that they don't think they can hold \nthe line on whatever issues they believe are important.\n  These two budgets are very different, but I think there are items of \nvalue in both, and I can see the outlines of a compromise. We need \ndeficit reduction. We need to clean up the Tax Code. We need a tax rate \nreduction as part of cleaning up the Tax Code. We need to make \ninvestments in the future of this country. But the idea that we can't \neven get to talk--I, frankly, am perplexed. I don't understand what the \nstrategy is because when I was running last year and when I was in \nMaine just last week, the single question I got more than anything else \nwas, why in the heck can't you people do something down there--only \nthey stated it a little less elegantly than I just did. Why can't you \nget anything done?\n  The question that was raised in the hearing this morning was from \npeople in the street: We are having a hard time understanding what is \nhappening and why.\n  Well, I am a U.S. Senator, and I am having a hard time understanding \nwhat is happening and why.\n  Budgeting is one of the most fundamental obligations of government. I \nwas a Governor. I know about putting budgets together. I know about \nmaking choices. It is not easy. It is not going to be easy to make the \nchoices required for this budget. It is going to be very difficult, but \nthat is what we were sent here to do. That is our job. That is our \nobligation to the American people. I believe there are areas of \nconsensus and there are some areas in the House budget that I think are \nideas worth considering.\n  The American people simply want us to act. Sure, everybody in this \nbody has different views, and they are partisan views, but as somebody \nwho was sent down here explicitly to try to make the place work--I \nthink that was why I was elected as an Independent, because people are \nso frustrated with this warfare that they don't understand and that \ndoesn't contribute to the welfare of the country.\n  So I hope, from the point of view of someone who sees values on both \nsides and believes that the only way we are going to solve these \nproblems is by discussion and, yes, by compromise, that is what we move \nforward toward. That is what we have to do in order to regain the \nconfidence of the American people.\n  We have a long way to go, but I believe that if we can move in a \nregular, orderly way to go to conference, which is what my civics book \nalways told me we are supposed to do next--the House passes a bill, the \nSenate passes a bill, they have differences, they go to conference, \nthey resolve the differences, both Houses then vote, and it goes to the \nPresident. That is the way the system was designed. If we could do \nthat, almost regardless of what the content of the budget is, that in \nitself would electrify the country. It would be so remarkable, and \npeople would say: Oh, now they are finally doing something.\n  So I hope my colleagues on the other side will decide to engage, to \nallow the conference to go forward with Members of both parties who go \nover to the House and sit down and try to work something out. We all \nknow what the issues are. We all know what the amounts are. We all know \nwhat the dollars are.\n  I believe that people who enter a room in good faith could solve this \nin about an afternoon if they left their ideological blinders at the \ndoor. I believe there are solutions to be had, and we have a \nresponsibility to find them. But today we can't even begin to talk \nabout it, and that is what is so puzzling to the American people. That \nis what is puzzling to me. I don't understand what is wrong with \ndebating, what is wrong with working on the problem. And to just say: \nOh, well, we can't do it; the sequester is going to be with us, and it \nis going to be with us for another couple of years--I think that \ndoesn't meet our fundamental responsibility as people who came here to \ngovern.\n  We all know there was something passed last year about no budget, no \npay. Well, unfortunately, it only said that if you pass a budget in the \nHouse, they get it, and if you pass a budget--well, we have done that. \nIt should have been no budget that finally gets done, no pay, because \nnow we are just stuck at an impasse.\n  I don't know what the outcome of the negotiations would be. I am not \nsure I would like them. But I believe the real task before us today is \nnot budgets and deficits. The question before us is, Is this experiment \nin democracy that is an aberration in world history, is it still \nworking? Are we able to make this idea work in the 21st century and \nmeet the challenges of this country? It seems to me the only way to \nbegin that process is to talk and debate and argue and work through the \nprocess the Framers gave us in order to solve the problems of the \ncountry.\n  I hope that before long we will reach a point where all of us can \nagree in this body that it is time to go to work on trying to bring a \nbudget back to both Houses that we can all support and move this \ncountry forward. The act of at least coming up with a solution--not a \nperfect solution but a solution--would be the most important gift we \ncould provide today to the people of this country.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, a few weeks ago the chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee, Senator Baucus of Montana, warned that the \nPresident's premier domestic legislative accomplishment--ObamaCare--was \nturning into a huge train wreck. Now, that is pretty remarkable for a \nnumber of reasons, one of which is that Senator Baucus was one of the \nprincipal authors of ObamaCare. So his comments cannot be dismissed as \nsimply partisan rhetoric or politics as usual.\n  A few days after he made those comments, another important \ncontributor to ObamaCare, Dr. Zeke Emanuel, brother of Rahm Emanuel, \nthe President's former Chief of Staff, acknowledged that the massive \nuncertainty generated by the health care law is already causing \ninsurance premiums to go up. Here is the scary part: ObamaCare hasn't \nactually been fully implemented and won't be until next year, 2014. So \nwhen it does take effect in 2014, we can expect insurance premiums to \ncontinue to rise, particularly for young people who are being asked \nonce again to subsidize their elders, this time in the context of \nhealth care premiums.\n  So much for the President's promise that the average family of four \nwould see a reduction in their insurance premiums under his premier \nhealth care law by $2,500. That is right. If people remember, the \nPresident said: If you like what you have, you can keep it, which is \nproving not to be true as employers are going to be shedding the \nemployer-provided coverage and dropping their employees into the \nexchange. He also said the average family of four would see a reduction \nin their health care costs of $2,500. Neither one of these is proving \nto be true.\n  It gets worse from there. According to a new study, there is a new \ntax that\n\n[[Page S3233]]\n\nwas created by ObamaCare on insurance premiums. So we have to pay a tax \non our insurance premiums too, which will reduce private sector \nemployment anywhere from 146,000 jobs to 262,000 jobs by the year \n2022. And, of course, the majority of those jobs will be in small \nbusinesses. It is not surprising, since small businesses are actually \nthe engine of job creation in America, that they will be \ndisproportionately hit.\n\n  To make matters worse, ObamaCare's looming employer regulations are \nalready prompting businesses to lay off workers, to reduce their \nworking hours, and transform many full-time jobs into part-time jobs \njust so they can avoid the penalties and the sanctions in ObamaCare for \nemployers.\n  Last month alone the number of Americans doing part-time work \n``because their hours had been cut back or because they were unable to \nfind a full-time job'' increased by 278,000--more than a quarter \nmillion Americans. Indeed, the total number of involuntary part-time \nworkers was higher in April 2013 than it was in April 2012, just a year \nbefore.\n  So the message for President Obama could not be any more obvious: His \nsignature domestic legislative initiative is driving up health care \ncosts, destroying jobs, and damaging our economic recovery. That is why \nit is so important we repeal this law, which I will grant the President \nhis best intentions but in practice has shown to be the opposite of \nwhat he promised in so many different instances.\n  But the consequences on long-term unemployment are what most people \nwill feel; and that is the story of a very human tragedy for many \npeople, some of whom have just simply given up looking for work. In \nfact, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has something called the labor \nparticipation rate. You can search it on the Internet. Look under \n``labor participation rate.'' It will reveal that the percentage of \nAmericans actually in the workforce and looking for work is at a 30-\nyear low.\n  What that means is some people have simply given up. We all know the \nlonger you are out of work, the harder it is to find a job because your \nskills have gotten rusty. Others may, in fact, be more qualified to get \na job opening if one presents itself.\n  I cannot imagine the pain and frustration felt by millions of \nAmericans who have been jobless for more than half a year. That is a \nlong time. Unfortunately, the President does not seem to have an answer \nto this unemployment crisis--and that is exactly what it is--other than \nmore taxes, after he got $620 billion in January as a result of the \nfiscal cliff negotiations, the expiration of temporary tax provisions. \nThe President seems to believe more spending--even after his failed \nstimulus of a $1 trillion, which ratcheted up the debt even more--and \nmore regulations is the answer to the unemployment crisis: more taxes, \nmore spending, more regulations.\n  Since the President has taken office, he has raised taxes by $1.7 \ntrillion already. That includes the $620 billion I just mentioned--but \n$1.7 trillion. His policies have increased our national debt by $6.2 \ntrillion. He has added another $518 billion worth of costly new \nregulations on the very people we are depending on to create the jobs \nand provide employment opportunities. The consequence is the longest \nperiod of high unemployment since the Great Depression.\n  Now for some good news: Tomorrow the President is traveling to Texas, \nto the city of Austin where my family and I live. According to Forbes \nmagazine, Austin is one of America's 10 Best Cities for Good Jobs. In \nfact, half of the top 10 Best Cities for Good Jobs in America include \nDallas, Fort Worth, Houston, and San Antonio. So, yes, I am bragging. \nBut we must be doing something right, and I hope the President goes \nwith an open mind to try to learn what is the cause of the Texas \nmiracle when it comes to job creation and economic growth.\n  Let me just point out that for 8 consecutive years Texas has been \nranked as the best State for business by Chief Executive magazine. That \nexplains why between 2002 and 2011 Texas accounted for almost one-third \nof all private sector job growth in America--one-third--many of these \nin high-paying industries. I know we like the claim about being big, \nbut we are only 8 percent of the population, and we accounted for one-\nthird of all of the U.S. private sector job growth between 2002 and \n2011.\n  Now, there is not a secret sauce or a secret formula. It is pretty \nclear why we have enjoyed that sort of job growth in America, and it is \nsomething I think the rest of the country could learn. It is low taxes \non the very people we are depending upon to create jobs; it is limited \ngovernment; it is the belief in the free enterprise system as the best \npathway to achieve the American dream; and it is sensible regulations.\n  We also believe in taking advantage of the abundant natural resources \nwe have in our State and using those resources to expand the domestic \nenergy supply, to bring down costs for consumers, and to create jobs in \nthe process.\n  I was recently in the Permian Basin--that is the Midland-Odessa \nregion, as the Presiding Officer knows. This is an area that since 1920 \nhas been one of the most prolific energy-producing regions of our State \nand the country. But because of new drilling technology--horizontal \ndrilling and fracking--it is anticipated that from this point forward \nthat region will produce as much as it has since 1920. That is amazing. \nThat is something we ought to be very excited about, and it has created \na lot of jobs.\n  The nominal unemployment rate in the Permian Basin is about 3.2 \npercent. But employers will tell you they are hiring everybody they can \nget their hands on. Some of these folks have had problems in the past \nthat might otherwise disqualify them for work, but as one employer told \nme: There is nothing like a job to provide an opportunity for people to \nrehabilitate themselves and get themselves on the right track.\n  Well, President Obama's policies, in contrast to what we are seeing \nin Texas, seem to send the message that only Washington knows how to \nrevive our economy, and by raising taxes and spending more money we do \nnot have to boot. In other words, with all due respect to my colleagues \nfrom the west coast, he favors the California model. Unfortunately, \nthat model has not worked too well for even our friends in California, \nand it will not work well for the rest of America either.\n  By comparison, in that laboratory of democracy known as the State of \nTexas, our State has become a powerhouse for job creation, and it would \ngo a long way to restoring the fiscal and economic health of the United \nStates. Yes it would help those people who have been unemployed for 6 \nmonths or more, or even a shorter period of time, find work that will \nhelp them regain their sense of dignity and productivity and allow them \nto provide for their families, which is a goal I know we all share.\n\n\n                       Nomination of Thomas Perez\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, on another matter--but it is an important \nmatter--I want to share a few words and a few observations about the \nPresident's nominee to be the Secretary of the Department of Labor, who \nis currently serving in the Justice Department. I am talking about \nAssistant Attorney General Thomas Perez.\n  Of course, we know the Department of Labor plays a very significant \nrole in our economic policy and even U.S. immigration policy, which is \na very controversial topic that we are just getting to take up tomorrow \nin the Senate Judiciary Committee, of which I am a member.\n  During his tenure at the Justice Department, Mr. Perez has been in \ncharge of the Civil Rights Division, which includes the Voting \nSection--obviously, a very important responsibility, but one that ought \nto eschew politics. Unfortunately, under his watch as head of the Civil \nRights Division and Voting Section, that section has compiled a \ndisturbing record of political discrimination and selective enforcement \nof our laws--something antithetical to what we consider to be one of \nthe best things we have going for us in America, which is the rule of \nlaw: that all of us, no matter who we are, are subject to the same \nrules and play by those rules.\n  You do not have to take my word for it--how the Voting Section and \nthe Civil Rights Division have gotten dangerously off track under Mr. \nPerez's leadership. The Department of Justice inspector general \npublished a 258-page report that said the Voting Section\n\n[[Page S3234]]\n\nunder Mr. Perez's leadership had become so politicized and so \nunprofessional that at times it became simply dysfunctional, it could \nnot function properly.\n  This 258-page report by the Department of Justice inspector general \ncited ``deep ideological polarization,'' which began under his \npredecessors and which has continued under Mr. Perez's leadership. The \ninspector general said this polarization ``has at times been a \nsignificant impediment to the operation of the Section and has \nexacerbated the potential appearance of politicized decision-making.''\n  This is at the Department of Justice. So instead of upholding and \nenforcing all laws equally, the Department of Justice, Civil Rights \nDivision--the Voting Section--under Mr. Perez, has launched politically \nmotivated campaigns against commonsense constitutional laws, such as \nthe voter ID laws adopted by the States of Texas and South Carolina.\n  In addition, he delivered misleading testimony to the U.S. Commission \non Civil Rights back in 2010. The inspector general said Mr. Perez's \ntestimony about a prominent voting rights case ``did not reflect the \nentire story regarding the involvement of political appointees.'' So \nwhen you are not telling the whole truth, you are not telling the \ntruth.\n  Before joining the Department of Justice--and this is part of his \nunfortunate track record--he served as a local official in Montgomery \nCounty, MD. During those years, he consistently opposed the proper \nenforcement of our immigration laws. In fact, Mr. Perez testified \nagainst enforcement measures that were being considered by the Maryland \nState Legislature.\n  I would ask my colleagues, because we have an important function to \nplay under our constitutional system, one of advice and consent--that \nis the confirmation process for Presidential nominees--is this really \nthe type of person we want running the Department of Labor, especially \nat a time when Congress is contemplating passage of important \nimmigration reform laws?\n  Given his record, I am concerned Mr. Perez does not have the \ntemperament or the competence we need in our Secretary of the \nDepartment of Labor. I fear that, just like he has at the Department of \nJustice, he would invariably politicize the Department of Labor and \nimpose ideological litmus tests. For all these reasons, and more, I \nwill oppose his nomination.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/08/senate-section/article/S3234-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3234-S3239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF THOMAS PEREZ\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to express my \ndeep disappointment that once again Republican obstructionism and \nprocedural tricks are preventing this body from carrying out its \nconstitutional duty and responsibility, its obligation to consider \nimportant Presidential nominations.\n  This time the target is Mr. Tom Perez, the President's extremely \nqualified nominee to be Secretary of Labor.\n  The HELP Committee, which I chair, was scheduled to vote on his \nnomination at 4 o'clock this afternoon. Obviously, we are not doing \nthat. An anonymous Republican has invoked an obscure procedural rule to \nprevent our committee from meeting at that scheduled time. This \npointless obstructionism is extremely disturbing.\n  I would like to point out that we had previously been scheduled to \nvote on his nomination in my committee 2 weeks ago. In an effort to \nbend over backwards and to be accommodating to our colleagues who \nrequested more time to consider documents related to the nomination, I \ndeferred it for 2 weeks as sort of senatorial courtesy.\n  This time there is no allegation that they have had insufficient time \nfor consideration, just delay for delay's sake on the nomination. Tom \nPerez has been before our committee since March. We have had our \nhearing, during which Mr. Perez fully answered all questions posed to \nhim. I cut off no one. I allowed anyone to ask whatever questions they \nwanted.\n  Mr. Perez has met with any interested Senator personally and answered \nover 200 written questions for the record. It is an understatement to \nsay his nomination has been thoroughly vetted. This continuing delay is \nunconscionable and only hurts the American workers and businesses that \nrely on the Department of Labor each and every day.\n  As our country continues to move down the road to economic recovery, \nthe work of the Department of Labor is becoming even more vital to the \nlives of our working families. Whether it is making sure workers get \npaid the wages they deserve, helping returning veterans reenter the \nworkforce, protecting our seniors' retirement nest eggs, ensuring that \na new mother can care for her baby without losing her job, the \nDepartment of Labor helps families build the cornerstones of a middle-\nclass life.\n  Now more than ever we need strong leadership at the Department to \nhelp strengthen our fragile recovery and build a stronger and \nrevitalized American middle class. That is why this nomination is so \nimportant.\n  There has been a lot of public discussion about Mr. Perez but \nremarkably little of it has focused on what should be the central \nquestion before our committee today: Will Tom Perez be a good Secretary \nof Labor. The answer is unequivocally yes. Without question, he has the \nknowledge and experience needed to guide this critically important \nagency.\n  Through his professional experiences, and especially his work as \nSecretary of the Maryland Department of Labor, Licensing and \nRegulation, he has developed strong policy expertise about the many \nimportant issues for American workers and businesses that come before \nthe Department of Labor every day. He spearheaded major initiatives on \npotentially controversial issues, such as unemployment insurance reform \nand worker misclassification, while finding common ground between \nworkers and businesses to build sensible, commonsense solutions.\n  He also clearly has the management skills to run a large Federal \nagency effectively. He was also an effective manager and a responsible \nsteward of public resources, undertaking significant administrative and \norganizational reforms that made the Maryland DLLR more efficient and \nmore effective.\n  His outstanding work in Maryland has won him the support of the \nbusiness community and worker advocates alike. To quote from the \nendorsement letter of the Maryland Chamber of Commerce:\n\n       Mr. Perez proved himself to be a pragmatic public official \n     who was willing to bring differing voices together. The \n     Maryland Chamber had the opportunity to work with Mr. Perez \n     on an array of issues of importance to employers in Maryland, \n     from unemployment and workforce development to the housing \n     and foreclosure crisis. Despite differences of opinion, Mr. \n     Perez was always willing to allow all parties to be heard, \n     and we found him to be fair and collaborative. I believe that \n     our experiences with him here in Maryland bode well for the \n     nation. That is a pretty strong endorsement by a chamber of \n     commerce for a nominee whom the minority leader today on \n     the floor characterized as a ``crusading ideologue . . . \n     willing to do or say anything to achieve his ideological \n     ends.'' That is how he was characterized by the Republican \n     leader today, but the Maryland Chamber of Commerce didn't \n     seem to think so. So that grossly unfair characterization \n     by the Republican leader is manifestly inconsistent with \n     the experiences of the Republican leaders and businesses \n     that have actually worked with Tom Perez.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nletters from businesses and Republican leaders demonstrating the strong \nbipartisan support for Mr. Perez's nomination. These people clearly \ndisagree with the Republican leader's assessment of Mr. Perez's \nqualifications and character.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                   March 19, 2013.\n\n Joint Statement From State Attorneys General in Support of Nomination \n         of Tom Perez as Secretary of U.S. Department of Labor\n\n       ``Tom Perez is a brilliant lawyer and leader, who listens \n     thoughtfully to all sides and\n\n[[Page S3235]]\n\n     works collaboratively to solve problems.

Barack Obama,\n     President of the United States, The White House, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear President Obama: The Maryland Chamber of Commerce \n     supports the nomination of Thomas E. Perez to serve as the \n     United States Secretary of Labor.\n       During his tenure as Secretary of Maryland's Department of \n     Labor, Licensing and Regulation, Mr. Perez oversaw a wide \n     range of regulatory programs of critical importance to the \n     state's business community, including unemployment insurance, \n     the regulation of financial institutions, worker safety and \n     professional licensing.\n       Mr. Perez proved himself to be a pragmatic public official \n     who was willing to bring differing voices together. The \n     Maryland Chamber had the opportunity to work with Mr. Perez \n     on an array of issues of importance to employers in Maryland, \n     from unemployment and workforce development to the housing \n     and foreclosure crisis.\n       Despite differences of opinion, Mr. Perez was always \n     willing to allow all parties to be heard and we found him to \n     be fair and collaborative. I believe that our experiences \n     with him here in Maryland bode well for the nation.\n       The Maryland Chamber of Commerce is Maryland's leading \n     statewide business advocacy organization. Our 800 member \n     companies employ more than 442,000 people in the state. The \n     Chamber works to support its members and advance the State of \n     Maryland as a national and global competitive leader in \n     economic growth and private sector job creation through its \n     effective advocacy, high level networking and timely \n     communications.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           Kathleen T.

His \n     understanding that government must work in partnership with \n     business to find solutions that succeed in today's \n     marketplace highlights his continual accessibility and his \n     empathic approach to working with job creators nationwide.\n       We applaud the President's nomination of Tom Perez as \n     Secretary of Labor because we have experienced, first hand, \n     the fruits of Tom's open door policy and his steady approach \n     to finding solutions that work for the benefit of all.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  M.H.

While serving as Maryland's labor secretary, \n     Tom proved to be fair-minded, and always had an open door.\n       The Maryland Minority Contractors Association is composed \n     primarily of merit shops, so our member companies have \n     employees that are not under union collective bargaining \n     agreements. We found ourselves at the table with Tom on a \n     range of issues, from workplace safety to apprenticeships to \n     the proper classification of employees. Although our \n     perspectives often differed, we always had a seat at the \n     table, and I can confidently say that our perspective was \n     always taken into consideration. Tom pursues his role of \n     protecting workers with vigor, but he always took the \n     concerns of our members seriously, and, when presented with \n     sound arguments, was willing to compromise.\n       We strongly support the nomination of Tom Perez, and we \n     believe that he will make an excellent Secretary of Labor. He \n     is a smart, honest person who will serve our county well.\n                                                      Pless Jones,\n     President, Maryland Minority Contractors.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 Whiteman Osterman\n\n\n                                                  & Hanna LLP,\n\n                                       Albany, NY, April 15, 2013.\n                  Re Thomas Perez, Nominee for Secretary of Labor.\n     Sen. Thomas Harkin (D-IA),\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN),\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n       Dear Senators Harkin and Alexander: I write as an appointee \n     by former President George H.W. Bush to the United States \n     Department of Justice in support of Thomas Perez who has been \n     nominated by President Obama to serve as Secretary of Labor \n     and urge your favorable consideration of his candidacy.\n       As the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights (1990-\n     1993), I worked directly with Tom (in fact, I hired him in \n     1990) on a variety of sensitive matters, including criminal \n     and voting rights issues. During a number of face-to-face \n     meetings, I had the opportunity both to review his legal-\n     based memoranda and to engage in a number of intense debates \n     as to what should be the Division's final course of action. \n     As a result of those experiences, I found Tom to be an \n     excellent lawyer, a dedicated public servant with a deep \n     commitment to the common good, and a person of legal and \n     moral integrity; qualities that enable him to recognize the \n     value of contending parties' positions in order to achieve \n     workable solutions.\n       I believe that he will bring those skills and strong \n     personal qualities to the duties of the Secretary of Labor \n     and enable him to perform in a manner worthy of your trust.\n       Thank you for listening to my support for this very special \n     and patriotic man.\n           Respectfully yours,\n                                                    John R. Dunne.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Indeed, I think Mr. Perez's character--his character--is \nexactly what qualifies him for this job--his character.\n  Tom Perez has dedicated his life to making sure every American has a \nfair opportunity to pursue the American dream. At the Maryland \nDepartment of Labor, he revamped the State's adult education system so \nmore people could successfully train for better jobs and brighter \nfutures. As the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights at the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice, where he is right now, he has been a voice for \nthe most vulnerable, and he has reinvigorated the enforcement of some \nof our most critical civil rights laws. He has helped more Americans \nachieve the dream of home ownership through his unprecedented efforts \nto prevent residential lending discrimination. He has helped to ensure \nthat people with disabilities have the choice to live in their own \nhomes and communities rather than only in institutional settings and to \nmake sure people with disabilities receive the support and services \nthey need to make independent living possible. He has stepped up the \nDepartment's efforts to protect the employment rights of servicemembers \nso our men and women in uniform can return to their jobs and support \ntheir families after serving their country.\n  I can tell you that Tom Perez is passionate about these issues. He is \npassionate about justice and about fairness, and I believe these are \nqualities that Tom Perez learned at the hand of his former employer \nhere in the Senate, our former committee chairman of the HELP \nCommittee, Senator Ted Kennedy. But, as he explained in his \nconfirmation hearing, he also learned from Senator Kennedy ``that \nidealism and pragmatism are not mutually exclusive.'' Mr. Perez knows \nhow to bring people together to make progress on even controversial \nissues without burning bridges or making enemies. He knows how to hit \nthe ground running and quickly and effectively become an agent of real \nchange. That is exactly the kind of leadership we need at the \nDepartment of Labor. We need his vision, we need his passion, and we \nneed, yes, his character at the helm of this important agency.\n  Allow me to state very clearly that while I know there has been \ngenerated controversy--not real controversy but generated controversy--\nsurrounding Mr. Perez's nomination, there is absolutely nothing that \ncalls into question his ability to fairly enforce the law as it is \nwritten. There is absolutely nothing that calls into question his \nprofessional integrity or his moral character or his ability to lead \nthe Department of Labor.\n\n[[Page S3236]]\n\n  As I mentioned, Mr. Perez has been as open and aboveboard as he could \npossibly be throughout this entire confirmation process. He has met \nwith any Member personally who requested a meeting. As I said, he \nappeared before our committee in a public hearing. He has answered more \nthan 200 written questions. He has bent over backward to respond to any \nand all concerns raised about his work at the Department of Justice.\n  This administration--President Obama--has also been extraordinarily \naccommodating to any Republican colleague, especially to their concerns \nabout Mr. Perez's involvement in the global resolution of two cases \ninvolving the city of St. Paul, MN--Magner v. St. Paul and Newell v. \nSt. Paul. The administration has produced thousands of documents \nconcerning these two cases. They have arranged for the interview of \ngovernment employees. They have facilitated almost unprecedented levels \nof disclosure to alleviate any concern about his involvement in these \ncases.\n  As chairman of the committee, I have also tried to be as \naccommodating as possible, joining in requests for documents that I, \nquite frankly, thought were unnecessary but willing to acquire and \npostponing the executive session for 2 weeks to provide Members \nadditional time for consideration.\n  All this extensive process has revealed is that Mr. Perez acted at \nall times ethically and appropriately to advance the interests of the \nU.S. Government. For example, with respect to the Magner and Newell \nmatters, Mr. Perez consulted with both outside ethics and professional \nresponsibility experts at the Department of Justice, and Mr. Perez \nacted within their guidelines at all times. It is no surprise that \noutside ethics experts have confirmed that Mr. Perez acted \nappropriately in these matters.\n  I would like to submit again for the Record letters and statements \nfrom several legal ethics experts and experts in the False Claims Act \nconfirming that Mr. Perez's handling of the Magner and Newell cases was \nboth ethical and appropriate. And I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record these letters.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Statement of Stephen Gillers, Elihu Root Professor of Law, New York \n                 University School of Law, May 6, 2013\n\n       The Joint Staff Report makes many assertions and contains \n     many factual allegations, which may or may not be contested. \n     However, only one issue is described as ethical. It is this \n     issue that the Democratic Staff memo mainly addresses. Stated \n     most favorably from the Joint Staff perspective, the issue \n     is:\n       ``Assuming that Assistant Attorney General Tomas E. Perez \n     (Civil Rights Division) was mainly responsible for reaching \n     the agreement with the City of St. Paul described below--even \n     assuming that the agreement would not have happened without \n     his intervention--but assuming, too, that Assistant Attorney \n     General Tony West (Civil Division), who had ultimate \n     authority to decide whether or not to intervene in Newell and \n     Ellis, chose not to do so after considering their merits, the \n     United States interest in preserving the disparate impact \n     test under the Fair Housing Act, and the U.S. interest in \n     ensuring (so far as possible) that a Supreme Court ruling on \n     the proper test be based on favorable facts, did Perez \n     violate any rule of professional conduct (ethics rule) \n     governing him as a lawyer by encouraging others at DOJ or HUD \n     (or elsewhere) to refrain from intervention in Newell and \n     Ellis in exchange for St. Paul's agreement to withdraw the \n     Magner appeal?''\n       The Joint Staff Report argues that linking the two cases--\n     withdrawal of the Magner appeal and U.S. non-intervention in \n     the two Qui Tam actions, Newell and Ellis (hereafter \n     Newell)--was unethical. However, it cites no professional \n     conduct rule, no court decision, no bar ethics opinion, and \n     no secondary authority that supports this argument. In fact, \n     no authority supports it.\n       The duty of lawyers for the United States is no different \n     from the duty of lawyers generally, namely to pursue the \n     goals of their client within the bounds of law and ethics. \n     Clients generally identify those goals, but when the client \n     is the government, its lawyers often do so, sometimes in \n     conjunction with agencies, elected officials, or other \n     representatives of the government who are authorized to speak \n     for the client.\n       The United States had interests in Magner and also in \n     Newell. Qui Tam actions are brought to vindicate interests of \n     the sovereign, here the U.S. The U.S. interest was to recover \n     money assuming, of course, that Newell had merit. The U.S. \n     interest in Magner was to avoid Supreme Court review of a \n     legal issue in Magner, whose facts were seen as unfavorable \n     to a decision that would sustain a disparate impact test for \n     violations of the Fair Housing Act. Perez believed that \n     preserving the disparate impact test was important to his \n     client and more important than intervention in Newell.\n       I assume that Perez persuaded others with decision-making \n     authority, and in particular West, that withdrawing the \n     Magner appeal was more important to U.S. interests than \n     intervention in Newell. I also assume, though it is \n     contested, that Newell was meritorious and that but for the \n     agreement with St. Paul, the United States would have \n     intervened in Newell and perhaps prevailed.\n       Of course, it is legitimate to argue that Perez, West, and \n     others made the wrong choice and that pursuing Newell was \n     more important to U.S. interests than how the Supreme Court \n     would ultimately resolve the issue in Magner. I have no view \n     on that question. It is not an ethical question. The question \n     I can answer is whether Perez could ethically make the \n     decision he did and which he encouraged others to accept. \n     Could he ethically decide, when faced with a situation where \n     only one of two possible choices could be made, and where \n     each choice offered a benefit to his client, to choose option \n     A over option B?\n       The answer is unequivocally yes. Perez was not choosing to \n     advantage one client over another client. There was no \n     conflict here between the interests of two clients because \n     there was only one client. That client, we are assuming, had \n     two interests--withdrawal of Magner or intervention in \n     Newell--but under the circumstances, it could pursue only \n     one. Perez made a choice between these options and encouraged \n     others to agree. His conduct violates no ethical rule that \n     governs lawyers. He was acting in what he believed to be the \n     best interests of his client, which is what lawyers are \n     required to do.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          The Vernia Law Firm,\n\n                                       Washington DC, May 6, 2013.\n     Re Declination by the United States Department of Justice in \n         United States ex rel.

Jordan, Cartwright, Franks, and Nadler:\n       I am writing in advance of the Committee's May 7, 2013 \n     hearing regarding the Department of Justice's declination of \n     the False Claims Act qui tam cases, United States ex rel. \n     Newell v. City of St. Paul, Minnesota, Civil No. 09-SC-001177 \n     (D.Minn.), and United States ex rel. Ellis v. City of St. \n     Paul, Civil No. 11CV-0416 (D.Minn.), to provide my comments \n     on certain of the conclusions reached in the Joint Staff \n     Report, DOJ's Quid Pro Quo with St. Paul: How Assistant \n     Attorney General Thomas Perez Manipulated Justice and Ignored \n     the Rule of Law (April 15, 2013). I appreciate the \n     opportunity to address the Committee.\n       For most of my twenty years practicing law, I have handled \n     investigations and cases brought under the False Claims Act, \n     31 Sec. U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 3729, et seq. Early in my career, I \n     served for eight years as a Trial Attorney in the Fraud \n     Section of the Commercial Litigation Branch of the Department \n     of Justice's Civil Division. In that capacity, I handled \n     dozens of False Claims Act cases involving numerous federal \n     agencies, including the Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development (HUD). I left the Fraud Section to be a \n     prosecutor in the Criminal Division where, in 2005 I received \n     a John Marshall Award from the Department of Justice, and the \n     National Exploited Children's Award from the National Center \n     for Missing and Exploited Children.\n       That same year, I joined Covington & Burling LLP, initially \n     focusing on the defense of False Claims Act investigations \n     and suits. I started my own firm in 2009, in part to have the \n     flexibility of representing whistleblower clients as well as \n     defendants. I have filed numerous qui tam suits, and I am now \n     litigating some of those, including a major case against a \n     long-term care pharmacy for prescriptions reimbursed by \n     Medicare Part D. In addition to my work on these cases, I \n     have made presentations on the False Claims Act and related \n     statutes, and I write the best-read legal blog on the topic, \n     www.falseclaimscounsei.com.\n       I have had no professional involvement in the Newell or \n     Ellis cases, and have not spoken about them with any of the \n     persons described in the Joint Staff Report. I have, however, \n     reviewed that Report, its attached documents, the Democratic \n     Staff's Report on the same topic (April 14, 2013), and \n     certain of the documents publicly available on the District \n     Court for the District of Minnesota's PACER website.\n\n[[Page S3237]]\n\n       As one of the few attorneys in private practice with \n     significant Department of Justice experience who represents \n     both defendants and whistleblowers, I read these documents \n     with great interest. With all due respect to the Joint Staff, \n     however, I feel compelled to write to take issue with certain \n     of their factual conclusions. I will limit my comments to \n     those that I feel are critical to assessing the conduct of \n     Department of Justice officials involved in these cases.\n\n\n                       Merits of the Newell case\n\n       Because the documents do not treat the Ellis case as a \n     significant factor in the Department's decision-making, I \n     have not undertaken to analyze the merits of that matter. Let \n     me also preface my remarks by stating that I do not intend \n     this letter to disparage Mr. Newell or his counsel. The \n     Department of Justice appears to have largely corroborated \n     his allegations and his qui tam complaint is well-drafted.\n       I disagree, however, with the Joint Staff's conclusion that \n     ``The Department of Justice Sacrificed a Strong Case Alleging \n     a Particularly Egregious Example of Fraud.'' See Joint Staff \n     Report at 37. Instead, I believe that the documents evidence \n     significant bases for skepticism by Department of Justice \n     officials.\n       The Joint Staff's conclusion rests in large part on its \n     rejection of statements by Department of Justice supervisors \n     that whether or not to intervene in Newell was a ``close \n     call,'' and its reliance instead on earlier positions in \n     support of intervention taken by the trial attorney and \n     others assigned to the case. But the draft memorandum urging \n     intervention acknowledges several significant potential \n     problems with the case--problems that clearly rebut the \n     conclusion that the case was a ``strong'' one, as the Joint \n     Staff asserts.\n       Newell's most prominent weakness was the potential \n     difficulty in proving that St. Paul's noncompliance with \n     Section 3 was material to the decision of HUD to make grant \n     payments. The trial attorney handling the case candidly \n     admitted that there was litigation risk regarding \n     materiality:\n       ``The City will argue that even if HUD did not say it \n     explicitly, HUD's silence over many years is tacit approval. \n     We will have to admit that the City was failing to comply \n     with Section 3 in ways that should have been apparent to HUD. \n     The City did not send its HUD 60002 forms each year. HUD \n     never objected to this failure. The City will argue that HUD \n     was so unconcerned with Section 3 compliance that the City's \n     failure to comply did not affect, or could not have affected \n     HUD's decision to pay.\n       ``The City will argue that HUD's failure to monitor its \n     Section 3 compliance was consistent with HUD's general lack \n     of oversight of Section 3 during the relevant period. The \n     city has already noted that previous federal administrations \n     were not concerned with Section 3 (a position with support in \n     recent HUD comments), and that it is unfair to require a City \n     to make boilerplate certification each year, ignore the \n     City's non-compliance year-after-year, and then seek FCA \n     relief when a new administration comes in that is more \n     concerned with compliance with Section 3.\n       Draft Intervention Memo at 7. Although the trial attorney \n     was optimistic that these arguments could be overcome, there \n     can be no doubt that significant concerns about proving \n     materiality of the City's noncompliance were evident long \n     before the alleged quid pro quo.\n\n\n Reliability of the Draft Intervention Memorandum's Damages Calculation\n\n       I also respectfully disagree with the Joint Staff's \n     assertion that the Department of Justice's decision to \n     intervene in the case cost taxpayers a significant \n     opportunity to recover over $200 million. See Joint Staff \n     Report at 61. This, too, significantly overstates the \n     strength of Newell.\n       The draft intervention memo very briefly describes only one \n     damages theory, which the trial attorney characterizes as \n     ``aggressive'': that the damages under the False Claims Act \n     were the entire amount of the Section 3 construction project \n     grants (which was some unknown fraction of the overall $86 \n     million in HUD grants). That ``aggressive'' theory is an \n     unsettled area of law, however, and the Joint Staff's \n     reliance on it in calculating the cost to taxpayers of \n     declining to intervene in the suit is dubious.\n       For much of the False Claims Act's 150-year history, \n     computing damages was relatively straightforward: the fact-\n     finder calculated the difference between what the Government \n     actually paid and the value of the goods or services it \n     received. See United States v. Bornstein, 423 U.S. 303, 316 \n     n. 13 (1976). When a third-party, and not the Government is \n     the intended recipient of the tangible benefit from the \n     outlay of federal funds, this approach arguably breaks down. \n     The traditional ``benefit-of-the-bargain'' approach is \n     strained further when the false claim relates not to quality \n     of the goods or services received by the third-party, but to \n     the fund recipient's satisfaction of some other condition \n     intended to benefit society more generally. The Newell case \n     falls into this category: the city receives Section 3 funds \n     to improve housing, and allegedly false claims relate to its \n     compliance with a condition unrelated to the quality of that \n     work.\n       The Courts have struggled with these issues, and four \n     Courts of Appeals--for the Second, Fifth, Seventh, and Ninth \n     Circuits--have chosen to follow the ``aggressive'' approach \n     the trial attorney described. The District of Columbia and \n     Third Circuits instead continue to employ the ``benefit-of-\n     the-bargain'' approach, which might result in a very low \n     damages calculation in a case such as Newell. I am not aware \n     of any controlling precedent on this issue in the Eighth \n     Circuit, in whose jurisdiction Newell was filed.\n       Given the unsettled nature of this area and the imprecision \n     in the Draft Intervention Memorandum's damages figure, $86 \n     million represented only a theoretical upper limit on the \n     Government's damages for St. Paul's alleged violations. The \n     Department of Justice trial attorney acknowledged the \n     limitations of this approach, writing in the Draft \n     Intervention Memorandum: ``We acknowledge this is an \n     aggressive position, and that some less aggressive approach \n     may be needed for trial. To date, however, we have not yet \n     determined an alternative approach.'' Id. at 5.\n       Even if the Department of Justice had intervened and \n     secured a judgment against the City on False Claims Act \n     liability, moreover, there is a significant risk that the \n     District Court or the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit \n     would, under the facts of this case (including HUD's apparent \n     disregard of Section 3 enforcement, and the defendant's \n     status as a taxpayer-funded entity) reject the ``aggressive'' \n     approach of seeking to recoup all Section 3 grants. Such a \n     decision would hinder the Government and relators in future \n     False Claims Act cases in the Eighth Circuit's jurisdiction.\n\n\n      The Risk of Newell's Dismissal on Public Disclosure Grounds\n\n       The Joint Staff Report also criticizes the Department's \n     declination on the grounds that it exposed Mr. Newell to \n     dismissal of his qui tam suit on grounds that the Court \n     lacked jurisdiction under the False Claims Act's public \n     disclosure bar. See Joint Staff Report at 58; 31 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3730(e)(4)(A) (2010). I respectfully disagree with the \n     premise of this criticism, which is that the Department of \n     Justice does, or should, evaluate the potential success of a \n     motion to dismiss on public disclosure grounds.\n       In my experience, both at the Department and in private \n     practice, the Government does not typically investigate the \n     common grounds on which declined qui tam suits founder: \n     public disclosure and particularity under Fed. R. Civ. P. \n     9(b). Although I, as a whistleblower attorney, would prefer \n     that the Department investigate these possible grounds for \n     dismissal prior to deciding whether to decline or intervene a \n     case, there are sound reasons for not doing so: the \n     Department of Justice has inadequate resources to investigate \n     the merits of the fraud allegations; routinely investigating \n     the public disclosures that might lead to the dismissal of a \n     declined qui tam would ultimately detract from the \n     Department's ability to carry out the False Claims Act's core \n     mission of detecting and remedying fraud.\n       Certainly no one has done more than Senator Grassley to \n     encourage whistleblowers to assist the Government in \n     uprooting fraud. The recent amendment to the public \n     disclosure bar demonstrates well his interest in improving \n     enforcement of the Act. I nevertheless believe that Congress \n     could best improve whistleblowers' involvement in fraud \n     enforcement by addressing more significant problems besetting \n     them (such as the application of Fed. R. Civ, P. 9(b) to \n     False Claims Act complaints, which is by far the most common \n     grounds for dismissal of declined qui tam cases).\n       In conclusion, after reviewing the publicly available \n     materials on the Department of Justice's decision to decline \n     to intervene in United States ex rel. Newell v. City of St. \n     Paul, I believe that Department officials acted well within \n     the scope of their discretion in declining to intervene in \n     that case. I must respectfully disagree with the contrary \n     conclusions the Joint Staff reached in its Report. I \n     appreciate your consideration.\n           Truly yours,\n     Benjamin J.

For over ten years, \n     we have assiduously represented whistleblowers in legal \n     actions brought pursuant the federal False Claims Act, 31 \n     U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 3729, et seq., and its state counterparts in \n     federal and state courts throughout the country. We regularly \n     engage in the evaluation of the viability of\n\n[[Page S3238]]\n\n     potential claims under those statutes and work with relators \n     to combat fraud against the government. We have been asked by \n     committee staff to offer our opinion regarding the effect of \n     the Department of Justice's decision to decline to intervene \n     in the qui tam cases of United States ex rel. Newell v. City \n     of St. Paul and United States ex rel. Ellis v. City of \n     Minneapolis, et al. What follows is that opinion.\n       On May 19, 2009, Relator Frederick Newell filed his qui tam \n     action under the federal False Claims Act against the City of \n     St. Paul in the United States District Court for the District \n     of Minnesota. On February 9, 2012, the Department of Justice \n     advised the court that it declined to intervene in the case. \n     On March 12, 2012, Mr. Newell filed an amended complaint in \n     response to which the City of St. Paul filed a motion to \n     dismiss based, in part, on the Public Disclosure Bar.\n       At the time that Mr. Newell filed his initial complaint in \n     his action, the False Claims Act provided a jurisdictional \n     bar to a relator's qui tam action commonly referred to as the \n     Public Disclosure Bar. Subsequently amended and rendered a \n     non-jurisdictional basis for dismissal in the Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, this section, 31 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 3730(e)(4), provided as follows:\n       ``(A) No court shall have jurisdiction over an action under \n     this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations \n     or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative \n     hearing, in a congressional, administrative, or Government \n     Accounting Office report, hearing, audit, or investigation, \n     or from the news media, unless the Attorney General or the \n     person bringing the action is an original source of the \n     information.\n       ```(B) For purposes of this paragraph, `original source' \n     means an individual who has direct and independent knowledge \n     of the information on which the allegations are based and has \n     voluntarily provided the information to the Government before \n     filing an action under this section which is based on the \n     information.''\n       On July 20, 2012, the court granted St. Paul's motion to \n     dismiss, finding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction \n     over Mr. Newell's action because of manifold public \n     disclosures of his allegations predating the filing of his \n     complaint and because he was not an original source of the \n     information on which the allegations were based. Mr. Newell \n     has appealed the dismissal of his case and his appeal is \n     currently pending before the United States Court of Appeals \n     for the 8th Circuit.\n       On February 18, 2011, Relators Andrew Ellis, Harriet Ellis \n     and Michael Blodgett filed their qui tam action under the \n     federal False Claims Act against, among others, the Cities of \n     Minneapolis and St. Paul in the United States District Court \n     for the District of Minnesota. On June 18, 2012, the \n     Department of Justice filed a Notice of Election to Decline \n     Intervention. The defendants in that case subsequently filed \n     motions to dismiss the Relators' complaints, which the court \n     denied without prejudice. That case remains pending as of the \n     date of this letter.\n       The effect of the government's decision not to intervene in \n     these two qui tam cases is central to the issues presently \n     being considered by your subcommittees. Indeed, it is \n     important to understand that, contrary to conclusory \n     statements set forth in the Congressional Committees' Joint \n     Staff Report of April 15, 2013, the decision by the \n     Department of Justice not to intervene in Mr. Newell's case \n     did not allow the City of St. Paul to move for dismissal of \n     the case ``on grounds that would have otherwise been \n     unavailable if the Department had intervened.'' (Joint Staff \n     Report, p. 58). In fact, the same motion would have been \n     available to the City whether or not the government had \n     intervened in the case. In Rockwell Intl. Corp. v. United \n     States ex rel. Stone, 549 U.S. 457 (2007), the United States \n     Supreme Court rejected the argument that government \n     intervention provides jurisdiction to a Relator who is not an \n     original source. Even had the government intervened, Mr. \n     Newell would have been vulnerable to the exact same public \n     disclosure jurisdictional bar.\n       Likewise, in declining to intervene in Mr. Newell's qui tam \n     action, the Department of Justice did not ``give up the \n     opportunity to recover as much as $200 million.'' (Joint \n     Staff Report, p. 4). A declination of intervention has never \n     been recognized by any court as tantamount to the termination \n     of the government's right to pursue the claim asserted in the \n     action. In fact, the federal False Claims Act specifically \n     provides that if the government initially elects not to \n     proceed with the action, it may intervene at a later date \n     upon a showing of good cause. 31 U.S.C. Sec. 3730(c)(3). The \n     government can decline to intervene in one action and, after \n     that complaint is dismissed, decide to intervene in a \n     subsequently filed action. Or the government can institute \n     and pursue its own action under the False Claims Act. \n     Moreover, the dismissal of Mr. Newell's complaint does not \n     affect the government's ability to pursue the same claims \n     itself. Thus, in declining to intervene in the Newell and \n     Ellis actions, the government is not foreclosed from pursuing \n     the claims that Mr. Newell could no longer himself pursue or \n     to intervene at a later date in the Ellis action, nor is it \n     foreclosed from pursuing remedies that might be available \n     under any other statutory or regulatory provisions. In fact, \n     in declining to intervene in these actions, it ``gave up'' no \n     rights or opportunities whatsoever.\n       We trust that the foregoing sheds light on the effect of \n     the government's decision not to intervene in the Newell and \n     Ellis qui tam actions and that this letter is helpful to the \n     work of your committees.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n     Gary L. Azorsky.\n     Jeanne A. Markey.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. As Professor Stephen Gillers, who has taught legal ethics \nfor more than 30 years at New York University School of Law, wrote in \none of these letters, Mr. Perez's actions in these cases ``violate[d] \nno ethical rule that governs lawyers. He was acting in what he believed \nto be the best interests of his client, which is what lawyers are \nrequired to do.''\n  In short, Mr. Perez did his job at DOJ, and he did it well. When it \ncomes down to it, I think the fact that he did his job well is probably \nthe source of much of the generated controversy surrounding his \nnomination. Maybe some people just don't like Tom Perez precisely \nbecause he is passionate about enforcing our civil rights laws and has \nvigorously pursued such enforcement in his current position.\n  I take great issue with the minority leader's suggestion today that \nMr. Perez doesn't follow the law or believe that it applies to him. I \nwould respectfully suggest that the Republican leader needs to check \nhis facts. To the contrary, Tom Perez has had a remarkable career as a \nresult of a determination to make the promise of our civil rights \nstatutes a reality for everyday Americans. Maybe these are some of the \nsame laws that some colleagues sometimes would like to forget are on \nthe books, but these laws matter. Voting rights matter. Fair housing \nrights matter. The rights of people with disabilities matter. These \nlaws are part of what makes our country great. I am incredibly proud of \nthe work Mr. Perez has done at the Department of Justice to make those \nrights a reality after years of neglect. He should be applauded, not \nvilified, for the service he has provided to this country.\n  Mr. President, it almost seems that when Mr. Perez's name came up, \nthere was a controversy generated about these cases in St. Paul \ninvolving whistleblower types and that somehow he acted inappropriately \nand denied the government the ability to get back a couple hundred \nmillion dollars or so. That seemed to be a belief some of my colleagues \non the other side had. So we looked into it. We went through all the \ndocuments, all the e-mails, and thousands of pages, with ethics lawyers \nboth in the government and out. What we came up with was that Mr. Perez \nacted ethically and appropriately at all times. There is no ``there'' \nthere. So the facts belie the belief, but it seems that the belief \ncarries on and that somehow the belief trumps the facts.\n  Well, if some of my colleagues want to believe the worst about Tom \nPerez, they can believe that, but they have no facts to back it up. It \nis an unfounded belief. Is that what is going to guide this body in \napproving nominations for this President or any President--that if I \nbelieve something and I can get maybe some of my colleagues to join in \nand believe it, that is enough? That is sufficient to vilify a nominee, \nto try to tear him down?\n  What about the facts? Don't facts matter? Doesn't the record matter? \nOf course it does. And the facts, as proven time and time again, are \nthat Mr. Perez acted ethically and appropriately at the Department of \nJustice at all times and especially in the two cases--Magner v. St. \nPaul and Newell v. St. Paul. That has been clearly brought forth, that \nhe acted appropriately and ethically.\n  So I say to my colleagues on the other side, believe what you want, \nbut that belief, mistaken as it is, should not be used to tear down a \ngood person, to vilify a good person, to cast this person in a light \nwhich is totally false.\n  So, yes, Mr. President, there was an objection to our meeting today \nunder this obscure rule of the Senate, but we have rescheduled the \nmeeting for 1 week hence. So in 1 week we will meet again, and we will \nvote to report out the nomination of Tom Perez, and then we will come \nto the floor. Again, I hope that it won't be filibustered by my \nRepublican colleagues but that we will be able to vote up or down on \nMr. Perez based not upon what someone believes but what the facts are, \nwhat his record is, what his record has been both in local government, \nState government, and at the Department of Justice.\n\n[[Page S3239]]\n\n  When you look at that record, it is an exemplary record of unstinting \npublic service in the best interests of the civil rights and equal \nrights of our country. That is why, with his background, his \nexperience, and his dedication to fairness and justice, the fact that \nhe has actually worked in the Senate on the HELP Committee--the \ncommittee that has jurisdiction over the Department of Labor--gives \ntremendous weight to his background and insight into how to be a truly \ngreat Secretary of Labor.\n  So we will vote next week. I hope there are not other kinds of \nroadblocks--unfounded roadblocks--thrown into the path of his \nconfirmation. We will do everything we can to make sure this good \nperson takes his rightful place as our next Secretary of Labor.\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/08/senate-section/article/S3239-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3239-S3240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUESTS\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 133 submitted earlier today. I \nfurther ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be made and laid \nupon the table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Reserving the right to object, I will have a request \nwith another resolution momentarily, but I understand the resolution of \nmy friend from Utah. I believe this problem is broader than the one \ncited in his resolution. In fact, looking to the conduct of the \nPhiladelphia instance, I would prosecute that case to the fullest \nextent of the law. I think the conduct--or, more correctly, \nmisconduct--in that instance was absolutely despicable and abhorrent.\n  I am concerned about patient safety in a variety of areas. They may \nbe a small fraction of the total number of health care cases in this \ncountry, but anytime, anywhere patients are endangered or threatened by \ncriminal conduct or malpractice, people should be prosecuted and \ndisciplined to the full extent of the law. These cases shock and \nhorrify our sense of decency and we understand the responsibility of \nhealth care practitioners anywhere, anytime.\n  My resolution, which I intend to offer after the Senator from Utah \nconcludes his, will call upon our colleagues to condemn these actions \nin all health care settings, whether clinics, hospitals, nursing homes, \nor dental offices across the country.\n  So with that, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, this week in Philadelphia, a jury is \ndeliberating the case of Kermit Gosnell. That doctor has been charged \nand tried for some of the most gruesome atrocities ever encountered by \nthe American justice system.\n  As the grand jury opened its harrowing report:\n\n       This case is about a doctor who killed babies and \n     endangered women. What we mean is that he regularly and \n     illegally delivered live, viable babies in the third \n     trimester of pregnancy--and then murdered these newborns by \n     severing their spinal cords with scissors.\n\n  Yet according to defense attorneys, Dr. Gosnell is not a monster, not \na serial killer, not a predator of vulnerable mothers and their \nhelpless children. He is just an abortionist.\n  Mr. President, let me suspend my speech momentarily. I understand my \nfriend, the Senator from Connecticut, wishes to make a motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I wish to offer the resolution that I \nand Senator Boxer, who is a long-time champion of better health care \nfor the citizens of our country, and Senator Shaheen, expressing the \nsense of the Senate that these practices will not be tolerated in any \nsetting, regardless of personal beliefs about the type of health care \nbeing offered.\n  This resolution is broader than the resolution of the Senator from \nUtah. I understand and sympathize with the basic objectives which, as I \nunderstand it, are to improve health care generally and to make sure \nthe kinds of abuses being prosecuted in Philadelphia will not occur \nanywhere in this country.\n  I offer my resolution calling on the Senate to condemn such practices \nin all health care settings, be they clinics or hospitals, dental \noffices, anywhere in this country. They may be a small fraction and, \nhopefully, are a very small fraction, of the kinds of cases we would \nwant to condemn. But we should condemn them wherever they occur, not \njust in one instance, not just singling out one case, but everywhere, \nanytime.\n  I might add as a former U.S. attorney that while this case is before \nthe jury, I think we need to be very careful about what we say in a \npublic forum as respected as this one about the facts of that case and \nabout potentially prejudging the result. My understanding is the jury \nhas not yet come back. If the allegations are true--if the jury \nconcludes they have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt--then the \npunishment should certainly be sufficiently severe and serious to fit \nthose circumstances and well deserving of our condemnation. But equally \ndeserving of our condemnation are any circumstances where health care \npatients are put in danger, where safety is in peril, where the \nconsequences do damage, or threaten damage, to the recipients of health \ncare. Whatever the kind of health care, whatever we may think of it \npersonally in terms of the merits and the type of care provided, we \nought to condemn it, and that is the purpose and sense of the \nresolution I am offering.\n  So if I may, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of a Senate resolution expressing the sense of the Senate \nregarding all incidents of abusive, unsanitary, or illegal health care \npractices be condemned--the text is at the desk; and I ask that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Reserving the right to object, as my friend, the Senator \nfrom Connecticut, is aware, we have only just received the language of \nthis resolution in the last few minutes. Without having to read it \nclosely, I am reluctant to grant consent at this time. But I will say I \nam heartened, and I think all Americans should be heartened, and the \nentire pro-life movement should be heartened by the clear implication \nthat health regulations should be equitably applied and enforced on \nabortion clinics as they are on other health care facilities.\n\n  Part of the reason we fear that Dr. Gosnell's clinic, if, in fact, \nthe allegations are proven true, was not a rare outlier is that \nabortion clinics are generally held to the same safety standards as \nhospitals, ambulatory, surgical facilities, et cetera. So on that \nbasis, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, if I may continue my remarks which I started \na few moments ago.\n  According to his defense attorneys, then, Dr. Gosnell is not a \nmonster, not a serial killer, not a predator of helpless mothers and \ntheir children. He is just an abortionist. In this context, Dr. \nGosnell's alleged crimes were just abortions, and his facility, the so-\ncalled Women's Medical Society--reportedly strewn about with animal \nwaste, infectious instruments, and fetal remains--was not, as the grand \njury alleged, ``a baby charnel house.'' No, it was just a clinic.\n  His staff of allegedly unqualified, untrained frauds were not \ncoconspirators in the contract killing of newborns. No, they were just \nhealth care providers. And the failure of local health inspectors and \npolitical officials to investigate repeated claims of Dr. Gosnell's \nbarbarism was just a bureaucratic oversight--perhaps--or perhaps, as \nthe\n\n[[Page S3240]]\n\npanicked abortion industry would have us believe, Dr. Gosnell is an \noutlier, an outcast, nothing like the professional, competent, law-\nabiding late-term abortion providers around the country. But then again \nperhaps not.\n  Just a few weeks ago, a Planned Parenthood representative testified \nbefore the Florida State legislature and suggested that infants born \nalive during botched abortions might not be entitled to medical \nattention--in clear violation of Federal law, to say nothing of \nfundamental human rights and dignity. Even since then, undercover \nvideos have caught late-term abortion providers telling pregnant \nmothers that even if their babies are accidentally born alive during \nthe procedure, even if the law requires them to treat the newborn as a \npatient and citizen of the United States, and also telling them that \neven if the baby is born somewhere other than their clinic, they will \nsee to it that the child does not survive.\n  So is the case of Dr. Gosnell an outlier or is the legitimacy of the \nlate-term abortion industry merely a lie? The American people deserve \nto know.\n  Yesterday I introduced legislation to end the practice of late-term \nabortion in Washington, DC, after 20 weeks, the point at which science \ntells us unborn children can feel pain, in light of the chilling \ndetails coming in from Pennsylvania, Maryland, the District of \nColumbia, and various abortion clinics around the country that late-\nterm abortions on pain-capable, unborn children are an important issue \nwe need to debate.\n  Opinions will obviously be divided, as they always are on abortion-\nrelated issues. But we owe it to the American people to see if we can \nfind common ground to protect innocent women and innocent children.\n  But there should be no division or controversy surrounding the sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution I called up a few minutes ago. The resolution \nhas the support of every Republican Senator, pro-life and pro-choice \nMembers alike.\n  The resolution expresses the sense of the Senate, affirming: The duty \nof the State and Federal Government agencies to protect women and \nchildren from violent criminals posing as health care providers; the \nequal human and constitutional rights of fully born infant children; \nthe need to prevent and punish abusive, unsanitary, and illegal \nabortion practices.\n  One of the newborns Dr. Gosnell is accused of murdering, ``Baby Boy \nA,'' was born alive--breathing and moving--to an underage girl almost \n30 weeks pregnant. Witnesses describe Gosnell severing the baby's \nspine, discarding the child in a shoebox, and joking that he was big \nenough ``to walk me to the bus stop.''\n  Joking. Joking.\n  A clinic employee estimated Baby Boy A's birth weight at about 6 \npounds, larger and heavier than two of my own children when they were \nborn.\n  If there are other Kermit Gosnells out there waging their own \npersonal war on women, we need to know about it, and we need to stop \nthem.\n  I don't think I can make a stronger argument for this resolution than \nthe one the grand jury in the Gosnell case made itself:\n\n       Let us say right up front we realize this case will be used \n     by both sides of the abortion debate. We ourselves cover a \n     spectrum of personal beliefs about the morality of abortion. \n     For us as a criminal grand jury, however, the case is not \n     about that controversy; it is about disregard of the law and \n     disdain for the lives and health of mothers and infants. We \n     find common ground in exposing what happened here and in \n     recommending measures to prevent anything like this from ever \n     happening again.\n\n  I hope the Senate too, whose Members cover a similar spectrum of \nviews on abortion, can follow the grand jury's lead to find common \nground in the pursuit of truth and justice for American women and \nchildren.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Again, Mr. President, I accept and sympathize with \nthe goals of the resolution offered by my friend from Utah. What I am \nsuggesting is a resolution that includes those criminals who may be \nposing as health care practitioners in one field of practice but \nextends the condemnation to all areas of practice.\n  I hope Senator Lee, my friend from Utah, will share my outrage at \nreprehensible and illegal actions that occur, unfortunately and \ntragically, in other areas of practice. Let me mention a few.\n  We ought to speak about the tragedy at the Pennsylvania clinic, where \nthese incidents occurred, but we also should talk about the Oklahoma \ndentist who exposed as many as 7,000 patients to HIV and hepatitis B \nand C through unsanitary practices. Thousands of his patients are being \ntested to see if they have been infected. So far 60 of his patients \nhave tested positive for these viruses. That is 60 people who trusted \ntheir dentist, a health care provider in a position of trust and \nresponsibility, relying on him to respect and care for them safely and \nresponsibly, and, instead they are now facing potentially life-\nthreatening diseases that are as abhorrent and despicable in the lack \nof responsibility and care as what happened in Pennsylvania. We ought \nto talk about that incident with the same outrage that we talk about \nwhat happened, allegedly, in Pennsylvania.\n  We ought to speak about the health care practitioners at the \nEndoscopy Center of Southern Nevada who exposed 40,000 patients to \nhepatitis C through unsanitary practices. These unsanitary practices \nwent on for years, and that is why this clinic may have hurt as many as \n40,000 people. We are talking about 40,000 people, again, exposed to \nunnecessary danger because of the lack of trust and responsibility on \nthe part of their health care provider.\n  We also ought to talk about the nursing director at Kern Valley \nnursing home in California who inappropriately medicated patients using \nantipsychotic drugs for her own convenience, resulting in the death of \nat least one patient.\n  We should be talking about the compounding pharmacies in \nMassachusetts and elsewhere in this country that provided products that \nkilled and harmed thousands of people.\n  These incidents, as alleged, are willful violations of law, \nviolations of human dignity and decency, that ought to shock the \nconscience of the Nation every bit to its core as much as the alleged \nmisconduct and potential criminal activity in Pennsylvania.\n  These standards of care--or more appropriately and correctly, the \nviolation of them--are simply unacceptable and intolerable, which is \nwhy my resolution would take as common ground the alleged Pennsylvania \nmisconduct and include many other instances where standards of care--\nbasic standards of decency and trust--are violated. I ask my friend \nfrom Utah to join me in espousing a resolution that establishes this \nkind of common ground.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I appreciate the insight and the concern \nshared by my friend and colleague from Connecticut. These are all \nthings we all ought to be thinking about, be concerned about, and be \ndebating from time to time. To reiterate one of the points we need to \nmake here: As with all health-care-providing institutions, all clinics, \nall hospitals need to be subjected to the scrutiny of some outside \nregulator. They need to have some accountability to those who will \nensure that conditions there are safe, that the treatments being \nprovided are effective, and that they are not going to result in more \ninjury, in more disease, in life-threatening conditions, in emergency \nresponders who show up not being able to access the patient in time \nbecause the hallways are too narrow, the exits are blocked or the \nhallways are crowded.\n  I appreciate the insight from my colleague from Connecticut and thank \nhim for his remarks.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/08/senate-section/article/S3240-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3240-S3248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2013--Continued\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, can I ask what the order is at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering S. 601.\n  Mrs. BOXER. OK. So this is my understanding: I ask Senator \nBlumenthal, do you have more to say on this matter with the resolution?\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I do not.\n  Mrs. BOXER. OK. I know Senator Coats has some very important remarks \nto make about the death of a figure whom he cares about very much.\n  What I wish to propose, if I can, is to talk a little bit about this \nlittle back\n\n[[Page S3241]]\n\nand forth we had going between my two friends here, and then \nimmediately following what will only take about 2 or 3 minutes is to \nyield the floor to Senator Coats for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. COATS. Less than that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Less than that. For the benefit of all Senators, we think \nwe are going to have a vote tonight on the Brown amendment. So everyone \nstay around. We are hoping to have that in the next half hour or so. \nThat is our plan. We hope it will happen.\n  But I wanted to say in this back and forth we heard between two \nSenators why I was very strongly for the resolution that was put \nforward by Senator Blumenthal.\n  Clearly, what we have in our society today are callous, abusive, \nunsanitary, or illegal health care practices. These horrible, callous \npractices turn into tragedies. They produce tragedies. As Senator \nBlumenthal said, it goes across a wide array of various health care \nsettings.\n  We do not come down here every day to call out one horrific problem \nafter another. Certainly what has happened in Pennsylvania--and, again, \nI would take the admonition of Senator Blumenthal, who was a \nprosecutor, we have to be careful when a jury is deliberating--but \ncertainly if these allegations are true, the individuals involved \nshould be punished to the full extent of the law--and the toughest kind \nof punishment--and I believe in other cases too.\n  I know my colleague has talked about a horrible situation in southern \nNevada, where 40,000 patients were exposed to hepatitis C. Hepatitis C \nis a serious and life-threatening condition. Mr. President, 40,000 \npeople were exposed to it. They did nothing. That is deserving of \ncondemnation as well.\n  He talked about a nursing home in California, where we had the death \nof a patient because the nurse in that particular case--and nurses are \nsome of the most extraordinarily wonderful people, but in this \nparticular case she had her own convenience ahead of the situation. She \nimproperly medicated patients using antipsychotic drugs, and we know \none patient died.\n\n  Whatever the setting is--if it is a reproductive health care clinic, \nif it is a dentist, if it is any type of doctor, any kind of clinic--\nwhere there are willful violations of the law and violations of human \ndignity and violations of standard of care, we should call them out.\n  What I thought was so important about Senator Blumenthal's resolution \nis that he took the spirit of Senator Lee's resolution. He did. He \nactually included in that what occurred in Pennsylvania. And we did get \nit to the Republicans 2 hours ago, so it was not a few minutes. I think \nthat is a case in point where we could come together, where we say: \nAbsolutely what happened in Pennsylvania is an outrage, it is a \nviolation of everything we hold dear; and here are some other cases.\n  As long as I have the floor, I will conclude with this: I have been \ngetting involved in issues that deal with medical errors. I was stunned \nto find out, as I think are my colleagues--as a matter of fact, I met \nwith a doctor from a Texas hospital where they have improved very much \nwhere they were losing patients, dozens of patients every month, \nbecause of medical errors, terrible errors that are preventable errors: \nthe wrong prescriptions, the lack of monitoring, infections, terrible \ninfections in hospitals. These are all horrible deaths that are \npreventable.\n  I think my colleague's resolution was very statesmanlike. I think \nwhat he did was he said to our colleagues who wanted to pass their \nresolution: Of course we will work with you. Let's broaden it. Let's \ninclude condemnation of other horrible tragedies that are occurring \nthroughout the Nation, not just this one case, which is tragic and \ndespicable and every word I could think of, but all these other cases, \nso we do not every day come here with another example. This is a broad \nproblem in our country. We do the best out of most developed countries, \nbut we still have a long way to go.\n  I wanted to explain why I supported my friend when he opposed the \nnarrower resolution and support his broad resolution. I would urge my \ncolleagues to work with us.\n  With that, I yield the floor to my friend from Indiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for allowing me to \nspeak as in morning business, and I ask unanimous consent to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Remembering Otis Ray Bowen\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, this past Saturday my State of Indiana lost \na humble giant whose soft-spoken yet very firm convictions influenced \nmany Hoosiers for many years, including me.\n  Former Indiana Governor Otis Ray Bowen, known affectionately to \nHoosiers as ``Doc,'' passed away at the age of 95, the culmination of a \nlife spent in service to others.\n  Born in 1918, near Rochester, IN, Doc Bowen earned both a bachelor's \ndegree and a medical degree from Indiana University, joining the Army \nMedical Corps, after completing his internship, in 1943.\n  He served in the Medical Corps of the U.S. Army during World War II \nand went ashore with the first wave of Allied troops during the \ninvasion of Okinawa in 1945.\n  After the end of the war, Doc Bowen started a family medical practice \nin Bremen, IN, which he continued for the next 25 years. He estimated \nthat during his career this family doctor delivered more than 3,000 \nbabies.\n  He was first elected to political office in 1952 as Marshall County's \ncoroner and then to the Indiana House of Representatives in 1956.\n  Doc lost the reelection following that 2-year stint by only 4 votes \nin 1958 but then subsequently was elected to seven consecutive house \nterms, beginning in 1960. He became minority leader in 1965 and speaker \nin 1967. He served as speaker of the Indiana House through four \nlegislative sessions.\n  As the 44th Governor of Indiana, from 1973 to 1981, Dr. Bowen served \nHoosiers with dignity and respect. His tenure included numerous \naccomplishments, including landmark tax restructuring, improvements to \nState park facilities, and the development of a Statewide emergency \nmedical services system.\n  One of the most significant accomplishments of Governor Bowen was a \nmedical malpractice bill he signed into law. Aimed to reduce the cost \nof health insurance and the burden on doctors, Governor Bowen's medical \nmalpractice law became a national model.\n  Hoosiers will also remember the Governor's passionate love of Indiana \nbasketball. When the TV cameras would scan the players' bench, there \nwas Doc, encouraging the team and, at times, casting a critical eye on \nthe referee who just missed an important call.\n  Following his service as Governor, Dr. Bowen returned to medicine as \na professor at the Indiana University Medical Center.\n  But his time in public service did not end there. President Ronald \nReagan called Dr. Bowen out of private life and back into public \nservice in 1985 by naming him Secretary of Health and Human Services--\nthe first physician to serve in this position.\n  In 1989, Dr. Bowen returned to his Bremen home and continued to serve \nothers through various charities and commissions.\n  I was privileged to be able to meet with him on some occasions--\nquietly, nonpublicly, just sharing stories, talking about his career, \nand, more importantly, his love for Indiana, his love for his wife, his \nlove for his country.\n  This good doctor and good Governor will long be remembered as an \nexample of political leadership and human decency. The imprint of his \nleadership and, most of all, the imprint of his character will live on \nin the minds and hearts of Hoosiers for generations to come.\n  My wife Marsha and I join millions of Hoosiers as we extend our \ndeepest condolences to his family and also our gratitude for his \nshining example of a life well lived.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his very warm \nremarks.\n  I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding the previous order, the \nBrown amendment No. 813, as modified with the changes that are at the \ndesk, also be in order; that there be no amendments in order to the \nBrown amendment prior to a vote in relation to the amendment; that at \n5:45 p.m. today, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Brown \namendment No.\n\n[[Page S3242]]\n\n813, as modified; further, that all other provisions of the previous \norder remain in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I just asked unanimous consent to vote on \nthe Brown amendment. I am going to be supporting that amendment. I \nthink it is an important amendment. I just want to say to colleagues, \nwe are making progress. It is not as fast as Senator Vitter and I would \nlike, but considering the Senate it is not bad. We have moved through a \nnumber of amendments already, one particularly contentious amendment.\n  We are moving toward the finish line. I urge everyone to get their \namendments in. I urge them, as best I can, to stay away from nongermane \namendments that are controversial, that cause us to pause in our work. \nThis is an important bill. This bill was last done in 2007. You would \nask, why does it take so long? We used to do these bills every 2 or 3 \nyears. But the reason it has taken this long, in the interim we decided \nwe would no longer have earmarks.\n  That made this bill particularly difficult because normally we would \nmention the projects by name. We could not do that. So we had to figure \na way to move forward by making sure we never listed any particular \nproject. We did it in a good way. We said if there is a completed Army \nCorps report, the project runs forward. If there is a modification that \nhas to be made that did not add to the cost of the project, it goes \nforward. In the future the local governments can come forward and pitch \nto the Corps directly. We need flood control in this country. We know \nthat. We knew that before Superstorm Sandy. We certainly know it now. \nWe need port dredging in this country to move our goods. Our goods must \nbe moved, and goods to our country have to come into our ports.\n  We need environmental restoration. We need to take care of the \nEverglades. We need to take care of the Chesapeake. I have a place \ncalled the Salton Sea that is drying up. We need to take care of these \nkinds of challenges. We are going to turn to the Brown amendment. I am \ngoing to give up the floor now and hope he will explain it. I will be \nstrongly supporting it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 813, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Senator from California, the chair of the \ncommittee who has done an extraordinary job with Senator Vitter on this \nbill.\n  I ask unanimous consent to call up amendment No. 813.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Brown], for himself, Mr. Toomey, \n     Mr. Casey, Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Durbin, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 813, as modified.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide a multiagency effort to slow the spread of Asian \n  carp in the Upper Mississippi and Ohio River basins and tributaries)\n\n       At the end of title V, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 50___. MULTIAGENCY EFFORT TO SLOW THE SPREAD OF ASIAN \n                   CARP IN THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI RIVER AND OHIO \n                   RIVER BASINS AND TRIBUTARIES.\n\n       (a) Multiagency Effort to Slow the Spread of Asian Carp in \n     the Upper Mississippi and Ohio River Basins and \n     Tributaries.--\n       (1) In general.--The Director of the United States Fish and \n     Wildlife Service, in coordination with the Chief of \n     Engineers, the Director of the National Park Service, and the \n     Director of the United States Geological Survey, shall lead a \n     multiagency effort to slow the spread of Asian carp in the \n     Upper Mississippi and Ohio River basins and tributaries by \n     providing high-level technical assistance, coordination, best \n     practices, and support to State and local governments in \n     carrying out activities designed to slow, and eventually \n     eliminate, the threat posed by Asian carp.\n       (2) Best practices.--To the maximum extent practicable, the \n     multiagency effort shall apply lessons learned and best \n     practices such as those described in the document prepared by \n     the Asian Carp Working Group entitled ``Management and \n     Control Plan for Bighead, Black, Grass, and Silver Carps in \n     the United States'', and dated November 2007, and the \n     document prepared by the Asian Carp Regional Coordinating \n     Committee entitled ``FY 2012 Asian Carp Control Strategy \n     Framework'' and dated February 2012.\n       (b) Report to Congress.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than December 31 of each year, \n     the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, \n     in coordination with the Chief of Engineers, shall submit to \n     the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Natural \n     Resources of the House of Representatives and the Committee \n     on Appropriations and the Committee on Environmental and \n     Public Works of the Senate a report describing the \n     coordinated strategies established and progress made toward \n     goals to control and eliminate Asian carp in the Upper \n     Mississippi and Ohio River basins and tributaries.\n       (2) Contents.--Each report submitted under paragraph (1) \n     shall include--\n       (A) any observed changes in the range of Asian carp in the \n     Upper Mississippi and Ohio River basins and tributaries \n     during the 2-year period preceding submission of the report;\n       (B) a summary of Federal agency efforts, including \n     cooperative efforts with non-Federal partners, to control the \n     spread of Asian carp in the Upper Mississippi and Ohio River \n     basins and tributaries;\n       (C) any research that the Director determines could improve \n     the ability to control the spread of Asian carp in the Upper \n     Mississippi and Ohio River basins and tributaries;\n       (D) any quantitative measures that Director intends to use \n     to document progress in controlling the spread of Asian carp \n     in the Upper Mississippi and Ohio River basins and \n     tributaries; and\n       (E) a cross-cut accounting of Federal and non-Federal \n     expenditures to control the spread of Asian carp in the Upper \n     Mississippi and Ohio River basins and tributaries.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer today, with my \ncolleagues from Pennsylvania, Senator Toomey and Senator Casey, this \namendment. As many of you know, the spread of Asian carp poses a threat \nto the Great Lakes' ecosystem. Because of the work of my Great Lakes \nState colleagues from Minnesota to Michigan, Pennsylvania, we are \nworking to address this problem.\n  But it is not, contrary to what many believe, limited just to the \nGreat Lakes. The Ohio and Upper Mississippi River Basins also face the \nthreat of these invasive species. This no-cost amendment that Senator \nToomey and I are offering would support multiagency efforts to hold the \nspread of Asian carp in the Ohio and Upper Mississippi Basin.\n  I ask my colleagues for their support.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I would like to begin by thanking my \ncolleague Senator Brown for his leadership on this issue, and Senator \nCasey, my colleague from Pennsylvania, who is supportive of this effort \nas well.\n  This is not a complicated amendment. I do not think it is a \ncontroversial amendment either. The fact is in southwestern \nPennsylvania, we have three iconic rivers. In northwestern Pennsylvania \nwe have access to and a coastline along a beautiful and important \nnational treasure, Lake Erie.\n  On all of these, the rivers and Lake Erie, the commerce and the \nrecreation that occurs on these waterways are potentially at risk to an \ninvasion of the Asian carp. This, as we all know, is a very aggressive, \nlarge, nonindigenous species that could be very disruptive to the \necosystem of the rivers, to the ecosystem of Lake Erie.\n  What we discovered is that there is no single entity in the entire \nFederal Government that is responsible for coordinating our response, a \nresponse that will help to minimize the risk that the Asian carp would \nbe able to invade the waterways and ultimately make their way into the \nGreat Lakes.\n  It would be potentially devastating if the Asian carp were to do so. \nWe have introduced this amendment to this bill which would simply do \ntwo things. It would place the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in charge \nof coordinating the Federal multiagency effort. That would include the \nNational Park Service, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the Army Corps \nof Engineers. It would require an annual report on what is being done \nat\n\n[[Page S3243]]\n\nthe Federal and State level to minimize the risk of an invasion of the \nAsian carp.\n  As I say, I believe this is a very constructive, modest amendment. I \ntrust it is not controversial. I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask for the yeas and nays on the Brown amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Brown.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Maryland (Mr. Cardin), \nthe Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Lautenberg), and the Senator from \nMissouri (Mrs. McCaskill) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have made progress on this bill in the \nlast couple of days. We have had a difficult time on some of the \namendments that were nongermane, but we worked our way through those. \nThe two managers on this bill are waiting for amendments to be offered.\n  I hope we could get this bill done as quickly as possible. It is an \nimportant bill for every State in the Union. I hope it is not bogged \ndown with a lot of nonrelevant, nongermane amendments. If people want \nto offer them, have at it. I just don't think it is the right thing to \ndo on this bill. We have already been through that. I have talked to \nSenator Boxer and Senator Vitter and they want to move through this \nbill.\n  There is a lot of good stuff in this legislation, and they have \nworked so hard. They have listened to all of their colleagues who have \nsituations, and some of that can be resolved with a managers' \namendment. So if Senators have to offer an amendment, go ahead and \noffer it, but let's try to get this legislation complete.\n  Monday is a no-vote day. We should do everything tomorrow to at least \ncome up with a finite list of amendments because we are not going to \nspend all week on this bill next week, that is for sure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 or 11 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Insider Trading Laws\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, with the passage of the STOCK Act last \nyear, Congress made an important statement: When it comes to insider \ntrading laws, there is no special exemption for Congress. If anyone in \ngovernment provides confidential information to someone for the purpose \nof trading on it, that is insider trading.\n  It is illegal if the information is both material and nonpublic. The \nword ``material'' means a reasonable investor would want to know it \nbefore investing. ``Nonpublic'' means the information has not been \nreleased to the general public. To violate the law, the person making \nthe disclosure must have a duty to keep the information secret.\n  Frankly, there is very little information in Congress that must be \nkept secret. Of course, that is a good thing. Unlike the executive \nbranch, most of what Congress does is public immediately. But \ndisclosing material nonpublic information can be a crime. Even if it is \ndone intentionally, people might be investigated before getting a \nchance to clear their name. And there is a big difference between \nmaterial nonpublic information and an expert's educated guess about \nwhat a government agency might do.\n  We now know that Wall Street has been harvesting expertise and \ntidbits of information from Washington, DC, for years while keeping us \nlargely in the dark. In fact, the political intelligence industry is so \nbig and so opaque that the Government Accountability Office was unable \nto quantify it or judge its size despite 1 whole year of investigating.\n  Political intelligence firms extract pieces of information from the \ngovernment and use that intelligence to make money on Wall Street. Each \ndetail a political intelligence firm gathers may not be material or \nnonpublic on its own, but the purpose of collecting and analyzing those \ndetails is to get an edge in the markets over other investors.\n  That is not illegal, and I have never suggested that it should be. \nPeople should not be discouraged from sharing information and opinions \nabout how our government operates. We should be more transparent, not \nless. The less open and transparent government is, the more \nopportunities there are to exploit government information for profit in \nthe markets.\n  I have been investigating the role of political intelligence firms in \nthe early release of information about Medicare Advantage rates prior \nto the public announcement on April 1st. There has been some confusion \nover the scope of my inquiry, so I want to be clear.\n  There are reports that the Securities and Exchange Commission is \ninvestigating whether material non-public information was released \nabout the Medicare Advantage rates. My interest is much broader than \nthat. Political intelligence is not the same thing as material non-\npublic information. Gathering political intelligence includes a lot of \nactivity that falls short of material non-public information. So, just \nbecause I am asking questions about how certain information or expert \nopinions flowed to these political intelligence firms, does not mean I \nam accusing anyone of any wrongdoing.\n  I am not seeking to ban the gathering of political intelligence. I am \nnot suggesting that if someone was the source for some piece of \npolitical intelligence, that the source did anything illegal. But, the \ngoal of these firms is to get an edge on other investors, and that \nshould be understood by everyone who communicates with them.\n  This investigation has shed a great deal of light on the political \nintelligence industry. I hope to use this information to improve the \nlegislation on political intelligence disclosure that I plan to re-\nintroduce with Representative Slaughter. I am trying to learn how these \npolitical intelligence firms function by using this real-world example, \nso that I can write better legislation on disclosure.\n  To be clear, I am not focused on examining whether particular \nCongressional staff acted properly with regard to their professional \nduties. Any reports to the contrary are simply inaccurate. What I think \nwe need is more transparency. Government officials need to know what \nhappens with the information they provide to outside parties. I want to \narm government officials with knowledge about who they are talking to.\n  My inquiry started with Height Securities, the firm that put out an \nalert 18 minutes before the markets closed on April 1st. That alert \ncaused a huge spike in the health insurance stocks\n\n[[Page S3244]]\n\nthat stood to gain from the rate announcement.\n  I initially learned that an email on April 1st from a healthcare \nlobbyist to the analyst at Height Securities looked like the basis for \nthe flash alert that moved the markets. In the interest of full \ndisclosure, it has been reported in the press that the lobbyist was \nformerly on my staff. But, I continued to press for more information.\n  I learned that Height paid for his expertise on healthcare, although \nhis entire billing amounted to only 1.75 hours of work before sending \nthe email on April 1st. I learned that the Height analyst had also \ncommunicated with two other healthcare policy experts before putting \nout his alert to the market.\n  Then, I learned that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services--\nCMS--had already made its decision to reverse the rate cuts much \nearlier, two weeks before the Height Securities alert.\n  The press has reported that there were major spikes in options \ntrading on March 18th and March 22nd. Options trading is one way folks \non Wall Street make big bets on a stock when they think they have a \nsure thing. March 18th happens to be the first trading day after CMS \nmade its decision internally. March 22nd happens to be the day that CMS \ntransmitted its draft decision to the White House more than a week \nbefore the public announcement. On that date, the circle of people in \nthe administration who would have known about the CMS decision expanded \nsignificantly.\n  This suggests that political intelligence firms may have obtained key \ninformation for their clients in mid-March, not just the day of the \nannouncement on April 1st.\n  The press also reported on the possible involvement of another \npolitical intelligence firm, Capitol Street. Capitol Street arranges \nconference calls between investors and governments experts.\n  In addition, I have asked two major hedge funds mentioned in the \npress whether they profited from trades in advance of the rate \nannouncement. So the scope of my inquiry is broad. It is not focused on \nparticular people. It is focused on the facts.\n  The Securities and Exchange Commission is also investigating. It is \ntheir job to determine whether any material non-public information was \npassed to Height or to anyone else in this case. That is not my job.\n  I am working on legislation to make the political intelligence \nindustry more transparent. I am gathering facts to inform that \nlegislation.\n  Remember, political intelligence does not necessarily involve \nmaterial non-public information. But, people in government need to know \nwho they are talking to and what they will do with your information. \nThat is why it is so important to ensure that political intelligence \nrelationships are transparent. Even if the information you provide is \nmerely an educated guess, it can still move markets. It can still \ncreate an impression that a fortunate few are making money from special \naccess to insiders.\n  If political intelligence transparency is passed, government \nofficials would be more fully informed when they provide expertise to \nthese firms about how the information might be used. But as things \nstand, without transparency, you do not necessarily know what firms \nlike Height Securities or Capitol Street do with the information you \nprovide to them. You don't know if they have a contract with a lobbyist \nwho is bringing in some other client for a meeting. You don't know that \nyour discussion with that lobbyist's client might be repeated to people \nwho are looking for an edge in the stock market. What you think may be \nan innocent detail or an educated guess may move markets.\n  At the end of the day, that is what these firms want to exploit. That \nis what they are after. That is what they sell. They should be honest \nand upfront with people about how they make money. Lobbying disclosure \nisn't perfect, but it has brought more transparency to the process.\n  Now, we need political intelligence disclosure too, for the same \nreasons.\n  Transparency increases the public's ability to trust that we are \nworking for them, not for just for special interests. That principle \nshould apply just as much to special interests on Wall Street as it \ndoes to special interests on K Street.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask consent to follow Senator Moran \nat the conclusion of his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Charitable Giving\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, April 15 has now come and gone, known as \ntax day to most Americans. Millions of Americans filed their returns \nlast month and many took into account in filing that return the dollars \nthey contributed to charitable and worthwhile causes. According to an \norganization called Giving USA, Americans gave nearly $300 billion in \n2011 to support important programs and services, from food pantries and \nmedical research to youth programs and seed grants to start new \nbusinesses. Because of those generous donations of millions of \nAmericans each year, not-for-profits have impacted the lives of \ncountless individuals for decades.\n  An example back home in my State, an example of where a charitable \ncontribution made a tremendous difference in the life of an individual \nis William Wilkerson, a 16-year-old from Overland Park, KS. At age 3, \nWilliam was diagnosed with moderate to severe bilateral hearing loss.\n  After visiting several doctors, William was taken to Children's Mercy \nHospital, where he was fitted with his first set of hearing aids. He \nlater put into words what he experienced that day: With so many \ndifferent things that I had never heard before, it was as if somebody \nhad turned on the world!\n  Denise Miller, the manager of the Children's Mercy Hearing and Speech \nClinic, said this about the importance of donations: Because of the \ndonor support we receive, we are able to fit the most appropriate \nhearing aids on each and every child, based on their own unique needs.\n  In 2011, the clinic fit nearly 500 patients with hearing aids \nbringing the world of sound to their ears and changing their lives \nforever.\n  Nonprofits like Children's Mercy Hospital depend on the generosity of \nKansans and other Americans to help support their ongoing care for \nchildren.\n  But President Obama has proposed changes to the 100-year-old \ntradition of providing tax incentives for charitable giving that could \nsignificantly diminish this support for nonprofits.\n  In the President's 2014 budget is a proposal to cap the total value \nof tax deductions at 28 percent for higher income Americans--including \nthe charitable tax deduction.\n  According to the Charitable Giving Coalition, this proposal could \nreduce donations to the nonprofit sector by more than $5.6 billion \nevery year. This reduction amounts to more than the annual operating \nbudgets of the American Red Cross, Goodwill, the YMCA, Habitat for \nHumanity, the Boys and Girls Clubs, Catholic Charities, and the \nAmerican Cancer Society combined. A reduction in giving of this \nmagnitude would have a devastating impact on the future of charitable \norganizations in our country.\n  Given our country's current economic situation, more Americans have \nturned to nonprofits for help in recent years. According to the \nNonprofit Finance Fund, 85 percent of nonprofits experienced higher \ndemand for their services in 2011 and at least 70 percent have seen \nincreased demand since 2008. Our country depends upon a strong \nphilanthropic sector to provide a safety net for services, especially \ngiven the tighter local and State budgets.\n\n  Americans understand the value and impact of the charitable \ndeduction, which is why a recent United Way Worldwide survey found that \ntwo out of every three Americans are opposed to reducing the charitable \ntax deduction.\n  Nonprofits are best equipped to provide assistance on the local level \nand can often do so in a far more effective manner than many government \nprograms. Studies have shown that for every $1 subject to the \ncharitable deduction, communities will receive $3 in benefits.\n\n[[Page S3245]]\n\n  The Federal Government will be hard-pressed to find a more effective \nway to generate that kind of public impact. Congress has previously \nacknowledged the benefits of private investments and regularly passes \ncharitable giving incentives in the wake of a natural disaster to \nencourage more giving.\n  Last October, when Hurricane Sandy tore across the east coast, the \nstorm left thousands of residents without the basic necessities of \nlife: food, water, and shelter. Within 6 weeks, the American Red Cross \nserved more than 8 million meals, provided more than 81,000 shelter \nstays, and distributed more than 6 million relief items to thousands of \nresidents impacted by the storm.\n  In times of crisis, Americans depend on relief service organizations \nsuch as the American Red Cross, Catholic Charities, and the Salvation \nArmy--all not-for-profit organizations whose main purpose is to help \ntheir fellow citizens when they need it the most.\n  Nonprofits such as Habitat for Humanity also help families make a \nfresh start in life after a disaster. In May of 2007, an EF5 tornado \nswept through my home State of Kansas devastating 95 percent of the \ntown of Greensburg.\n  Diana Torres, a single mom, had lived in Greensburg for nearly 7 \nyears when the tornado destroyed the home they were renting. Diana \nfaced the likelihood of having to move out of State when the Wichita \nHabitat for Humanity stepped in with 1,400 volunteers to build a new \nhome. Thanks to special financing and donated supplies, Diana could \nafford to purchase the home for her family.\n  Executive director of the Wichita Habitat for Humanity Linda Stewart \nsaid those who support Habitat ``know they are making a difference in \nsomeone's life that lasts for years.'' That is what not-for-profits do \nevery day across Kansas and around our country. They make a difference \none life at a time.\n  Since the founding of our Nation, neighbors have been helping other \nneighbors. They lend that helping hand that is so often needed. The \ncharitable deduction is one way to encourage that tradition to \ncontinue.\n  Any change in the Tax Code related to charitable giving would have a \nlong-lasting and negative consequence, not necessarily to the generous \ndonor but, more importantly, to the millions of Americans who rely upon \nthe services provided by a charitable organization. With our economy \nstill recovering and the tremendous need for charitable causes, the \nPresident should be encouraging Americans to give more, not less, and \nCongress should reject this administration's proposal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I would like to ask consent to speak \nfor up to 15 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. As I am sure the Presiding Officer suspects, I am \nback on the floor again to urge that we awaken to what carbon pollution \nis doing to our planet, to our oceans, to our seasons, and to our \nstorms. I wonder why is it that we are so comfortably asleep when the \nwarnings are so many and so real. What could beguile us away from \nwakefulness and duty?\n  I was recently at a Senate meeting when I heard a Member of our \nSenate community say: ``God won't allow us to ruin our planet.'' Maybe \nthat is why we do nothing. We are comfortable that God somehow will not \nallow us to ruin our planet. That seems like such an extraordinary \nnotion, I thought I would reflect on it in my remarks this week.\n  First of all, the statement refers to God and is couched in religious \nterms, but is it truly an expression of religious inquiry? I think not. \nIt is less an expression of religious thinking than it is of magical \nthinking. The statement that God will not allow us to ruin our planet \nsweeps aside ethics, responsibilities, consequences, duties, even \nawareness. It comforts us with the anodyne assumption that no matter \nwhat we do, some undefined presence will--through some undefined \nmeasure--make things right and clean up our mess. That is seeking \nmagical deliverance from our troubles, not divine guidance through our \ntroubles.\n  Is God truly here just to tidy up after our sins and follies, to \nimmunize us from their consequence? If that is true, why does the Bible \nsay in Galatians 6:7, ``Do not be deceived . . . whatever one sows, \nthat will he also reap.'' If God is just a tidy-up-after-us God, why \ndoes the book of Job 4:8 warn that ``those who plow iniquity and sow \ntrouble reap the same.'' If God is not a God of consequences, why does \nLuke 6:38 tell us, ``For with the measure you use, it will be measured \nback to you.'' Proverbs 22:8 tells us, ``Whoever sows injustice will \nreap calamity.''\n  Jeremiah 17:10 says, ``I the Lord search the heart and test the mind \nto give every man according to his ways, according to the fruit of his \ndeeds.''\n  So it seems we should not walk in the counsel of the wicked or sit in \nthe seat of the scoffers and then expect there will be no bitter fruit \nof our deeds, no consequence.\n  We are warned in the Bible not to plow iniquity, not to eat the fruit \nof lies. Where in the Bible are we assured of safety if we do? I see no \nassurances of that. The Bible says in 1 Samuel 2:3 that ``the Lord is a \nGod of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.'' At Thessalonians \n1:6, ``God considers it just to repay with affliction those who \nafflict.'' Those who ``sow the wind,'' the Bible says, ``they shall \nreap the whirlwind.''\n\n  Look at our own American history. If God is just here to tidy up \nafter our sins and follies, how could Abraham Lincoln say this about \nour bloody Civil War to free and redeem us from the sin of slavery? \nHere is what Lincoln said about that war:\n\n       Yet, if God wills that it continue, until all the wealth \n     piled by the bond-man's two hundred and fifty years of \n     unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood \n     drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the \n     sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must \n     be said: ``The judgments of the Lord, are true and righteous \n     judgment altogether.''\n\n  That was Abraham Lincoln. Blood drawn by the sword in equal measure \nto that drawn by the lash as the true and righteous judgment of the \nLord--that doesn't sound like a God of amnesty.\n  Go to the very beginning. If we live in a state of God-given general \namnesty from consequences, why were Adam and Eve expelled from Eden for \ntheir sin? Why was Cain sent into the wilderness, condemned to wander \nfor the crime against his brother? If it is your assertion that God's \nlove has no measure of tough love, wander a bit through the Old \nTestament before getting too married to that idea.\n  If the Old Testament is too bloodthirsty for you, look at Revelations \n11:18:\n\n       And thy wrath is come, and the time . . . that thou . . . \n     shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.\n\n  If we believe in an all-powerful God, we must then believe that God \ngave us this Earth, and we must in turn believe God gave us its laws of \ngravity, chemistry, and physics. We must also believe that God gave us \nour human powers of intellect and reason. He gives us these powers so \nwe, his children, can learn and understand Earth's natural laws, which \nhe also gave us, so that as his children we can use that understanding \nof Earth's natural laws to build and create and prosper on his Earth.\n  Hasn't that, in fact, been the path of human progress? We learn these \nnatural laws, and we apply them to build and create and we prosper.\n  Why then when we ignore his plain, natural laws, when we ignore the \nobvious conclusions to be drawn by our God-given intellect and reason \nwould God--the tidy-up God--drop in and spare us? Why would he allow an \ninnocent child to burn its hand when it touches the hot stove but \nprotect us from this lesson? Why would he allow a badly engineered \nbridge or building to fall, killing innocent people, but protect us \nfrom this mistake? Why would he allow cholera to kill in epidemics \nuntil we figure out that the well water is contaminated?\n  The Earth's natural laws and our capacity to divine them are God's \ngreat gift to us, allowing us to learn and build great things and cure \ndisease. But God's gift to us of a planet with natural laws and natural \norder has as an integral part of that gift consequences--consequences \nwhen we get\n\n[[Page S3246]]\n\nthat law and order wrong. The child's hand burns, the bridge falls, the \ndisease spreads. If it didn't matter whether we got it right or wrong, \nthere would be no value to God's creation of that natural law and order \nin the first place.\n  So is that then to be our answer to polluting our atmosphere with \ncarbon by the megaton and changing our climate and changing our seas? \nIs it to be our answer to that, that God would not allow us to ruin our \nplanet? We are to continue to pollute our Earth with literally megatons \neach year of carbon, heating up our atmosphere, acidifying our seas, \nknowing full well by His natural laws what the consequences are? \nInstead of correcting our own behavior, we are going to bet on a \nmiracle? That is the plan? Excuse me, but that is not the American way. \nPresident Kennedy described the American way as he ended his inaugural \naddress connecting our work to God's:\n\n       . . . let us go forth, to lead the land we love, asking His \n     blessing and His help, but knowing that here on earth God's \n     work must truly be our own.\n\n  That is the order of things. We are here to do God's work. He is not \nhere to do ours. How arrogant. How very far from humility would be the \nself-satisfied smug assurance that God--a tidy-up-after-us God--will \ncome and clean up our mess; that on this Earth, God's work need not be \nour own.\n  Remember the story of the man trapped in his house during a huge \nflood. A faithful man, he trusted God to save him. As the waters began \nto rise in his house, his neighbor came by and offered him a ride to \nsafety, and he said: I am waiting for God to save me. So the neighbor \ngot in his pickup truck and drove away.\n  As the water rose, the man climbed to the second floor of his house, \nand a boat came by his window with people who were headed for safe \nground. They threw a rope and they yelled at the man to climb out and \ncome with them, but he told them: No, I trust in God to save me. They \nshook their heads, and they moved on.\n  The flood waters kept rising, and the man clambered up onto his roof. \nA helicopter flew by, and a voice came over the loud speaker offering \nto lower a ladder to the man, let him climb up and fly to safety. The \nman waved the helicopter away, shouting back that he counted on God to \nsave him, so the helicopter left.\n  Well, eventually the floodwaters swept over the roof, and the man was \ndrowned. When the man reached Heaven, he had some questions for God:\n  God, he asked, didn't I trust in You to save me?\n  Why did You let me drown?\n  God answered: I sent you a pickup truck, I sent you a boat, I sent \nyou a helicopter. You refused my help.\n  Just as God sent the pickup truck, the boat, and the helicopter to \nthe drowning man, he has sent us everything we need to solve this \ncarbon pollution problem. We just refuse. We just refuse. Some of us \neven deny that the floodwaters are rising.\n  As I have indicated in previous speeches, climate denial is bad \nscience. Indeed, it is such bad science it falls into the category of \nfalsehood. Climate denial is bad economics, ignoring that in a proper \nmarketplace the costs of carbon pollution should be factored into the \nprice of carbon. Climate denial is bad policy in any number of areas--\nbad national security policy, bad environmental policy, bad foreign \npolicy, bad economic policy.\n  Although I am a Senator, not a preacher, from everything I have \nlearned and believe, it seems to me that climate denial is also bad \nreligion and bad morals. Hopes for a nanny God who will, with a \nmiracle, grant us amnesty from our folly is not aligned with history or \ntext of the Bible.\n  We need to face the fact that there is only one leg on which climate \ndenial stands: money. The polluters give and spend money to create \nfalse doubt. The polluters give and spend money to buy political \ninfluence. The polluters give and spend money to keep polluting. That \nis it--not truth, not science, not economics, not safety, not policy, \nand certainly not religion, nor morality. Nothing supports climate \ndenial--nothing except money.\n  But in Congress, in this temple, money rules. So here I stand in one \nof the last places on Earth that is still a haven to climate denial. In \nour arrogance, we here in Congress think we can somehow ignore or trump \nEarth's natural laws--laws of chemistry, laws of physics, laws of \nscience--with our own political lawmaking, with our own political \ninfluence. But we are fools to think that. The laws of chemistry and \nthe laws of physics neither know nor care what we say or do here.\n  So we need to wake up. We need to walk not in the counsel of the \nwicked, nor sit in the seat of scoffers, but with due humility awaken \nto our duty and get to work because here on Earth God's work must truly \nbe our own.\n  Thank you very much. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I just want to say to Senator Whitehouse before he leaves \nthe floor how much I appreciated his remarks tonight and how much I \nlearned from his remarks. I wish to say to the Senator that I think he \nput forward the most cogent argument from a religious perspective as to \nwhy we have to take action to make sure we don't lose this planet. We \nare in a planetary emergency. As he said, this is the last place in the \nworld, almost, that doesn't get it.\n  I wish to say to the Senator from Rhode Island that the reason so \nmany religious leaders are in our coalition to call attention to \nclimate change, to call attention to global warming, to call attention \nto the rising waters, to call attention to the terrible droughts, to \nthe terrible fires, to the terrible storms, to the extreme weather and \nall the things we are seeing around us--the Senator from Rhode Island \nhas laid it out chapter and verse, we can truly say, chapter and verse, \nand I so appreciate what he is doing here. I so appreciate his \nconsistent voice, his passionate voice.\n  I so appreciate that he is on the committee I am so proud to chair, \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee. We are on a bill that deals \nwith the public works side of the committee. We have good camaraderie \nthere. But when it comes to protecting the environment, it is as if \nthere are just two totally different species of humanity--the deniers \nand the believers. I am proud to be on the side of the believers. I \nbelieve America is built on facts. It is built on, yes, religious \nbeliefs and scientific proof.\n  I think the Senator from Rhode Island laid it out tonight in such a \nmagnificent way that I intend to send the Senator's remarks, with his \npermission, to all of our colleagues, to put them up on my Web site \nbecause I am so proud to stand with the Senator from Rhode Island in \nthis fight. This is a fight, and as my friend from Rhode Island said it \nis a fight that puts on one side the special interests, the polluters, \nthe money, versus those who just say we have to save this planet. It is \nour responsibility. It is our God-given responsibility.\n  I thank the Senator from Rhode Island so much, and I yield to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I just want to say how honored I am to serve on \nSenator Boxer's committee with her as our chairman and leader and how \neager I am to fight beside her in the struggles ahead.\n  With that, with my appreciation, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to say to my friend, today was a \ngreat day for the Senator from Rhode Island, not only because of the \nspeech that I think is quite memorable but also because of the \namendment he passed with the help of our Republican friends, to set up \nan oceans trust fund. I think this is a good, positive day, and I am \nvery pleased about that.\n  I would ask the staff if we are ready to make the unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  We will be in 2 minutes. So I would say to my colleague that we are \ngoing to dispose of about six amendments very quickly on the floor, \nwith the indulgence of the Senator, and we should be free and done with \nthis business in a few minutes.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I thank the Senator. No objection.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator.\n  So we will put in a quorum call. I ask unanimous consent to complete \nmy remarks after the remarks of Senator Hoeven.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S3247]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise in support of amendment No. 802, \nwhich I understand will be offered to the WRDA bill by my colleague \nfrom Louisiana Senator Landrieu which would stop flood insurance \npremiums from skyrocketing until FEMA completes its study on the \naffordability of premiums of the National Flood Insurance Program.\n  As everyone here knows, my home State of New Jersey was at the \nepicenter of Superstorm Sandy which destroyed thousands of homes, left \nmillions without power, and caused billions of dollars in damage. But \ndespite the devastation, the people of New Jersey didn't give up. They \nbegan rebuilding, and we showed the country that ``Jersey Tough'' isn't \njust a slogan.\n  But even as we slowly recover from the worst natural disaster in our \nState's history, a manmade disaster is looming in the distance, \njeopardizing our recovery. The combination of updated flood maps and \nthe phaseout of premium subsidies for the National Flood Insurance \nProgram threaten to force victims out of their homes and destroy entire \ncommunities.\n  It is like a triple whammy. We have the consequences of Superstorm \nSandy, which devastated homes, so they have to rebuild. Many times, \nthat insurance didn't rise to the level of the cost of rebuilding. \nSecondly, and as a result of flood maps that came in after the storm, \nthere are now requirements for new elevations. Thirdly, the premiums \nare going to skyrocket because the subsidies go down. So we have a \ntriple whammy.\n  Now, many homeowners are going to be forced to pay premiums that are \nseveral times higher than their current policy. Those who cannot afford \nthe higher premiums will either be forced to sell or abandon their \nhomes. This, in turn, will drive down property values and local \nrevenues at the worst possible time--when we are doing everything we \ncan to bring communities back to life after the storm.\n  I have heard from countless New Jerseyans. Many who are facing this\n\n[[Page S3248]]\n\npredicament have come to me in tears. These are hard-working middle-\nclass families who have played by the rules, purchased flood insurance \nresponsibly, and now are being priced out of the only home in which \nthey have ever lived. This amendment would delay these potentially \ndevastating changes until FEMA completes its study on premium \naffordability.\n  This study is the result of a requirement I authored in the flood \ninsurance bill last year because I was concerned that premiums could \nbecome unaffordable for too many families. Of course, at that time the \nchallenge was made by many of our colleagues, particularly on the other \nside of the aisle, who said: Well, we will let the flood insurance \nprogram die unless it can be self-sufficient.\n  Given the choice between having no flood insurance program--that, \ntherefore, would mean no homeowner would have any insurance available \nto them, and, of course, it dramatically reduces the value of the home \nif you cannot get flood insurance and you are in a flood plain--or \nhaving a flood insurance program under the conditions our colleagues \ninsisted on, there was a need to have a flood insurance program. But \nbecause I knew that had some potential rate shock to individuals, the \nstudy I required and sought and achieved in the flood insurance bill \nlast year was because of this concern of unaffordability for too many \nfamilies. That was even before Superstorm Sandy struck.\n  While my friends on the other side of the aisle protested my efforts \nto provide assistance to help low- and middle-income families afford \ninsurance, I was able to include a requirement that FEMA conduct this \nstudy on affordability. Well, it has been 10 months since we passed the \nreauthorization, and there is still no study.\n  Unfortunately, my concerns about premiums becoming unaffordable have \nalready come true for many New Jersey homeowners. Until FEMA does its \njob and provides options, according to the law, to improve \naffordability, the people of New Jersey should not have to face these \nskyrocketing premiums at a time they are, in essence, getting a triple \nwhammy: They lost their homes or their homes are dramatically \nuninhabitable, they have to rebuild--in many cases, because of new \nflood maps, they will have to elevate--and they will have to pay \nincredibly higher premiums. That is simply a devastation that should \nnot take place.\n  We all remember the devastation that happened in New Jersey in late \nOctober and the way the country came together to help the victims. Last \nweek we marked the 6-month anniversary of Sandy, and the work is far \nfrom over. We still have too many people out of their homes and too \nmany people who are afraid of losing their homes.\n  New Jersey families already suffered from a natural disaster. The \nnext disaster should not be a manmade one. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich).

Mr. President, to many Vermonters, Joel Najman is part of \nrock-and-roll radio history. Taking the reins of the Vermont Public \nRadio show ``My Place'' 30 years ago this spring, he captivated rock-\nand-roll enthusiasts from around the region and staked his claim in \nVermont radio history.\n  Marcelle and I have known Joel for many years and have followed his \ncareer with great interest. Starting in radio at Vermont's own \nMiddlebury College, Joel went on to WJOY in South Burlington and \ncontinues to work WDEV in Waterbury, in addition to hosting ``My \nPlace'' on Vermont Public Radio.\n  Joel first joined ``My Place'' as a substitute host in 1982. After \ntaking over full time in 1983, he took the show far beyond an ``oldies \nrock radio hour'' and made it his mission to apply cultural and \nhistorical context to rock music for his listeners. In each hour-long \nepisode, he examines rock-and-roll history, providing his listeners \nwith details that often take years to accumulate. He has even been \nknown to spend his entire radio hour picking apart a single song.\n  In 2004, he was inducted into the Vermont Broadcaster's Hall of Fame, \nand the Vermont State Legislature recently passed a resolution honoring \nhim as a ``rock and roll impresario.'' Today, I would like to \ncongratulate Joel for his 30 years as host of ``My Place.'' I ask \nunanimous consent an article from the Vermont publication, Seven Days, \nentitled, ``Vermont Legislature Honors `My Place' Host Joel Najman'' be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From Seven Days, Apr. 26, 2013]\n\n        Vermont Legislature Honors ``My Place'' Host Joel Najman\n\n                            (By Dan Bolles)\n\n       On Wednesday, April 24, the Vermont Legislature surprised \n     Joel Najman with a resolution congratulating the local DJ on \n     his 30th anniversary as the host of the Vermont Public Radio \n     show, and rock-and-roll time machine, ``My Place.''\n       ``My Place'' was originally hosted by David Field and began \n     life as a wide-ranging, interactive retrospective of rock and \n     roll from the 1950s and '60s. But Najman dramatically \n     revamped the show's format when he took over in 1983, after \n     serving as a substitute host the year prior.\n       Najman is as passionate a musicologist as he is a fan, \n     which is really saying something. In each hourlong episode, \n     he hones in on a specific theme or topic, sometimes \n     sharpening his focus to a single song, and examines its \n     historical context and cultural importance in painstaking \n     detail.\n       He's said those details can take years--yes, years--of \n     sleuthing to fully unearth. Recent episodes of ``My Place'' \n     have explored the first and second waves of the British \n     Invasion, Berry Gordy's pre-Motown canon and ``Popular Songs \n     About Women.''\n       ``There are a lot of oldies stations, and you can buy \n     oldies CDs, or go online and MP3 them or however you want to \n     get the music,'' said Najman in a 2007 interview with Seven \n     Days celebrating his 25th anniversary. ``But it's relating it \n     to the evolving culture of that time and the stories behind \n     the songs--how they came about, how they were made--which has \n     always been my hobby.''\n       Some hobby.\n       If you're into stiff, overly formal verbiage with lots of \n     ``Whereas''-es, you can read the full resolution here. \n     Whereas, if you'd like to hear from the man himself, Najman \n     will appear as a guest on VPR's ``Vermont Edition'' on \n     Monday, April 29.\n       Whereas, you could also listen to ``My Place'' on VPR \n     Saturdays at 8 p.m.\n       Congrats, Joel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/08/senate-section/article/S3248-3", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3248-S3249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO BRIAN JOSEPH DAVID\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. David's expertise in continuity issues greatly enhanced \nthe safety and security of the legislative, executive, and judicial \nbranches of government.\n  While serving as the Detection Project Officer for the Joint Program \nOffice of Biological Defense, JPO-BD, Mr. David supervised and operated \nDOD's first integrated biological and chemical detection system, which \nwas deployed overseas for force protection during Operation Desert \nThunder in Kuwait. He also created the Concept of Operations for the \nPortal Shield biological detection Advanced Concept Technology \nDemonstration, ACTD, Program, which was implemented during actual \ndeployment conditions. He was awarded the Superior Civilian Service \nAward for successfully leading this deployment overseas.\n  Mr. David played an integral role providing advice and counsel to \nassist national emergency managers as they worked to mitigate and \nrecover evidence from biological warfare attacks on the Senate. Mr. \nDavid's knowledge and expertise significantly reduced the recovery time \nand expenses related to the anthrax and ricin attacks on the Senate. He \noversaw a major chemical, biological, radiological, and explosives \ndefense effort to protect our country's national assets. By combining \nsurveillance and identification technologies, defensive measures and \nmitigation capabilities, Mr. David formed a standard\n\n[[Page S3249]]\n\nby which other large-scale protective efforts are now measured.\n  I commend Mr. David's contributions and longstanding career in public \nservice. I, along with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, \ncongratulate him on his well-earned retirement and wish him well in his \nfuture endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/08/senate-section/article/S3249-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     JOINT COMMITTEE ON THE LIBRARY\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER.

Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 70th \nAnniversary of the Battle of Attu.\n  The Battle of Attu is often times forgotten or dismissed, but this \nbattle is an important part of our history as a Nation. After all, it \nwas the last battle between warring nations to be fought in North \nAmerica.\n  During WWII Alaska was still a territory to the United States, and in \n1942, Japan seized three islands off the end of the Aleutian chain in \nthe most southwest part of Alaska. Japan prepared the island for the \ninevitable counterattack.\n  On May 11 1943, the Americans launched towards Attu Island, and a \nbattle raged until May 29 when 800 Japanese soldiers employed a full \nfledged Banzai attack, fighting hand to hand. While the Japanese attack \ncrumbled,\n\n[[Page S3251]]\n\nJapanese soldiers pulled grenades, dying by their own hand as a sign of \nhonor. By the afternoon, the battle was over. American forces had \nprevailed.\n  This battle was remarkable in many ways. More men were killed in \naction on Attu than at Pearl Harbor. It also remains the only time \nAmerican soldiers have fought an invading army on American soil since \nthe war of 1812. Last summer I had the honor of travelling to Attu with \nAdmiral Ostebo, the Coast Guard District 17 Commander, where we \ndedicated a permanent memorial to the sacrifice of the Attu villagers. \nNow all who walk the hills of Attu will be reminded of the sacrifice \nAttu village residents and other Alaskans made during World War II.\n  An article in the Anchorage Daily News by Mike Dunham did a great job \nin relaying the story of the battle, and I ask unanimous consent to \nhave it printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Anchorage Daily News, May 4, 2013]\n\n           70 years ago this month, the Battle of Attu raged\n\n                            (By Mike Dunham)\n\n       Cpl. Joe Sasser was asleep in his pup tent on a cold, soggy \n     morning 70 years ago when the alarm sounded. ``Somebody was \n     shouting, `The Japs have come through!' '' he recalled.\n       Sasser's outfit, the 50th Engineers, were builders, not \n     fighters. Most of the men--and there weren't a lot of them--\n     were what the Army calls noncombatants. Their job was to make \n     roads and move supplies to the soldiers on the front lines. \n     The strung-out line of supply tents was not fortified. The \n     soldiers had rifles, not machine guns.\n       He struggled into his perpetually damp leather boots--``Not \n     the right attire'' for the snow and mud of Alaska, he said--\n     grabbed his helmet and M-1 rifle, went to an embankment \n     created when the road was pushed through a few days earlier \n     and peered over the side.\n       ``The Japanese were moving up the hill,'' he said. ``The \n     ravines were full of them'' in numbers that far exceeded the \n     Americans at the outpost.\n       He watched the mass of determined, desperate men swarm \n     toward him in an action no U.S. soldier had faced since the \n     War of 1812--a bayonet charge by an enemy invader on American \n     soil.\n       Thus began the Battle of Engineer Hill, the last battle \n     between warring nations to be fought in North America.\n\n\n                         Theater of frustration\n\n       In 1942 Japan seized three islands at the end of Alaska's \n     Aleutian chain. Only one, Attu, had a village. The citizens, \n     mostly Aleut Natives, were sent to internment camps in Japan. \n     The invaders prepared the island for the counterattack they \n     knew would come.\n       Historians debate whether Japan's Alaska incursion was a \n     feint to draw attention away from their real target, Midway \n     Island, or part of an ambitious plan to create a virtual \n     ``fence'' across the Pacific.\n       Either way, the propaganda value was undeniable. The \n     Territory of Alaska was part of the North American continent, \n     sharing the mainland with the 48 states. The occupation by a \n     hostile force, even of an island 1,000 miles from the coast, \n     constituted an embarrassment that could not be tolerated.\n       On May 11, 1943, the Americans launched the Battle of Attu \n     with amphibious landings from two directions.\n       The day began in fog, Sasser recalled in a phone call from \n     his home in Carthage, Miss., last month. ``But it cleared up \n     somewhat later in the day. We got on our boats and went \n     ashore at Massacre Bay,'' the southern landing site.\n       ``There was no resistance.''\n       It was a misleading start.\n       American intelligence originally estimated Japanese \n     strength at 500 men. There were more like 2,500. U.S. maps \n     were incomplete or inaccurate. Planners failed to understand \n     the swampy tundra that rose from the beach, a skim of grass \n     over bottomless muck. Soldiers went ashore in summer uniforms \n     and slick-bottom leather boots suitable for desert combat.\n       The defenders waited in the steep mountains, cloaked in \n     clouds, set in positions to cover the approaches in \n     crossfire. When the Americans were well into Massacre Valley, \n     the Japanese opened up with machine guns and mortars. The \n     valley offered little cover and no quick retreat. The advance \n     ground to a halt and the scene turned into what one historian \n     has called ``the theater of military frustration.''\n       Planes supposed to provide air cover crashed in the \n     Aleutian winds. Some attacked American soldiers by mistake. \n     The offshore armada couldn't see or reach inland targets \n     where U.S. forces were getting ripped up. Heavy guns and \n     supplies barely moved off the beach as heavy equipment bogged \n     down in the mire.\n       ``The invasion of Attu was scheduled for a three-day \n     deal,'' Sasser said. ``Three days, they told us, and we'd be \n     out of there.''\n       On the fifth day the commanding general was replaced. \n     Reinforcements poured in as the Americans suffered heavy \n     losses--not just from the bullets but from exposure. Some \n     froze or died from hypothermia. ``Trench foot'' and frostbite \n     crippled their numbers. So did the psychological battering of \n     constant incoming fire.\n       ``We went on one detail all the way across the valley to \n     pick up a guy who'd lost his marbles,'' Sasser said. ``He was \n     really a zombie at that point. He followed us back, almost \n     like a child, not saying anything.''\n\n\n                            Gallons of blood\n\n       Historian John Cloe observes that ``two under-strength \n     Japanese infantry battalions on half-rations'' repeatedly \n     threw back six battalions of amply supplied U.S. infantry. \n     But bit by bit the Americans pushed ahead--particularly on \n     days when air support could reach them.\n       On the seventh day, the Japanese retreated toward Chichagof \n     Harbor. The Americans' northern and southern landing forces \n     finally met. The Americans slowly took possession of \n     strategic ground, one yard at a time, each little victory \n     measured in gallons of blood. By May 28, the Japanese were \n     cornered at Chichagof Harbor.\n       Commander Col. Yasuyo Yamazaki had less than half his \n     forces still able to fight. They were almost out of \n     ammunition and near starvation.\n       But the valley above the harbor was lightly defended with \n     the Americans' main fighting units dispersed along the high \n     ground--and there were caches of U.S. supplies at the top.\n       Yamazaki devised a last-ditch plan. A surprise attack could \n     throw the Americans in Chichigof Valley back in panic. In the \n     rout, his men might reach the heavy artillery in Massacre \n     Valley and turn the Americans' own guns against them. He \n     could replenish his stock of weapons, hold strategic ground, \n     cut supply lines, divide the dispirited American forces and \n     perhaps maintain a stalemate until help arrived.\n       But he knew the odds of success were slim. He ordered all \n     documents burned. Men too sick or injured to fight died \n     either by their own hand or from an overdose of morphine.\n\n\n                                 Banzai\n\n       Just before dawn on May 29, Americans in the valley were \n     told to leave their positions and get a hot breakfast at the \n     regimental mess tent. Cloe suspects the order may have been \n     spread by an English-speaking Japanese infiltrator.\n       The groggy men were thinking of coffee when upwards of 800 \n     screaming Japanese came charging out of the mist and dark. \n     The Americans were caught off guard and overrun. Fighting was \n     hand-to-hand. It was impossible to see what was going on. \n     There were no prisoners.\n       The Japanese reached the medical tents and slaughtered the \n     wounded in their cots. Their death shrieks added to the \n     chaos. U.S. troops, their top officers dead, uncertain of the \n     number or positions of the invisible enemy, scattered or \n     retreated.\n       It was one of those soldiers, fleeing over Engineer Hill, \n     who gave the warning that woke Sasser.\n       Among those escaping the carnage was an unarmed doctor. \n     ``He asked for a gun, but nobody had two,'' Sasser said. ``He \n     disappeared for a while and came back with a rifle and took \n     up position with us. He wanted to be in the fight.''\n       Dr. John Bassett was killed about 15 feet from Sasser.\n       Sasser had a slight advantage over many of the other men. \n     He had trained as a scout before being transferred to the \n     engineers. As he looked down on the approaching Japanese, he \n     felt lucky that he'd moved his tent the night before.\n       ``Three of us initially pitched at the crest of a ravine. \n     Then, I can't remember why, we moved 40 to 50 yards farther \n     up the hill to the road bed,'' he said. ``Two other guys \n     thought it was a good spot and pitched there. They were \n     bayonetted in their sleeping bags.''\n       Sasser credited a small embankment along the road for \n     saving him from a similar fate. ``It saved our lives.''\n       Outnumbered and rattled, a thin line of bulldozer drivers, \n     mechanics, medics and cooks formed a hasty defense. Some of \n     the men didn't have time to put on their boots. The only \n     automatic weapons they had were those dropped by the men in \n     retreat.\n       But the Japanese had even less, little more than bayonets, \n     swords, knives and sticks along with a few precious bullets. \n     Nonetheless, they engaged the Americans with a ferocity that \n     Sasser recalls to this day.\n       ``They were a tenacious group,'' he said. ``I was \n     surprised. It was dishonor for them to be captured and an \n     honor to be killed.''\n       Yamazaki died with his sword in hand. The Japanese fell \n     back and reassembled for a second charge. The Americans had \n     their rifles ready.\n       ``We picked 'em off one by one,'' Sasser said.\n       As their assault crumbled, the remaining Japanese each took \n     the grenade he kept for himself, gripped it to his chest or \n     his head--and pulled the pin.\n       The battle was over. The valley, in the words of one \n     historian, looked like an excavated cemetery. Hundreds of \n     corpses from both sides lay atop the rock and tundra.\n       ``Then we had to go down there and pick `em up,'' Sasser \n     said.\n       Morning's heroes became the afternoon's grave diggers.\n\n\n                               Aftermath\n\n       The Battle of Attu, often dismissed or forgotten, was \n     remarkable in many ways.\n\n[[Page S3252]]\n\n       More men were killed in action on Attu than at Pearl \n     Harbor: at least 2,350 Japanese--plus those never accounted \n     for--and 549 Americans; 1,148 Americans were wounded and \n     2,100 listed as casualties due to cold and shell shock. How \n     many Americans died as a result of injuries in the weeks \n     after the battle is uncertain, but some say it was equal to \n     or greater than the battlefield deaths.\n       Fewer than 30 Japanese were captured alive.\n       It was the only land battle in the war fought in the \n     Americas, the first amphibious landing by the U.S. Army and, \n     aside from Iwo Jima, the most costly in terms of the \n     percentage of American casualties. ``For every hundred of the \n     enemy, about 71 Americans were killed or wounded,'' according \n     to the official Army history.\n       It was the first time in the war that the U.S. military \n     retook occupied American territory, and the first time the \n     Army encountered the fanatical fight-to-the-death ethos of \n     the Japanese.\n       It remains the only time American soldiers have fought an \n     invading army on American soil since the War of 1812.\n       It was the deadliest battle on the continent since the \n     Civil War.\n       But history wasn't on Sasser's mind as he braced for the \n     screaming, charging enemy 70 years ago. ``At that particular \n     point I was not aware of the significance,'' he said. ``I \n     just knew we were there because it was American territory. \n     And we were going to get it back.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/08/senate-section/article/S3252-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING AUDREY THIBODEAU\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, on May 25, loving family members and \ncountless friends will gather in Presque Isle, ME, to celebrate the \nremarkable life of Audrey Bishop Thibodeau, who passed away January 2, \nat the age of 97. I rise today in tribute to a caring citizen and dear \nfriend.\n  It has been said that we all have a birth date and a death date, with \na dash in between. It's what we do with our dash that counts.\n  Audrey Thibodeau's dash was long, and she made it count. She was a \ndevoted wife, a wonderful mother, an educator, a farmer, and an \nentrepreneur. Wherever there was a need, she was a committed volunteer \nand a generous philanthropist.\n  She was born Audrey Elaine Bishop on December 13, 1915, in Caribou, \nME, my hometown. She attended Caribou public schools and, in 1937, \ngraduated from the University of Maine with a degree in nutrition. It \nwas while teaching high school home economics that she developed one of \nthe great passions of her life--raising awareness and fostering \neducation for students with reading disabilities. Her commitment to \nyouth was also seen years later when she founded a Pony Club to help \nyoung people learn the skills and responsibilities of horsemanship.\n  In 1939, she married Lawrence Thibodeau, a high school classmate. \nAfter a brief adventure with farming in New York State, they returned \nto Maine and settled in Fort Kent, on the Canadian border. It was there \nthat Audrey immersed herself in French to better appreciate the culture \nof the region.\n  The couple, with their growing family, relocated to Presque Isle in \n1946 and soon became valued members of that community. Audrey's love of \nlocal culture led her to become instrumental in the incorporation of \nthe Vera Estes House into the Presque Isle Historical Society and the \ncreation of the Cultural and Museum Center at the Old Presque Isle Fire \nHouse, which celebrates the heritage of the local area. Audrey \nwitnessed much history during her long life. Just as important, she was \ndevoted to preserving the rich history of Aroostook County for future \ngenerations.\n  Her husband, Lawrence Thibodeau, better known as ``Tib,'' passed away \nin 2008, but he will long be remembered for his contributions to Maine \nagriculture and support of the University of Maine Cooperative \nExtension Service. Together, the couple will always be remembered for \nthe Larry and Audrey Thibodeau Scholarship that helps Aroostook County \nstudents pursue careers in medicine. After Audrey's passing, her family \ncarried on her commitment to others by asking that memorial \ncontributions be made to the Audrey B. Thibodeau Charitable and \nEducational Fund.\n  Audrey's philanthropy and volunteerism earned her accolades from the \nMaine Legislature and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Presque \nIsle Area Chamber of Commerce. Her service and compassion will always \nbe cherished by the people of Aroostook County. A strong leader, Audrey \nThibodeau filled her dash with an infectious smile, enthusiasm for \nlife, assistance to others, community participation, a dedication to \nAroostook County, and a great deal of love for her remarkable family. \nMay her memory inspire us all to follow her example.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/08/senate-section/article/S3252-2", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING AROOSTOOK MEDICAL CENTER\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to commend The Aroostook \nMedical Center, TAMC, in Presque Isle, ME, for its efforts to improve \nits energy efficiency with compressed natural gas, CNG.\n  Dedicated to environmental stewardship and improving the community, \nTAMC is at the cutting edge with its conversion to CNG to meet the \nhospital's heating, cooling, and other energy needs. CNG represents a \nsensible effort to use a viable and affordable domestic energy \nalternative. This event demonstrates TAMC's efforts to create, sustain, \nand grow a modern health care organization to continue making a \npositive difference in Aroostook County. The countless and continuing \nefforts this northern Maine hospital is making to energy efficiency are \nto be commended for their lasting impact.\n  Converting to CNG is just one of the ways TAMC has reduced its carbon \nfootprint. This efficient source of energy is safer to work with, will \nlower costs, and will burn more cleanly. The conversion to CNG will not \nonly benefit the hospital and its patients and employees directly, but \nalso will benefit the entire community by reducing emissions.\n  TAMC is quickly becoming a leader in environmentally friendly \npractices in northern Maine. The hospital has made changes to its \nnutritional program by eliminating disposable kitchenware, which has \nreduced the amount of waste it sends to the area's landfill. In \naddition, TAMC partners with the University of Maine at Presque Isle to \nimprove composting. TAMC also purchases produce from MSAD No. 1 school \nfarm, local farmers, and other small local growers to support the \ncommunity and reduce transportation emissions.\n  Whether it is taking actions as small as reducing waste or as large \nas converting to CNG, TAMC is making a positive impact on the area, \nimproving both public health and the environment. I commend TAMC for \nits commitment to conservation and improving efficiency. TAMC is truly \nstanding up to its motto, TAMC: More Than a Hospital.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/08/senate-section/article/S3252-3", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3252-S3253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              CONGRATULATING THE BOSTON CHILDREN'S MUSEUM\n\n Mr. COWAN. Mr. President, today I am delighted to recognize \nthe Boston Children's Museum for receiving the National Medal for \nMuseum and Library Service. I had the pleasure of congratulating the \nstaff of the Boston Children's Museum earlier today before they headed \nto the White House to have the medal presented in a ceremony by the \nFirst Lady.\n  This medal is the Nation's highest honor conferred on museums and \nlibraries. The award is given to institutions which demonstrate \nextraordinary and innovative approaches to public service, exceeding \nthe expected levels of community outreach. Out of 33 well-deserved \nfinalists, only 10 were selected to receive the medal.\n  The Boston Children's Museum is a center of family in Massachusetts \nand it comes as no surprise to me that this revered institution would \nreceive the Nation's highest honor.\n  Children spend their whole day learning, and Boston Children's Museum \nprovides resources for families and educators to help support that \ncontinuous discovery. It provides a welcoming, imaginative, child \ncentered learning environment that supports families and promotes the \nhealthy development of all children.\n  Boston Children's Museum is one of the oldest and largest children's \nmuseums in the world. It was founded in 1913 by a group of visionary \neducators as a center for the exchange of materials and ideas to \nadvance the teaching of\n\n[[Page S3253]]\n\nscience. For the past century, the museum has provided children with \nopportunities to engage in joyful discovery experiences that instill an \nappreciation of our world, develop foundational skills, and spark a \nlifelong love of learning.\n  The Museum has prided itself on developing exhibits and programs that \nemphasize hands on engagement and learning through experience. Children \nuse play-based learning activities to spark their natural creativity \nand curiosity. The exhibits focus on science, culture, environmental \nawareness, health and fitness, and the arts. Museum educators also \ndevelop programs and activities that address literacy, performing arts, \nscience and math, visual arts, cultures, and health and wellness.\n  Boston Children's Museum is a pioneer in early childhood education \nand development and works with research partners to gain a deeper \nunderstanding of how children learn, and how they develop physically, \nintellectually, and socio-emotionally. The museum has teamed up with \nresearchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to create \nPlay Lab--an exhibit featuring active research in cognitive \ndevelopment. They have also worked with Harvard University on research \ninvolving developmental studies and social cognition. Additionally, \nthey have worked with researchers from Boston College to explore the \npsychology of the arts and children's understanding of emotional \ndevelopment.\n  I would like to congratulate Carole Charnow, president and chief \nexecutive officer, and all the employees at the Boston Children's \nMuseum on receiving the National Medal for Museum and Library Service.\n  For 100 years, their outstanding efforts have inspired lifelong \nlearning for generations of children and have served as a model for the \nNation in early childhood education and development. I believe that the \nBoston Children's Museum will continue to be the best children's museum \nin the world and I look forward to the innovation and leadership they \nwill deliver over the next 100 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/08/senate-section/article/S3253-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONGRATULATING JOHN ANTHONY SCIRE\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Dr. John \nAnthony Scire, who has been awarded the 2013 Dean's Award for Teaching \nby a Member of the Contingent Faculty of the University of Nevada, \nReno. My home State of Nevada is proud and privileged to acknowledge an \nextraordinary educator and leader.\n  Since 1993, Dr. John Scire has dedicated himself to the students and \nfaculty of the College of Liberal Arts at the University of Nevada, \nReno, UNR, as an adjunct professor. His extensive education in areas of \ninternational relations, international finance, and political science \nhas prepared him for his service to the students of UNR. Nevada is \nfortunate to have such great educational leadership serving the \nstudents across our great State.\n  Prior to working in higher education, Dr. John Scire served nearly \nthree decades in the U.S. military. His work included intelligence, \ncounterintelligence, and psychological warfare operations that were \nvital to maintaining the national security of our country. Dr. Scire, \nlike all of our military men and women, dedicated his life to serve \nthis great Nation, and I am grateful for his sacrifices.\n  I want to acknowledge and thank Dr. John Scire for his faithful \nservice to our country, both in the classroom and protecting America.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Sergeant \nTimothy Hall, an extraordinary Nevadan who sacrificed his well-being in \ndefense of this great Nation. The State of Nevada and the U.S. Army are \nproud and grateful for his selfless service and dedication to \nprotecting our freedom.\n  Sergeant Hall put service to his Nation above his personal safety in \n2010 when he was deployed to Afghanistan. He was willing to stand up \nand defend the United States in some of the harshest conditions. Just 6 \nmonths into Sergeant Hall's deployment, he was critically wounded in an \nenemy mortar attack that resulted in the loss of both his legs. Since \nthen, Sergeant Hall has endured more than 60 surgeries and countless \nhours of rehabilitation.\n  In Sergeant Hall, I see the values of integrity, service, and \nexcellence that define the brave men and women in our Armed Forces. It \nis these virtues that will define the rest of his life as he continues \nto adapt to the civilian world as a disabled veteran in his hometown of \nHawthorne, NV. Sergeant Hall is the kind of patriot who, at the end of \nthe day, is a hero that dedicated himself wholly to the most \nprofessional fighting force the world has ever known. America is an \nexceptional nation because of heroes like Sergeant Hall who are \ndedicated to securing our freedom no matter what the situation, no \nmatter what the challenge.\n  All of our Nation's service men and women know all too well the price \nthat is paid for freedom. Each and every day, our troops are serving \nthe United States to protect our liberties. They dedicate their lives \nin service and constantly make grave sacrifices to ensure the safety of \nour country. For all who served and all who continue to serve, I cannot \nthank you enough, and you will continue to have my unwavering support.\n  I ask my colleagues to stand with me in honoring Sergeant Hall's \nservice to our Nation. Let us continue to be mindful of our dedicated \nservice members who fight to protect and preserve the ideals of freedom \nand democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/08/senate-section/article/S3253-3", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING VIVA FLORIDA 500\n\n Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize the events taking place in my home State of \nFlorida commemorating five centuries of historic and cultural \nsignificance.\n  Five hundred years ago Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Leon led an \nexpedition from the island of Puerto Rico in search of new territory \nfor Spain to claim. Ponce de Leon laid claim to the new territory they \nfound, calling the site La Florida because of the lush floral beauty \nthat he saw. From our beautiful sandy beaches, to our rivers and lakes, \nto the Everglades in South Florida, our State remains true to Ponce de \nLeon's first description.\n  Ponce de Leon's landing can be considered the first step in Florida's \njourney to become a part of our great country. Ponce de Leon was the \nfirst European to land on what is now the continental United States. \nHis landing predates some of the most treasured historical sites and \nmoments in the United States, including the English landing at \nJamestown, VA, and the Pilgrims landing at Plymouth, MA.\n  It is also important to recognize the State of Florida's Native \nAmerican population during these events. Native Americans inhabited \nterritories in and around Florida prior to Ponce de Leon's arrival and \ncontinue to make a positive contribution to our State and its culture.\n  Since its founding over five centuries ago, Florida continues to \ndisplay its rich history by contributing new ideas, culture, and events \nto the American experience. I am proud to come from a State with a \ndeeply rooted history, and I celebrate the State of Florida's \nleadership both past and present.\n  Mr. President, colleagues, please join me in recognizing the State of \nFlorida and its 500th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/08/senate-section/article/S3253-4", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3253-S3254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ANDREW DOWNS\n\n Mr. SHELBY.

Andrew is a native of Irondale, \nAL, and is a sophomore at the Alabama School of Fine Arts. He is the \nprincipal bassist for the Alabama Symphony Youth Orchestra.\n  The National Youth Orchestra of the United States of America is an \ninitiative of Carnegie Hall's Weill Music Institute that brings \ntogether 120 of the most promising and talented young musicians from \nacross the country to play together across the Nation and the globe. \nThis year marks their inaugural session.\n\n[[Page S3254]]\n\n  Andrew was selected out of a pool of 2,500 applicants from all 50 \nStates, and is clearly one of Alabama's most talented young musicians. \nHe is a member of the National Junior Honor Society and also plays the \nviolin, cello, and piano. He hopes to one day pursue a career as a bass \nplayer for a symphony orchestra.\n  This talented young man will be the only Alabamian in the orchestra, \nas well as one of only 10 bassists selected. I am proud to represent a \nState that is home to promising young individuals such as Andrew, who \nare committed to displaying excellence in their education and the arts.\n  Further, I wish Andrew Downs all the best as he embarks on his \njourney playing with the National Youth Orchestra.

Rockefeller, Mrs. \n        Murray, Mr. Brown, Mr. Tester, Mr. Begich, Mr. Blumenthal, Ms. \n        Hirono, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Johanns, Mr. Moran, Mr. Boozman, and \n        Mr. Heller):\n  S. 893. A bill to provide for an increase, effective December 1, \n2013, in the rates of compensation for veterans with service-connected \ndisabilities and the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation for \nthe survivors of certain disabled veterans, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, I am proud to introduce the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-\nLiving Adjustment Act of 2013. I am also pleased to be joined by \nRanking Member Burr and all of my colleagues on the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs in introducing this important legislation. I look \nforward to our continued work together to improve the lives of our \nNation's veterans.\n  Effective December 1, 2013, this measure would direct the Secretary \nof Veterans Affairs to increase the rates of veterans' compensation to \nkeep pace with a rise in the cost-of-living, should an adjustment be \nprompted by an increase in the Consumer Price Index, CPI. Referred to \nas the COLA, this important legislation would make an increase \navailable to veterans at the same level as the increase provided to \nrecipients of Social Security benefits.\n  Last year, I was proud to cosponsor the Veterans' Compensation Cost-\nof-Living Adjustment Act of 2012, which provided a 1.7 percent increase \nin veterans' compensation. The annual COLA legislation is so important \nbecause it impacts vital benefits, including veterans' disability \ncompensation and dependency and indemnity compensation for surviving \nspouses and children. In fiscal year 2014, it is projected that over \n4.2 million veterans and survivors will receive compensation benefits.\n  As a longstanding advocate of our Nation's veterans, I understand the \ncritical nature of these benefits as many recipients depend upon these \ntax-free payments to feed their families,\n\n[[Page S3259]]\n\nheat their homes, pay for prescription drugs, and to provide for the \nneeds of spouses and children. We have an obligation to the men and \nwomen who have sacrificed so much to serve our country and who now \ndeserve nothing less than the full support of a grateful Nation. The \nCOLA brings us one step closer to fulfilling our Nation's promise to \ncare for our brave veterans and their families.\n  We also must continue to ensure that these benefits are not \ndiminished by the effects of inflation. For this reason, I strongly \noppose the President's proposal to adopt the chained CPI. I am joined \nin opposition by nearly every major veterans' organization in America. \nThe Gold Star Wives, The American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, \nDisabled American Veterans and many, many more all oppose the chained \nCPI.\n  I will do everything within my power as Chairman of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee to ensure we honor the promise we made to veterans \nand survivors. It is important that this country address our budget \ndeficit, but there are fairer ways to do it than on the backs of \ndisabled veterans--men and women who have already sacrificed so much \nfor their country.\n  I ask my colleagues to join with me in honoring the promise that has \nbeen made to our Nation's veterans. We cannot allow this misguided \nattempt to balance the budget on the backs of those who have so proudly \nserved our Nation diminish the benefits provided to veterans and their \nsurvivors.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 893\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

INCREASE IN RATES OF DISABILITY COMPENSATION AND \n                   DEPENDENCY AND INDEMNITY COMPENSATION.\n\n         (a) Rate Adjustment.--Effective on December 1, 2013, the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall increase, in accordance \n     with subsection (c), the dollar amounts in effect on November \n     30, 2013, for the payment of disability compensation and \n     dependency and indemnity compensation under the provisions \n     specified in subsection (b).\n         (b) Amounts To Be Increased.--The dollar amounts to be \n     increased pursuant to subsection (a) are the following:\n         (1) Wartime disability compensation.--Each of the dollar \n     amounts under section 1114 of title 38, United States Code.\n         (2) Additional compensation for dependents.--Each of the \n     dollar amounts under section 1115(1) of such title.\n         (3) Clothing allowance.--The dollar amount under section \n     1162 of such title.\n         (4) Dependency and indemnity compensation to surviving \n     spouse.--Each of the dollar amounts under subsections (a) \n     through (d) of section 1311 of such title.\n         (5) Dependency and indemnity compensation to children.--\n     Each of the dollar amounts under sections 1313(a) and 1314 of \n     such title.\n         (c) Determination of Increase.--Each dollar amount \n     described in subsection (b) shall be increased by the same \n     percentage as the percentage by which benefit amounts payable \n     under title II of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et \n     seq.) are increased effective December 1, 2013, as a result \n     of a determination under section 215(i) of such Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 415(i)).\n         (d) Special Rule.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs may \n     adjust administratively, consistent with the increases made \n     under subsection (a), the rates of disability compensation \n     payable to persons under section 10 of Public Law 85-857 (72 \n     Stat. 1263) who have not received compensation under chapter \n     11 of title 38, United States Code.\n         (e) Publication of Adjusted Rates.--The Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs shall publish in the Federal Register the \n     amounts specified in subsection (b), as increased under \n     subsection (a), not later than the date on which the matters \n     specified in section 215(i)(2)(D) of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 415(i)(2)(D)) are required to be published by \n     reason of a determination made under section 215(i) of such \n     Act during fiscal year 2014.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANDERS:\n  S. 894. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to extend \nexpiring authority for work-study allowances for individuals who are \npursuing programs of rehabilitation, education, or training under laws \nadministered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, to expand such \nauthority to certain outreach services provided through congressional \noffices, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as the Chairman of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, I am committed to ensuring we provide our Nation's veterans \nthe opportunities they need to successfully transition back to civilian \nlife. One of the programs afforded to veterans to assist them during \nthis difficult time is the Department of Veterans Affairs' work-study \nprogram.\n  VA's work-study program provides veterans participating in several VA \neducational, vocational, and rehabilitation programs the opportunity to \nwork alongside school certifying officials and State and Federal \nemployees to assist veterans with VA benefits and services. In fiscal \nyear 2012, this program assisted more than 10,000 veterans, who \nreceived approximately $25.7 million in work study payments. Under \ncurrent law, this program is set to expire this year.\n  I am proud to introduce legislation that would extend VA's work-study \nprogram for three more years. This legislation would allow veterans to \ncontinue doing such important activities as conducting outreach \nprograms with State Approving Agencies; working with a National \nCemetery or a State Veteran's Cemetery; assisting in caring for \nveterans in State Homes; and working with school certifying officials, \nclaims processors, and other state and federal employees to provide \nmuch needed benefits and services to our Nation's heroes.\n  VA has determined work-study participants do not have the authority \nto work in congressional offices, despite their successful service in \nsuch offices in the past. These veterans were critical to Congress' \nefforts to understand the needs of our Nation's veterans. They used \ncongressional resources and personal experience to help veterans access \nearned benefits and services. This legislation would allow veterans to \nwork in congressional offices to assist other veterans with casework \nissues, help congressional staff address the unique challenges facing \nour newest generation of veterans, and develop the knowledge and \nexperience needed to successfully transition into the civilian \nworkforce.\n  Our veterans have sacrificed so much in defense of this country. They \ndeserve a seamless transition when they look to return to civilian \nlife. This legislation would expand a program that has been so vital in \npreparing veterans to succeed in the civilian workforce.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 894\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prevent the doubling of the interest rate for \nFederal subsidized student loans for the 2013-2014 academic year by \nproviding funds for such loans through the Federal Reserve System, to \nensure that such loans are available at interest rates that are \nequivalent to the interest rates at which the Federal Government \nprovides loans to banks through the discount window operated by the \nFederal Reserve System, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, on July 1, the interest rate on new \nfederally subsidized student loans is set to double from 3.4 to 6.8 \npercent. That means unless Congress acts, for millions of young people \nthe cost of borrowing money to go to college will double.\n  The student debt problem in this country is a quiet but growing \ncrisis. Today's graduates collectively carry more than $1 trillion in \ndebt--more than all the outstanding credit card debt in the whole \ncountry. Doubling the interest rate on new student loans will just \nincrease the pressure on our young people.\n  Keep in mind: these young people didn't go to the mall and run up \ncharges on a credit card. They worked hard, they stayed in class, they \nlearned new skills, and they borrowed what they needed to pay for their \neducation. Their education will improve their opportunities in life, \nbut their education will not just help these students. When they \nacquire more skills, these students help us build a strong and \ncompetitive economy and they strengthen our middle class.\n  Student interest rates are set to double in less than 2 months, but \nso far this Congress has done nothing--nothing--to address this \nproblem. Some people say that we can't afford to help our kids through \nschool by keeping student loan interest rates low. But right now, as I \nspeak, the Federal Government offers far lower interest rates on loans, \nevery single day--they just don't do it for everyone.\n  Right now, a big bank can get a loan through the Federal Reserve \ndiscount window at a rate of about 0.75 percent. But this summer a \nstudent who is trying to get a loan to go to college will pay almost 7 \npercent. In other words, the Federal Government is going to charge \ninterest rates that are nine times higher than the rates for the \nbiggest banks--the same banks that destroyed millions of jobs and \nnearly broke the economy. That isn't right. And that is why I am \nintroducing legislation today to give students the same deal that we \ngive to the big banks.\n  The Bank on Students Loan Fairness Act would allow students eligible \nfor federally subsidized Stafford loans to borrow at the same rate the \nbig banks get through the Federal Reserve discount window. For 1 year \nthe Federal Reserve would make funds available to the Department of \nEducation to make loans to students at the same low rates offered to \nthe big banks. This will give students relief from high interest rates \nwhile giving Congress a chance to find a long-term solution.\n  Some may say we can't afford this proposal. I would remind them the \nFederal Government currently makes 36 cents in profit for every $1 it \nlends to students. Add up those profits and you'll find next year \nstudent loans will bring in $34 billion. Meanwhile, the banks pay \ninterest that is one-ninth of the amount students will be asked to pay. \nThat is just wrong. It doesn't reflect our values. We shouldn't be \nprofiting from our students who are drowning in debt while we are \ngiving a great deal to the big banks. We should be investing in our \nyoung people so they can get good jobs and grow the economy, so let's \ngive them the same great deal the banks get.\n  Some explain that we give banks exceptionally low interest rates \nbecause the economy is still shaky and banks need access to cheap \ncredit to continue the recovery. But our students are just as important \nas banks to a strong recovery, and the debt they carry poses a serious \nrisk to that recovery. In fact, in March of this year, the Federal \nReserve said because of the economic impact on family budgets, high \nlevels of student debt pose a risk to our shaky economic recovery.\n  If the Federal Reserve can float trillions of dollars to large \nfinancial institutions at low interest rates to grow the economy, \nsurely they can float the Department of Education the money to fund our \nstudents, keep us competitive, and grow our middle class.\n  Let's face it, banks get a great deal when they borrow money from the \nFed. In effect, the American taxpayer is investing in those banks. We \nshould make the same kind of investment in our young people who are \ntrying to get an education. Lend them the money and make them pay it \nback, but give our kids a break on the interest they pay. Let's bank on \nstudents.\n  The Bank on Students Loan Fairness Act is my first stand-alone bill \nin the Senate. I am introducing this bill because our students are \nfacing a crisis. We cannot stand by and simply watch. This is about our \nstudents, our economy, and our values. The Bank on Students Loan \nFairness Act is a first step toward helping young people who are \ndrowning in debt. Unlike the big banks, students don't have armies of \nlobbyists and lawyers. They have only their voices. And they call on us \nto do what is right.\n  I thank the Chair.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 909. A bill to amend the Federal Direct Loan Program under the \nHigher Education Act of 1965 to provide for student loan affordability, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Responsible \nStudent Loan Solutions Act with Senator Durbin to offer a long-term \napproach to setting student loan interest rates.\n  Congress must take swift action to prevent the doubling of the \ninterest rate on need-based loans on July 1, 54 days away. We also need \na new mechanism for setting interest rates on all federal student loans \nfor the long term so that students and taxpayers are protected, and we \nneed to take the time to get it right.\n  In April, I introduced the Student Loan Affordability Act to keep the \nrate on subsidized loans at 3.4 percent for the next 2 years. This \nwould give Congress time to debate a long-term solution as part of the \nreauthorization of the Higher Education Act.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation with Senator Durbin and \nCongressman Tierney and Congressman Courtney to overhaul the mechanism \nfor setting the interest rates on federal student loans. Instead of \nsetting a numerical rate in law, which quickly becomes out of sync with \nthe economic and interest rate environment, or locking borrowers into a \nfixed rate with no opportunity to refinance when rates drop, our \nproposal will offer adjustable rate loans for students and parents with \nthe protection of a cap on the maximum interest rate that could be \ncharged during periods of high interest rates.\n  In today's low interest rate environment, the fixed rates for student \nloans are too high, resulting in student loans generating a profit for \nthe Federal Government. If we would have maintained the variable rate \nfor student loans that was in law before 2006, the interest rate for \nstudents in repayment on their loans would be 2.39 percent this year. \nAt today's fixed rates, they will pay 3.4 percent for subsidized loans \nand 6.8 percent for unsubsidized loans. The Federal Government provides \nstudent loans to increase the number of Americans who attain college \ndegrees, not to generate revenue. Yet, according to CBO estimates, the \nFederal Government will save more than 36 cents for every dollar lent \nin the student loan programs for fiscal year 2013. CBO projects that \nthe student loan programs will continue to generate savings on the \nbacks of students through fiscal year 2023. We need to change this.\n  The Responsible Student Loan Solutions Act will offer adjustable rate \nloans for students and parents with a cap on the maximum interest rate \nthat could be charged to protect borrowers during periods of high \ninterest rates. Interest rates for need-based, subsidized loans will be \ncapped at 6.8 percent. Rates for unsubsidized and parent loans will be \ncapped at 8.25 percent. Rates will be set every year based on\n\n[[Page S3261]]\n\nthe 91-day Treasury bill plus a percentage determined by the Secretary \nof Education to cover program administration and borrower benefits. The \nSecretary must set the rate so that the student loan programs are \nrevenue neutral.\n  The Responsible Student Loan Solutions Act will also correct an \ninequity for undergraduate students who qualify for subsidized loans. \nCurrently, a dependent undergraduate student can borrow up to $31,000 \ntotal. However, the maximum amount that can be subsidized is $23,000, \nwhich means that needy students often have to resort to more expensive \nunsubsidized loans to finance a part or the remainder of their \neducation costs. The Responsible Student Loan Solutions Act will allow \nborrowers with demonstrated financial need to have up to the full loan \nlimit in the lower cost subsidized program.\n  Finally, the Responsible Student Loan Solutions Act will allow \nborrowers with high fixed-rate federal student loans to refinance those \nloans into the new variable rate loan with a cap. This could be a real \nhelp to borrowers trying to make ends meet, considering that, under \ncurrent conditions, rates calculated under a bill would be much lower \nthan the fixed rates for unsubsidized loans 6.8 percent, PLUS loans \nmade under the old bank-based program, 8.5 percent, and PLUS loans made \nthrough the Federal Direct Loan program 7.9 percent.\n  We need a multi-faceted approach to solving our student loan debt \ncrisis, which reports from the Federal Reserve and others show is a \ndrag on our economy. We cannot allow this generation of Americans to \nflounder, unable to buy a home or a car or secure credit or start a \nfamily under the weight of student debt.\n  We need to keep rates low in the short term--that means taking quick \naction to keep the rate from doubling in July. It also means over the \nlong-term, setting rates in a way that does not add to the growth of \nstudent debt. I encourage our colleagues to join Senator Durbin and me \nin cosponsoring the Responsible Student Loan Solutions Act to put in \nplace a long-term approach to setting student loan interest rates that \nis fair to students and taxpayers. I also urge our colleagues to \nsupport taking immediate steps to reassure students and families that \nthe rate on subsidized loans will not double this July.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/08/senate-section/article/S3261-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3261-S3262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 131--RECOMMENDING THE DESIGNATION OF A PRESIDENTIAL \nSPECIAL ENVOY TO THE BALKANS TO EVALUATE THE SUCCESSES AND SHORTCOMINGS \n    OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DAYTON PEACE ACCORDS IN BOSNIA AND \n HERZEGOVINA, TO PROVIDE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS, AND TO REPORT BACK TO \n                        CONGRESS WITHIN ONE YEAR\n\n  Mr. BEGICH submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

from 2009 \n     with regard to the election to the Presidency and House of \n     Peoples of BiH of Others, who are defined as those Bosnian \n     citizens who are not primarily a member of the

those people \n     consistent with the founding provisions of the Dayton Peace \n     Accords, as opposed to the existing practice, which allows \n     for the representatives of one people to be elected by the \n     members of other constituent peoples, hindering the political \n     stability of BiH;\n       Whereas only the full protection of equal political, \n     economic, legal, and religious rights of all the constituent \n     peoples and others throughout the territory of BiH, including \n     the inalienable right to return, will guarantee the future \n     stability, functionality, and effectiveness of the country;\n       Whereas the number of Bosnian Croats has declined from \n     820,000 before the war to around 460,000 remaining in BiH \n     today, as reported by the Catholic Church in BiH which has \n     played an important role in protecting rights of Catholic \n     Bosnian Croats and reporting problems and cases of \n     destruction of personal and real property of both the \n     Catholic Church and Croat returnees;\n       Whereas it is not acceptable that this negative demographic \n     trend is reflected in the reduction of constitutional rights \n     of Bosnian Croats, as that reduction directly causes \n     political and administrative dysfunctionality of the country;\n       Whereas a functional BiH as a whole is not possible without \n     a fully functional FBiH, one of the two entities established \n     by the Dayton Peace Accords, both being ethnically and \n     administratively composite;\n       Whereas FBiH's protracted poor functionality only \n     exacerbates the existing predominant separatist tendency in \n     the RS, the predominantly Serb entity of BiH, thus \n     threatening the very integrity of the country as a whole;\n       Whereas continuous economic decline is a direct consequence \n     of the fact that most of BiH's gross domestic product (GDP) \n     is generated from the publicly owned companies, which are run \n     at the RS and FBiH entity levels by political parties with \n     enduring ethnocentric agendas reflecting their particular and \n     non-common interests, preventing the further creation of \n     much-needed free enterprise business development and closely \n     integrated national internal markets;\n       Whereas the social fabric of BiH is the single most \n     important victim of the war and ensuing political conflict, \n     and the need for repair, strengthening, and further \n     development of civil society is fundamental to the country's \n     recovery and desired development;\n       Whereas the Republic of Croatia has clearly demonstrated \n     that allegiance to democracy, market economy, rule of law, \n     and respect for human and citizen rights is conducive to full \n     integration into the Euro-Atlantic community, and the \n     Government of Croatia continues to play an active role in \n     contributing to BiH's political stability, internal \n     integrity, and international viability;\n       Whereas all the other neighbors of BiH share the ambition \n     to join the European Union; and\n\n[[Page S3262]]\n\n       Whereas the future of BiH is in the European Union and \n     NATO: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) reiterates its support for the sovereignty, territorial \n     integrity, and legal continuity of BiH within its \n     internationally recognized borders, as well as the equality \n     of its three constituent peoples and others within an \n     integrated multiethnic country;\n       (2) welcomes steps taken by the government of BiH towards \n     integration into the Euro-Atlantic community and reiterates \n     its position that this commitment is in the interests of the \n     further stabilization of the region of southeastern Europe;\n       (3) emphasizes that it is urgent that BiH, as well as its \n     internal political entities, all work toward the creation of \n     an efficient and effective state able to meet its domestic \n     and international obligations with effective and functional \n     institutions, and that the national government of BiH--as \n     well as the institutions of the entities--are able to instill \n     necessary reforms in order to fulfill European Union and \n     North Atlantic Treaty Organization membership requirements;\n       (4) reiterates its call that constitutional reform in BiH \n     take the Dayton Peace Accords as its basis, but advance the \n     principles of political, economic, legal, and religious \n     equality and tolerance in order to rectify provisions that \n     conflict with the European Charter of Human Rights and the \n     ruling of the European Court of Human Rights, and to rectify \n     the conditions to enable economic development and the \n     creation of a single economic space, including through the \n     fair and effective functioning of public companies so as to \n     be consistent with the goal of successful EU membership;\n       (5) stresses the importance of privatization of the \n     publicly owned enterprises through fully transparent \n     international tenders prepared in close cooperation with the \n     EU and the Office of the High Representative (OHR) as a means \n     of avoiding the misplacement of political attention and \n     energy toward running companies rather than providing \n     effective service to the citizens of the country;\n       (6) commends the present focus of the United States \n     Government in support of stronger civil society in BiH, and \n     urges the Department of State to further increase endeavors \n     in that regard;\n       (7) believes that the Department of State and the President \n     must seek to address all these matters more emphatically in a \n     manner that provides for a just evaluation of the current \n     grievances of the three constituent peoples and the Others in \n     the two entities of the BiH;\n       (8) believes that it is of paramount importance that the \n     United States Government work closely with the EU in \n     conceiving and implementing an accession process specifically \n     made for BiH, which would link in a causal and firmly \n     conditional way the internal integration of BiH with its \n     phased integration into the EU;\n       (9) urges that it is substantially beneficial for the \n     process of building up the functional capacities of BiH to \n     the level of its full ability to enable membership in NATO \n     and the EU, that the United States Government work closely \n     with BiH's neighboring countries--especially those who are \n     signatories to the Dayton Peace Accords--ensuring consistency \n     along the lines of their own European ambitions so that they \n     actively contribute to BiH's internal integration and \n     political and administrative functionality conducive to BiH's \n     successful membership in NATO and the EU;\n       (10) reiterates that a fully functional Federation of BiH \n     entity is essential for the future of BiH as a functional and \n     stable state and therefore any envisaged reform should take \n     into account protection of the constitutional rights of all, \n     including Bosnian Croats--demographically smallest of the \n     three Dayton Peace Accords recognized constituent peoples in \n     BiH--and prevent further weakening of their position;\n       (11) believes that it is important that the United States \n     Government, together with other international actors, support \n     countries of the region in fulfilling their obligations as \n     agreed through the launching of the Sarajevo Process in 2005, \n     reaffirmed in the 2011 Belgrade Declaration, as well as \n     during the Donor Conference held in Sarajevo in April 2012, \n     aimed at ending the protracted refugee and internal-\n     displacement situation in the region of Southeast Europe and \n     finding durable solutions for the refugees and internally \n     displaced persons through the implementation of the Balkans \n     Regional Housing Programme;\n       (12) reiterates its call that the United States should \n     designate a Presidential Special Envoy to the Balkans who \n     should work in partnership with the OHR, the EU, NATO, and \n     the political leaders in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as \n     with neighboring countries, to facilitate much needed reforms \n     at all levels of government and society in BiH; and\n       (13) urges the Presidential Special Envoy, not later than \n     one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, to \n     submit to the Committees on Foreign Relations and \n     Appropriations of the Senate and the Committees on Foreign \n     Affairs and Appropriations of the House of Representatives a \n     report with targeted evaluations and discoveries, including \n     to provide proposals on how to address any ongoing \n     difficulties outlined above, as well as ways to overcome any \n     remaining political, economic, legal, or religious \n     inequalities in BiH.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url":

      REALIGNMENT AND CLOSURE AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. BEGICH (for himself, Mr. Tester, and Mr. Baucus) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Armed \nServices:\n\n                              S. Res. 132\n\n       Whereas the Department of Defense claims a 24 percent \n     surplus in domestic military infrastructure and has requested \n     domestic Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) rounds in 2015 \n     and 2017;\n       Whereas Congress rejected a request for 2 BRAC rounds made \n     by the Department of Defense in fiscal year 2013;\n       Whereas the Senate Armed Services Committee noted in title \n     XXIV of Senate Report 112-173 to accompany S. 3254 of the \n     112th Congress, that a request by the Department of Defense \n     for authority to conduct a domestic BRAC round must be \n     preceded by a comprehensive evaluation of opportunities to \n     obtain efficiencies through the consolidation of the overseas \n     operations of defense agencies and possible relocation back \n     to the United States;\n       Whereas the Base Structure Report for fiscal year 2012 of \n     the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense, \n     Installations and Environment, found that the Department of \n     Defense has 666 military sites in foreign countries, \n     including 232 in Germany, 109 in Japan, and 85 in South \n     Korea;\n       Whereas the United States has developed an increased \n     capacity to rapidly deploy around the globe, thereby reducing \n     the strategic value of an overseas footprint based largely on \n     Cold War geopolitics and an obsolete National Security \n     Strategy;\n       Whereas the Government Accountability Office concluded in a \n     2007 study that the 2005 BRAC round was the most complex and \n     costliest ever;\n       Whereas the Government Accountability Office found in a \n     2012 report entitled ``Military Base Realignments and \n     Closures: Updated Costs and Savings Estimates from BRAC \n     2005'' that the 2005 BRAC round far exceeded estimated \n     implementation costs, growing from $21,000,000,000 to \n     $35,100,000,000, a 67 percent increase;\n       Whereas the Government Accountability Office found in the \n     2012 report that the estimated 20-year savings for the 2005 \n     BRAC round decreased by 72 percent from $35,600,000,000 to \n     $9,900,000,000;\n       Whereas the Government Accountability Office estimates that \n     it will take until 2017 for the Department of Defense to \n     recoup upfront implementation costs of BRAC 2005, 4 years \n     longer than the BRAC Commission estimates and 12 years after \n     the date of execution and initial investment;\n       Whereas the Department of Defense would spend \n     $2,400,000,000 in a time of fiscal austerity to execute the \n     proposed BRAC round in 2015;\n       Whereas the financial crisis in the United States continues \n     to challenge local economies and a BRAC round would create \n     more uncertainty and economic hardship for impacted \n     communities still in the recovery process;\n       Whereas Federal budget uncertainty and the fiscal \n     challenges a domestic BRAC round would bring to communities \n     renders the significant $2,400,000,000 in up-front costs \n     neither affordable nor feasible as of the date of agreement \n     to this resolution; and\n       Whereas the lack of potential return on the significant \n     investment required for a BRAC round may result in an \n     inefficient use of taxpayer funds: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) as of the date of agreement to this resolution, the \n     Department of Defense should not be granted authority for the \n     requested 2015 and 2017 Base Realignment and Closure rounds;\n       (2) before granting the authority for the requested 2015 \n     and 2017 BRAC rounds, the Department of Defense should \n     achieve economic efficiencies by--\n       (A) closing and consolidating excess infrastructure and \n     facilities in overseas locations; and\n       (B) reexamining relocation opportunities of overseas \n     missions to United States military installations; and\n       (3) the Department of Defense is unwise to request a BRAC \n     round when the economy of the United States is struggling to \n     recover and negatively impacted communities are fighting to \n     put citizens back to work.\n\n[[Page S3263]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/08/senate-section/article/S3263-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 133--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT CONGRESS \nAND THE STATES SHOULD INVESTIGATE AND CORRECT ABUSIVE, UNSANITARY, AND \n                       ILLEGAL ABORTION PRACTICES\n\n  Mr. LEE (for himself, Mr. Toomey, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Scott, Mr. Cruz, Mr. \nInhofe, Mr. Burr, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Boozman, Mr. Blunt, Mrs. Fischer, Mr. \nThune, Mr. Johanns, Mr. Paul, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Coats, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. \nCochran, Mr. Chambliss, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Isakson, and Mr. Graham) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S. Res. 133\n\n       Whereas the Declaration of Independence sets forth the \n     principle that all people are created equal and are endowed \n     by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, and that \n     among these rights are life, liberty, and the pursuit of \n     happiness;\n       Whereas the dedication of the people of the United States \n     to this principle, though at times tragically marred by \n     institutions such as slavery and practices such as \n     segregation and the denial of the right to vote, has summoned \n     the people of the United States time and again to fight for \n     human dignity and the common good;\n       Whereas the people of the United States believe that every \n     human life is precious from its very beginning, and that \n     every individual, regardless of age, health, or condition of \n     dependency, deserves the respect and protection of society;\n       Whereas the people of the United States believe that early \n     and consistent care for mothers, with due regard both for the \n     well-being of expectant mothers and for the children they \n     carry, is a primary goal of any sound health care policy in \n     the United States;\n       Whereas no woman should ever be abandoned, by policy or \n     practice, to the depredations of an unlicensed, unregulated, \n     or uninspected clinic operating outside of the law with no \n     regard for the mothers or children ostensibly under its care;\n       Whereas the Report of the Grand Jury in the Court of Common \n     Pleas of the First Judicial District of Pennsylvania, \n     certified on January 14, 2011, contains the results of a \n     thorough investigation of the policies and practices of Dr. \n     Kermit Gosnell and the Women's Medical Society of \n     Philadelphia, which found multiple violations of law and \n     public policy relating to abortion clinics, and recommended \n     to the Pennsylvania Department of Health that these abortion \n     clinics ``be explicitly regulated as ambulatory surgical \n     facilities, so that they are inspected annually and held to \n     the same standards as all other outpatient procedure \n     centers'';\n       Whereas the Report of the Grand Jury documented a pattern, \n     over a period of 2 decades, at the Women's Medical Society of \n     Philadelphia of untrained and uncertified personnel \n     performing abortions, non-medical personnel administering \n     medications, grossly unsanitary and dangerous conditions, \n     violations of law regarding storage of human remains, and, \n     above all, instances of willful murder of infants born alive \n     by severing their spinal cords;\n       Whereas the violations of law and human dignity documented \n     at the Women's Medical Society of Philadelphia involved women \n     referred to the facility by abortion facilities in a number \n     of surrounding States, including Virginia, Maryland, North \n     Carolina, and Delaware;\n       Whereas abortion clinics in a number of States, \n     particularly Michigan and Maryland, and including 2 clinics \n     at which Dr. Kermit Gosnell performed or initiated abortions \n     and 2 Planned Parenthood facilities in Delaware, have been \n     closed temporarily or permanently due to unsanitary \n     conditions, and the Planned Parenthood facilities in Delaware \n     have been described by former employees as resembling a \n     ``meat market'';\n       Whereas the imposition of criminal and civil penalties on \n     individuals and corporations involved in the deplorable \n     practices described in this preamble is appropriate, but is \n     not the only necessary response to such practices;\n       Whereas it is essential that the Federal Government and \n     State and local governments take action to prevent dangerous \n     conditions at abortion clinics;\n       Whereas government accountability means that officials \n     whose duty it is to protect the safety and well-being of \n     mothers accessing health care clinics must have their actions \n     made public and their failures redressed;\n       Whereas the extent of, and purported justification for, \n     legal and illegal abortions in the United States performed \n     late in the second trimester of pregnancy and into and \n     throughout the third trimester of pregnancy are not routinely \n     reported by all States or by the Centers for Disease Control, \n     and are therefore unknown;\n       Whereas women and children in the United States deserve \n     better than the 56,145,920 abortions that have been performed \n     in the United States since the Supreme Court rulings in Roe \n     v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, and Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179, in \n     1973; and\n       Whereas there is substantial medical evidence that an \n     unborn child is capable of experiencing pain at 20 weeks \n     after fertilization, or earlier: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) Congress and States should gather information about and \n     correct--\n       (A) abusive, unsanitary, and illegal abortion practices; \n     and\n       (B) the interstate referral of women and girls to \n     facilities engaged in dangerous or illegal second- and third-\n     trimester procedures;\n       (2) Congress has the responsibility to--\n       (A) investigate and conduct hearings on--\n       (i) abortions performed near, at, or after viability in the \n     United States; and\n       (ii) public policies regarding such abortions; and\n       (B) evaluate the extent to which such abortions involve \n     violations of the natural right to life of infants who are \n     born alive or are capable of being born alive, and therefore \n     are entitled to equal protection under the law;\n       (3) there is a compelling governmental interest in \n     protecting the lives of unborn children beginning at least \n     from the stage at which substantial medical evidence \n     indicates that they are capable of feeling pain, which is \n     separate from and independent of the compelling governmental \n     interest in protecting the lives of unborn children beginning \n     at the stage of viability, and neither governmental interest \n     is intended to replace the other; and\n       (4) governmental review of public policies and outcomes \n     relating to the issues described in paragraphs (1) through \n     (4) is long overdue and is an urgent priority that must be \n     addressed for the sake of women, children, families, and \n     future generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/08/senate-section/article/S3263-2", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 134--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT ALL \n  INCIDENTS OF ABUSIVE, UNSANITARY, OR ILLEGAL HEALTH CARE PRACTICES \n   SHOULD BE CONDEMNED AND PREVENTED AND THE PERPETRATORS SHOULD BE \n                PROSECUTED TO THE FULL EXTENT OF THE LAW\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Shaheen, and Mr. \nFranken) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Strengthening The \n     Resiliency of Our Nation on the Ground Act'' or the ``STRONG \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 11102. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Extreme weather has serious economic costs for \n     Americans, American businesses, and State and local \n     governments. Hurricanes, droughts, floods, tornadoes, extreme \n     heat, and extreme cold cause death, result in loss of \n     property and well-being, especially among the most vulnerable \n     populations, and negatively impact business activity and \n     economic growth.\n       (2) Superstorm Sandy, which devastated the Eastern United \n     States in late October 2012, resulted in more than 100 \n     deaths, the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people \n     from their homes, power outages affecting more than 8,500,000 \n     homes, massive flooding, gasoline shortages, and a crippled \n     regional energy and transportation infrastructure. As a \n     result of this storm, Congress passed the Disaster Relief \n     Appropriations Act, 2013, which appropriated $50,500,000,000 \n     for post-Sandy recovery efforts.\n       (3) In the past 30 years, there have been more than 130 \n     weather-related disasters in the United States that each \n     generated at least $1,000,000,000 in damages or more than \n     $880,000,000,000 in total standardized loss. In addition, \n     there have been many other extreme weather events that \n     generated less than $1,000,000,000 in damages, but still \n     caused immeasurable harm to the Nation's citizens, \n     infrastructure, and economy.\n       (4) Hurricane Katrina led to more than 1,800 deaths, \n     property damage exceeding $80,000,000,000, more than \n     $120,000,000,000 in Federal spending, and long-term impacts \n     on the economy and livelihoods of those living in the Gulf \n     Coast region.\n       (5) In 2011, one of the most severe and costly years for \n     weather and climate on record, extreme weather hit every \n     region in the United States, resulting in--\n       (A) prolonged droughts in the South and the West;\n       (B) deadly floods in the Southeast and Midwest;\n       (C) hundreds of devastating tornadoes across the United \n     States;\n       (D) Hurricane Irene in the Northeast;\n       (E) more than $50,000,000,000 in weather-related damages;\n       (F) 14 extreme weather events, which resulted in more than \n     $1,000,000,000 in damages each and caused a combined death \n     toll of hundreds of people; and\n       (G) many other extreme weather events with lesser, but \n     still significant, impacts.\n       (6) In 2012, in addition to Superstorm Sandy, the United \n     States experienced--\n       (A) drought conditions in more than 60 percent of the \n     contiguous United States at the peak of the drought, \n     including more than 2,200 counties that have received \n     disaster designations from the Secretary of Agriculture due \n     to the drought;\n       (B) deadly floods in Minnesota, Tropical Storm Debby in \n     Florida, and Hurricane Isaac in Louisiana;\n       (C) destructive wildfires on more than 9,000,000 acres \n     across 37 States;\n       (D) power outages affecting more than 3,400,000 homes due \n     to severe storms during the summer; and\n       (E) deadly heat waves, highlighted by July as the warmest \n     month on record for the contiguous United States and more \n     than 9,600 daily high temperature records broken during June, \n     July, and August.\n       (7) These events and natural disaster trends, when combined \n     with the volatility of weather, ongoing demographic changes, \n     and development in high risk areas, indicate that the \n     negative impacts of extreme weather events and natural \n     disasters have the potential to increase over time. The fact \n     that a significant number of people and assets continue to be \n     located in areas prone to volatile and extreme weather \n     indicates that these events will continue to be expensive and \n     deadly if the United States fails to enhance its resiliency \n     to such events. Recent studies show that the intensity and \n     frequency of some types of, but not all, extreme weather \n     events will likely increase in the future.\n       (8) Economic savings can be achieved by considering the \n     impacts of extreme weather over the short- and long-term in \n     the planning process. For example, a 2005 review of the \n     Federal Emergency Management Agency's hazard mitigation \n     programs, conducted by the National Institute of Building \n     Sciences' Multi-Hazard Mitigation Council,\n\n[[Page S3269]]\n\n     found that every dollar spent on hazard mitigation yields a \n     savings of $4 in future losses.\n       (9) There are several efforts currently underway at the \n     Federal, regional, tribal, State, and local levels that have \n     helped lay the foundation for a federally-coordinated effort \n     to increase the Nation's resiliency to extreme weather \n     events, such as the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force, \n     the Presidential Policy Directive on National Preparedness \n     (referred to in this subtitle as ``PPD-8''), the National \n     Preparedness System, the whole community approach led by the \n     Department of Homeland Security, and the Silver Jackets \n     Program by the Army Corps of Engineers. Other recent reports \n     on this subject include the National Academies of Sciences' \n     reports ``Disaster Resilience: A National Imperative'' and \n     ``Building Community Disaster Resilience through Public-\n     Private Collaboration''.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this subtitle is to minimize \n     the economic and social costs and future losses of life, \n     property, well-being, business activity, and economic growth \n     by making the United States more resilient to the impacts of \n     extreme weather events over the short- and long-term, thereby \n     creating business and job growth opportunities by--\n       (1) ensuring that the Federal Government is optimizing its \n     use of existing resources and funding to support State and \n     local officials, businesses, tribal nations, and the public \n     to become more resilient, including--\n       (A) encouraging the consideration of, and ways to \n     incorporate, extreme weather resilience across Federal \n     operations, programs, policies, and initiatives;\n       (B) promoting improved coordination of existing and planned \n     Federal extreme weather resilience and adaptation efforts \n     that impact extreme weather resilience and ensuring their \n     coordination with, and support of, State, local, regional, \n     and tribal efforts;\n       (C) minimizing Federal policies that may unintentionally \n     hinder or reduce resilience, such as damaging wetlands or \n     other critical green infrastructure, or lead Federal agencies \n     to operate at cross purposes in achieving extreme weather \n     resilience; and\n       (D) building upon existing related efforts, such as the \n     Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force, the PPD-8, the \n     National Preparedness System, and the whole community \n     approach;\n       (2) communicating the latest understanding and likely \n     short- and long-term human and economic impacts and risks of \n     extreme weather to businesses and the public;\n       (3) supporting decision making that improves resilience by \n     providing forecasts and projections, data decision-support \n     tools, and other information and mechanisms; and\n       (4) establishing a consistent vision and strategic plan for \n     extreme weather resilience across the Federal Government.\n\n     SEC. 11103. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this subtitle:\n       (1) Extreme weather.--The term ``extreme weather'' includes \n     severe and unseasonable weather, heavy precipitation, \n     hurricanes, storm surges, tornadoes, other windstorms \n     (including derechos), extreme heat, extreme cold, and other \n     qualifying weather events as determined by the interagency \n     group established under section 11104(a)(1).\n       (2) Resilience.--The term ``resilience'' means the ability \n     to prepare and plan for, absorb, recover from, and more \n     successfully adapt to adverse events in a timely manner.\n\n     SEC. 11104.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the Water \nResources Development Act or the WRDA bill that we are considering on \nthe Senate floor. I wanted to begin by thanking leadership on both \nsides of the aisle for moving this very important legislation to the \nfloor so we can act on it.\n  This legislation is important because it funds vital infrastructure \nprojects that make our country stronger, safer, and more competitive. I \nwish to begin by talking about one of those flood protection projects, \npermanent flood protection for the Red River Valley. The Fargo-Moorhead \nArea Diversion Project will establish permanent flood protection \nmeasures for the Red River Valley region of North Dakota and Minnesota.\n  It will, in essence, divert water around--actually water that is now \nalmost an annual flood event--population centers, channel it safely \ndownstream for both States. In fact, it will protect nearly one-quarter \nof a million people and billions of dollars of property in one of the \nMidwest's most dynamic, productive, and growing metro areas on both \nsides of the North Dakota-Minnesota border.\n  Furthermore, this vital infrastructure will not only protect lives \nand property, it will actually save the Federal Government money. This \nis very important at a time when we face deficits and debt, something \nwe very much need to address.\n  So let me explain. This project will actually save the Federal \nGovernment money. When the waters threaten, as they have in 4 of the \npast 5 years, many agencies of the Federal Government are mobilized to \nprotect life and property. That includes the Army Corps of Engineers, \nFEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife, \nCoast Guard, even Customs and Border Protection, which has been called \nin to monitor the advancing waters of the flood from the air, and other \nagencies as well.\n  Those are just Federal agencies. In addition, we have State and local \nagencies that respond as well. Many of them also rely on Federal \nfunding. That includes agencies such as emergency management, the \nNational Guard, State departments of transportation, highway patrol, \nwater commission, human services, departments of health, and many \nothers.\n  The point is the flood fight requires a lot of work and it costs a \nlot of money. We are doing it every year. It involves the enormous task \nof building miles and miles--not feet, not yards, but miles of \ntemporary earthen dams, dikes, and levees. That means moving heavy \nequipment such as backhoes, bulldozers, dump trucks, as well as tons \nand tons of dirt. It means activating the National Guard to devote its \nresources and equipment to the task of fighting the rising waters.\n  The flood fight also involves filling sandbags, literally millions of \nsandbags to protect homes and businesses. It involves deploying \nindustrial pumps to try to move water out faster than it is moving into \nthe cities. That, I tell you, is very fast at the height of the flood, \nthousands of cubic feet per second.\n  It means calling on local police and highway patrol officers to work \novertime to direct traffic, provide security, and keep order. \nUltimately it means paying out millions in taxpayer dollars year after \nyear, and that is the point. We are fighting this flood every single \nyear, and we are expending these dollars every single year.\n  Then there is another phase after the water recedes and then comes \nthe cleanup: removing those dams, dikes, and levees, disposing of those \nmillions of sandbags, cleaning the streets, repairing the damage, and \naddressing the multitude of costs and time-consuming tests necessary to \nget things back to normal. Again, as I have said, you are doing all of \nthis on a temporary basis, and you have to do it all over again the \nfollowing year. In fact, the expense of mounting a successful flood \nfight year\n\n[[Page S3283]]\n\nin and year out amounts to many millions of dollars every year.\n  For example, the successful flood fight of 2009 cost Fargo-Moorhead \nabout $50 million. When you lose the flood fight, the cost is much \ngreater in both human terms and in financial terms.\n  For example, in another community, a much smaller community, Minot, \nND, lost the flood fight in 2011, destroying or damaging more than \n4,000 homes and displacing thousands of people. The Federal Government \nhas put more than $632 million--let me repeat--more than $632 million \ninto the city's recovery efforts to date, and we are still not done.\n  A similar flood in the Fargo-Moorhead metro area would be far worse \nand far more expensive. The Army Corps of Engineers predicts a 500-year \nflood in the Red River Valley would cost more than $10 million in \ndamage, and that doesn't even take into account the impact in terms of \nhuman cost and difficulty to families and to businesses.\n  Let's look at how the costs of such a flood are typically shared. \nThis is very important when we do the cost-benefit analysis. Typically \nlocal government covers 15 percent of the cost. The State pays about 10 \npercent of the cost, and the Federal Government pays by far the largest \nshare of the cost. The Federal Government is paying 75 percent of the \ncost every single year--oh, except, in severe disasters, FEMA \nrecommends raising the 75-percent Federal share for public assistance, \nthe repair of infrastructure, to 90 percent Federal cost after you meet \na certain threshold.\n  When you have very significant damage and higher losses, now the \nFederal Government is picking up as much as 90 percent of the cost, \nparticularly for the public infrastructure. That cost, in our case now, \nis incurred on a year-in and year-out basis.\n  In fact, Fargo-Moorhead has not only had to mount a flood fight but \nthen conduct cleanup afterwards in 4 out of the last 5 years, including \nthis spring. That is my point. That is exactly my point. With permanent \nflood protection, which is provided through the WRDA bill, we can break \nthat cycle. With one-time spending we can protect people on a permanent \nbasis and do so much more cost-effectively. Once you build it, you are \ndone with the endless and traumatic sequence of fighting floods and \ncleaning up after them. Not only that, but the cost-sharing for \npermanent flood protection is lower for the Federal Government. The \nFederal share would be less than half of the cost of the permanent \nproject, 45 percent of the permanent project. That compares with 75 to \n90 percent the Federal Government is obliged to cover for the annual \nflood fight or, worse, if you lose the flood fight and you have that \nrecovery effort.\n  We are saying for the permanent protection, the non-Federal share, \nFederal share 45 percent. The non-Federal share is more than half, \nwhich means State and local government will cover 55 percent of the \ncost, which is actually the majority of the project. We have already \nlined up those funds. At that local level and the State level, we are \nready to go.\n  This is a two-State effort, as I said. That cost is incurred by the \nState of North Dakota, by local government, and Minnesota, and it \nbreaks out as follows: Minnesota would cover about 10 percent of the \nnon-Federal share or about $100 million. North Dakota will cover 90 \npercent of the non-Federal share, about $900 million, divided evenly \nbetween the State and local municipalities, each putting in about $450 \nmillion.\n  In the end you can't put a price on the kind of hardship and despair \nthat losing a home or a business means after the fact. You can help to \nspare people that hardship in the first place with permanent flood \nprotection.\n  That is what the Fargo-Moorhead diversion is all about, and that is \nwhy it is so important to North Dakota, to Minnesota, and to the Red \nRiver Valley region of the North. The Water Resources Development Act, \nhowever, does more. It is key to building and rebuilding vital water \ninfrastructure projects throughout our Nation, projects that will make \nus stronger and safer.\n  Moreover, the WRDA bill includes streamlining provisions to help us \ncomplete worthy projects more cost effectively with less bureaucracy, \nwith greater savings, and with less redtape. In addition, we work \nconscientiously through the process to make sure we do these vital \nprojects right. They have been subjected to full corps review, \nincluding cost-benefit analyses, in an open and transparent way.\n  For all of these reasons and more, I urge my colleagues to support \nthe Water Resources Development Act for the peace of mind permanent \nflood control and protection will give to the people of our region and \nother regions throughout the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/08/senate-section/article/S3283-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
