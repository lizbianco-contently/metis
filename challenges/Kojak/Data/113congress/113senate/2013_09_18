Mr. President, each year Hispanic Heritage Month offers an \nopportunity to honor the contributions of a community that has \ncontributed to our country's progress for centuries.\n  In the State of Nevada the influence of Hispanic Americans is evident \neven in the name of the State, which means ``snowcapped.'' Of course, \nour most famous city--one of the most famous cities in the world--means \n``the meadows.'' It was a place that in pioneer days was an oasis in \nthe desert, and that is an understatement. Water from artisan wells \nthat bubbled out of the ground was the beginning of Las Vegas--the \nmeadows.\n  The first non-Native American who set eyes on Las Vegas Valley was a \nman named Rafael Rivera. We honor him in Nevada. In my office here and \nin my conference room I have a wonderful painting of Rafael looking \ndown over Las Vegas. He looked so good, all dressed in his finery, but \nin reality he was lost. He had been with a Spanish expedition and was \nlost, but he was the first to see Las Vegas, and we recognize that. The \npicture is terrific. We see him looking down at a place where there was \nnothing other than the meadows, but now there are 2.5 million people \nthere.\n  In Nevada and across the Nation we see the contributions of Hispanic \nAmericans in every facet of our society--on the battlefield, in the \nboardroom, in the courtroom and the classroom, at art galleries, and on \nthe playing field. Hispanic Americans have also played an important \nrole in this Nation's Armed Forces, serving in every conflict since the \nRevolutionary War. More than 2.3 million Hispanic-owned businesses \nemploy millions of Americans, providing critical goods and services and \nhelping to drive our economy.\n  Nationwide, Latinos are expected to make up about 60 percent of the \npopulation growth in the decades to come. To ensure our country \nthrives, we must ensure this Hispanic population thrives as well. \nHispanic Heritage Month should be one to celebrate but also one to \nreflect on what we can do to help Hispanic families thrive.\n  This year affords a special moment for reflection as our Nation \ncommemorates 50 years since the historic march on Washington for Jobs \nand Freedom. The struggle for equality, justice, and freedom is \nongoing, but through engagement Hispanic Americans and all Americans \ncan make heard in Washington their support for quality education, \nquality health care, a living wage, and the right to vote without \nintimidation or discrimination.\n  Congress heard their calls for quality affordable health insurance. \nThat is why we passed, among other reasons, the Affordable Care Act, \nknown as ObamaCare, which was a huge step forward for Hispanic families \nand Nevadans across the country. In Nevada alone, more than 160,000 \nLatinos and more than 10 million nationwide who currently lack health \ninsurance will be eligible for coverage through the new marketplaces \nthat are going to start October 1.\n  Congress heard the calls for opportunity during tough economic times. \nDemocrats made small business loans possible for 11,000 Hispanic-owned \nbusinesses. We have significantly cut predatory and discriminatory \nlending practices that disproportionately affected Hispanic \ncommunities. Last year Congress cut taxes for 98 percent of American \nfamilies, including every middle-class family.\n  Congress also heard the calls for fair, practical immigration reform, \nand this year the Senate passed a bipartisan immigration bill that will \nreform America's illegal immigration system and reduce the deficit by \n$1 trillion. This measure will also help 11 million people--people who \nare tired of looking over their shoulders and fearing deportation--to \nget right with the law and start down an earned pathway to citizenship. \nThe Senate, though, is still waiting, as we have been waiting for lots \nof things, for the Republicans in the House to allow a vote on the \nSenate's bipartisan compromise. What better way to celebrate this \nimportant month than by passing a bill that will allow millions of \nfamilies to stay together and reach their full potential?\n  I look forward to Hispanic Heritage Month as an opportunity to \nreaffirm my commitment to supporting the 52 million Latinos in America \nthrough our work in the Senate. To me, Hispanic Heritage Month is about \nrecognizing the incredible contributions of Hispanic Americans to our \nNation, but it is also about building a brighter future for Hispanic \nAmericans in our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/18/senate-section/article/S6548-2", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, earlier this week we passed the 5-year \nmark since the financial crisis hit our country. Incredibly, President \nObama tried to use that opportunity to take credit for the fact that \nthings aren't as bad as they were back then, and he is back at it again \ntoday. Basically, his message is this: America isn't in a free fall, so \neveryone should give him a big pat on the back.\n  Well, as far as deflections go, it is pretty creative, but it is also \npretty misleading because in an effort to justify his own failed \npolicies and preserve them, the President is papering over some pretty \ntroubling realities. The truth is, for most Americans, the past few \nyears have felt like anything but a recovery. It has been a story of \nlost jobs and underemployment and the loss of dignity that comes with \nboth. It has been a period of stagnant wages and an increasing \ndisparity between rich and poor. Then there are all the young people \nwho have been stunned to realize, after graduating from college, that \nthere just aren't any jobs out there. So now is not the time for \nvictory laps because if this is his idea of success, I would hate to \nsee what failure looks like.\n  Today, nearly 8 million Americans who want full-time jobs can only \nfind part-time work. That is nearly twice as many involuntary part-\ntimers as we had throughout most of the previous administration. And, \nof course, ObamaCare will make this much worse. What is more, the poor \nand middle-income folks and those just starting out on their own are \nsome of the people who have been struggling the most in the Obama \neconomy. The unemployment rate for low-income Americans, for instance, \nnow stands at 21 percent--21 percent unemployment for low-income \nAmericans--right about where it was during the Great Depression.\n  The President likes to claim credit for jobs created since the so-\ncalled recovery began, but what he fails to mention is that there are \nstill fewer jobs today than before the crisis hit, while real median \nwages haven't gone up at all over the past 5 years.\n  Even though Candidate Obama promised to ``spread the wealth around,'' \nwe find that 95 percent of recent income gains have actually gone to \nthe richest among us. Ninety-five percent of recent income gains have \ngone to the richest among us. In other words, we are again faced with \nthe tragic irony that those on the left who claim most loudly to be \nstanding for fairness and equality often end up getting the worst \nresults for those who need help the most. To paraphrase President \nReagan's old line about the apostles of ``fairness,'' maybe they are \nfair in one way: Their policies don't discriminate; they bring misery \nto everybody--unless, of course, we are speaking of the elite of the \nelite. We all know why that is. Because when government policies hurt \neconomic growth by stifling opportunities and drying up investment, it \nis the American worker who loses. It is those at the bottom of the \neconomic ladder who suffer the most.\n  The best thing we can do to help the poor and working class is to get \nthe private sector growing again. And we know how it is done--by \nimplementing things such as a more competitive tax code, regulatory \nrelief, approval of the Keystone Pipeline, and, of course, repealing \nObamaCare, which is killing jobs.\n  The fact is that the policies of today's Washington Democrats \nactually entrench unfairness and make the playing field even more \nuneven.\n  Even the President's allies are beginning to understand. Big Labor \nwants to rewrite some provisions of the same ObamaCare law they helped \nmuscle through. Why? Because, predictably, ObamaCare is now hurting the \n40-hour\n\n[[Page S6549]]\n\nworkweek and undermining the kind of employer-sponsored plans their \nmembers like and were told they would be able to keep. Union bosses \nalso know that the President recently agreed to delay parts of the law \nfor businesses. Now they want relief too. Why for business and not for \nunions? But what about everybody else? What about the middle class? \nWhat about college graduates or young couples trying to make ends meet \nwhile they start a family? Don't those folks deserve some relief from \nObamaCare too?\n  That is why Senator Coats and I filed an amendment last week that \nwould allow everyone else to take advantage of the ObamaCare delay \nalready offered to businesses. If companies get to catch a break, then \nRepublicans think the middle class should too. The Democrats who run \nWashington need to stop blocking us from even taking a vote on this \nimportant legislation--legislation that already passed the House of \nRepresentatives, by the way, on a bipartisan basis.\n  After all, as I have already indicated, ObamaCare is a big reason we \nare turning into a nation of part-time workers and that so many \nAmericans will lose their jobs and the health care plans they like. It \nis also one of the reasons the rate of those either working or looking \nfor work has dropped back to Carter-era levels--Carter-era levels--and \nthat the average time it takes to find a job is longer than it has been \nliterally in decades.\n  These are all good reasons not just to delay but to repeal this law \nand start over with bipartisan reforms that can actually reduce costs \ninstead of killing jobs. I have confidence we will get there eventually \nbecause the only person who seems to be happy with ObamaCare is the guy \nit is named after--the guy it is named after. Because when everyone \nfrom union bosses to working moms wants to repeal this act, it is hard \nto escape the conclusion that the people standing in the way are more \ninterested in what is good for their legacies than what is good for the \ncountry.\n  But, look, I am still holding out hope. I hope the President will \ntake this 5-year anniversary of the financial crisis as a chance to \nreflect and to change course. I hope he will finally admit that what he \nhas tried thus far has not worked; that it is not enough to just \nimprove the lot of those who have influence in government; that he has \nto work for the middle class too. I hope he starts working with Members \nof both parties to start over on health care, to put our economy on a \nsound and sustainable footing, to get spending under control so we do \nnot leave the same kind of mess to our children, as CBO again warned us \nyesterday.\n  Most important, I am hoping he starts thinking of ways to give those \nwho are struggling in this economy a real chance to succeed. When he \ndoes, Republicans will be here ready to work with him, as we have since \nhe first came to office.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/18/senate-section/article/S6549-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as you know, today marks the fifth \nanniversary of the 2008 financial panic which threw our country into a \nsevere recession and the worst economic crisis this country has had \nsince the 1930s. It has been 5 years since Lehman Brothers collapsed. \nIt has been 5 years since the Federal Government seized full control of \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It has been 5 years since Washington bailed \nout AIG, the giant insurance company.\n  In the weeks and months following the events of September 2008, \nMembers of both parties agreed that one of the most important things we \ncould do is to fix the idea of too big to fail when it came to some of \nthe largest financial institutions in America. Too big to fail--so the \nonly alternative was for taxpayers to bail them out.\n  We wanted to end it. Five years later, I wish I could say we had \nsucceeded. I wish I could say that too big to fail was a thing of the \npast. Unfortunately, the very law that was passed by our Democratic \nfriends, primarily, that was supposed to end too big to fail actually \ncodified it, actually made it more certain to occur because it gave \nFederal regulators the power to identify something called systemically \nimportant institutions. Doesn't that sound suspiciously like too big to \nfail if you are systemically important financial institutions?\n  We have already seen that systemically important firms enjoy huge \nfunding advantages over smaller competitors, primarily community \nbankers in places such as my State, mostly because of the perception \nthat these large companies enjoy a government bailout guarantee. In \nother words, their cost of doing business is lower because people \nactually perceive they have a Federal Government backstop available to \nbail them out if they get into trouble--not so for small credit unions, \ncommunity bankers in places such as my State and around the country.\n  In other words, Dodd-Frank, rather than weakening this concept, \nactually strengthened the de facto partnership between Washington, DC, \nand New York, and primarily Wall Street. That is the exact opposite of \nwhat I think the American people thought was happening and certainly \nthe opposite of what they were demanding since 2008. It is exactly the \nopposite of what our financial system needs in order to operate more \nsafely and to avoid taxpayer bailouts such as we saw following 2008.\n  This is just another reason the U.S. economy continues to slog along, \nwith the weakest recovery and the longest period of high unemployment \nsince the Great Depression of the 1930s. Nearly 38 percent of America's \nunemployed have been jobless for more than 6 months. Let me say that \nagain. Nearly 38 percent of Americans unemployed have been jobless for \nmore than 6 months.\n  Those are tragic statistics because we all know that the longer \nsomeone is unemployed, the harder it is for them to get back into a job \nbecause they lose skills, they become less competitive in the labor \nmarkets.\n  The only reason unemployment rates actually fell was not because the \neconomy was getting strong enough to create new jobs, but it was \nbecause fewer and fewer people actually were looking for work. More and \nmore people actually gave up. All one has to do is go on the Internet \nand look at the Bureau of Labor Statistics under something called the \nlabor participation rate, and we can see that the percentage of people \nactually looking for work has declined to the lowest point in about 30 \nyears or so.\n  A recent study concludes that America is still 8.3 million jobs away \nfrom a full economic recovery--8.3 million Americans out of work who \nneed to be back at work in order for us to get back on track.\n  Is it any wonder that a Pew Research Center poll indicated that 52 \npercent of people feel as though our job situation has hardly recovered \nat all since the great recession? Fifty-two percent think things have \nnot gotten that much better.\n  Nevertheless, there seems to be this divide, this gulf between \nperception in Washington among the political elites and on Main Street. \nFor example, in an ABC News broadcast this past weekend, President \nObama said that since he took office, America has witnessed ``progress \nacross the board.'' I guess ``progress'' is a relative term.\n  But since the official end of the recession in June 2008, median \nhousehold income has declined by nearly $2,500. Average working \nfamilies have $2,500 less to spend, so, of course, they do not feel as \nthough we have had a recovery. They do not feel as though things have \ngotten better across the board, such as the President. Of course, that \nis before we even account for inflation. When we adjust the numbers to \nreflect the increase in consumer prices, the drop in median household \nincome has been significantly larger than the $2,500 I just mentioned.\n\n[[Page S6550]]\n\n  The President says he is concerned about income inequality, about the \ndifference between the wealthy and average working families and the \npoor. But the New York Times has reported that the trend of rising \nincome inequality ``appears to have accelerated during [this \nPresident's] administration.'' It has gotten worse. Indeed, according \nto one measure of the income gap, inequality has increased about four \ntimes faster under President Obama than it did under President George \nW. Bush.\n  Of course, America's income gap is mirrored by a yawning unemployment \ngap. Earlier this week, the Associated Press reported that ``the gap in \nemployment rates between America's highest- and lowest-income families \nhas stretched to its widest levels since officials began tracking the \ndata a decade ago.''\n  Again, this is happening under a President who said rising income \ninequality is morally wrong, a President who believes rising income \ninequality is holding America's economic recovery back.\n  But the problem is not in his diagnosis, it is in his proposed \nremedies, his policies. His proposed remedies for growing inequality \ninclude more taxes, more spending by the Federal Government, more debt, \nand more regulations. It is symptomatic of the idea that Washington \nknows best. It does not, and we know because of the failed experiments \nover the last 5 years. Of course, if such policies were truly part of \nthe solution, inequality would be declining. In other words, if the \nPresident's proposed solutions of more regulations, more taxes, and \nmore Federal spending would work, we would be well on our way to an \neconomic recovery, unemployment would be back to historic norms, and \nthe economy would be growing. But it is not.\n  Then there is the cost of health insurance. This is another one of \nthe burdens on particularly small businesses and individuals which are \nkeeping the economy stagnant.\n  Back in 2008 the President famously promised that premiums for a \nfamily of four would decrease by about $2,500 if we would just pass his \nsignature health care legislation, now known as ObamaCare, the \nAffordable Care Act, but instead the cost has gone up by nearly $2,400 \nbetween 2009 and 2012.\n  So we have median household income going down about $2,500, but \nactually the cost of health care, rather than going down, is going up \nby about the same amount. For that matter, the cost problem will only \nget worse once ObamaCare is fully implemented, as we are beginning to \nsee as we see what the premiums are like in the individual market for \npeople who buy their health care in the exchanges.\n  The National Journal found that ``for the vast majority of \nAmericans,'' premiums will be higher under ObamaCare. That is pretty \neasy to understand because of the way it has been wired. For example, \nsomeone has said, it is as though, because of the guaranteed issue \naspect of ObamaCare, someone can wait until they are sick to buy health \ninsurance and the insurance company has to sell it to them. So somebody \nsaid: That is akin to waiting until your house is on fire before you \nactually buy fire insurance. That is not insurance anymore, and that \nruns up the cost for everybody, as does a phenomenon such as age \nbanning, where young people my daughters' age, in their early thirties, \nare going to have to bear the cost of health care for older Americans \nbecause they cannot charge older Americans any more than three times \nmore than what they charge young, healthy people such as my daughters, \neven though their consumption of health care, we know, will not be \nanywhere near that ratio.\n  As projected, the President's health care law will cause individual \ninsurance premiums to skyrocket all across America, including Texas.\n  Policies such as ObamaCare and Dodd-Frank, as I keep hearing from my \ncommunity bankers, have increased the cost of doing business and \ngenerated enormous uncertainty about the future. I was talking to a \nbusinessman in Houston just 2 days ago. He said: The thing that is \nholding America back, our economy back, is uncertainty. People don't \nknow what their taxes are going to be like, what the regulatory \nenvironment is going to be like. They don't know about our failure to \ndeal with our national debt, now about $17 trillion. As the Fed begins \nto wind down its purchases of our own debt, interest rates start to go \nback up. What is that going to mean?\n  It is going to mean we have to pay China and other creditors more \nmoney for the money they have loaned to us because of that $17 trillion \ndebt, and it will simply crowd out our ability to fund other priorities \nsuch as national security, among others.\n  The story of our sluggish recovery is ultimately a story of wasted \nhuman capital, again another tragedy. It is a story of mothers and \nfathers who cannot find full-time jobs and who are having trouble \nsupporting their families. It is a story of college graduates who are \nunemployed, living at home, and drowning in student loan debt.\n  As economists Keith Hennessey and Ed Lazear have written, ``The \nsevere recession was bad enough, but the slow recovery is doing just as \nmuch damage to living standards since it is sustained over a longer \ntime frame.''\n  I would say to our President: If you care about reducing income \ninequality, if you care about saving the American dream, let's try \nsomething new. You know, the definition of insanity, one pundit said, \nwas doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different \noutcome. So let's try something new, because we know the status quo has \nnot worked. Instead of piling more burdens on job creators and making \nit harder for Americans to secure full-time employment, let's embrace \npolicies that make it easier to create jobs and easier to get full-time \nwork. Let's reform our Tax Code so it is progrowth, make it simpler, \nmake it fairer, make it more logical, make it more conducive to that \nstrong economic growth that is going to create jobs.\n  Let's go back to the drawing board on health care and embrace \nsensible patient-centered reforms that will reduce costs and increase \naccessibility. We are never going to change our economic trajectory \nuntil we change our economic policies. Again, doing the same thing over \nand over again is not going to change the outcome. We need to try \nsomething new.\n  The policies of the past 4\\1/2\\ years have given us an economy that \nis failing to deliver the kind of job creation and income gains \nAmericans want and they need. As the President's own Treasury Secretary \nsaid this week, ``Too many Americans cannot find work, growth is not \nfast enough, and the very definition of what it means to be middle \nclass is being undercut by trends in our economy that must be \naddressed.''\n  I could not agree with him more. So isn't it time to try something \ndifferent?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/18/senate-section/article/S6550-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6550-S6551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ENERGY AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, today I would like to follow up on some \nof the comments by Senator Cornyn about these massive burdens on \nAmerican families, how it is impacting their lives, their quality of \nlife. Those are burdens forced upon them by this administration.\n  I rise to talk about an amendment I filed to the energy efficiency \nbill that we will be debating today on the floor. This amendment would \nstop President Obama's attempt to impose a massive increase to the \nnational energy bill. It will affect all Americans because, in a sense, \nessentially what we have is a huge energy tax caused by government \nregulations.\n  My amendment blocks the issuance of new carbon pollution standards \nfor new and existing coal-fired powerplants. Those standards are due \nout from the Environmental Protection Agency this very week. They can \ndo great harm to the American economy and to American families.\n  We need to make America's energy as clean as we can as fast as we \ncan. Everyone knows that. It is important, though, that we do it \nwithout hurting our economy and without costing thousands of middle-\nclass jobs. The American people, through their elected representatives \nin Congress, have rejected President Obama's reckless energy policies \nin the past. This past June President Obama issued a Presidential \nmemorandum directing the EPA to issue carbon pollution standard \nregulations.\n\n[[Page S6551]]\n\n  My amendment would require the approval of Congress for any \nregulations causing increases of our national energy bill, just like \nthe one the EPA would create with these regulations. If these \nregulations are allowed to take effect, they will increase energy costs \nfor the people who can bear the burden the least--seniors, low-income \nfamilies, small businesses.\n  High energy costs will destroy thousands of jobs in places such as my \nhome State of Wyoming but also in Missouri, Ohio, West Virginia, \nMontana, and many other States. We have already seen coal-fired \npowerplants shut down and reduce capacity, putting many people out of \nwork. That has been the President's plan all along. These new \nregulations would be the latest step.\n  Remember, President Obama said that under his plan ``electricity \nrates would necessarily skyrocket.'' Skyrocket. That is his word, not \nmine. He said energy producers could still build coal-fired \npowerplants, but that the cost would be so high it would bankrupt them. \nThe President should be looking for ways to help businesses grow, to \nhelp create jobs, not pushing his regulations to find backdoor ways to \nbankrupt them.\n  My amendment accomplishes a number of goals, beginning with \nprotecting American jobs. That has been our focus in this difficult \neconomy. The Nation's recession ended more than 4 years ago. We have \nnot had the recovery, though, we should have had because the \nPresident's policies have failed. The President promised he had a plan \nto create so-called green jobs. People have seen that those green jobs \nnever materialized.\n  Now the President is going after the red, white, and blue jobs that \ncontinue to power our country. The Obama administration and its allies \nin the fringe environmental movement say we need to get rid of those \njobs to make way for new ones. They say coal miners and powerplant \nworkers should fade into history along with the men and women who built \nstagecoaches, telegraphs, and record players. Their idea is that if we \nsimply let coal die, those folks can start making something new.\n  That kind of thinking is a luxury a lot of Americans do not want and \ncannot afford. When excessive Washington redtape crushes a coal mine or \na coal-fired powerplant in a small community, those jobs are not the \nonly thing that go. The town loses its revenue base. That hurts its \npublic schools, its police, its fire departments, senior busing \nservices for those who cannot drive. Everything that town does to serve \nits people suffers because of decisions made by this administration in \nWashington, DC.\n  Before long, people start to move away, looking for a better chance \nsomewhere else. Small businesses do not have enough customers, so they \nshut down, and the town withers away. When Washington uses the heavy \nhand of excessive regulation, there are a whole host of ways it hurts \nAmerican communities. One of those ways is its impact on public health.\n  Studies consistently show unemployment increases the likelihood of \nillness, hospital visits, and premature death. Families where a parent \nis out of work are more likely to fall into poverty. Children in poor \nfamilies are four times as likely as other children to be in fair or \npoor health.\n  The bureaucrats at the EPA can shake their magic eight ball to \npredict health impacts of carbon pollution on virtual people who have \nnot been born yet, years into the future. But if their predictions are \nwrong, and I expect they are, they will simply shake their magic eight \nball again.\n  Meanwhile, the health effects caused by their excessive regulations \nare very real for real families, real children, real seniors. My \namendment addresses this public health issue. It does it by preventing \nthis massive unemployment that would result from new redtape and higher \nenergy costs.\n\n  Finally, my amendment is clear that Congress should act on an \naffordable energy plan. Nothing in my amendment says Congress should \nnot work with State and local governments to protect communities from \nsevere weather events where lives are at stake. My amendment is clear \nthat these kinds of decisions should be for Congress to make, not for \nthe President to make on his own. That is true whether the President is \na Democrat or a Republican. I hope to get a vote on my amendment to \nensure that the Obama administration does not impose an increase in our \nnational energy bill on the American people.\n  Along the same lines, I want to speak briefly about another \nopportunity we have to ensure a stronger energy future for our country. \nThis week will mark an anniversary that I hope will spur the American \npeople to demand some action from the Obama administration. Five full \nyears ago TransCanada first applied for permission to build the \nKeystone XL Pipeline. President Obama still cannot make up his mind to \napprove the permits. He dithers, he delays, he makes excuses.\n  It is time to act. It is time finally to approve the Keystone XL \nPipeline so America can start to get the benefits of this important \nenergy project.\n  According to the State Department analysis, the pipeline's \nconstruction could support 42,000 jobs across the country. The \nPresident should be grabbing any opportunity he can to help the private \nsector create jobs. Instead, he says the jobs the Keystone XL Pipeline \nwould create are ``a blip relative to the need.'' Is this how the \nPresident sees the livelihoods of 42,000 American families, a blip?\n  This is the fourth major pipeline project between Canada and the \nUnited States since 2006. All the others were approved and the process \ntook between 15 and 28 months for each of them. The permit process for \nKeystone XL is now 60 months and still counting. Why is it taking so \nlong? In October 2010, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said her \ndepartment was ``inclined'' to approve the project. In July 2011, the \nadministration said it was ``publicly committed to reaching a \ndecision'' before the end of the year. That was 2011. The deadline came \nand it went.\n  This past June, the President suddenly raised the bar. He said the \n``net effects of the pipeline's impacts on our climate will be \nabsolutely critical'' in his decision. We know today what those effects \nwould be. Studies show the Keystone XL Pipeline would not have a \nsubstantial impact on greenhouse gas emissions. That is because even if \nthe pipeline does not get built, the energy is still going to be \ndeveloped. China has absolutely offered to buy the energy from Canada. \nThis pipeline has the support of more than 70 percent of the American \npeople. It has the support of major labor unions, of every State along \nits route.\n  A bipartisan majority in the House and 62 Senators support it. Still, \nPresident Obama cannot make up his mind. He delays his decisions on \nthis vital infrastructure project and at the same time orders \nregulations that would impose what amounts to a national energy tax. He \nstalls a pipeline that would create thousands of jobs and at the same \ntime orders regulations that would destroy thousands of jobs. He stalls \na pipeline that would help middle-class families while he promotes a \npolicy that would take more money out of the pockets of hard-working \nAmericans. We need to improve America's energy picture, without \ndestroying jobs or bankrupting our country.\n  President Obama can help do that. He can do it today by doing two \nthings. First, he should drop his plan to impose a new increase on \nnational energy costs and let it be debated by Congress. Second, he \nshould immediately approve the Keystone XL Pipeline. If the President \nis serious about helping middle-class families, he will prove it. If he \nis not ready to join Democrats and Republicans in Congress in making \nreasonable energy policies that help American families, then the Senate \nshould act.\n  Struggling middle-class families are asking for our help. It is time \nto give them the help they need.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. SCHATZ.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Affordable Care \nAct. At home in Hawaii we have a saying, ``Lucky you live Hawaii.'' \nThat can\n\n[[Page S6552]]\n\nmean a lot of different things to different people, but when talking \nabout access to affordable, effective care, this phrase has particular \nmeaning.\n  In the early 1970s, the rate of uninsured in our State was about 30 \npercent, meaning roughly 1 in 3 in our population would live in fear \nthat sickness or injury could cause financial ruin for themselves or \ntheir families. The people of Hawaii knew this was unacceptable.\n  In 1974, the State government passed an innovative piece of \nlegislation, the Prepaid Health Care Act. Now simply known as Prepaid, \nthis legislation requires employers to provide affordable and quality \ncare for hundreds of thousands of individuals and their families.\n  Our uninsured rate is one of the lowest in the country, with only 8 \npercent of our population lacking any type of insurance. Even though \nHawaii has been at the forefront in making health care a right and not \na privilege, we still have a way to go. Even with Prepaid, there are \nmore than 100,000 people in our State still uninsured.\n  When the Affordable Care Act passed 3 years ago, I knew it meant that \nthose who are uninsured or underinsured in Hawaii would find some \nrelief. We have already seen major successes since this landmark \nlegislation passed.\n  Yet people are still afraid of ObamaCare. This is because a lot of \npeople have spent a lot of time and money to make the American public \nbelieve that somehow this legislation is bad for them and will harm \nthem. That is why, when asked about health care reform as a whole, many \nAmericans say they are concerned, they have anxiety. But when you talk \nto people back in Hawaii and across the Nation, and even those who \nthink they don't like health care reform, they like what it does.\n  For example, parents like that they can keep their children on their \nhealth insurance until the age of 26, which affects 6,000 young adults \nin the State of Hawaii. People will no longer have to live in fear of \nlifetime limits on health benefits, which will help more than 460,000 \nresidents of Hawaii, including 115,000 children. More than half a \nmillion people in my State will no longer have to worry about being \ndenied coverage because of a pre-existing condition.\n  As a State that has committed to Medicaid expansion, Hawaii will also \nnow be able to provide care to close to more than 68,000 residents \nstarting in 2014.\n  People like these policies. People like what health care reform is \nalready doing for them.\n  While my colleagues across the aisle are looking to repeal this \nhistoric legislation, I am looking forward to how we can build on its \nsuccess.\n  Let me be clear. The fact that health care reform is working is \nexactly why the detractors of the ACA are trying so hard to stop it \nfrom being fully implemented. They know the American people are \nembracing ObamaCare because of all the good it will do for our \nfamilies.\n  In particular, I am looking forward to the opening of our \nmarketplace, the Hawaii Health Connector, on October 1. Many of the \npeople I have spoken to want to know what the marketplace may mean for \nthem. Simply, the Hawaii Health Connector is going to provide a \nconsumer-friendly way for residents of my State to view and compare a \nwide variety of plans. Then they will be able to pick the coverage that \nbest suits them and their families. My office has been in constant \ncontact with the Connector, and their staff in Hawaii has been working \ntirelessly to set up the online and phone interface, and to provide \nassistance and navigation in the form of kokua, a word in Hawaiian that \nessentially means pitching in to help your neighbors and your community \nwith no regard for personal gain.\n  This is reflective of the values we have in Hawaii, that everyone \ndeserves to be healthy and have access to affordable and quality care. \nThat doesn't mean we still don't have a lot of work to do.\n  I am hoping a number of bills I have introduced, including the Rural \nPreventive Health Care Training Act and the Strengthening Health \nDisparities Data Collection Act, will be considered and voted on by the \nfull Senate in order to solve some of our worst issues in providing \ncare to rural and underserved populations in Hawaii and across the \nNation.\n  I believe ACA is working the way it should be. It is increasing the \nnumber of insured Americans, promoting preventive care that will help \nto reduce the human and financial costs of avoidable illness and \nlowering the costs of care for everyone.\n  Many of my colleagues in Congress choose not to see any of this. The \nonly option for them is total repeal, with zero tolerance for open \ndiscussion or compromise on this landmark legislation, but that kind of \nthinking is what causes the gridlock Americans are so tired of. I \nunderstand there will be parts of this law, which is a sweeping piece \nof legislation, that will need to be amended over time to resolve any \nkinks. These kinds of revisions have been done with every other \nlandmark domestic social policy that has been passed in this country, \nincluding Medicare and Social Security.\n  I am willing, as are my colleagues on the Democratic side, to come to \nthe table and work with Republicans to make necessary improvements over \ntime, but I refuse to engage in the process of political and \nparliamentary gymnastics designed to score small, short-term wins at \nthe expense of the American people and the economy.\n  It must be pointed out that anyone who wants to grind the entire \ngovernment to a halt over the implementation of this several-years-old \nlaw will cause harm to the economy and harm to their communities, \nbecause Federal funding provides essential services and programs to \nconstituents in every State and every county in every district. If \nimprovements or changes need to be made, they can be done through the \nregular order with hearings, serious discussions, and bipartisan \nsupport. Ultimately, what we are seeing in Hawaii and across the Nation \nis President Obama's historic health care package is making inroads in \nimproving our health care system. Efforts to stop that cannot be \ntolerated by Members of Congress and the people of this Nation.\n  I will continue to support its full implementation and look forward \nto working with all of my colleagues in the Senate to build upon its \nsuccess.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, today I am here to give my first speech \non the floor of the Senate. I do so with deep respect and reverence for \nthe history of this Chamber and for the giants of the Senate who have \nserved before us. From Massachusetts, our recent roster of Senators \nreads like a history textbook: President John F. Kennedy, who inspired \na Nation--President Kennedy's desk is right here, and it is so \nappropriate that my extraordinary partner from Massachusetts, Senator \nWarren, occupies it today--the legendary Ted Kennedy--he had the vision \nto make health care a right and not a privilege; Ed Brooke, the first \nAfrican-American popularly elected to the Senate; Paul Tsongas, a model \nof independence; for 28 years John Kerry was a champion for the people \nof Massachusetts. Now he is our chief diplomat to the world, his skill \nalready shown in his ability to bring Russia and Syria to the \nnegotiating table.\n  America is the greatest country on Earth.\n  My father drove a truck for the Hood Milk Company. He graduated from \nthe vocational program at Lawrence High School. My mother was going to \nbe senior class president in high school, but her mother died when she \nwas a junior. She had to abandon her college dreams to stay home and \ntake care of her younger sisters.\n  That was before the New Deal, before Social Security, and before \nFranklin Delano Roosevelt. In those days the\n\n[[Page S6553]]\n\nonly social safety net for families was that one of the girls had to \nstay home.\n  I was the first in my family to go to college. I drove an ice cream \ntruck to work my way through Boston College as a commuter. I did the \nsame for law school. I took out Federal student loans, like so many \nmillions of American students have to do today.\n  Thanks to the people of our State, this son of a milkman is now \nserving the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the U.S. Senate.\n  I am a son of Malden, but I do not come just to occupy a seat in the \nSenate. I come here to stand and to speak for all those families, to \nseek change that uplifts those families and their future. To everyone \nhere I say: That will be how I conduct myself here in the Senate.\n  I come here today to discuss my perspective, formed by the \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts, guided by its people, practiced in the \nHouse of Representatives for more than 36 years, and open to new \nknowledge, new ideas, and innovative ways to move our country forward.\n  From its inception, Massachusetts has thrived because it is a \nwellspring for the advancement of humanity's ideas and ideals. Nearly \n400 years ago the pilgrims braved an uncertain passage to Plymouth as \nreligious innovators, but the pilgrims would likely not have survived \nthe new world's harsh environment without learning new ways from the \nnative Wampanoag Indians--the ``people of the dawn,'' as their tribal \nname translates.\n  So our bearings were set early in the Bay State. In a sense, we in \nMassachusetts are all people of the dawn, looking over the horizon \ntoward a new frontier, striving to forge a better tomorrow.\n  It is no surprise that when America moved from farms to factories it \nbegan in Massachusetts. Massachusetts has survived and it has thrived \nbecause of our tradition of innovation and imagination.\n  We invent the materials that power our economy. We initiate the moral \ndiscussions that advance a Nation. We are never satisfied with what we \nhave accomplished, instead, always pushing for progress and embracing \nthe promise of the rising sun. We know from experience that when we \ninvest in the future we create jobs here and now in our country.\n  During the last few decades, the pursuit of the possible that is hard \nwired into our Massachusetts DNA has helped us weather tough economies \nand rough international competition better than many other States.\n  We have become a high-tech, clean-tech, biotech hub for America and \nfor the world. At places such as MIT and at companies such as Bolt, \nBeranek and Newman in Boston, the underlying architecture of the \nInternet was envisioned and set in motion.\n  Earlier in my career, Congress passed three telecommunications bills \non a bipartisan basis that I helped author. They removed barriers for \ninnovation and unlocked opportunity for entrepreneurs, creating jobs in \nMassachusetts and across the Nation by unleashing more than $1 trillion \nof private sector investment in this emerging technology area.\n  Now the future of telecom is mobile. Massachusetts has several \nhundred mobile companies. We have the strongest robotics centers in the \nNation. We have the burgeoning digital games industry centered in our \nState. We are ready for the next generation of technology jobs because \nwe spent decades building our digital foundation.\n  Massachusetts was once the Nation's leading power producer, when \nMelville wrote ``Moby Dick'' by the light of a whale oil lamp. Now we \nare at the forefront of the most recent energy revolution.\n  Our electricity is getting cleaner, we are using it smarter, and it \nis getting cheaper. Massachusetts is now the No. 1 State in the country \nwhen it comes to energy efficiency. Just yesterday Boston was named \nAmerica's most energy-efficient city.\n  Our shores will host the first offshore wind energy farm in the \nNation. The same winds that brought the pilgrims to Plymouth Rock will \nnow power a new generation of jobs in Massachusetts.\n  Massachusetts is seventh in the Nation in solar installed per person, \neven in a State more known for the perfect storm than for perfect sunny \ndays.\n  In Massachusetts alone, clean energy now employs 80,000 people across \n5,000 businesses in our State.\n  If we continue our commitments to clean energy, we will put \nsteelworkers, iron workers, welders, and electricians to work building \na new backbone for a new energy economy in the United States and around \nthe world.\n  Massachusetts is the hub for biotech on the entire planet. We are No. \n1 in per-capita dollars awarded by the National Institutes of Health, \nsupporting 35,000 jobs Statewide. Health is our first wealth, but in \nMassachusetts it is also one of the best job creators.\n  We are an idea factory pumping out new concepts, creating new \ncompanies that produce new jobs and discover cures for deadly diseases.\n  In Massachusetts, we recognize that education is a ladder of \nopportunity that allows every child to maximize their God-given \nabilities. The first public school in America was established in \nMassachusetts. Today, Massachusetts students are No. 1 in the Nation in \nmath, in reading, and tied for No. 1 with New York in science.\n  For students in Massachusetts and around the country, we should never \nlet the big dreams of attending college be thwarted by the small print \nof overly burdensome loans.\n  As children learn in an online environment, we need to make sure they \ncan grow, develop, and make mistakes that won't derail a promising \nfuture. That is why I will soon introduce my do not track kids \nlegislation on a bipartisan basis to protect the privacy of children \nonline.\n  The value of our economy grows because it is imbued with our American \nvalues. What unites us is the unshakable belief that no matter where \nyou come from, no matter what your circumstances, you can achieve the \nAmerican dream. We believe everyone should get a fair shot. No one \nshould be left behind.\n  It is time to get back to the values that made Massachusetts and this \ncountry great. It is time to make real progress, creating an economy \nthat works for everyone. It is time to protect a woman's right to \nchoose. It is time to deliver to the LGBT community all of the \nprotections and rights under the Constitution.\n  It is time that we put real gun control measures on the books. The \nhorrific mass shooting at the Navy yard is the latest deadly reminder \nthat we need to do more to stem the tide of gun violence in this \ncountry. Newtown, Aurora--these tragedies are not inevitable, they are \npreventable. This senseless carnage must end.\n  We need a ban on assault weapons, and we need a ban on high-capacity \nmagazines. We need universal background checks combined with \ncomprehensive care for our mentally ill. We need to put an end to the \npartisan gridlock that prevents even the most basic of gun control \nmeasures from becoming law.\n  In the next few weeks we will see our seventh fight over our debt and \ndeficit in the last couple of years. We need to break down this rampant \nideology that threatens to turn a government that works for the people \ninto a government that simply shuts down.\n  We must also end the mindless across-the-board cuts from \nsequestration. Cutting programs such as Head Start will leave a \ngeneration of kids lagging behind. Slashing investments in science \nmeans the breakthroughs that create jobs and cure deadly diseases could \ngo undiscovered. Cutting defense spending mindlessly can undermine our \nsecurity.\n  We need a new transportation bill that puts union workers back out \nthere working, rebuilding our roads and our bridges.\n  While many economists have labeled the recent downturn a recession, \nfor our working families and low-wage earners it has become an economic \ndepression. Economic inequality tears at the fabric that makes our \ncountry great. It turns ``E pluribus unum'' into ``everyone for \nthemselves.'' We must raise the minimum wage for the people who are \nstruggling to make it into the middle class.\n  We need to create an end to the era of climate denial. Climate change \nis irrefutable. It is raising sea levels. It is giving storms more \npower.\n  The planet is running a fever. There are no emergency rooms for \nplanets.\n\n[[Page S6554]]\n\nWe must put in place the preventive care of unleashing a renewable \nenergy revolution in wind and solar, in biomass and geothermal, and in \nenergy efficiency to avoid the worst, most catastrophic impact of \nclimate change on this planet. We are seeing it on an ongoing basis not \njust here in our country but across the planet.\n  Our moral duty to future generations calls for us to address climate \nchange, but it also is an economic opportunity to create new jobs here \nin our country.\n  I will soon introduce legislation that will call for America, by \n2025, to reach a 25-percent target of clean energy and energy \nefficiency improvements. This bill will create jobs as it cuts \npollution. And I will continue to work to pass climate legislation, as \nI did in the House of Representatives.\n  I will also introduce legislation to fix our aging natural gas system \nin Massachusetts and across the country, making it cleaner and more \nefficient. We can use affordable natural gas and clean energy, built \nand delivered through the work of union hands, to power new American \nmanufacturing centers. That is a job-creation triple play--generate new \nenergy, build new infrastructure, and manufacture new American \nproducts.\n  We must not massively export our natural gas abroad or I fear we will \ncontinue to export our young men and women to dangerous places all over \nthe world and lose opportunities to lower electricity rates here and to \nincrease the manufacturing jobs here in the United States.\n  Fifty years ago President Kennedy announced the ambitious goal of \nsending an American safely to the Moon. He told us that we would need a \ngiant rocket made of new metal alloys, some of which had not yet been \ninvented. It would have to be fitted together with precision better \nthan the finest watch. It would have to be able to be returned to Earth \nsafely at speeds never before approximated by humanity. And it would \nall have to be done in less than 8 years.\n  President Kennedy urged us to be bold. I say to this Chamber, it is \ntime for us to be bold. In this era of innovation, there are jobs that \nare not yet imagined in fields that haven't been created with \nindustries that don't yet exist. We should be bold.\n  America watched with pride as Neil Armstrong stepped onto the Moon \nand an American flag was planted as a symbol of our success. In this \nCapitol Building, there is a flag that was brought back from the Moon. \nIt testifies to the returns we receive when we invest in American \ningenuity, when we seek the dawn of discovery, when we invest in our \npeople and in our industries, and when we follow the universal American \nvalues of justice and tolerance and liberty and equality.\n  We can use our talents and our tools to help all people everywhere \nbuild a more peaceful, prosperous future.\n  I look forward to working with every Senator in the months and years \nahead to make the 21st century more educated, more healthy, more \nprosperous, and more fair than the 20th century was. That is our \nchallenge. That is our opportunity. But we must do it together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I extend my appreciation to Senator \nMarkey. I had the good fortune of serving in the House of \nRepresentatives with him. When he decided to run for the Senate, I was \nexcited, and I am so happy he is here with us. The speech he just gave \nindicates the work we should be doing. I have always admired him.\n  I appreciate very much what he has done for the State of Nevada in \nmany different areas. He has been at the forefront of protecting Nevada \nfrom the ravages of something that could be an environmental disaster--\nnuclear waste--and has been someone who has led the country in so many \ndifferent ways in recognizing the dangers of climate change.\n  In telecommunications, no one in the last 30 years has done more for \nmodernizing our telecommunications system than Ed Markey. So I \nappreciate very much his good work.\n  As I sat and listened to this remarkably important speech, I thought \nof the Massachusetts delegation--two new Senators, but what wonderful \nSenators they are, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Ed Markey. The \npotential they have is so astounding.\n  On the news today: This will be the least productive Senate in the \nhistory of the country. People, such as the Senators from \nMassachusetts, are being prevented from doing good. There is no better \nexample of that than the Senator who was on the floor listening to \nSenator Markey, the senior Senator from New Hampshire.\n  A bill to make our energy consumption around America more efficient, \nenergy efficiency, a bill we should have done a long time ago--we can't \ndo it because we have the anarchists running the House of \nRepresentatives, and they are doing a pretty good job over here too. I \nwould say about 40 percent of the Republicans over here are anarchists, \ntea party-driven.\n  This Energy bill has five nongermane amendments, most of them dealing \nwith health care. The Republicans are obsessed with what is the law of \nthe land--ObamaCare. It has been the law for almost 4 years. The U.S. \nSupreme Court has said it is constitutional, but that doesn't take away \ntheir obsession to try to undercut this legislation, which is going \ninto effect in a big way on October 1.\n  It is a shame that we are not able to legislate the way we did. \nEverything is a squabble and a fight. I came here more than three \ndecades ago having already had a legislative career in the State of \nNevada, and we have been able to work together to do so many good \nthings--until recently.\n  We are now waiting to see what the House of Representatives is going \nto do, how absurd what it sends us is going to be. We know it is going \nto be something really strange and weird because the Speaker has to do \neverything he can to try to mold a piece of legislation to meet the \nneeds of the tea party, the anarchists. And I say that without any \nequivocation. They do not want government to work on any level--not the \nlocal level, not the State level, and certainly not here. Any day that \nis a bad day for government is a cheering day for them.\n  So I am so impressed with the Senator's speech, but I am distressed \nat what is going on here in the Senate as far as trying to get work \ndone. Bipartisanship is a thing of the past. Now all we do is \n``gotcha'' legislation.\n  I was given this assurance by many Republicans: Let's do energy. \nEnergy efficiency--let's do it. We will work together on a bipartisan \nbasis.\n  And the first thing out of the box is something that will derail this \nlegislation.\n  So I am thankful that we have a new Senator who is as talented and as \ngood as he is, but I wish his talents could be better put to work here \nin the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Madam President, I am proud to come to the floor today to \nwelcome my colleague Ed Markey on giving his first speech on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  Long before I became a U.S. Senator, Ed Markey was in the House of \nRepresentatives, became the dean of the Massachusetts delegation, and \nhas been out there working for the families of Massachusetts and the \nfamilies of this country. He has been a leader on issues ranging from \nenergy and the environment to technology and telecommunications, and he \nknows how to get things done. That is very inspiring.\n  I just wanted to come by today to listen to his first speech, \ncongratulate him on his first speech, and to say how much I am looking \nforward to working with my partner Ed Markey in the Senate. We are \ngoing to do our best to get something done.\n  Congratulations.\n  Mr. MARKEY. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/18/senate-section/article/S6554-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 1392, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1392) to promote energy savings in residential \n     buildings and industry, and for other purposes.\n\n\n[[Page S6555]]\n\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Wyden (for Merkley) amendment No. 1858, to provide for a \n     study and report on standby usage power standards implemented \n     by States and other industrialized nations.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I also would like to welcome the new \nSenator from Massachusetts to this body. I listened to his speech, and \nwe will have some discussions over some of those items at some time, I \nam certain. But I also listened to the leader's speech following that, \nand I am a little bit disappointed in that speech.\n  He mentioned that we were the least productive Senate in history. I \nthink there is a reason for that, and the reason is that we are doing \ndealmaking now instead of legislating.\n  I came here 16 years ago and have watched for a number of years as we \nhave legislated--and ``legislated'' means getting votes on \namendments. Getting votes on amendments happens much quicker than \ntrying to make some kind of deal to limit amendments. Yes, some of the \namendments in all those years have not been relevant to the bill we \nwere talking about. Usually, once they have been covered, they are kind \nof done with and they do not come up on every bill. But the same tactic \nhas been used to stifle amendments to bills, even relevant ones.\n\n  Both sides are at fault. It is not just one side. Both sides are \nstopping amendments from being voted on. We need to vote on amendments. \nOf course, the first one up is one I have been working on. The reason \nit is being brought up on this bill is that this is the first bill \nafter a recess on which we can put anything.\n  During the recess, there was a huge change in the health care reform \nbill. That huge change was that the President decided he would exempt \nCongress from being under the bill, from having to do the same thing \nthe rest of America will do. If you work in a business in America, a \nprivate business, and your business does not provide insurance and you \nhave to go on the exchange--now, of course, the Senate and Federal \nGovernment provides insurance, but we all agreed we would go on the \nexchange because the American people had to go on the exchange. When we \ngo on the exchange, we should have to abide by the same rules as \nanybody else who goes on the exchange.\n  Private business, if they say we are not going to buy insurance, \ntheir people have to go on the exchange, and if they go on the \nexchange, they cannot get a contribution from their employer for their \ninsurance. There is a subsidy for people who earn under, I think it is \n$42,000 a year as an individual or $92,000 as a family. They can get a \nFederal subsidy. They cannot get a subsidy from their employer.\n  The President decided, through the Office of Personnel Management, \nthat Senators should be able to move that contribution over to the \nexchanges. That is different from everybody else. We should have to \nlive under the same laws we passed. That was the contention we made \nwhen we put that amendment in the bill. That amendment went in the bill \nin the Health, Education, Labor & Pensions Committee. It went in the \nbill in the Finance Committee. It was agreed to on the floor of the \nSenate. We said we ought to be under the same rules as everybody else \nwhen it comes to the health exchanges, and we ought to try those health \nexchanges so we can see what America is going through.\n  We did that. We did it--maybe did it to ourselves--but that is the \nway government ought to work, with those who pass the law living under \nthe law. All we are asking for is a vote to see if the Senate agrees we \nought to live under the law the way the other people will have to live \nunder the law.\n  As far as delaying the bill, it only takes probably 30 minutes for a \n15-minute vote. It should only take 15 minutes for a 15-minute vote, \nbut it takes 30 minutes at least, sometimes a couple hours for a 15-\nminute vote, if it is a close one and they want to negotiate with some \nof the people voting on it, but we ought to have to vote on it. We \nought to put our names on the line as to how we feel about having the \nAmerican people in a situation where their employer cannot contribute \nto their health insurance if they go on the exchange and make that same \nlaw apply to us.\n  I traveled Wyoming during the recess. We traveled about 6,000 miles \nby car, and I did a lot of listening sessions. I never heard anybody \nsay, no, I think Congress ought to be able to continue doing what they \nhave been doing before; instead, Congress ought to come under the same \nlaw.\n  There is a little addition to this bill that we did not put in the \noriginal bill. Maybe that is what is holding it up. That little \naddition to the bill is saying the President and the Vice President and \nthe President's appointees should come under the same rules as Congress \nin this instance, going into the exchange. I hope the President, since \nthe bill is kind of named after him, would want to be under the bill \njust like everybody else. If we are not going to allow contributions \nfrom businesses to go to regular people who go onto the exchange, then \nthe same rule ought to apply to us.\n  That is pretty much what the amendment says. It clarifies the law and \nmakes sure the Office of Personnel Management cannot exempt us without \nauthority. It is more than a clarification, it is a complete reversal \nof what we passed in this body. When we passed it, I think on the floor \nit was unanimous. That means it was pretty bipartisan. That means we \nall agreed that maybe we ought to live under the same laws as the rest \nof the people in America.\n  Let's just have a vote on it. As I say, 30 minutes is about all it \nwould take for a 15-minute vote and we could move on to other issues. \nThat is the way we used to do things around here. It was not unusual \nfor a bill to have 150 amendments. I don't ever remember voting on 150 \namendments because there is some duplication in amendments that are \nturned in. There are also some people who realize, as the debate goes \nalong, that their amendment would not pass and they do not want it to \nbe voted on and lose when they might be able to win with it later. Of \ncourse I am in favor of doing relevant amendments on bills. You will \nfind usually any amendment I am signed on to is relevant to the bill.\n  The reason this is an exception is because it came up during the \nrecess and the effect begins on October 1. I do not know what other \nbills are going to come up before October 1. At the pace we are going, \nthis will not even make it by October 1. Just voting on bills rather \nthan trying to negotiate it down to a 10-vote package--on the \nimmigration bill I think we had 9 votes. It took us 3 weeks. There were \nabout 200 amendments, probably 150 that could have been voted on and in \n3 weeks I think we could have been through 150 of them and it would \nhave made it a better bill. That is what legislating is.\n  All of those would not have passed. Maybe very few would have passed. \nMaybe only 9 would have passed. But people would have had a decision \nand would have been able to represent what their people back home are \ntelling them, and that is what we are supposed to do here. The reason \nthe Senate has the rules it does is so we can actually represent the \npeople back home. One of the ways we do that is through amendments. \nOccasionally, there will be surprises that something that is not \nrelevant might wind up on a bill. Usually, if it is not relevant, it \ngets defeated. There is usually a way to process a whole lot of \namendments in a hurry; that is, with a tabling motion, but we are just \nnot getting the vote. We ought to do some voting around here and move \non.\n  This is an important bill, and there are some good amendments that \nhave been turned in on which we would also like a vote. We should go \nthrough them and then we can be a productive body. Then we could cover \na lot of bills that would go through in about 3 days, but we spend days \nnegotiating not having amendments, and when we have that pent-up \nobjection to our amendments not getting on there, it gets more pent up, \nmore angry, more divisive, more partisan as the process goes by.\n  What I have referred to, the way the Senate used to work--just vote \non amendments. We will not like all of them. We know some of them will \nwind up in an ad against us when we run, but that has always been the \ncase and there is no reason to change it now.\n  I hope we vote on amendments and get busy. It is an important bill. I \nwould like to see the bill finished. We need to do a lot of things on \nenergy for\n\n[[Page S6556]]\n\nthis country, particularly to keep energy prices down where people \nexpect them to be. Again, let's vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I certainly appreciate the comments \nfrom my friend and fellow Senator. He does speak to the obvious. We \nhave an opportunity for some amendments on what I think most of us \nwould agree is an important bill, this energy efficiency bill. How we \nmove forward is indicative of whether this is a body that is going to \nstart working, whether this is going to be a body that is defined as \ndysfunctional or, as was suggested earlier in a report that came out \nearly in September, that this Senate could prove to be the least \nproductive in our Senate history.\n  That is not a title or a banner this Senator wants to wear. I think \nwe want to work around here. I think we want to try to produce. I think \nwe want to legislate. In fact, I know that is what I want to do. That \nis why I applaud my colleagues, Senator Shaheen and Senator Portman, \nfor all of the effort they have given--themselves, their staffs working \nwith the chairman of the energy committee, his staff, my staff working \ntogether for a couple of years now--to produce what I think is a pretty \ngood bill. This is a bill that is focused on a piece of our energy \nportfolio, if you will, that is critically important: the aspect of \nefficiency and how we work to use less.\n  What we have in front of us is not legislation that is controversial \nin the sense that it is pitting different philosophies against one \nanother. We are bogged down in our own inertia and cannot figure out \nhow we even get to start. That is a pretty poor reflection on us. The \nway we get to start is how we started this debate just a few days ago, \nwhen Senator Wyden and I came to the floor with the sponsors of the \nbill, Senator Shaheen, Senator Portman, and we said: OK, great bill. We \ntalked about the advantages of energy efficiency and all that Shaheen-\nPortman delivers, this very bipartisan product and effort.\n  Then we started talking about amendments, amendments that would \nactually strengthen this bill. We had no fewer than one dozen Members \ncome to the floor, on both sides of the aisle, talking about their good \nideas, how we are going to build in more efficiencies--whether it is in \nour schools or public buildings; how we can help nonprofits. These are \nall good, strong, healthy ideas.\n  Then we are here today and, as my friend from Wyoming has indicated, \nwe are stalled out. We are not moving forward. The majority leader \nsuggested this morning--his words, not mine--that we perhaps would not \nfinish this legislation. That is quite disturbing to me. That is quite \ndisturbing to me because if we cannot finish legislation such as an \nenergy efficiency bill, something that most of us would recognize is a \ngood approach to our energy issues in this country, what are we going \nto be able to do on the very big stuff?\n  We talk about pent-up demand for amendments. Let me suggest there is \na pent-up demand for real energy legislation. For 5 years now we have \nnot seen an energy measure debated on the floor of the Senate. That \ndoesn't mean we have not passed some good energy bills. In fact, I was \npleased to work with the chairman in passing two hydroelectric bills \njust before the August recess. These are good bills. These are truly \ngoing to help us as we work to reduce our emissions, provide for jobs, \nprovide for greater electrification across the country. These are good. \nBut we have not had that good, comprehensive discussion about the \nenergy issues that have impacted our Nation in the past 5 years.\n  Think about what has happened in 5 years. Five years ago, if someone \nhad mentioned the shale revolution, people would not have had a clue \nwhat they were talking about.\n  Think about what has happened with natural gas over the past 5 years. \nThe Presiding Officer knows full well because her State has the lowest \nunemployment in the Nation. The Presiding Officer represents a State \nwhere almost everybody has a job. In fact, most people have two or \nthree jobs.\n  When you think about the changing dynamics of an energy world, think \nabout it in the context of a timeline. What happened over the last 5 \nyears? Boom. Think about what happened to the economy. We read the \narticles from just a couple of weeks ago about how natural gas is not \nonly helping those who work in the industry, it is a rising tide that \nlifts all boats. When people are paying less for their utilities, it \nallows them to spend more on the economy, and as a result everyone is \nbenefiting. Our economy is benefiting and the unemployment picture is \nimproving.\n  We are seeing good, positive things because of our energy future. \nEverybody seems to be bullish about it except us in the Senate because \nwe cannot seem to get an energy bill to the floor. When we do finally \nhave a bill, after years of good hard work by good folks wanting to do \nthe right thing, we get to the floor and we get stalled out.\n  Again, there is pent-up demand for amendments because what we have \nknown as regular order has not been so regular anymore. The chairman of \nthe energy committee, and I, as the ranking member, think we have \nworked very hard. We have worked diligently on a daily basis to make \nsure we are working within our committee. We are producing bills.\n  In fact, as I understand, our committee has produced more than half \nof all the bills that have been reported and are ready for action on \nthe floor. We have rolled up our sleeves and said: There are going to \nbe areas where we disagree, but on those areas where we can come \ntogether and make some good happen, let's make it happen, and we have \nbeen doing that. But you know what. If a committee works hard and \nproduces good things and still doesn't go anywhere--wow. After a while \nwe wonder why we are working so hard around here.\n  I know why I am working hard. I am working hard because the people in \nmy State pay more for their energy than anyplace else in the country. I \nam working hard to make sure we have jobs for Alaskans and jobs for all \npeople. I am working hard because I think the energy policy is \nfundamental to everything we do. We need to have the opportunity to \nhave a full-on debate, and if we have some amendments that are tough, \nthat is the way it is. Nobody asked me to come here and represent the \npeople of Alaska because they knew that every vote was going to be \neasy. That is not how it works. Let's take some of the hard votes and \nlet's get to the business at hand, which is a good, strong, bipartisan \nenergy efficiency bill. Then when we are done with that one, I want to \nwork with the chairman to address the unfinished business.\n  I want to work on measures that will help us enhance our energy \nproduction, whether it is with our natural gas onshore or offshore, \nwhether it is to do what we can so we truly become an energy-\nindependent nation or whether it is how we deal with some pretty hard \nissues, such as how we treat our nuclear waste and how we are going to \nmove forward with an energy future that is based on renewables and \nalternatives, which I am all about.\n  We all stand here and talk about an ``all of the above'' approach. \nBut you know what. People stop believing it when we just talk about it \nand we don't do anything to enhance our policies because we cannot get \na bill to the floor. Then, when we get a bill to the floor, we \nhamstring ourselves.\n  I am not ready to give up on this energy efficiency bill. I am not \nready to give up on energy policy or legislating in the energy sector \njust because we are getting bogged down. We have to demonstrate to the \nAmerican public that we are governing. They are asking us to lead in an \narea on which we have not legislated in 5 years.\n  I know my colleague from Oregon, the chairman, agrees with me when I \nsay we had some issues within our committee, and we are proud of the \nwork we have done. We have proposals that focus on how we can make \nexisting programs better or perhaps we need to repeal them. We have \nworked hard on a bipartisan basis with the authorizers and the \nappropriators to develop a good, solid proposal for how we deal with \nnuclear waste. If we cannot move forward on energy efficiency, how are \nwe going to tackle these hard issues? How are we going to tackle the \nissues as they relate to this amazing expansion of natural gas and the \nrecognition that we need to have an infrastructure\n\n[[Page S6557]]\n\nthat keeps up with demand and everything else that is going on?\n  We are not giving up on this bill. We are not going to give up on the \ngood bipartisan work Senator Shaheen and Senator Portman have crafted. \nThere are many other Members who have stepped forward to say: This is \ngood stuff. Let's make it happen. So there is a lot of pent-up demand. \nFor those who have waited a couple of weeks for their amendment, good. \nWe need to address those too. But let's not sacrifice a good, strong \nbill that can be made better by good amendments to the bill itself. \nLet's not sacrifice that. This is a bill that has been in process for a \ncouple of years because folks are saying: I have to have my piece right \nnow. We can figure out how we craft an agreement that is workable from \nboth sides.\n  I am certainly prepared to continue that work, and if the deal that \nhas been offered at this point in time is not acceptable, OK, let's go \nback and figure out what is going to be acceptable. Let's not throw in \nthe towel. This is too important. We have too much pent-up demand for \nenergy solutions for this country.\n  I am here to stay focused on the issues at hand, but what we have in \nfront of us--the bill we are working on--is a good, strong, bipartisan \nenergy efficiency bill, and I want to continue that. I know my \ncolleague, the chairman of the committee, wants to continue with that, \nand I think that is our effort here.\n  With that, I thank those who have stuck with us throughout this past \nweek, but I am hoping we are going to be sticking with this for a while \nlonger and we are going to see this bill cross the finish line.\n  I know the chairman wants to speak as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I could see that we both--the Presiding Officer and I--\nwere riveted by Senator Murkowski and her remarks for a reason. Her \nremarks were truly inspiring. I will just say I think the Senate needed \nto hear Senator Murkowski's remarks, and I think that is why the \nSenator from North Dakota, and all of us, were listening so carefully.\n  I just want to highlight some of what Senator Murkowski said. The \nbill we are considering now is pretty much the platonic ideal for \nconsensus legislation. It pretty much follows the kind of rules Senator \nEnzi and Senator Kennedy used to talk about--that wonderful 80-20 rule. \nI remember Senator Enzi talking to me about how they would try to agree \non 80 percent but may not agree on 20 percent.\n  The Shaheen-Portman legislation has the Kennedy-Enzi type of \nprinciple, where 80 percent of it is common ground that makes sense, \ndoesn't have any mandates, uses the private sector, and focuses on \nefficiency which creates jobs. Frankly, around the world, some of the \nother countries try to get ahead by paying people low wages. We are \ntrying to get ahead with legislation such as this, so we can wring more \nvalue out of the American economy and save money for businesses and \nconsumers.\n  I think Senator Shaheen and Senator Portman are going to talk more \nabout the 3 years they put into meeting that kind of Kennedy-Enzi \nprinciple of good government and finding common ground. I can tell \neveryone that when they write a textbook on how we ought to put \ntogether a bipartisan bill, these two fine Senators have complied with \nit.\n  It is not by osmosis that they got the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the \nNational Association of Manufacturers, and the Business Roundtable to \nmeet halfway with some of the country's leading environmental groups. \nIt is because--as the Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator from \nOhio demonstrated--they were out there sweating the efforts to try to \nfind common ground. Of course, neither side gets exactly what they \nwant, but that is how they built this extraordinary coalition.\n  Point No. 2 that Senator Murkowski addressed--and I think it is very \nimportant as it was highlighted by my visit to the Presiding Officer's \nState in the last few days--is the whole question with respect to \nfuture legislation.\n  I come from a State--my colleagues know this--that doesn't produce \nany fossil fuels. We are a hydrostate and we have renewables, so a lot \nof people said: Ron is going to be chairman of the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources so nobody is going to talk about anything except \nhydro and renewables.\n  The first hearing we held in our committee was on natural gas. The \nreason why Senator Murkowski and I made that decision jointly is \nbecause there ought to be bipartisan common ground on capping the \npotential of natural gas for our country, our consumers, and the \nplanet. It is 50 percent cleaner than the other fossil fuels. We have \nit, the world wants it, and a lot of companies are talking about coming \nback from overseas because they want that pricing advantage.\n  What I have been talking about to Senators--and I do it at every \nopportunity--is how do we find a win-win approach that is good for the \nconsumer and good for business and good for the environment? For \nexample, for natural gas we are going to need a way to get that gas to \nmarkets, and that is going to mean more pipelines. So one of the ideas \nthat I want to talk about with Senators on our committee as well as off \nthe committee is, wouldn't it make sense to say if we are going to need \nmore pipelines, the pipelines of the future ought to be better, meet \nthe needs of the industry, and also help us get that added little \nbenefit for consumers and the planet by not wasting energy.\n  I saw folks in North Dakota working really hard to try to deal with \nflaring and these methane emissions. So what I would like to do is \nexactly what Senator Murkowski described this morning. She wants to get \na bipartisan energy efficiency bill, which is a logical place to start, \nas the Senator said, on the ``all of the above'' strategy.\n  When we are done with that, we are going to move on to a whole host \nof other issues and in each case take as our lodestar this kind of win-\nwin concept that can bring people together to find some common ground \nso we can tackle big issues. If we do that in the energy context, we \nwill be doing something that helps create good-paying jobs, helps the \nconsumer, and is also good for the planet.\n  My sense right now is that we have a number of issues colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle have felt strongly about for quite some \ntime.\n  I think there is a real chance--and I have been advocating for it--to \nwork out an agreement to deal with the two issues that have been \nparticularly on the minds of some colleagues on the other side of the \naisle--the health care issue and Keystone. Certainly I think there is a \nway to find common ground on those two issues procedurally so we could \nhave a vote on two issues I have heard particularly conservative \ncolleagues say are extraordinarily important to them. At that point, if \nour leadership could get an agreement on those two--and they could \nnegotiate on any other matters where we could agree--but what we would \nensure is we wouldn't have a situation where, in effect, a handful of \ncolleagues who want to offer amendments unrelated to energy efficiency \nwouldn't be blocking dozens of Senators of both political parties who \nwould like to offer bipartisan energy efficiency amendments. That is \nwhat we would face if we don't find a way to work this out.\n  I am part of this ``we aren't giving up caucus'' Senator Murkowski \ndescribed, because I think we came here to find a way to come together \nand deal with these issues. I will say, speaking for myself, if there \nis one thing I want to be able to take away from my time in public \nservice--just one thing--and I would say to Senator Murkowski that \napparently the Presiding Officer was a volunteer in my first campaign; \nI was a Gray Panther, had a full head of hair and rugged good looks and \nall that--she is denying that, I can tell--if there is one thing I wish \nto take away from my time in public service it is what Senator \nMurkowski alluded to, which is that we did everything on our watch to \nfind common ground and deal with some of these issues.\n  That is why Senator Isakson and I have a fresh approach that I think \nwill appeal to both sides of the aisle on Medicare. I have been \ninvolved with Senators on bipartisan tax reform, and Senator Murkowski \nand I have been working on energy. She said, Let's not miss this ideal \nopportunity to put good government into action and that is by moving \nahead with the Shaheen-Portman legislation.\n\n[[Page S6558]]\n\n  Let us get an agreement. I think it ought to be achievable in the \nnext few hours. I am going to go back--I have met with leadership on \nboth sides and I am making the case that I think there is a procedural \nway out. I think Senator Murkowski described it with the goodwill she \ndemonstrated in what I thought was an inspiring address, and I can tell \nthe Presiding Officer thought the same thing. I think we can find our \nway out of this.\n  I see the sponsors of the underlying legislation, Senator Shaheen and \nSenator Portman, on the floor. I wish to thank them for the fact they \nhave consistently said throughout this process they are willing to work \nwith Senator Murkowski and me for this kind of procedural route \nforward, and I think it is achievable, particularly if Senators reflect \non the outstanding remarks just given by the Senator from Alaska.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I am pleased to join Chairman Wyden \nand Ranking Member Murkowski on the floor of the Senate today. I want \nto sign up for the ``get it done caucus,'' because I think this is \nlegislation we can get done. It has bipartisan support from I believe \nthe majority of the Members in this Senate. I think if we can get some \nagreement to move forward on this legislation and on the amendments, we \ncan show the public, which is very frustrated with what is happening \nhere in Washington, that we can actually get something done.\n  I wish to thank Senator Wyden and Senator Murkowski for all of their \ngreat work on the energy committee. I had the opportunity to serve my \nfirst 4 years on the energy committee. It is a great committee. They \nhave done a terrific job of showing what it is like to be able to get \nwork done, to be able to get people to come together and figure out \nwhere they can get agreement and move forward. It was in that spirit \nthat Senator Portman and I started working together 3 years ago, when \nwe were both members of the energy committee, on energy efficiency \nlegislation, working with the Alliance to Save Energy, and a number of \nmembers of the business community, and with all of these groups that \nhave endorsed this legislation, to try and put together a bill where we \ncould find some agreement. There has been a lot of division around \nenergy issues in the last decade or so.\n  That is why it has been I think 6 years--actually since 2007--since \nan energy bill has come to the floor of the Senate, because there are \nthose of us who believe the best way forward is to focus on fossil \nfuels and more oil and gas. There are others who believe alternatives \nand renewables, hydro and solar and wind, are the best way forward.\n  One of the aspects that is true in this entire energy debate, whether \none comes from North Dakota, as the Presiding Officer does, or New \nHampshire, as I do, is that energy efficiency benefits all of us. It \ndoesn't matter which form of energy one supports or which region of the \ncountry one is from; this is a place where we can get some consensus. \nIt is agreement that allows us to move forward on job creation; it \nallows us to move forward on saving on pollution.\n  We have had several Senators on the floor over the last couple of \ndays talking about the challenges of climate change and what is \nhappening with our weather. This is a way to save on those emissions. \nIt is a way to address cost savings. I have been to businesses all over \nNew Hampshire that have been able to stay competitive because they have \nreduced their energy costs. In a State such as New Hampshire where we \nhave the sixth highest energy costs in the country, it is important for \nus to figure out how we can lower those costs. That is one of the \nthings this bill does.\n  The other aspect of the legislation that we haven't talked about as \nmuch on the floor is it reduces our dependence on foreign oil and \nforeign sources of energy, so it is also critical to our national \nsecurity. As we think about our energy challenges in the future, making \nsure we can produce the energy we use in the United States is very \nimportant. As we think about what is happening in the Middle East, as \nwe think about the challenges we have to stay competitive in the world, \nenergy, as Senator Murkowski said so well, is something that affects \neverything we do.\n  This bill has been criticized by some quarters for not being robust \nenough. I appreciate there are provisions in the legislation I might \nnot have chosen to put in. There are others I would like to have seen \nin it we didn't get consensus on. But I think that is what we are \ntalking about when we are talking about how do we reach consensus on a \nbipartisan bill and how do we get something done that can get through \nnot only the Senate but the House. I think we have a good start in this \nlegislation.\n\n  The bill would do several things. First, it would strengthen national \nmodel building codes to make new homes and new commercial buildings \nmore energy efficient. We know about 40 percent of our energy used in \nthis country is used in buildings, so making sure those buildings are \nmore energy efficient is critical. It is particularly important for \nthose of us who are in the northeast. In New Hampshire we have a lot of \nold buildings because we are an older part of the country, so we have a \nlot of buildings that have been there for a long time and we need to do \nwhat we can to make them more energy efficient.\n  Then the legislation would also train the next generation of workers \nin energy-efficient commercial building design and operation. It would \nexpand on university-based building training and research assessment \ncenters--something that is very important as we think about the future \nworkforce.\n  Let me go back because when I talked about the national model \nbuilding codes, I wanted to make sure everybody is clear that these \nbuilding codes are voluntary; they are not mandatory. As Senator \nPortman has said so well, there are no mandates in this legislation. \nThis is an effort to look at incentives, to look at how we can \nencourage the private sector and consumers to be more energy efficient.\n  Then the bill also deals with the manufacturing sector, which is the \nbiggest user of energy in our economy. It directs the Department of \nEnergy to work closely with private sector partners to encourage \nresearch, development, and commercialization of innovative energy-\nefficient technology and processes for industrial applications. That is \na mouthful, but what it says is--and this is something we heard from \nstakeholders, from those businesses that work in the energy industry, \nwhich is they want to have a better working relationship with the \nDepartment of Energy. They want to be able to feel as though there is \nsupport there as they are trying to take technologies to \ncommercialization. It also helps manufacturers reduce energy use and \nbecome more competitive by incentivizing the use of more energy-\nefficient electric motors and transformers.\n  About 4 percent of energy use in this country is through electric \nmotors and transformers. I have been interested in transformers because \nwe have a company in New Hampshire called Warner Power that has made \nthe first breakthrough in transformer design in 100 years. If we can \nget their energy-efficient transformers, or something like them, into \nbuildings and projects across the country, we could save significant \namounts of energy.\n  As we look at the manufacturing sector, the legislation also \nestablishes a program called Supply Star, to help make companies look \nat their supply chains and figure out how to make their supply chains \nmore efficient. I can remember when I was on the energy committee and \nwe were talking about this whole issue of supply chains and we were \ndebating whether it was important to encourage companies to look at \ntheir supply chains, people were saying, It doesn't make that much \ndifference in terms of the actual energy use. I pointed out that we \nhave a company in New Hampshire called Stoneyfield Farm that makes \nyogurt--great yogurt. If my colleagues haven't had it, they should try \nit. But they have been very interested in being more energy efficient. \nThey have looked at all of their processes and they have figured out \nhow they can do the best possible job at saving on energy. What they \ndiscovered is their biggest problem isn't how they produce the yogurt, \nit is the cows they depend upon for the milk to produce the yogurt \nbecause the cows release so much\n\n[[Page S6559]]\n\nmethane. That was the problem in terms of their supply chain and with \nthe amount of energy they were using. So helping companies take a look \nat their supply chain and figure out how to reduce the energy use \nthrough that supply chain is very important and it is an important \npiece of this bill.\n  Then the third section in the legislation deals with the Federal \nGovernment. I know all of us know this because we are here and we are \nworking hard on energy. The Federal Government is the biggest user of \nenergy in this country. Most of that energy is used by the military. \nAbout 93 percent is used by the military. The military understands it \nis important for them to figure out how to be more energy efficient. \nThey have been real leaders in government--the Navy in particular, but \nall branches in the military have looked at how they can be more \nefficient in using energy. Our legislation tries to incentivize the \nrest of the government to catch up with the military. So we would ask \nagencies to look at data centers--and we have some very good amendments \nfrom Senators Risch and Udall and Senator Coburn to take a look at data \ncenters because they are a big waster of energy in the Federal \nGovernment. It would allow Federal agencies to use existing funds to \nupdate plans when they are constructing new buildings so they can make \nthem more energy efficient. We have a number of amendments which would \nalso address how we can make the Federal Government more energy \nefficient and be a leader as we look at what is happening in the \nprivate sector to save on energy, so this bill is a very good start for \nhow to address energy efficiency. Senators Murkowski and Wyden have \nsaid we have over a dozen agreed to, bipartisan amendments that would \nmake the bill even better. I hope we can get to those amendments. I \nthink it is really important for us to do this.\n\n  But to answer those people who say that this is just a little bill, \nthat it is not going to make much difference, I would point to a new \nstudy that just came out from the American Council for an Energy-\nEfficient Economy. They looked at this legislation without the \namendments--and the amendments are going to make it better--and they \nsaid that if we can pass this legislation, by 2025 the legislation will \nencourage the creation of 136,000 new jobs, not just in businesses that \nare going to be more efficient and so they can create more jobs but in \nbusinesses that are producing the energy-efficient technologies that \nare going to allow us to be more energy efficient. By 2030 the bill \nwould net an annual savings of over $13 billion to consumers, and it \nwould lower carbon dioxide emissions and other air pollutants by the \nequivalent of taking 22 million cars off the road. That is a pretty \ngood savings and solution.\n  So, as we have all said, this is a win-win-win. It makes sense for us \nto move on this legislation. It makes sense for what we can accomplish \nwith the legislation itself. It makes sense in terms of other energy \nissues that are pending and what we need to do to make sure we position \nthe United States and our businesses and our families to be more energy \nefficient to be able to compete in the new energy world we are \nentering.\n  We need to start now to address energy, and I hope we are going to be \nable to get by the impediments that currently face us so we can begin \nto vote, so we can adopt the great amendments that have been proposed, \nand so we can actually act on this bill.\n  Thank you very much, Madam President.\n  I am pleased to see my partner on this legislation on the floor to \ntalk about why we need to pass this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I appreciate the comments of the \nSenator from New Hampshire on the important benefits of this \nlegislation. I will start by saying I think we are pretty close to \nfiguring out a way to move forward if we can get both the majority and \nthe minority party leadership teams to look at the list. We have about \na dozen bipartisan amendments ready to go on. In fact, more than half \nof those amendments have already been discussed at some length on the \nfloor, so I think the time agreement could be relatively narrow, and we \ncould move quickly. Some of them could be voice-voted. And then we have \nsome amendments that are not directly related to energy efficiency but \nrelated to energy. I would hope we could take those up as well.\n  My understanding is that there has been a general agreement to have a \nvote on the Vitter amendment. That is something I have heard on the \nfloor from leadership. And then we also have a Keystone amendment that \nI think there is an agreement to move forward on that relates to energy \nmore broadly and one where I think this body has a strong interest in \nexpressing itself.\n  I hope we could figure out how to move forward on this and do it \nquickly. We are wasting time right now. We have spent the last couple \ndays on the floor, again, talking about all these amendments. So if \nthere are concerns about time, let's get going because we can process \nthese amendments quickly. I appreciate the fact that the majority \nleader is working with us. He is keeping the door open. So we are going \nback and forth.\n  I really do believe this is a seminal moment in the sense that if we \ncannot even do a bipartisan bill like this on energy efficiency that \ncame out of the committee with a 19-to-3 vote, what can we do? It is an \nimportant piece of legislation. It is not a major piece of legislation \nlike the continuing resolution or the debt limit or tax reform or \nentitlement reform--things this body knows it has to address--but it is \na step forward, and I think it would provide a model for how we can \nmove forward on other issues.\n  We have spent 2\\1/2\\ years working on this legislation. We have been \nable to garner the support of over 260 businesses and trade \nassociations that believe this is good legislation for our country. \nThat is one reason we got a 19-to-3 vote out of committee. That is one \nreason there is a lot of support on the floor for this underlying bill. \nIt is ultimately about having a smart energy strategy.\n  I believe we should produce more energy here in this country, \nparticularly in the ground, in America, right now. I think that is good \nfor our economy and our country. We should also use it more \nefficiently. This is an opportunity to have a true ``all of the above'' \nstrategy--in this case, energy efficiency, going along with production \nand other important elements of an energy strategy that makes sense. I \nhope we will be able to make progress on this today and move forward \nand start to have some votes on these good amendments that actually \nimprove the legislation, in my view.\n  The jobs issue is also one that is paramount. Think about it. There \nis a report out that my colleague from New Hampshire talked about that \nsays there will be 136,000 additional jobs created by this legislation \nby 2030. I think that is a low-ball estimate because there will be jobs \ncreated in energy efficiency. In other words, by encouraging--not \nthrough mandates because there are no mandates in this legislation \nexcept on the Federal Government to get them to practice what they \npreach, as we talked about yesterday--by encouragement and incentives, \nthere will be more jobs created in the energy efficiency field. That is \ngood for our economy.\n  More significantly to me, there will be jobs created because American \nbusinesses will be more competitive. They will be able to spend less on \nenergy and more on expanding plant and equipment and people, and they \nwill be hiring more people as they level the playing field, in essence, \non one of the essential costs of doing business, which is the cost of \nenergy. We need that right now. Our economy is weak. We have not had \nthe recovery all of us hoped for. They say it is the weakest economic \nrecovery we have lived through since the Great Depression. We simply \nneed to have that shot in the arm. This is one way to do it. It is not \nthe only way to do it, but it would certainly help.\n  Finally, it is going to help our economy in ways that are important. \nRight now we have a trade deficit, and it is driven by a couple \nfactors. One is China and the other is energy. Taking those two out \nwould be almost an even balance of payments. That trade deficit is \ndriven in part by the fact that we still have this demand for a lot of \nforeign energy. By making these relatively small important steps in \nenergy efficiency, it will actually reduce our dependency on foreign \nsources of energy.\n\n[[Page S6560]]\n\n  As I said earlier, I think we should produce more energy in this \ncountry. That is part of the answer, but part of it is also using it \nmore efficiently, using it more wisely, which I believe is a \nconservative value, and it also happens to help on the trade deficit \nand therefore will help our underlying economy.\n  These are all positive aspects of this legislation that I would think \nMembers on both sides of the aisle acknowledge. If we cannot move \nforward again on something that makes so much sense, that does have \nthat kind of support across the aisle, I worry about whether we can \ndeal with these bigger issues that we must deal with for the American \npeople.\n  It also, of course, leads to a cleaner environment. Why? Because of \nhaving to build fewer powerplants. And through efficiency you are going \nto have fewer emissions.\n  This is why you have groups from the chamber of commerce--which is \nkey voting this legislation, by the way--to groups on the environmental \nside saying this is good legislation. It makes sense. Strange \nbedfellows when you have the National Association of Manufacturers and \nthe chamber of commerce and other business groups with environmental \ngroups, such as the Natural Resources Defense Council, saying this \nmakes sense. Let's move forward with it.\n  I am hopeful we can move forward not just on resolving these \ndifferences on what amendments can be offered and voted on but also \nmove forward on this underlying bill, send it to the House, where there \nis interest in this bill, where there is on both sides of the aisle an \ninterest in taking up efficiency legislation, and then send it to the \nPresident for his signature and actually be able to go home and say: \nYou know what. We did something here to help create jobs, grow the \neconomy, have a cleaner environment, deal with our trade deficit, and \nagain create a model for how other issues can be resolved.\n  For Members who are listening and who have not come to the floor yet \nto talk about their amendments, I hope they will do that because we may \nhave a relatively narrow window now because of the fact that we are \nspending so much time trying to resolve these differences on which \namendments can get a vote. I am hopeful we will have the opportunity to \nstart voting today yet. If we do, we can move quickly and we can \ndispose of these issues.\n  By the way, some of the issues are not directly related to energy \nefficiency. If they do not come up on this bill, they are going to come \nup on another bill, so it is better, in my estimation, for us to go \nahead and have some of these debates, have some of these discussions, \ngo ahead and see the votes. Again, they should be subject to time \nlimitations. We should have a reasonable list. We think we have a \nreasonable list now, going back and forth, and I am hopeful we will be \nable to resolve that. But in the meantime, if Members can come down and \ntalk about their amendments, that would be very helpful for us to \nensure we can get to the underlying bill and move forward.\n  I thank the chairman and the ranking member because they have been \nworking very closely with us not just for the last 2\\1/2\\ years to put \ntogether legislation that has this broad support, but more recently \nthey have been helping Senator Shaheen and me to ensure that we do have \non both sides of the aisle good lines of communication and the ability \nto move forward with an energy bill. They care about efficiency. I will \nlet them speak for themselves, and they have done that ably earlier \ntoday. But they also care about an energy agenda for our country, and \nthey view this as one of the first major pieces of energy legislation \nthat can lead then to other bills.\n  For those who would like to discuss broader energy topics but would \nnot have the ability to do it on this legislation--or maybe they do not \nhave their amendments fully formed on that--the commitment from the \nchairman and ranking member is that they are going to have additional \nenergy legislation. I serve on the committee. I can tell you, I have a \nstrong interest in moving forward on some of the fossil fuel \nlegislation, for instance. They have made a commitment to do that.\n  So there will be other opportunities where we will have broader \nenergy legislation that deals with the production side, deals with the \nimportant part of our energy strategy--in addition to energy \nefficiency--that lets us truly have an ``all of the above'' energy \nstrategy. I thank them for that commitment and for their strong work on \nthis legislation. Once we move this, it will be much easier then to see \nus move forward on these other bills. Success begets success.\n  With that, I am hopeful that Members will come to the floor and talk \nabout their amendments--I see one of my colleagues coming to the floor \nnow--and we can move forward with a good discussion on energy issues \nand move to these amendments as soon as possible and then move to final \npassage.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I wish to thank my two colleagues from \nNew Hampshire and Ohio and, of course, my colleagues from Alaska and \nOregon as well for their leadership on this very important piece of \nlegislation.\n  I have four amendments that I would love to be considered, that I \nwould love to be included in the legislation, and I hope we are able to \nmove these forward. But let me just talk about two of those. I do not \nwant to take the Senate's time. I understand other Senators may be on \ntheir way over to the floor to speak.\n  Let me first start with the Quadrennial Energy Review. This is \nsomething on which I have worked with the Senator from Alaska and many \nothers in this Chamber. In fact, it is a bipartisan amendment. It is \namendment No. 1881. Our cosponsors are Senators Alexander, Begich, \nBoozman, Coons, Heinrich, Tester, Tom Udall, and Wyden. Again, it is a \nbipartisan group of Senators.\n  Basically, one of the things we have learned from the Department of \nDefense is every 4 years they do a Quadrennial Defense Review, and that \nhelps them determine what is going on within their agency as an agency. \nIt helps them determine the strengths and weaknesses, the needs that \nneed to be addressed. It helps them plan, and it also helps us make \ndecisions. We want to make good defense decisions. The only way you do \nthat is by knowing what you have on hand and what you need.\n  Well, this is the same for energy. We have a lot of very well-\nintentioned energy programs and ideas that either float around this \nCapitol Building or float around the various Departments or that are \nlaw right now. A lot of these programs exist, but they are not \nnecessarily coordinated. There is no one there who is really making \nsure all of the dots connect and we are able to have a smart energy \npolicy.\n  So I feel like a Quadrennial Energy Review, every 4 years we would \ngo--the Federal Government--top to bottom, look at all of our energy \nneeds, look at our capabilities, look at our shortcomings, look at \nwhere we need to focus our resources. Should we be doing research in \none area and should we be focusing on manufacturing somewhere else? But \nthis will allow us to have a good, solid review every 4 years so we can \nmake good decisions, so the various Departments can make good \ndecisions. Also, it will help industry know kind of what is coming down \nthe pike. It will help bring us together and coordinate in a very \npositive and constructive way.\n  So the Quadrennial Energy Review, from my standpoint, is a very \nimportant piece and building block. It is laying the foundation for \nhaving a smart energy policy for this country. That is one thing we \nneed to recognize, quite honestly, here in the Senate. Again, we have \ngood intentions, but we do not always have a good, cohesive, and smart \nenergy policy. So the QER is something I hope we would be able to get \nthrough on this legislation and get this legislation moving through the \nprocess.\n  Let me give you one example, Madam President, on the Quadrennial \nEnergy Review.\n  We have in our country now a lot more domestic energy than we have \nhad in years past, and it is very exciting. In my State we produce a \nlot of natural gas through horizontal drilling and fracking, et cetera, \nand that is common in many other States around\n\n[[Page S6561]]\n\nthe country. I see some Senators here where they have the same thing. \nSometimes it is oil, sometimes it is gas, sometimes it is both.\n  Let's take natural gas for one moment. We have people come into my \noffice, and they will say: Hey, this is great that we have all of this \nnatural gas now. Why don't we liquefy it and export it? Okay. That is \nan idea. We ought to talk about that and think about that.\n  Or another group will come in and say: Hey, we have all of this \nnatural gas. Why don't we actually turn it into diesel fuel? Okay, \napparently you can do that. The technology is there. Let's talk about \nthat.\n  Then we have other folks who come to us and they say: Why don't we \ntake this natural gas and let's convert our diesel fleet over to \nnatural gas? Here again, okay, that all sounds good. But I do not think \nyou can do all three of those things. We do not have any mechanism \nright now to coordinate that and put all of that together and get \nconsistent with our energy policies.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Absolutely.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, it strikes me that the Senator's idea is \npractical right now. Because you look at the changes we have seen in \nthe last 4 or 5 years--particularly in areas such as natural gas. We \nwere talking about it with the Senators from North Dakota. This would \nbe the point of the Senator's amendment, to get the policies of the \ngovernment to start being reflective of what goes on in the \nmarketplace. Four or five years ago in our State we were having pitched \nbattles whether to develop import facilities for natural gas. They were \npretty spirited discussions. People were getting hauled out by the \ngendarmes and all of that.\n  Now we are having the same kind of battles about whether we ought to \nbuild export facilities. Is that the Senator's desire, to make sure the \ngovernment and the policies of the government sort of keep up with the \ntimes? It strikes me the Senator from Arkansas is proposing an \namendment that is particularly timely right now.\n  Mr. PRYOR. That is exactly right. I thank the Senator from Oregon for \nhis good question, because that is exactly right. We need some \nmechanism to make sure we are consistent and coherent and cohesive in \nour energy policy in the country. Things change. That is why you want \nto do this about every 4 years. You do not need to do it every year. It \nis too much work and too much going on. But just as with the Department \nof Defense, things change. What happens is you get a benchmark from 4 \nyears ago that suddenly you have a good comparison. You have a baseline \nthat you can look back to 4 years ago and see if you are making \nprogress, if your policy is going in the right direction.\n  Maybe in this case we have a lot of energy programs that are not \nworking very well. This will help us identify those. Maybe we have some \nthat are working great, that we ought to be spending more money on. \nThis will help us identify those.\n  I do thank the Senator for his question.\n  I do see we have other Senators coming to the floor.\n  Let me talk very quickly about one other amendment I have. It is the \nvoluntary certification program, here again, bipartisan, working with \nSenator Sessions. It is amendment No. 1879. This is a very specific \namendment for some very specific industries: heating, cooling, \ncommercial refrigeration and water-heating products. This is not \neconomywide. This is very specific to those industries. But right now \nwhat they do is they self-certify. They self-certify. I think they \nshould be allowed to continue to do that, assuming their certification \nmeets certain credible and scientific standards, which I think they do \nnow. If they do not now, they should.\n  But what this will do is actually save the government money. There is \nno reason why the Department of Energy and others should be reviewing \nthis and making them do extra certification and more testing, et \ncetera, when it has already been done right now to the standards \neveryone should accept.\n  I could talk more about this. I do see I have a couple of colleagues \nhere on the floor. It is my understanding they would like to speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I hope we are moving to votes on this \nbill, to votes on our ``no Washington exemption'' language. I certainly \ncontinue to encourage that and continue to support that.\n  The reason that is important, particularly on this ``no Washington \nexemption'' language is because unless we act on October 1, what I \nthink is a completely illegal rule from the Obama administration that \ndoes create a special Washington exemption will go into effect.\n  First of all, I think it is very unfortunate, sure is frustrating, \nthat I and others have to be here on the floor blocking an illegal rule \nin the first place. Because, you see, on this point ObamaCare is clear. \nThe actual statutory language of ObamaCare says clearly that all \nMembers of Congress and their congressional staff go to the exchange. \nIt is crystal clear about that. All of us. In another section, section \n1512, it also says clearly any folks going to the exchange lose their \nemployer-based subsidy. That is crystal clear.\n  Chuck Grassley, our distinguished colleague, authored this provision. \nHe could not have been more clear about where he was coming from about \nthe intent. He said at the time, ``The more that Congress experiences \nthe laws it passes, the better.'' He is exactly right. That is what \nthis is all about. That is what that provision is all about. Legal \nexperts such as David Ermer, a lawyer who has represented insurers in \nthe Federal employee program for 30 years, said clearly, ``I do not \nthink members of Congress and their staff can get funds for coverage in \nthe exchanges under existing law.''\n  That is very clear, particularly from the precise language of the \nObamaCare statute. So it is pretty darn frustrating that my colleagues \nand I who are pushing this ``no Washington exemption'' language have to \nbe here doing this to begin with. It is all because of an illegal rule \nto bail out Congress, to create out of thin air a Washington exemption \nthat will go into effect, unless we act, October 1. So that is why we \nmust act. That is why we must vote in a timely way.\n  The first thing this illegal rule says is, we do not know what staff \nare covered so we are going to leave it up to each individual Member of \nCongress to even decide which, if any, of their staff have to go to the \nexchange. That is a ludicrous interpretation of the clear statutory \nlanguage. It is ludicrous on its face, because that language says ``all \nofficial staff.''\n  Secondly, and even more outrageous in my opinion, this illegal rule \nsays: Whoever does go to the exchange from Congress, from staff, gets \nthis very generous taxpayer-funded subsidy transferred from the Federal \nemployees health benefits plan which we are leaving to the exchange. \nWhere did that come from? That is not in ObamaCare. In fact, section \n1512 of ObamaCare says exactly the opposite with regard to all \nemployer-based contributions. So where did that come from? It came out \nof thin air. It came from intense lobbying to have President Obama \ncreate this special Washington exemption.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to do the right thing and say, you know \nwhat, the first most basic rule of democracy is we should be treated \nthe same as America under the laws we pass. That should be true across \nthe board, certainly including ObamaCare.\n  That is why the Heritage Foundation recently said:\n\n       Obama's action to benefit the political class is the latest \n     example of this administration doing whatever it wants, \n     regardless of whether it has the authority to do so. The \n     Office of Personnel Management overstepped its authority when \n     it carried out the President's request to exempt Congress \n     from the requirements of the health care law. Changing laws \n     is the responsibility of the legislative branch, not the \n     executive.\n\n  They also said:\n\n       Millions of Americans are going to be losing their existing \n     coverage and paying more for health insurance. Under the \n     Vitter amendment, so would the Obama administration's \n     appointees, Congress and congressional staff. They baked that \n     cake, now they can eat it too.\n\n  Similarly, National Review said recently:\n\n       Most employment lawyers interpreted that--\n\n[[Page S6562]]\n\n  Meaning the ObamaCare language\n\n     --to mean that the taxpayer-funded federal health insurance \n     subsidies dispensed to those on Congress's payroll--which now \n     range from $5,000 to $11,000 a year--would have to end.\n\n  A little later in the same opinion piece they wrote:\n\n       Under behind-the-scenes pressure from members of Congress \n     in both parties, President Obama used the quiet of the August \n     recess to personally order the Office of Personnel \n     Management, which supervisors Federal employment issues, to \n     interpret the law so as to retain the generous Congressional \n     benefits.\n\n  The Wall Street Journal has also weighed in. I think they are right.\n\n       The issue is the White House's recent ObamaCare bailout for \n     members of Congress and their staffs. If Republicans want to \n     show that they stand for something, this is it. If they \n     really are willing to do whatever it takes to oppose this \n     law, there would be no more meaningful way to prove it.\n\n  As I said, the author of this original provision of ObamaCare made it \nperfectly clear where he was coming from. That is our distinguished \ncolleague Chuck Grassley. ``The more that Congress experiences the laws \nit passes, the better.'' The distinguished lawyer regarding this area \nof law, David Ermer, also said, it is clear: ``I do not think members \nof Congress and their staff can get funds for coverage in the exchanges \nunder existing law.''\n  That is why we have to act and have to vote before October 1.\n  Finally, in closing, let me say, I want to be very direct and ask \nMembers and the public to beware of another approach to defeating this \n``no Washington exemption'' language. That approach is pretty clever \nand it is pretty cynical. That approach is to say: Oh, this is a great \nidea, but we actually need to expand this to all Federal employees.\n  There are Members promoting this approach, particularly on the \nRepublican side. That will have one effect and one effect only: It will \nhelp ensure absolutely, no ifs, ands, or buts, that my language does \nnot pass or that language does not pass. In fact, one of the main \nRepublican proponents of that language said in a meeting which I \nattended: This will be perfect because under that scenario, under that \nlanguage, all Republicans can vote yes, all Democrats can vote no, and \nit will be killed and we will keep the subsidy.\n  That is the game. That is the point. That is what is going on. We \nneed a straight up-or-down vote on this ``no Washington exemption'' \nlanguage which is filed as an amendment to this bill on the floor, \nwhich is filed as a separate bill. I very much look forward to that \nbefore October 1.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hatch pertaining to the introduction of S. 1518 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I wish to commend Senator Shaheen and Senator Portman for \ntheir hard work in bringing a bipartisan bill to the floor that will \nboost energy efficiency in government, in industry, and in commercial \nand residential buildings. This bill will help increase our economic \ncompetitiveness, enhance our national security, and combat global \nclimate change.\n  Energy efficiency improvements are a smart, cost-effective way to \nreduce pollution, increase the competitiveness of our manufacturers, \nand put people back to work in the building trades.\n  We don't have an energy problem in this country; we have a waste \nproblem. Last October the Department of Energy and Lawrence Livermore \nNational Labs calculated that we waste 57 percent of all energy \nproduced--57 percent. We are becoming more energy efficient, but we \nhave a long way to go, which is why the Shaheen-Portman bill is so \nimportant.\n  I wish to speak about two changes I would like to see in the Tax Code \nthat would help us achieve our goals of energy efficiency. I have \nworked on two bills in this regard and I will be speaking about them as \nwe go through this session of Congress. I have noted amendments, but as \nI think the Presiding Officer is well aware, to try to put a tax \nprovision on a bill that originates in the Senate causes what is known \nas the blue slip when the bill is taken to the House, since all tax \nbills must originate in the House of Representatives. Therefore, I will \nbe looking for opportunities to advance these two energy-related bills \nbut will not have the opportunity on the legislation that is before us.\n  Energy efficiency is as important as renewables, nuclear, and fossil \nfuels in an ``all of the above'' strategy to meet the Nation's energy \ndemands. In fact, the cheapest, cleanest ``energy'' we have is the \nenergy we don't need because of energy efficiency improvements.\n  Our Tax Code in turn can be an effective tool in promoting energy \nefficiency. Consider that buildings account for more than 40 percent of \nour energy consumption in the United States. So by encouraging \nbusinesses to make energy-efficient upgrades in their buildings, we can \nreach substantial energy savings. A recent study by McKinsey & Company \nbacks me up. The study concluded that maximizing energy efficiency for \nhomes and commercial buildings could help our country reduce energy \nconsumption by 23 percent by 2020 and cut greenhouse gas emissions by \n1.1 gigatons annually. This is the equivalent of taking all passenger \ncars and light trucks off the road for a year.\n  Making buildings more efficient is more cost-effective than \ndeveloping new energy sources. Current building codes are already \nmaking new construction significantly more efficient, but a boost is \nneeded for older structures.\n  Up to 80 percent of the buildings standing today will still be here \nin 2050, so encouraging the retrofitting of existing buildings needs to \nbe a priority. Even buildings that are fairly new can benefit from \nretrofitting. For example, Bush Stadium, home of the St. Louis \nCardinals, was built in 2006, but energy improvements in 2011 reduced \nenergy consumption by 23 percent.\n  We could see more successful projects such as this proliferate across \nthe Nation, but our current tax policies have not yet proved to be \nmeaningful incentives for making energy-efficient upgrades to existing \nbuildings. For example, the landmark upgrade of the Empire State \nBuilding, which is under contract to lower energy consumption by almost \n40 percent, could not qualify for a 179D deduction under the law's \ncurrent structure. Senator Feinstein and I are working on legislation \nthat would make commonsense reforms to the existing section 179D tax \ndeduction.\n  Section 179D of the Internal Revenue Code provides a tax deduction \nthat allows cost recovery of energy-efficient windows, roofs, lighting, \nand heating and cooling systems that meet certain energy savings \ntargets. Section 179D allows for an accelerated depreciation that \nencourages real estate owners to make the significant front-end \ninvestments in energy-efficient upgrades. The deduction is scheduled to \nexpire at the end of this year. By extending, modifying, and \nsimplifying this important provision, we can encourage energy savings, \ncreate thousands of retrofitting jobs in the construction industry, and \nreduce energy bills for all consumers--a win-win-win situation. Our \nlegislation would make this critical incentive more accessible and \neffective for existing buildings that are currently using inefficient \nlighting systems, antiquated heating and cooling systems, and poor \ninsulation. Upgrading and improving the 179D deduction will make \nthousands of businesses more competitive and create good-paying jobs \nright here in the United States.\n  In addition to commercial properties, our bill will also help promote \nenergy efficiency in private residences. Homes consume more than 20 \npercent of our Nation's energy, so we need to give American homeowners \na helping hand to increase the energy efficiency of their properties. \nOur legislation does this by establishing a section 25E tax credit for \nhomeowners. Homeowners would receive a 30-percent tax credit of up to \n$5,000 for making an investment in energy efficiency and reducing \nenergy consumption and costs. Simply\n\n[[Page S6563]]\n\nput, it is an incentive that encourages homeowners to choose the most \ninexpensive option for saving energy. At a time of Federal budget \nconstraints, we must prioritize tax policies so they promote the most \ncost-effective methods of bolstering our energy security. Performance-\nbased energy efficiency improvements can transform America's homes and \nlower energy bills for the families who live in them.\n  Finally, our legislation targets the sector with the largest \npotential for increasing energy efficiency in our country--the \nindustrial sector. Our bill offers focused, short-term incentives in \nfour areas to help manufacturers make the efficiency investments \nnecessary to innovate and compete. These critical areas include water \nreuse and replacing old chillers that harm the atmosphere.\n  I have a letter dated September 17, 2013, from a large coalition of \nbusiness, labor, and environmental groups supporting the Cardin-\nFeinstein approach to the reform of section 179D. The Real Estate \nRoundtable spearheaded the letter, but 50 different organizations have \nsigned on. I want to quote one part of that letter. This is a quote \nfrom the letter that was sent in support of the legislation:\n\n       The Section 179D deduction is a key incentive to leverage \n     significant amounts of private sector investment capital in \n     buildings. It will help spur construction and manufacturing \n     jobs through retrofits, save businesses billions of dollars \n     in fuel bills as buildings become more energy efficient, \n     place lower demands on the power grid, help move our country \n     closer to energy independence, and reduce carbon emissions.\n\n  I think that is exactly what we should be doing. These are the types \nof incentives we should be working for. If you look at the groups that \nhave signed on to this letter, these are groups that understand how to \ncreate jobs and that Congress can help in that regard.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that letter \nbe printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  Senator Crapo and I will be introducing legislation that will fix a \nproblem that is keeping energy-efficient roofing materials from being \ndeployed. This is a separate bill that I think could help us create \njobs, save energy, and help our environment.\n  The current Tax Code acts as an obstacle to retrofitting old roofs \nwith energy-efficient ones because, generally speaking, commercial \nroofs are depreciated over 39 years. Our bill would shorten the \ndepreciation schedule to 20 years for roofs that meet certain energy \nefficiency standards and that are put in place over the next 2 years. \nBy shortening the depreciation schedule, we are lowering the amount of \ntax businesses would otherwise have to pay. They get the advantage of \ntheir savings in the early years.\n  This change will create more jobs by encouraging the construction of \nnew roofs and by putting more cash into the hands of businesses. It is \ngood tax policy because the average lifespan of a typical commercial \nroof is only 17 years. So this legislation corrects an inequity in the \nTax Code by aligning the depreciation period closer to the lifespan of \ncommercial roofs.\n  Securing America's energy and economic future requires a renewed \nfocus on energy efficiency. I hope we can pass the legislation that is \nbefore us and send it to the House. I hope the House will send us a tax \nbill that can serve as the basis for using the Tax Code to promote \nenergy efficiency.\n  Energy efficiency gains are a win-win for families, businesses, job \nseekers, taxpayers, our human health, and the environment. We can \ncreate jobs, we can help our economy, we can become more competitive, \nand we can have a cleaner environment if we do the right thing with the \nlegislation before us and are able to improve our Tax Code to help \nachieve those goals.\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               September 17, 2013.\n     Re: 179D Tax Deduction for Energy Efficient Buildings.\n\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance,\n     U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Finance,\n     U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Dave Camp,\n     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,\n     House of Representatives.\n     Hon. Sander Levin,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, House of \n         Representatives.\n       Dear Chairmen and Ranking Members: Our organizations and \n     companies represent a broad spectrum of the U.S. economy and \n     include real estate, manufacturing, architecture, \n     contracting, building services firms, financing sources, and \n     environmental and energy efficiency advocates. Many of the \n     entities we represent are small businesses that drive and \n     sustain American job growth. We support the tax deduction at \n     section 179D of the Internal Revenue Code, which encourages \n     greater energy efficiency in our nation's commercial and \n     larger multifamily buildings. As Congress continues to assess \n     comprehensive tax reform, we support section 179D's extension \n     and necessary reforms to spur retrofit projects in existing \n     buildings.\n       The section 179D deduction is a key incentive to leverage \n     significant amounts of private sector investment capital in \n     buildings. It will help spur construction and manufacturing \n     jobs through retrofits, save businesses billions of dollars \n     in fuel bills as buildings become more energy efficient, \n     place lower demands on the power grid, help move our country \n     closer to energy independence, and reduce carbon emissions.\n       Section 179D provides a tax deduction (not a credit) that \n     allows for cost recovery of energy efficient windows, roofs, \n     lighting, and heating and cooling systems meeting certain \n     energy savings performance targets. Without section 179D, the \n     same building equipment would be depreciated over 39 years \n     (business property) or 27.5 years (residential property). \n     These horizons do not meaningfully encourage real estate \n     owners to bear the immediate and expensive front-end costs \n     associated with complex energy efficiency upgrades. Section \n     179D allows for accelerated depreciation of high performance \n     equipment that achieves significant energy savings.\n       Current law has the perverse effect of discouraging energy \n     improvements. Utility bills and the costs of energy \n     consumption are part of a business's ordinary and necessary \n     operating expenses, and are thus fully and immediately \n     deductible. Section 179D is a critical provision because, by \n     encouraging greater building efficiency, it aligns the code \n     to properly incentivize energy savings. Moreover, relative to \n     the code's incentives for energy creation, taxpayers get more \n     ``bang for the buck'' through efficiency incentives like the \n     section 179D deduction. Dollar for dollar, it is much cheaper \n     to avoid using a kilowatt of energy than to create a new one \n     (such as through deployment of fossil fuel or renewable \n     technologies). As a matter of tax, budget, and an ``all of \n     the above'' energy policy, section 179D checks all of the \n     right boxes.\n       Regardless of the ultimate result of comprehensive tax \n     reform, the section 179D deduction is scheduled to expire at \n     the end of this year. While the provision should be carefully \n     considered as part of the code's possible overhaul, Congress \n     should also extend this important incentive with reasonable \n     improvements that better facilitate ``deep'' energy retrofit \n     improvements in buildings. In this regard, the Commercial \n     Building Modernization Act (S. 3591) from last Congress--\n     introduced by Senators Cardin and Feinstein, and former \n     Senators Bingaman and Snowe--is a step in the right direction \n     of a ``performance based'' and ``technology neutral'' \n     deduction that both of your committees have emphasized must \n     be the hallmarks of any energy tax incentive. Revisions of \n     the sort proposed by S. 3591 would improve the section 179D \n     deduction by providing a sliding scale of incentives that \n     correlate to actual and verifiable improvements in a \n     retrofitted building's energy performance. S. 3591 does not \n     select technology ``winners or losers'' but respects the \n     underlying contractual arrangements of building owners and \n     their retrofit project design teams, who are best suited to \n     decide which equipment options in a given structure may \n     achieve high levels of cost-effective energy savings.\n       Furthermore, any 179D reform proposal should ensure that \n     building owners have their own ``skin in the game'' of a \n     retrofit project--such as S. 3591's specification that the \n     financial benefits of the tax deduction cannot exceed more \n     than half of project costs.\n       Congress should extend and improve the section 179D tax \n     deduction before it expires at the end of 2013. We urge you \n     to look to S. 3591 from last Congress as the starting point \n     for further deliberations and refinements this fall.\n\n\n                        SUPPORTING ORGANIZATIONS\n\n       ABM Industries; Air Conditioning Contractors of America; \n     Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute; \n     American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy; American \n     Gas Association; American Hotel & Lodging Association; \n     American Institute of Architects; American Public Gas \n     Association; American Society of Interior Designers; ASHRAE; \n     Bayer MaterialScience LLC; Building Owners and Managers \n     Association (BOMA) International; CCIM Institute; Concord \n     Energy Strategies, LLC; Consolidated Edison Solutions, Inc.; \n     Council of North American Insulation Manufacturers \n     Association.\n       Danfoss; Empire State Building Company/Malkin Holdings; \n     Energy Systems Group; First Potomac Realty Trust; Independent \n     Electrical Contractors; Institute for Market Transformation; \n     Institute of Real Estate Management; International Council of \n     Shopping Centers; International Union of Painters & Allied \n     Trades (IUPAT); Johnson Controls, Inc.; Mechanical \n     Contractors Association of America (MCAA); Metrus Energy,\n\n[[Page S6564]]\n\n     Inc.; NAIOP, the Commercial Real Estate Development \n     Association; National Apartment Association; National \n     Association of Energy Service Companies (NAESCO); National \n     Association of Home Builders; National Association of \n     REALTORS'; National Association of Real Estate \n     Investment Trusts.\n       National Association of State Energy Officials; National \n     Electrical Contractors Association; National Electrical \n     Manufacturers Association; National Lumber and Building \n     Material Dealers Association; National Multi Housing Council; \n     National Roofing Contractors Association; Natural Resources \n     Defense Council; Owens Corning; Plumbing-Heating-Cooling \n     Contractors--National Association; Polyisocyanurate \n     Insulation Manufacturers Association (PIMA); Real Estate \n     Board of New York; The Real Estate Roundtable; The Sheet \n     Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation International \n     Association; Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Contractors' \n     National Association; U.S. Green Building Council; Window and \n     Door Manufacturers Association.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, 5 years ago, as a result of the greed and \nthe recklessness and the illegal behavior on Wall Street, this country \nwas plunged into the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression \nof the 1930s. As a result, millions of people lost their homes, lost \ntheir jobs, and lost their life savings. And about 5 years ago we were \nlooking at a situation where some 700,000 Americans a month were losing \ntheir jobs--an unbelievable number. The stock market plummeted. There \nwas panic in the financial sector.\n  The good news is that to a significant degree we have stabilized that \nsituation. We are not losing hundreds of thousands of jobs a month. The \nstock market is, in fact, doing very well. But what is important to \nunderstand is that it is imperative we not accept the ``new normal'' \nfor the economy as it is today because the reality is that today, while \nthe situation is better than it was 5 years ago, for the middle class \nand for the working families of this country the economy is still in \nvery bad shape. And I am not just talking about a 5-year period; I am \ntalking about a generational situation.\n  Mr. President, you may have seen that just yesterday the Census \nBureau came out with some new and extremely disturbing statistics, and \nit tells us why so many Americans are frustrated and angry with what is \ngoing on in Washington and why so many people respond to pollsters and \nsay: Yes, we believe the country is going in the wrong direction.\n  What they are saying is true. They have every reason to be angry, \nevery reason be frustrated. Of course, economically this country is \nmoving, in a very significant way, in the wrong direction.\n  This is what the Census Bureau reported yesterday: They said the \ntypical middle-class family, the family right in the middle of American \nsociety, that median family income today is less than it was 24 years \nago. Median family income today for that typical American family is \nless than it was 24 years ago.\n  In 2002, typical middle-class families, that family right in the \nmiddle, made $51,017. Back in 1989, that family made $51,681. What does \nthat mean? It means that 24 years later, after all of the effort and \nthe hard work of people, today they are worse off than they were 24 \nyears ago.\n  Let's think about what that means. It means that despite the \nexplosion of technology and all of the robotics, all of the cell phones \nand everything else that has made this economy more productive, the \nmedian family income today is worse than it was 24 years ago.\n  I will give you an example of what that means. If during the period \nfrom 1989 through 2012 that typical American family had received just a \n2-percent increase in their income--just 2 percent, a very modest \nincrease--that family today, instead of making $51,000 a year, would be \nmaking $81,000 a year. That is a $30,000 gap.\n  If over that 24-year period people had seen a modest--I am not taking \nabout a huge increase--a modest increase in their income of 2 percent, \nwhich people certainly deserve, that family would make $81,000 a year. \nToday that family is making $51,000 a year--less than that family was \nmaking 24 years ago.\n  This is what the Census Bureau also reported. They said the typical \nmiddle-class family has seen its income go down by more than $5,000 \nsince 1999, after adjusting for inflation--$5,000.\n  They told us the average male worker made $283 less last year than \nthat same worker made 44 years ago. Do you want to know why people are \nangry? They see an explosion of technology, they see an explosion of \nproductivity, and yet a male worker today is making less than a male \nworker--the average male worker--made 44 years ago.\n  The average female worker earned $1,775 less than they did in 2007. A \nrecordbreaking 46.5 million Americans lived in poverty last year. That \nis more people living in poverty than at any time in American history. \nSixteen million children live in poverty. That is almost 22 percent of \nall kids in America. That is the highest rate of childhood poverty in \nthe industrialized world. That is the future of America. Over one out \nof five kids in the country is living in poverty.\n  A higher percentage of African Americans lived in poverty last year \nthan was the case 15 years ago, and 9.1 percent of seniors lived in \npoverty last year, higher than in 2009. More American seniors were \nliving in poverty last year than in 1972. Today, 48 million Americans \nare uninsured, no health insurance. That will change as a result of \nObamaCare. But as of today, 48 million Americans are uninsured, 3 \nmillion more than in 2008.\n  So when people call the Presiding Officer's office in Delaware or my \noffice in Vermont and they say: You know what: we are hurting, they are \ntelling the truth. What they are saying is Congress seems to deal with \neverything except the reality facing the middle class and working \nfamilies of this country.\n  People worry desperately not only for themselves, they worry more for \ntheir kids. What kind of education will their kids have? Will there be \nenough teachers in the classroom? Will their kids be able to afford to \ngo to college or will young working families be able to find quality, \naffordable child care? What kind of job will their kids have when they \nget out of high school or they get out of college?\n  Those are the questions that tens of millions of Americans are asking \nall over this country. Here in Washington, we are not giving them clear \nand straightforward answers. What makes this moment in American history \nunique is that while the great American middle class is disappearing \nand while the number of Americans living in poverty is at an alltime \nhigh, something else is going on in this society; that is, that the \npeople on top, the top 1 percent, have never, ever had it so good. Last \nweek we learned an astounding fact I want everybody to hear clearly; \nthat is, between 2009 and 2012, the last years we have information on, \n95 percent of all new income created in this country went to the top 1 \npercent--95 percent of all of the new income created in America went to \nthe top 1 percent.\n  The bottom 99 percent shared in 4 percent of the new income. So what \nwe are seeing as a nation is the disappearance of the middle class, \nmillions of families leaving the middle class and descending into \npoverty, struggling desperately to feed their families, to put gas in \ntheir car, to get to work, to survive on an $8-an-hour wage.\n  You have that reality over here, and then you have another reality; \nthat is, the people on top are doing better than at any time since \nbefore the Great Depression.\n  Today, the top 1 percent own 38 percent of the Nation's financial \nwealth. Meanwhile, the bottom 60 percent, the majority of the American \npeople together, own only 2.3 percent of the wealth in this country. \nWhen I was in school we used to--and I am sure all over this country--\nstudy what we called an oligarchy. An oligarchy is a nation in which a \nhandful of very wealthy people control the economy, control the \npolitics of the nation. It does not matter about political parties \nbecause they own those parties as well.\n  Guess what. What we used to look at in Latin America and laugh about \nor worry about has now come home to\n\n[[Page S6565]]\n\nthis country. In America today, we have the most unequal distribution \nof wealth and income of any major country on Earth. That gap between \nthe very rich and everybody else is growing wider.\n  I do not believe the American people feel that is what this great \ncountry should be about; that the top 1 percent owns 38 percent of the \nwealth, while the bottom 60 percent owns barely 2 percent of the \nwealth. That is not the dream of what this great country is about.\n  Earlier this week Forbes magazine reported that the wealthiest 400 \nAmericans in this country--400 people--are now worth a recordbreaking \n$2 trillion--400 people worth $2 trillion; in other words, the \nconcentration of wealth is getting greater and greater and greater. The \nwealthiest 400 Americans now own more wealth than the bottom half of \nAmericans, over 150 million Americans.\n  We could probably squeeze 400 people into this room. If we did and \nthey were the wealthiest people in this country, 400 people in this \nroom would own more wealth than the bottom 50 percent of the American \npeople.\n  Just one family, one family in America, the Walton family, the owners \nof Walmart, are worth over $100 billion and own more wealth than the \nbottom 40 percent of the American people. One family owns more wealth \nthan the bottom 40 percent of Americans.\n  While the middle class disappears, while children in this country go \nhungry, while veterans sleep out on the streets, corporate profits are \nnow at an alltime high, while wages, as a share of the economy, are at \na record low.\n  Wall Street--the major financial institutions in this country whose \ngreed and recklessness drove us into this economic downturn and the \ngroup of people the American middle class bailed out 5 years ago--is \nnow doing phenomenally well. So Wall Street drives the country into a \nsevere economic downturn. Wall Street is bailed out by the American \nmiddle class. Wall Street now is doing phenomenally well while the \nmiddle class is disappearing.\n  You want to know why the American people are angry and disgusted and \nfrustrated? That is why. In fact, the CEOs on Wall Street, the \nexecutives there, are on track to make more money this year than they \ndid in 2009. That is the time in which Wall Street greed destroyed our \neconomy.\n  The American middle class is disappearing. Poverty is increasing. The \ngap between the rich and everyone else is growing wider and wider. That \nis the economic reality facing this country. The time is long overdue \nfor this Congress and this President to start, in a very forceful, \naggressive way, to address that issue.\n  But where are we today? Are we having a major debate on the floor of \nthe Senate as to how we are going to rebuild our crumbling \ninfrastructure and create millions of jobs? I do not hear that debate. \nAre we having a debate on the floor of the Senate that says it is an \noutrage that working people throughout the country are trying to \nsurvive on a minimum wage of $7.25 and we need to raise that \nsubstantially so that when people work 40 hours a week they can \nactually take care of themselves and their families and not go deeper \ninto debt? Are we having that debate? I do not hear that.\n  Are we having a debate which says that not only should we not cut \nSocial Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, but we should join the rest of \nthe industrialized world and guarantee health care to all of our people \nas a right of citizenship? I do not hear that debate; quite the \ncontrary, this is the debate I hear. This is what I am hearing from my \ncolleagues over in the House and the Republican leadership over there. \nWhat I am hearing them say is that while poverty is at an alltime high, \nwhile our childcare system, early childhood education is a disaster, \nwhat they want to do is continue sequestration and push for more \nacross-the-board spending cuts to Head Start, while elderly people \nthroughout the country who are fragile and hurting are dependent on the \nMeals On Wheels Program, they want to continue cuts in that program.\n  They want to continue cuts in that program. While millions of \nfamilies are wondering how they are going to send kids to college, they \nwant to continue sequestration, making it harder for families to send \ntheir kids to college. They want to continue cuts to unemployment \ninsurance and a number of other vital programs; in other words, instead \nof addressing the very serious problems facing the middle class and the \nworking class of this country, what I am hearing from my Republican \ncolleagues is let's make a bad situation even worse.\n  Let me conclude by saying, instead of cutting the Head Start Program, \nwe should be expanding the Head Start Program. Study after study makes \nit clear that the most important years of a human being's life are 0 to \n3. Giving those little kids the intellectual and emotional nourishment \nthey need so they will do well in school is perhaps the most important \nwork we can do.\n  We have to increase funding for Head Start, not cut funding for Head \nStart.\n  It is a moral outrage in this country that anybody here talks about \ncutting back on the Meals On Wheels Program, which provides at least \none nutritious meal per day to fragile and vulnerable citizens. We \nshould not be cutting back on that program; we should be significantly \nexpanding that program.\n  I can tell you that in Vermont, if you talk to the people in my \nState, they will tell you we have significant problems with our \nbridges, significant problems with our roads, significant problems with \nrail, significant problems with wastewater and water plants. People \nwant to invest in our crumbling infrastructure and make us a productive \nnation. When we do that, we can create jobs.\n  Right now on the floor--I don't know if we are going to get to vote \non it--there is a very modest bill brought forth by Senators Shaheen \nand Portman which talks about energy efficiency. In Vermont and \nthroughout this country, people are paying higher fuel bills than they \nshould, wasting enormous amounts of energy, and contributing to global \nwarming through greenhouse gas emissions because we are not aggressive \non energy efficiency, making our homes more efficient. We should be \ninvesting in energy efficiency and creating jobs doing this.\n  The bottom line is we are in a pivotal moment in American history. \nThe rich are getting richer, the middle class is disappearing, and \npoverty is at an alltime high. People are demanding that we create jobs \nand address the problems facing this country. Yet we have folks who \nwant to make a bad situation worse by protecting the tax breaks that \nhave been given to the wealthy and large corporations and then cut back \non the needs of ordinary Americans.\n  I hope the American people will stand and say enough is enough and \nthat they will demand that, finally, Congress stands with the middle \nclass of this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I rise to talk about the relentless assault on the poor \nand hungry in this country that is being waged right now in the House \nof Representatives and too often on the Senate floor.\n  The meltdown on Wall Street caused a recession in this country, as we \nknow, that was worse than anything we have experienced since the Great \nDepression. Eight million people, eight million Americans lost their \njobs. Trillions of dollars in the stock market were wiped out. With \nthat money went the life savings of many middle-class families.\n  Many families lost their homes. Small businesses closed up shop. This \nwas an economic disaster that hit communities across this country as \nhard as any natural disaster we have seen.\n  While Wall Street is doing well again these days, millions of \nfamilies on Main Street are still waiting for their situation to \nimprove. We are seeing new job creation, but millions of Americans are \nstill out of work. In fact, when we look at the chart on employment \nrates, we see what happened in 2008 and 2009, the numbers of people who \nlost their jobs. While based on the population we are holding our own, \nwe are just barely at this point keeping up with the population and \nbeginning to grow again.\n  What the House Republicans are saying is get a good-paying job or \nyour family will just have to go hungry. But there aren't enough good-\npaying jobs, as we all know. To add insult to injury,\n\n[[Page S6566]]\n\nthey are slashing job-training money, which makes absolutely no sense, \njob-training money that States get to help Americans find work.\n  Economists point also to the irresponsible sequestration cuts as a \ncause for this sluggish job growth.\n  In the Senate we have passed a budget that will replace the sequester \nwith a balanced solution to reduce the debt and balance the budget, but \na handful of Senators on the other side of the aisle are blocking us \nfrom even being able to send negotiators to the House to finalize the \nbudget. We are now stuck with a policy that makes absolutely no sense, \nthat economists say is slowing down our economy and costing us jobs \nbecause of political games, pure and simple, in Washington.\n  This is having a very serious effect on the wallets of Americans who \ncontinue to find it difficult to put food on the table for their \nfamilies. This is very real. It is not a political game for American \nfamilies all across the country and certainly in my great State of \nMichigan. Even those people who are able to find work are working for \nless. In fact, wages as a percent of the economy are at 30-year lows.\n  When we look back, what has happened is not only is job growth not \ncoming back as fast as it should, we are seeing people who have been in \nthe middle class struggling by their fingertips trying to hold on or, \nmost of the time, much of the time, losing ground because we are seeing \nwages going down, down, and down, even for the jobs that are available. \nThis is a situation that millions of Americans find themselves in \ntoday. They are struggling to find work. When they do find work, the \nsalary isn't even close to what it was before the recession.\n  Many people have taken pay cuts to keep their jobs or they have had \ntheir pay and benefits frozen for 4 or 5 years. Families who only 5 or \n10 years ago were doing fine are now in dire straits.\n  Now the same Republicans who refuse to fix the sequester, who refuse \nto work with us to get the economy moving again for millions of middle-\nclass families, again are trying to take temporary food assistance away \nfrom the children and families who are out of work or who are working \none, two or three part-time jobs trying to make ends meet.\n  Let me stress as we debate the question of hunger and food assistance \nin America, we know that many families receiving SNAP, the Supplemental \nNutrition Assistance Program, are working. They are working.\n  About half of those families receiving food help are working. They \nare people with children and whose wages are falling behind so they are \nno longer able to feed their families.\n  For those who have lost their jobs, SNAP is a short-term lifeline to \nkeep food on the table while they search for work. We know the average \nnew SNAP recipient only receives help for 10 months or less. Let me \nrepeat that. A person who is coming onto this program during this \nrecession worked before they needed help. They are getting an average \nof 10 months' worth of help so their family doesn't starve while they \nare looking for work and trying to put the pieces back together. Then \nafter that they are going back to work.\n  What we also know is men, women, families on supplemental nutrition \nassistance are using that money to feed their children. Nearly half of \nthe people who are getting food assistance help in this country are \nchildren. We are looking now at nearly half being children, children \nwho are going to bed hungry at night while their parents are doing the \nbest they can to get back on their feet.\n  We see senior citizens who find themselves in a situation where their \nonly income is Social Security. That little bit of food help makes a \ndifference of whether they can go to the grocery store and put food in \nthe cupboard or not.\n  The real faces of food assistance are veterans who went to war for \nthis country, many of whom were injured and returned home only to find \nthey couldn't get a job or their disabilities made it impossible to \nwork. People with disabilities are the faces of food assistance. \nInstead of honoring these men and women for their service, House \nRepublicans want to take away the little bit of help they get each \nmonth to buy food.\n  If we add all of this, 85 percent of the faces of food assistance, of \nSNAP, are children with their parents, people with disabilities, \nincluding our veterans, and senior citizens--85 percent. The bill being \nconsidered in the House of Representatives would kick millions of \nchildren and their families off food assistance.\n  This is how majority leader Eric Cantor and House Republicans will \ncut $40 billion in food assistance. That is what they will be voting \non, probably tomorrow. They do it by cutting off individuals and \nfamilies who need the assistance the most.\n  Under the Republican plan, which Eric Cantor says encourages people \nto get back to work, benefits for a jobless adult without children \nwould be limited to 3 months every 3 years. They better eat a lot \nduring those 3 months.\n  That means if you lose your job and you are unemployed for 6 months, \nhalf of the time you will be able to have help in order to be able to \nput food on your table. Once you find a new job, you had better make \nsure your company doesn't close and doesn't go overseas within the next \n2\\1/2\\ years or you will not be able to have any help to put food on \nthe table as well.\n  It is important to note that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice has said that 14 million people will stop receiving food \nassistance over the next 10 years the right way. As the economy \nimproves, they will get back on their feet financially and be able to \nfind a good-paying job. We built into our farm bill reduced costs in \nSNAP because the economy is beginning to improve. But the House of \nRepresentatives, the House Republican majority leader's bill, \neliminates families from food assistance the wrong way--by eliminating \nfood help to those who most need it: 1.7 million poor, unemployed \nadults next year, whose average income is about $2,500 a year--$2,500 a \nyear; those are the folks who would lose help with food--2.1 million \nlow-income working families and seniors next year alone, 210,000 \nchildren who would receive cuts and would lose their school lunches \nunder the House Republican plan, and other unemployed parents and their \nchildren--parents who want to work but can't find a job or a training \nprogram to join--will be eliminated from help.\n\n  The Republicans say it is about getting people back to work. But this \nbill cuts worker training and job placement for people who are trying \nto get back to work, who are mortified that, probably for the first \ntime in their lives, they have needed help with food. They are people \nwho have paid taxes their whole lives and who got caught up in this \ngreat recession and are trying to climb out but need a little help with \none of the things I think we would all consider pretty basic--the \nability to eat and provide food for their families.\n  People on SNAP want to work. They are like any American wanting to \nwork, but there currently are not enough jobs, which is why we should \nbe focusing on jobs and growing the economy. Right now we have three \nunemployed workers for every job opening. It is better. I can remember \nstanding on the floor a few years ago saying the number was six \nunemployed workers for every job, and then five, and now it is three. \nBut it is still three for every job opening.\n  Does the Republican plan do anything to help people find jobs or the \njob training skills they need to get a good-paying job so they can care \nfor their families? No, absolutely not. In fact, the Republican plan \nwould offer cash-strapped States a truly perverse incentive. I had to \nread this several times to see whether this was actually written down \nthis way. They are allowing States to keep half of the Federal money \nthat would be spent on food whenever they cut somebody off the program. \nSo the incentive is to eliminate help for people so the State can keep \nhalf the money and use it for something else. That is in the House \nbill.\n  Let me be clear: We have seen occasions of fraud and abuse in the \nfood assistance program, and that is why the Senate farm bill includes \nmajor reforms to crack down on misuse and to make sure only people who \ntruly need help are getting help. We heard reports of people winning \nthe lottery, two in my home State, but who are still getting SNAP \nbenefits. That will not happen again under our bill. We have seen \nliquor stores accepting food stamps\n\n[[Page S6567]]\n\nwhen they do not sell much food. We have reformed that to make sure \nthat cannot happen again, as well as a number of other areas where we \ncan bring more accountability and tighten up the program.\n  We want every dollar to go to the people I am talking about today--\nwho work hard all their lives, find themselves in a bad situation and \nare trying to climb out but they need a little bit of help because \ntheir children are hungry, because they are hungry. Maybe they are a \nveteran or maybe they are a senior or maybe they are somebody with a \ndisability who needs a little bit of help. So we have passed real \nreforms to crack down on abuses we have found, and we did it in a \nbipartisan way in the Senate. I am very proud of that.\n  What House Republicans are voting on is nothing more than an \nextremely divisive, extremely partisan political exercise that is, by \nthe way, going nowhere, and it is jeopardizing the passage of a 5-year \nfarm bill. We have never seen this kind of partisanship injected into \nagricultural policy in our country before. It is shocking what has \nhappened in the last 2 years in the House of Representatives. And shame \non the majority floor leader and his allies for doing it now.\n  Our farmers, our ranchers, our small towns and rural communities and \nour children and families do not deserve this. The 16 million people \nwho work in this country because of agriculture do not deserve this. \nWhat is happening this week in the House of Representatives is not \nabout reality, it is about some fiction they have made up--an idea if \nthe stock market is doing well, if wealthy Members of Congress and \nothers are doing well, then surely everyone in America must be doing \nwell too. And anyone who isn't must be lazy or not trying hard enough.\n  The reality is most people in America are still struggling to get \nback on their feet from the recession. There still aren't enough jobs \nfor every person who needs and wants one. The jobs that are there pay \nless than they did 5 years ago, and families getting food help are \nmaking about $500 a week. They do not have money in the stock market. \nThey do not have investment income. In fact, the average SNAP family \ndoesn't have more than $300 in assets--things they own. What they do \nhave, though, because of our policy of supporting those families, is \n$4.53 a day to eat. That is right, $4.53 a day to eat--less than the \ncost of one specialty coffee at our favorite stores.\n  But some Members of the House of Representatives have decided that is \ntoo much, that $4.53 a day is too much for our disabled veterans, too \nmuch for our senior citizens living on Social Security, too much for \nour children, for families working multiple part-time jobs and trying \nto figure out how to get out of the hole that was created not by them \nbut by others in the great recession.\n  We all want to spend less on food assistance, and the good news is, \nunder the Senate farm bill we all voted on, we do spend less. The \nbaseline for food assistance is going down. Why? Because the economy is \nimproving. There is $11.5 billion in reduced spending built into our \nfarm bill because people are finding jobs, and that is added to the $4 \nbillion in fraud and misuse we have included.\n  Again, the Congressional Budget Office projects that 14 million \npeople will leave the supplemental nutrition program as the economy \nimproves because they will no longer need temporary help. Costs are \ngoing down the right way, because the economy is beginning to improve. \nAnd as it improves more aggressively, which is what we should be \nworking on together, we will see those costs go down.\n  I should also add that SNAP recipients are already going to see an \narbitrary cut, unfortunately, to their benefits on November 1 because \nof the expiration of the Recovery Act help that temporarily boosted \nassistance to families in need, which we did in 2009. So they are \nalready going to see less available for food.\n  If we want to continue to cut spending the right way, we should be \nworking together to invest in our economy, to support our businesses, \nlarge and small, to outinnovate the global competition, to get rid of \nthe sequester and to help people get the training they need to find \ngood-paying jobs.\n  The Republican approach is like saying: You know, we are so tired of \nspending money on wildfires--forest fires--so we will cut the budget \nfor the fire service. That isn't going to work. The fires will rage on \nand they will only get worse. If we want fewer fires we have to find \nways to prevent fires and contain the fires in order to reduce the \ncost.\n  The Republican approach is also like saying: We are tired of paying \nfor the cost of drought, flooding, and other crop disasters so we will \ncut crop insurance. The government's cost of crop insurance went up \nover $5 billion--50 percent--last year because of droughts and flooding \nand so on. It went up 50 percent. And while we are seeing increases in \ncrop insurance, it is projected that food assistance is actually going \ndown $11.5 billion over the next 10 years.\n  Are the House Republicans proposing we eliminate help for farmers in \na disaster or just low-income families--children, seniors, disabled \nveterans--when they have a disaster?\n  What is happening in the House right now is a complete reversal of 50 \nyears of great American values. Today, in the United States of America, \none in six people say they do not know where their next meal will come \nfrom--one in six Americans in the greatest, the wealthiest country in \nthe world. We have a long history in this country of making sure that \npoverty and hunger are kept in check. In fact, Presidents on both sides \nhave understood this. President Ronald Reagan said:\n\n       As long as there is one person in this country who is \n     hungry, that's one person too many.\n\n  That is one person too many. I wish our House Republicans could hear \nthat and understand what he was saying. What would he have to say about \nthis effort now in the House of Representatives to blame the victims of \npoverty and unemployment, to blame the children, to blame the seniors, \nto blame the veterans, who only want enough food to be able to eat and, \nfor those who are able, to work and to get back on their feet and get a \njob?\n  The House Republicans who are proposing these drastic cuts all have \nenough to eat. We in the Senate are not living on $4.53 a day for food. \nWe have enough to eat. None of us wonder where our next meal is going \nto come from, like the one out of six Americans. None of us have to \nworry about whether our children will go to bed hungry tonight. None of \nus have to skip meals so our children don't have to.\n  We in America are better than the debate that is being waged in the \nHouse of Representatives. The good news for children, families, \nseniors, the disabled and veterans across America is that the House \nbill will never see the light of day in the Senate. It is time to stop \nthe political games around hunger in America. It is time to work \ntogether and pass a 5-year farm and food bill, to grow the economy and \nreduce the need for food assistance the right way--by making sure every \nAmerican has the ability to have a good-paying job so they can feed \ntheir families and achieve their part of the American dream.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. A parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Just to make sure, because Senator Roberts--I had a \nquestion. He has gotten some time from Senator Cruz; is that correct? \nSenator Heitkamp wanted to make comments for a couple of minutes \nfollowing Senator Stabenow.\n  So this is what I would ask: After Senator Heitkamp is recognized, I \nwould be recognized. If Senator Cruz comes, I will stop at that time \nand yield the time to Senator Cruz and then continue after he has \nfinished. That would be a consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Reserving the right to object, my remarks will only take \n4 minutes to identify myself with Senator Cruz's effort on Benghazi. I \nknow Senator Inhofe would like to say a few words.\n  So perhaps I could start?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, if I could just say that I am happy to allow that \nto go forward, but there needs to be a definite time. How much time \nwill all three Senators--my understanding was that Senator Cruz--for \nhow many minutes?\n\n[[Page S6568]]\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I think it was 15 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So if the Senator is asking that he take Senator Cruz's \n15 minutes, I have no objection.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I am not going to take all of the 15 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, if the Senator is asking that he take part of the \nSenator's 15 minutes and count against Senator Cruz's time, I have no \nproblem with that whatsoever. So I would revise that to say that \nSenator Heitkamp would be going for 3 minutes, Senator Roberts would be \ngoing for 5 minutes, and then I would be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Reserving the right to object, it is a 15-minute slot \nthat we had intended, and I am sure the Senators will arrive.\n  Mrs. BOXER. When Senator Cruz arrives to take the additional 15 \nminutes, that is fine. So in other words, the Senator takes 5 minutes, \nSenator Cruz comes, and I would yield to him for the rest of the 15 \nminutes. He is not here.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I withdraw any objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I will be very brief, recognizing the \nother urgent business the Senate needs to address, but I did want to \nassociate myself with the remarks of the very able and capable \nchairwoman of the agriculture committee, Senator Stabenow.\n  We have a disaster in the making. It is called the farm bill. Months \nago this body passed a comprehensive farm bill recognizing a 50-year \ncompromise, a 50-year association of nutrition assistance with the \nability to provide disaster assistance to our farmers in this country. \nFor 50 years that effort has served us very well.\n  Today and this week in the House of Representatives, they will do \nsomething that is unprecedented in 50 years: They will segregate, pass \nseparate bills, and do a disservice to struggling, unemployed, \nunderemployed American families; that is, dramatically reduce the food \nstamp allocation.\n  Food stamps are there when people need them in the same way that farm \ndisaster payments are there when farmers need them. Anyone who thinks \nsomeone is living high on the hog, so to speak, on food stamps needs to \nspend time with people who are trying to make it work and feed their \nfamilies on $1.40 per meal.\n  We know that with a recovering economy we are going to see a \ndwindling number of those folks move on. Yet we see this move almost in \na way that is going to challenge this long-term relationship that has \nbasically enabled a great partnership between many of our urban and \nrural legislators, Senators, and Members of the House of \nRepresentatives, but also something that speaks to a very important \nvalue we have, which is that kids ought not to go hungry in this \ncountry. That is not who we are. We are not a country that allows \nchildren and families who are working, in many cases, to go hungry. And \nwhen they need that help, that temporary help they have been receiving, \nthey ought to get it because it makes sense. It makes them better \ncitizens, and it makes them better students. It tells us that, yes, \nwhen times are very tough--as they have been for so many American \nfamilies--we will be there.\n  Let's not let this happen. Let's fight back. Let's continue to have \nthis conversation, and let's pass a comprehensive farm bill that \nrecognizes the need to feed people as well as provide disaster \nassistance for farmers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, Senator Cruz is now on the floor, and he \nwill be speaking right after me.\n  I thank Senator Cruz for his efforts to keep the focus on the \nBenghazi terrorist attacks.\n  It seems to me to be a great shame that 1 year after the heinous \nattacks on our consulate in Benghazi and four Americans being murdered \nand--this is tremendously important--shaking the confidence of our men \nand women deployed in service to this Nation that the United States \nwould never leave one of their own behind--I was told that when I \njoined the Marine Corps a long time ago--it is a great shame that we \nare still in the same place.\n  Justice has yet to be seen or done. The families of those killed at \nthe consulate in Benghazi are waiting for answers about what happened \nthat night, and they simply want to know that this President and this \nadministration are working to seek justice for what actually happened. \nYet it appears that what is happening is that the administration is \ndoing everything but seek justice. Quite frankly, I think Americans--\nand I share their concern and frustration and anger--are sick and tired \nof hearing excuses, delays, and even silence. The President and his \nadministration have stonewalled us on this case, in my personal view.\n  This should have been called a terrorist attack a long time ago. The \nIntelligence Committee should be handling this, but that is not the \ncase. Today the FBI continues to seek tips from Libyans. The FBI has \neven posted an entire page on their Web site dedicated to finding \nsuspects. There are photos of 29 suspects on that page. Twenty-nine. No \narrests have been made. CNN and The New York Times have even had access \nto one of the chief suspects, Ahmed Abu Khattala, to interview him \nwhile he mocks the U.S. investigation. This is unbelievable.\n  The administration refuses to answer simple questions:\n  Who told the military to stand down?\n  Who is responsible for misleading the American public and the \nvictims' families?\n  What actionable intelligence did our government have?\n  I know that there was actionable intelligence. People asked for that \nsecurity. Why was it ignored? This is why we need a joint select \ncommittee.\n  At the very least, this deserves a vote. So I urge my colleagues, \nplease drop your hold. Let us at least have a vote. If you want to \ndefeat it, defeat it. But at least allow the Senator from Texas to have \nan opportunity to debate this bill.\n  I thank Senator Cruz for introducing this legislation. I believe this \nshould be a top priority for our government.\n  I yield back any remaining time I have to the distinguished Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Kansas for his \nleadership and for his reasonable call that we ascertain the truth on \nthis very important matter.\n  As we do every year, last week as a nation we marked the somber \nanniversary of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. For the \nfirst time this year we also remembered the victims of Benghazi: \nForeign Service officer Sean Smith, former Navy SEALs Glen Doherty and \nTyrone Woods, and Ambassador Christopher Stevens, who was our first \nAmbassador murdered while serving since Adolph Dubs in 1979.\n  The anniversary of the Benghazi attacks, however, should not simply \nbe an act of remembrance; it should serve as a wake-up call. An entire \nyear has gone by since these American heroes lost their lives in the \nservice of our Nation, and we still have far too many unanswered \nquestions:\n  Why was the State Department unwilling to provide the requested level \nof security in Benghazi?\n  Why were no military assets mobilized while the attacks were going on \neven if they might not arrive before the attacks were over?\n  If then-Secretary Panetta had ``no question'' in his mind that this \nwas a coordinated terrorist attack while it was going on, why did \nAmbassador Rice, Secretary Clinton, and President Obama all tell the \nAmerican people that the cause was a spontaneous demonstration about an \nInternet video in the days after September 11, 2012?\n  Why did the State Department edit the intelligence talking points to \ndelete the references to ``Islamic extremists'' and ``Al Qaeda''?\n  Why did the FBI not release pictures of militants taken the day of \nthe attack and released them only 8 months after the fact? Why not \nimmediately, as proved so effective in the Boston bombing last April?\n  What role, if any, did the State Department's own counterterrorism \noffice play during the attack and in its immediate aftermath?\n  Why have none of the survivors testified to Congress?\n  Why do the Benghazi whistleblowers still fear retaliation and \nretribution?\n\n[[Page S6569]]\n\n  To get the answers to these questions, we need to hear from the \nsurvivors of the attack to gain firsthand understanding of what \nhappened that night. We need to ensure that the whistleblowers on \nBenghazi can tell their stories without fear of reprisal. We need the \nPresident to make good on his promise of September 12, 2012, ``to bring \njustice to the killers who attacked our people.'' That still has yet to \nhappen.\n  Over the past year it has become evident that we need a joint select \ncommittee to get these answers because we have an administration that \nis actively trying to avoid learning more about Benghazi. We have a \nformer Secretary of State who responds to congressional inquiries about \nwhy we were attacked in Benghazi with ``what difference at this point \ndoes it make?'' We have a current Secretary of State who responds to \ncongressional inquiries about why the administration deliberately \nmisidentified the nature of the attack by saying that he does not want \nto spend a whole year ``coming up here talking about Benghazi'' to \nCongress. We have a White House Press Secretary who responds to press \ninquiries about difficulties in interviewing the survivors by simply \ndismissing Benghazi as something that ``happened a long time ago.'' And \nwe have a President who complains that ``phony scandals'' are \ndistracting him from his domestic agenda, by which, his Press Secretary \nclarified the next day, he meant the IRS targeting and Benghazi.\n  In addition, we have seen in recent weeks an escalating pattern of \nobstruction by the administration into any investigation into Benghazi \nand a reluctance to take any action to retaliate against the attack or \nto prevent a future episode.\n  On August 14 there were press reports that the team of special \noperators who were in Libya to track down those responsible for the \nBenghazi attack were being pulled out despite repeated recommendations \nfor action, some as recent as August 7.\n  On August 20 we learned that the only disciplinary action taken after \nBenghazi would be reversed as the four State Department employees who \nhad been placed on administrative leave after the attacks were \nreinstated.\n  On August 23 the State Department said it was ``not prepared'' to \nallow the Benghazi survivors to testify to Congress--a denial that was \nreportedly reiterated by Secretary of State John Kerry on September 10.\n  On September 11 we learned from the State Department's own internal \nreview that the Department is ``lagging behind'' in implementing the \nnew security measures recommended after the Benghazi attack, with, for \nexample, only 100 of the recommended 1,000 marines being deployed for \npotential hotspots.\n  On September 15 we learned of serious allegations in a draft House \nCommittee on Oversight and Government Reform report that the \nAccountability Review Board report requested by Secretary Clinton \nwhitewashed the responsibility of senior State Department officials for \nthe decisions that resulted in the lack of proper security at the \nBenghazi facilities.\n  Just today at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, Under \nSecretary of State for Management Patrick Kennedy admitted that the FBI \ninvestigation in Benghazi has ground to an indefinite halt because of \nthe security situation in Libya. Mr. Kennedy also asserted in this \nhearing that the reassignment of four State Department employees \nrepresented ``serious accountability'' for the four Americans who died \nin Benghazi.\n  This state of affairs is, in a word, unacceptable. Truth is not \npartisan, and every Member of this body should want to ascertain what \nhappened. Given the yearlong collective failure of our government \neither to gain clarity on what happened in Benghazi on September 11 or \nto extract any retribution for the terrorist attacks, Congress should \nnow form a joint select committee to launch a proper investigation.\n  The attacks on our diplomatic facilities in Benghazi are part of a \nlarger threat we have faced for the last 12 years from radical Islamic \nterrorists. We cannot let this anniversary pass with just ``a thought, \na hope, a prayer or a wish'' as Secretary Kerry recommended in an all-\nstaff e-mail to the State Department regarding the Benghazi attack. We \nneed a chief counsel who can systematically ascertain the truth and can \nfollow the actual facts of what happened that night to their full and \nlogical conclusion, wherever that may lie, so that we can honor these \nAmerican heroes and we can ensure that we are doing everything we can \nto prevent this sort of attack from ever happening again. If we refuse \nto seek the answers to these questions, then we are inviting future \ntragedies.\n\n  We have four dead Americans. It has been a full year. My cosponsors \non this resolution and I have had enough without answers and without \nthe truth.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Request--S. Res. 225\n\n  I therefore ask unanimous consent that the Rules Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of S. Res. 225, that the Senate \nproceed to its consideration, that the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be made and laid on the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I object and I would like to explain why, if that would \nbe appropriate for the next 2 minutes--if I could?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am proud be a longtime member of the \nForeign Relations Committee for many years. When this Benghazi tragedy \noccurred, the Foreign Relations Committee held hours of hearings. I sat \nthrough those hearings.\n  I want to say to my friends, I share their dismay that we have not \ncaught the perpetrators. But I want to remind them that the President \nwho caught Osama bin Laden--who killed so many of our people--was \nPresident Obama, and when he says he is going to do something he will \nnot rest until he does it.\n  Secretary Clinton immediately called for an Accountability Review \nBoard. That Accountability Review Board was not partisan. What my \ncolleague wants to do is set up some kind of committee filled with \npoliticians--of which I happen to be proud that I am one--but I put \nmore faith, frankly, in the professionalism and the nonpartisanship of \nthe Accountability Review Board.\n  Who headed that Accountability Review Board? Ambassador Thomas \nPickering, who was first picked for public service by George H.W. Bush; \nand Admiral Michael Mullen, former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  There are many other reasons why I oppose this. Secretary Kerry has \naddressed this and continues to address it. We had two classified \nbriefings. The Select Committee on Intelligence is preparing to release \na bipartisan report on the events that occurred in Benghazi and, last \nDecember, the Senate Homeland Security Committee released a bipartisan \nreport on the security deficiencies, and the good news is: Of course as \na result of this tragedy, changes have been made all over the world.\n  I sense there is politics here. I sense there is politics here. I do \nnot think it is right to inject politics into such a tragedy. \nTherefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I can't disagree there is politics here. \nThis is the Senate. But let me say one thing. I strongly support this \namendment. Let me ask in the order of things right now, does the \nSenator from Texas still have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Very good. I appreciate that.\n  One thing, as I read this resolution that my good friend Senator Cruz \nhas, I thought it really does not go far enough. I think all that \npeople are talking about now is how can we preclude this from happening \nagain, what happened and all that. To me that is not even the issue. \nThe issue is the coverup.\n  I sat there as the ranking member on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. I watched the day that this happened, 9/11, then of course \nthe annex came after that, 9/12, the next day. When that happened there \nwas never any doubt but that it was an organized terrorist attack--\nnever any doubt.\n\n[[Page S6570]]\n\n  I happened to know Chris Stevens. He happened to be in my office \nright before he was deployed there. He was telling me in my office how \ndangerous it was over there. He said, you know, there are threats, \nthere are terrorist threats. Al Qaeda has a presence over there and we \ndo not have a lot of security, and he started requesting security. This \nis a long time before this happened. I have all the dates. I did not \nbring them down with me because it would be redundant. It has been in \nthe Record so many times, that he knew this was happening. We knew \nthere was this kind of activity in that part of the world and he wanted \nto do something about it, offer more security.\n  He is dead now, and he knew what he was getting into at that time. \nWhen the threats came for what happened on 9/11, people were aware of \nthat. Remember the Brits, they left and several others just up and left \nbecause they knew what kind of threat was out there.\n  Anyway, what we did right after \n9/11--and it is just a matter of hours after that they attacked the \nannex. They cannot say for certain that the original attack was \norganized. I think it was; it was an organized terrorist attack. But \nthey can say with certainty, and I will not use my words, I will use \ntheir words, it was ``unequivocal,'' unequivocal that we knew at that \ntime it was an organized terrorist attack.\n  I remember when Secretary Panetta came forward and he used the same \nword ``unequivocal.'' Then the CIA Chief Brennan, at that time--that \nwas his job--said, sitting in my office and then again before a \nhearing, it was unequivocal that we knew it was an organized terrorist, \nAl Qaeda-related attack. We knew it.\n  The coverup is this. I have studied coverups for a long time. Iran-\nContra, I went all the way through that. I remember that well. The \nPentagon Papers, Watergate, all of these things were coverups. But this \none, where 5 days after all of our people and the top security people \nknew it was an organized attack, to send Ambassador Rice to the talk \nshows to say, for purely political reasons and cover up the reality of \nit, that this was due to some video--I will only say this. I would like \nto pursue this in terms of the coverup, which is not covered in the \nresolution we are discussing right now. I think it should be--it should \nhave been. I was not part of drafting it. I strongly support it. I know \nwhere we are coming from, and I think we need to get to the bottom of \nit. All the questions need to be answered. But the big issue that needs \nto be discussed, that nobody likes to talk about, is the coverup.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague from the \nForeign Relations Committee having already objected, but I wish to make \na few remarks because there are those--regardless of what is reviewed, \nregardless of who comes forth, regardless of all the information--who \nwant to keep this alive for what are ultimately election purposes. I \nknow the next Presidential election is a few years away, but it seems \nit is very alive in the Senate.\n  Look, I am always for getting to the truth, particularly when the \nlives of American diplomats have been lost. That is an honorable \npursuit. But by the same token, from my perspective--and let me say why \nI am going to have this perspective. My perspective is we have two of \nthe most outstanding individuals in Ambassador Pickering and Admiral \nMullen. Certainly, no one questions their integrity. At least I have \nnot heard their integrity questioned on the Senate floor. They \nconducted the Accountability Review Board. In the process, they yielded \n29 recommendations that are, in fact, being implemented, that our \ncommittee has continued to pursue oversight in the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee. We have held two hearings. We have had multiple \nlevel--high-level briefings, including intelligence briefings, bringing \nall the respective parties who are responsible together.\n  In fact, we had the former Secretary of State before the committee at \na hearing I chaired at the time who addressed all of these issues. We \nhad before that, former Chairman Kerry, now Secretary Kerry. He held a \nhearing of the committee on the events that transpired with Deputy \nSecretary Burns and Deputy Under Secretary Nyes. We had two classified \nbriefings on December 13 and 19, specifically on the circumstances \nsurrounding the attack.\n  In those classified briefings, we had the key individuals who could \nget us to the truth. I understand the Select Committee on Intelligence \nis presenting a bipartisan report on the events that occurred in \nBenghazi. Last December, the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs chairman at the time, Senator Lieberman, and Ranking Member \nCollins released a bipartisan report on the security deficiencies at \nthe temporary U.S. mission in Benghazi that led to the deaths of those \nfour Americans, including our Ambassador Chris Stevens. The House has \nconducted its own hearings and investigations. Yet we have those who \nwant to continue to pursue this, despite all of these different \nefforts, independent of the Senate, between the House, the \nAccountability Review Board.\n  There is a lot of culpability, and maybe there is coverup in a \ndifferent sense. The coverup is a Congress that doesn't want to put the \nmoney where it is necessary, to ultimately take the high-risk, high-\nthreat posts of this country and ultimately protect them. It is nice to \ntalk about who is responsible. Let's talk about who is also responsible \nin terms of obligations. We have over 30 high-risk, high-threat posts \nin the world right now--right now as we speak on the Senate floor--that \nare at risk and that do not meet the present security standards. Yet \nCongress seems to move ever so slowly toward getting to the resources \nthat would accelerate the pace on which we create the physical and \nother protections for those high-threat, high-risk posts.\n  Those, of course, are the 30 that exist today. We know from history \nthat in fact what exists today as a high-risk, high-threat post, \ntomorrow there could be another one on the list. So we have diplomats \nwho are at institutions that do not meet the present standards. Yet at \nthe pace we are going, based upon the appropriations of this Senate, we \nwould find ourselves a decade from now dealing with just those 30 \nposts. I would like to see the Members who do not seem to be willing to \nvote for the security of diplomats abroad, before the next attack \ncomes--and inevitability, unfortunately, in the world in which we live \nthat is very possible--put their resources to work to accelerate the \npace to where we would succeed in preventing injuries or death.\n  Let's be honest about this process. Yes, there was a process that \nultimately led to a series of recommendations. The legislation that the \ncommittee has ultimately reported out in a bipartisan basis--working \nwith Senator Corker, the ranking Republican on the committee--would \ndeal with these challenges. It would deal with language issues. It \nwould deal with the funding issue. It would deal with diplomatic \nsecurity preparation, which we have scattered across a whole bunch of \ninstitutions that do not meet the goal. It would deal with all of these \nelements. It would create greater accountability.\n  Do you know what else it would do? It would let the Secretary of \nState have the ability to ultimately fire those individuals who might \nbe found derelict in their duty, which is not presently in the law--the \nability for the Secretary to pursue that.\n  So let's move that legislation. I hope my colleagues are going to \nsupport that as we move forward, to try to find the success that we \nwant in making sure that our diplomats across the globe are as safe as \nhumanly possible as they advocate America's national economic \ninterests, its national interests, its national security interests, \nstill always facing a risk but minimizing those risks to the greatest \nextent. If not, then I certainly believe the garish light of attention \nshould be placed upon the institution of the Congress, which is not \nmeeting its responsibility as it relates to our diplomats abroad.\n\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be acknowledged \nas if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S6571]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we have had a carefully constructed list \nof who would speak. I wonder how long the Senator wishes to speak.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I do want to accommodate the Senator from California. I \nhave three different subjects I want to talk about----\n  Mrs. BOXER. How much time does my friend need to talk about his first \nsubject?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I need 9\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. What was supposed to happen was that I was going to speak \nnext. I will give up my place so Senator Murray can speak, followed by \nSenator Coons, followed by Senator Inhofe for 9\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  I don't know how many minutes my friend needs--5 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I will need about 12 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would follow Senator Inhofe's 9\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Is that a unanimous consent request?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The Senator from California would follow the Senator from \nWashington?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the consent I made was that we would go to \nSenator Murray for 12 minutes, followed by Senator Coons for 5 minutes, \nSenator Inhofe would be next for 9\\1/2\\ minutes, and then I would get \nto go for about 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, point of inquiry: Is this after I speak \nnow or is that starting now? In other words, we would have four \nDemocrats before I speak?\n  Mrs. BOXER. No, two.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The Senator already had one and then Senator Coons.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Republicans had quite a few on their side speak. The \nRepublicans had three speakers--one right after the other--so now we \nare going to have three speakers, and then it goes back to Senator \nInhofe.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, if two of \nthem speak now and then let me speak and then the Senator can speak \nafter that, that is still 2 to 1.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, that is what I said. I said Senator \nMurray, Senator Coons, Senator Inhofe, and then Senator Boxer. That is \nwhat I said. Is that all right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from California for \naccommodating all of us.\n  I wish to join my colleagues who have spoken on the floor and express \nmy deepest condolences to the families of those who lost someone in \nMonday's tragic shooting. I know the thoughts and prayers of the Nation \nare with those who are still recovering.\n  I know I speak for my constituents in Washington State in thanking \nthe law enforcement community here in Washington, DC. They put their \nlives on the line every day to protect our families and workers in the \nNation's capital. We don't have all the answers to the many questions a \ntragedy such as this raises, but those questions will continue to be \nasked, and I am hopeful the answers will help our Nation heal and guide \nour continued work to prevent these kinds of tragedies in the future.\n  I am here today because, like many of my colleagues, I spent this \npast August traveling around my home State and meeting with my \nconstituents. I heard from Washington State families about a wide range \nof issues facing our Nation, but the one sentiment I heard over and \nover from every part of my State was they were sick and tired of the \nconstant lurching from crisis to crisis.\n  They told me how disappointed and disgusted they were that every time \nthey turned on their televisions over the past few years they would see \nanother story about Congress hurtling toward another official deadline, \nhurting our economy and causing more uncertainty for our businesses. \nThey told me they want Congress to work together; they want us to focus \non the economy; they want us to put our country and the families we \nrepresent before partisanship and political gains.\n  I couldn't agree more. Like them, I am frustrated that we seem to be \nonce again headed toward another completely avoidable, completely \nunnecessary, self-inflicted crisis.\n  It has now been 179 days since this Senate and the House passed our \nbudgets. When the Senate budget passed, I was optimistic that because \nboth Republicans and Democrats said they wanted to return to regular \norder, we might be able to get back to a responsible process. At that \ntime we had 192 days to reach a bipartisan budget agreement and I \nthought the next step would be a budget conference where the two sides \nwould get in a room, hash out our differences, and work together toward \na deal. But as we all know, some of our Republican colleagues had other \nideas. They immediately seemed to regret their push for a Senate budget \nand started running away from a debate as quickly as they could.\n  I came to the Senate floor with my colleagues a total of 18 times to \nask for consent to start a budget conference with the House, but every \ntime we tried a member of the tea party here in the Senate, backed by \nRepublican leaders, stood up and blocked us. Instead of using the \nmonths we had to work out a compromise, Republicans seemed to think it \nwas in their best interest somehow to stall as long as possible under \nsome misguided theory that a crisis would give them more leverage.\n  I had hoped my Republican colleagues spent their time back home \ntalking to their constituents and would be ready to come back to DC so \nwe could get to work on a balanced and bipartisan budget deal, but, \nsadly, the opposite has happened. While I believe the majority of \nRepublicans are interested in working with us as Democrats to get to a \nfair budget deal, a few of my Republican colleagues spent the summer \nriling up the tea party and making them promises they could not keep.\n\n  Since Republican leaders know they need to find a way to avoid \nanother crisis that would be blamed on them, a full-scale civil war has \nbroken out within the Republican Party. They are in disarray. They are \nhaving trouble figuring out how to pull themselves out of the hole they \nhave climbed into. And while we wait for Republicans to join us at the \ntable, the tea party is pushing our country closer and closer to a \ngovernment shutdown and closer to what would be a catastrophic default \non our laws.\n  Why are they doing this? It is not because they are concerned about \nthe budget, not because they are interested in jobs or economic growth. \nTo them it seems it is all about ObamaCare. Everything they are doing \nnow they are doing in order to cut off health care coverage for 25 \nmillion people, to end access to free preventive health care, to cause \nseniors to pay more for their prescriptions, to cut off young adults \nfrom their coverage, to bring back lifetime coverage caps and let \npatients with preexisting conditions be denied care, put the insurance \ncompanies back in charge of our health care system, and so much more.\n  These political games might play well with the tea party base, but \nhere is the reality: ObamaCare is the law of the land. It passed \nthrough this Senate with a supermajority. It passed through the House. \nThe President signed it into law. This Supreme Court upheld it. It is \nalready helping millions of Americans stay healthy and financially \nsecure, and it is on track to help millions more.\n  When I see some of my colleagues working so hard to defund ObamaCare, \nI have to wonder whether they have taken the time to meet some of their \nown constituents who are already benefiting from this law.\n  This last month I was home in Washington State, and I met an \nincredible woman named Nikki Mackey who lives in Seattle. On September \n16 of 2010, Nikki was diagnosed with an extremely aggressive form of \nbreast cancer. She was 36 years old and terrified of what this disease \nwould do to her. To make matters worse, instead of focusing on her \ntreatment, she had to worry about her coverage, and that is because a \nfew months before her diagnosis, in the midst of the recession, Nikki \nhad been laid off from her job. So there she was, with her coverage at \nrisk and years of treatment ahead of her. But thanks to ObamaCare, a \nlaw some of my colleagues want to undermine at any cost,\n\n[[Page S6572]]\n\nNikki will never have to worry about reaching a lifetime cap. She will \nnever have to worry about not getting coverage due to her now \npreexisting condition. That is why we have worked so hard to pass this \nlaw because it says now in America: You shouldn't go broke because you \nget sick, and you shouldn't be denied care simply because you cannot \nafford it.\n  Let's be clear about what is happening here and the political \ncalculation some of my colleagues have made. They have decided they are \nwilling to play politics with Americans' health care, they have decided \nit is better for them to sabotage this law rather than improve it, and \nthey have decided that beyond all that, they are also willing to \ndevastate our Nation's economy to kill this law. Well, we are not going \nto let that happen.\n  Nikki told me when she turns on her TV and sees Members of Congress \nusing every trick in the book to kill this law, she feels her ``own \nwell-being is under attack.''\n  I want to be clear: Democrats are not going to defund or delay health \ncare reform. It is not going to happen. We should all be working \ntogether right now to make sure it is implemented in the best possible \nway for our families, our businesses, and our communities. We are \ncertainly very interested in hearing from anyone, Democrat or \nRepublican, who has good ideas about how the law could be improved. We \nare not going to allow the health care of Nikki or millions of other \nAmericans to be used as a pawn in a political game. We are not going to \nlet this law get sabotaged as it continues to benefit millions of \nfamilies and small business owners. The sooner Republicans realize \nthis, the sooner we can get to work diffusing this latest artificial \ncrisis.\n  We know the families we represent don't support the Republicans' \nsabotage tactics. Recent polls show that fewer than 1 in 4 people \nsupports efforts to make health care reform fail. A majority of people \nbelieve we in Congress should be trying to make the law work. It is \nalso clear that Americans would rightly blame Republicans if the law \nshuts down--especially over an issue such as this--and a lot of \nRepublicans know that.\n  My colleague Senator Johanns said these defunding and delaying \nefforts have ``zero chance of being successful.'' Senator Burr said \n``the dumbest idea I've ever heard of.'' House Republicans know this \ntoo. That is why they introduced a bill last week that would allow a \ngovernment funding bill to pass while giving House Republicans a vote \nto defund health care that has no chance of becoming law. As we now \nknow, the tea party is not interested in that. They don't want a \nshowboat, they want a shutdown, and they are going to keep fighting \nuntil they get it.\n  We now have less than 2 weeks before the end of this fiscal year and \na potential government shutdown. It is a shame that we have gotten to \nthis point, but we are here. We owe it to the American people to come \ntogether and find a solution and a path forward that is good for our \neconomy and fair for our middle class.\n  My goal has been and will continue to be a long-term budget agreement \nthat replaces sequestration, tackles our debt and deficit responsibly, \nand invests in our workers and our economy. But since it seems clear \nthat the House won't be able to get its act together in the next few \nweeks, the least they should be able to do is send us a clean, short-\nterm extension of the current budget levels so the government doesn't \nshut down while we continue to negotiate on this longer term budget \ndeal.\n  I want to be clear: Democrats are not going to negotiate over whether \nCongress should allow the Federal Government to pay its bills. As \nSpeaker Boehner said in the past, default would be ``a financial \ndisaster, not just for us, but for the worldwide economy.'' Republicans \nneed to take those words to heart and stop threatening the economic \nrecovery with their saber rattling and brinkmanship.\n  We went through this earlier in the year. Back then--after spending \nmonths saying they wouldn't raise the debt limit unless they got \ndollar-for-dollar spending cuts, Republicans dropped their demands, \ndropped the so-called Boehner rule, and allowed the debt ceiling to be \nincreased. Going back now to that reckless approach of 2011 and \ndrumming up this uncertainty again is nothing but a huge and harmful \nwaste of time.\n  It is ridiculous that we find ourselves on the brink of an artificial \ncrisis again. We should be doing everything possible to support the \neconomic recovery and help our workers get back on the job. We should \nbe spending time finding common ground to tackle our long-term fiscal \nchallenges responsibly, and we should be working together to build on \nthe Affordable Care Act to continue improving our health care system \nfor all of our families and small business owners. As we know, we are \nnow mired in the muck of perpetual partisanship and constant crises. \nThe American people deserve better. Nikki and the millions of families \nsuch as hers deserve better.\n\n  I am hopeful that the Republican leadership stops focusing so much on \ntheir extreme party minority and comes to the table with us to work on \na balanced and bipartisan deal the vast majority of Americans want. I \nhope they don't make us reach a crisis to get to that point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the remarks \nof the Budget Committee chair. As a member of the Budget Committee, I \njoin her in expressing her strong view that this country does not need \nanother shutdown or another pointless fiscal cliff but needs us to \nlisten and to work together in this Chamber and with the House of \nRepresentatives and move forward on the agenda on which all of our \nconstituents want us to proceed.\n  I rise today specifically to speak to the bill that is on the floor \nthat has been the subject of debate and discussion, S. 1392, the Energy \nSavings and Industrial Competitiveness Act of 2013.\n  This is a broadly bipartisan bill. Its two primary authors, my \ncolleagues from New Hampshire and Ohio, Senators Shaheen and Portman, \nhave worked tirelessly to make sure it respects the priorities of \nMembers of both parties. Its passage by a vote of 19 to 3 out of the \nenergy committee on which I serve speaks to its support across partisan \nlines. Yet, sadly, now that it is on the floor, a few Republicans have \ndecided they want to use it to carry out their own narrow or partisan \npolitical agenda rather than showing our constituents and the American \npeople that we can come together across our differences of region and \nparty to pass this commonsense, bipartisan legislation. They would \nrather confirm the frustration and even disgust so many of our \nconstituents feel about this body.\n  We were all home last month. We all heard from our constituents. I \ndon't know about my colleagues but what I heard from Delawareans about \nwhat they want and deserve is not more displays of selfish partisanship \nthat frustrates them but, rather, that we can listen to each other and \nwork together on bipartisan bills that move this country forward.\n  Energy efficiency--the topic of this bill and the topic we should be \nmoving forward on today--its only agenda is creating a stable, dynamic, \nand prosperous future. The Shaheen-Portman bill has been written with \nonly that goal as its north star. It is not about who is right or who \nis wrong, about whether climate change is real, about whose science we \nare going to choose to believe today; energy efficiency is \nfundamentally something that makes sense. It allows us to bridge \ncompeting interests and concerns because it promotes energy \nindependence, it helps our environment, and it promotes American jobs--\njobs today and jobs tomorrow.\n  When we need to purchase new equipment to promote the efficiency of \nour buildings, whether it is DuPont's Tyvek wrapping or Dow's foam \nspray insulation--both made here in America--we create good \nmanufacturing jobs in our country. When we install new energy-efficient \nequipment in homes and buildings, we hire Americans to do that work--\nsheet metal workers, electricians, laborers. And when we set voluntary \nnew goals for efficiency, as this bill does, we incentivize the kind of \nresearch and innovation that will create jobs well into the future. It \nis simple. There is no reason we shouldn't be able to get this done.\n\n[[Page S6573]]\n\n  I come to this debate today as someone who has seen the power of \nenergy efficiency up close in the private sector and public sector in \nmy work in Delaware. When I was in the private sector more than 15 \nyears ago, I came to understand that power when our then-Governor Ruth \nAnn Minner appointed me to chair the Conservation and Efficiency \nWorking Group of her Energy Task Force. In over 2 years of meetings I \ngrew to appreciate how powerful energy efficiency can be for the \ncommercial and industrial balance sheet of our country. It later \ntranslated into my work as county executive of New Castle County, DE, \nwhere I led a countywide effort to make our buildings more energy \nefficient. We had old and energy wasteful buildings and we knew that by \ninvesting in energy efficiency upgrades, we could save taxpayer money \nand put Delawareans to work.\n  We started with our old City/County Headquarters, a building \nconstructed in the 1970s, almost designed to be monumentally energy \ninefficient. As we audited it, the auditor was stunned at how energy \ninefficient it was--high ceilings, bad insulation, poorly sealed \nwindows--so we overhauled. We upgraded the lights and put in new \nmanagement energy systems, replaced the boilers and chillers and \ncooling towers and got that building up to ENERGY STAR standards. We \ndid a host of other things on a constrained budget and it was a \nresounding and lasting success. With the improvements just to that one \nsmall building, the county saved $350,000 a year, and it will pay for \nitself over 15 years. Because of that success, the county has gone on \nto do retrofits to 20 more buildings in total, providing work for more \nthan 150 Delawareans and reducing emissions by 12 million pounds of \ncarbon dioxide per year, the equivalent of taking 1,000 cars off the \nroad. Those jobs can't be offshored. These are jobs for electricians, \nlaborers, and sheet metal workers. These are good-quality building \ntrades jobs. They are also sustainable because as each contractor \nlearns how to do an energy efficiency retrofit in one building, they \ncan go on and do it for more.\n  What I found is that once folks understood the impact, once they saw \nthe difference we could make in that county, it became an issue that \ntranscended partisanship or political loyalties. That should be the \ncase here, if we had a healthy and functioning Senate, because this \nissue is no more partisan across the United States than it was in our \ncounty. It saved us money, it helped our environment, it put \nDelawareans to work, and the same is true for the Shaheen-Portman bill \nthat should be moving forward today.\n  Earlier this year I had the chance to visit Dover Air Force Base, our \nlargest military facility in Delaware, and see what the U.S. military \nis doing to use less energy and employ alternative energy solutions. \nThey are making dramatic progress, looking across every corner of that \nbase to reduce their energy use and to be more efficient in how they \ntransport materiel in the U.S. Air Force.\n  These are real ideas and technology-based solutions that could be \napplied nationally. There are companies up and down our State in the \nprivate sector which have applied the same approach, the same \ninitiative this bill would take and seen real savings. Businesses such \nas Hirsh Industries, PPG, Kraft, and AstraZeneca all have realized \nsavings of hundreds of thousands of dollars that add to their balance \nsheet and their bottom line.\n  This bill has been scored as creating 136,000 new jobs by 2025, \nsaving consumers $13 billion and nearly 3 billion megawatt hours by \n2030. In total, this is exactly the sort of bill we should be coming \ntogether to pass. Instead, sadly, what I am hearing is that it is \nlikely the partisanship of this Chamber is going to defeat our \nopportunity to take up and consider this important balanced and \nbipartisan bill.\n  Americans are looking to us to take action to create jobs, save them \nmoney, and build a better future for our country. This bill genuinely \ngives us a chance to do all of those things. I am a proud cosponsor of \nthis bill. I had hoped to have a chance to debate, discuss, and vote on \nmany amendments directly relevant to this bill that deal with energy \nefficiency and would strengthen it. Instead it seems we are again mired \nin partisanship as folks here seek to add to this bill amendments \nutterly irrelevant to the core of what should be the focus today: \nhelping to create high-quality jobs for Americans, improving our \nenvironment, and adding to our Nation's bottom line on this commonsense \nmatter.\n  It is my hope we can get past the partisanship and back to the real \nwork our constituents expect and demand of us in the weeks ahead.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, when we were establishing our time, I \nwould say to my good friend and colleague from California, I was joking \naround a little bit about using 9\\1/2\\ minutes. Is it all right if I \nmake that 19\\1/2\\ minutes, maximum?\n  Mrs. BOXER. No. I say to my friend, I was promised to be able to \nspeak at 3:30 so I am already giving up so much time, so if the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma could just take 9\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. OK. I will do that. I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of the remarks of the Senator from California I be \nrecognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. All right. I ask unanimous consent to be recognized for \n15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I wasn't going to do this, \nbut since my good friend from California is on the floor and it is our \nfavorite subject to talk about, I thought I would. I wish to take the \nopportunity to talk about the first round of the major global warming \nregulations the President is set to release this week. These rules will \ngovern the amount of carbon dioxide that can be emitted from \npowerplants and they are the first round of rules following the \nPresident's major speech on global warming in June.\n  The rules represent the most aggressive representation of the war on \nfossil fuels we have seen in this administration, and we have seen a \nlot of them. We know the rules will require any coal-fired plant to \nhave carbon-capture and sequestration technology; that is, CSS \ntechnology. While the Clean Air Act only allows feasible technology to \nbe mandated, the CSS technology is not feasible. It is really not there \nyet. No powerplant has ever been built with the technology unless it \nhas been supported by massive taxpayer subsidies. The rule would kill \nthe coal powerplant industry.\n  While the rules may be constructed in a way that allows natural gas-\nfired powerplants to meet the mandate, we have to know that is coming \nnext. After all, natural gas is a fossil fuel as well. There have been \nseveral statements of people saying, Well, wait around until fossil \nfuel, which is going to be next. The only thing these new rules will do \nis cause energy prices to skyrocket. I expect the rules to be one of \nthe key issues covered by the media this week.\n  While the exact details of the rule will not be known until it is \npublished later this week, there are a few things that we know right \nnow. First, the science behind global warming is now more uncertain \nthan ever. I spoke about this this morning in our hearing. Just last \nweek it was reported all over the media--the Telegraph--this is in \nLondon, one of their largest publications--the Guardian, also in \nLondon, the Wall Street Journal, and others, that this year there has \nbeen 60 percent more ice coverage in the Arctic than there was this \ntime last year.\n  My colleagues might remember the hysterical people were saying at one \ntime that there would be no more icecaps by 2013. Instead, we find out \nit has actually increased by 60 percent. This is the equivalent of \nalmost 1 million square miles, and this is being observed before the \nwinter refreeze has even set in.\n  What makes it more interesting is that in 2007, the BBC reported that \nglobal warming would leave the entire Arctic ice-free in the summers by \n2013. The scientist who made this claim, Professor Wineslaw Maslowski, \nsaid, in the typical bravado we have come to expect from climate \nscientists, that ``This is not a cycle; not just a fluctuation. In the \nend, it will all just melt away quite suddenly.'' That is in 2013. \nWell, here we are in 2013 and guess what. They are wrong again. There \nis 60 percent more ice than there was at\n\n[[Page S6574]]\n\nthis time last year. A lot of the yachts and the ships that expected to \nuse the Northwest Passage can't use the Northwest Passage; it is \nclosed, closed because the ice is there.\n  This follows reports earlier this year, notably from The Economist, \nshowing that global warming has been on a pause for the last 15 years. \nThe Economist wrote: ``Over the past 15 years, air temperatures and the \nEarth's surface have been flat while greenhouse-gas emissions have \ncontinued to soar.''\n  The U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change did not expect \nthis development to occur, nor did its models predict that there would \nbe a 15-year stall in global warming.\n  Professor Anastasios Tsonis, at the University of Wisconsin, recently \nconcluded that:\n\n       We are already in a cooling trend, which I think will \n     continue for the next fifteen years at least. There is no \n     doubt the warming of the 1980s and 1990s has stopped.\n\n  This reminds me of all the hysteria in the 1970s that a global \nwarming trend is coming. I can't tell my colleagues how many times on \nthe Senate floor I have talked about how these cycles come and go about \nevery 25 years, and here it is, right on schedule, going into a cooling \nperiod. Starting back in 1895, every 15 to 20 years, they start out \nwith the new Ice Age is coming, everyone is hysterical, and then in \n2007--1970--1919, they went into a period of warming, and then in \n1995--or 1945--they went into another cooling spell and that happened \nto coincide with the year they had the greatest surge in CO2 \non our planet.\n  I only want to say this finally has come to our attention that we are \nlooking at a situation that is quite different than we have seen in the \npast. I mentioned that later in this month the long-awaited event is \ngoing to happen. It comes up every 5, 6, or 7 years. That is when the \nIPCC comes out with its assessment. This just came up--I saw that it is \ndated today in the Wall Street Journal, and I will read this:\n\n       Later this month, a long-awaited event that last happened \n     in 2007 will recur. Like a returning comet, it will be taken \n     to portend ominous happenings. I refer to the \n     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's fifth assessment \n     report.\n\n  That is what we are talking about. They go on to say they have \nlearned from some leaks what is in that assessment. ``There have \nalready been leaks''--I am reading now--``from this 31-page document \nwhich summarizes 1,914 pages of scientific discussion, but thanks to a \nsenior climate scientist, I have had a glimpse of the key prediction at \nthe heart of the document.\n  Keep in mind, this is IPCC, United Nations. The big news is that for \nthe first time since these reports started coming out in 1990, the new \none dials back the alarm. It states that the temperature rise we can \nexpect as a result of manmade emissions from carbon dioxide is lower \nthan the IPCC expected.\n  This is something we did not anticipate would happen just as recently \nas a few days ago.\n  Real quickly, it is my hope we get to some of these amendments, and I \nam going to mention one that is a very significant amendment.\n  A few months ago, when we were debating the continuing resolution, \nthe Senate adopted amendment No. 29, which prohibited the EPA from \nenforcing this Spill Prevention, Containment, and Countermeasure Rule. \nThat is the SPCC rule.\n  As we all remember, they were going to enforce this against farmers. \nThe reason we did this is clear: EPA first threatened to enforce this \nrule against farmers at the beginning of the Obama administration, but \nthey did very little outreach. Most farmers do not even know today \nabout this rule or what they would have to do to comply. The only \nreason other Members know about this rule is because of the work \nSenator Pryor and I have done to highlight the problem for what it is.\n  This rule was originally drafted for compliance by major handlers of \noil--refineries, pipelines--players such as the ones that are shown on \nthis chart I have in the Chamber.\n  This chart actually shows part of Cushing, OK, which is a major hub \nof oil pipelines. Millions of barrels of oil are transported through \nand stored in this small town each day, and it is incredibly important \nthat the handlers of the oil follow appropriate regulations to make \nsure accidents do not cause significant environmental damage. They \nunderstand why the regulations are in place, and they follow the rules \nwith precision. And we are talking about the people in the adjoining \ntowns.\n  These refineries and tank operators are who the rule was designed for \nin the first place, and that makes sense. But now EPA wants to enforce \nthat rule against farmers.\n  What would it look like if we did this?\n  First, take a look at this second chart. This is a diesel fuel \ncontainer on a farm. It is small. It does not hold that much fuel. But \nright now it is subject to the same regulations you would have for oil \ncompanies and refineries.\n  I asked a friend of mine, Keith Kisling, a wheat farmer in western \nOklahoma, what it would take for him to comply with this rule that was \ndesigned for refiners.\n  He said: First I have to purchase a new double-wall container that \nwould cost thousands of dollars. EPA justifies this by saying it would \nprevent leaks. Keith, like all other farmers I know in Oklahoma, thinks \ndiesel is expensive. So Keith is not going to let his tanks leak, \nwhatever kind it is. You would sit on a farm and realize that is \nleaking money. Obviously, they do not want to do that.\n  The next thing he would have to do is build a berm all the way around \nhis tank to contain a spill if all of the diesel fuel came out of it. \nThis would be expensive and difficult to operate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have 3 more \nminutes and conclude.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Finally, Keith would have to hire and pay a professional \nengineer to certify his spill plan, if he can find one. In Oklahoma, \nfarmers cannot find professional engineers because they are all working \nfor oil and gas companies, which makes compliance with this particular \nrequirement virtually impossible. All told, Keith would have to pay \nsomewhere between $10 and $30,000 to comply with the rule, and the \nenvironment is not any better for it.\n  After we secured the amendment prohibiting the EPA from enforcing the \nrule back in March, Senator Pryor and I worked to secure a permanent \nexemption, and we did this. We put it in, as the Senator from \nCalifornia will remember, the WRDA bill, and, of course, it is not \nfinal law yet. This is the amendment that we have right now.\n  Last month, during the August recess, I received word from the \nNational Cattlemen's Beef Association that producers in Kansas and \nother areas out West were hearing from EPA enforcement officers that \nthey were at risk of having the SPCC rule retroactively enforced \nagainst them once the prohibition on enforcement expires on September \n23. This comes despite the clear actions Congress has been taking to \nprovide relief to farmers. I honestly do not know of anyone who wants \nto subject our farmers in the United States of America to the same \nrequirements that refineries and oil companies and these operations \nhave.\n  So I do have an amendment that would go on. It is my hope we will be \nable to get to the amendments on the bill, the underlying bill that is \nunder consideration today, and I think this is one of two amendments I \nhave that should be accepted unanimously.\n  With that, I thank the Senator from California for giving me that \nadditional time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, first I want to add my voice of condolence \nto that of Senator Murray's and say to the Navy family how heavy our \nhearts are and that I stand ready, any minute, any hour, any second, to \nwork with my colleagues to make sure mentally ill people do not get \ntheir hands on weapons. As soon as we can get a breakthrough on that--\nand maybe on background checks--maybe we can finally do something for \n90 percent of the American people who want us to.\n  I also want to note that Senator Inhofe and I have an ongoing \ndispute, though it is quite friendly, on climate change. We went \nthrough this this morning. He sees evidence that climate change is \nprobably still a hoax, and he talks about the great news that we do not \nhave climate change. I think you should tell that to the people in \nColorado. But notwithstanding that--forget\n\n[[Page S6575]]\n\nthat--I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record four \narticles that appeared in the recent days about how the consensus on \nclimate change is growing, and there is 95-percent certainty that the \ncause is human activity.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Reuters, Aug. 16, 2013]\n\n Experts Surer of Manmade Global Warming but Local Predictions Elusive\n\n              (By Environment Correspondent Alister Doyle)\n\n       Oslo (Reuters).--Climate scientists are surer than ever \n     that human activity is causing global warming, according to \n     leaked drafts of a major U.N. report, but they are finding it \n     harder than expected to predict the impact in specific \n     regions in coming decades.\n       The uncertainty is frustrating for government planners: the \n     report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \n     (IPCC) is the main guide for states weighing multi-billion-\n     dollar shifts to renewable energy from fossil fuels, for \n     coastal regions considering extra sea defenses or crop \n     breeders developing heat-resistant strains.\n       Drafts seen by Reuters of the study by the U.N. panel of \n     experts, due to be published next month, say it is at least \n     95 percent likely that human activities--chiefly the burning \n     of fossil fuels--are the main cause of warming since the \n     1950s.\n       That is up from at least 90 percent in the last report in \n     2007, 66 percent in 2001, and just over 50 in 1995, steadily \n     squeezing out the arguments by a small minority of scientists \n     that natural variations in the climate might be to blame.\n       That shifts the debate onto the extent of temperature rises \n     and the likely impacts, from manageable to catastrophic. \n     Governments have agreed to work out an international deal by \n     the end of 2015 to rein in rising emissions.\n       ``We have got quite a bit more certain that climate change \n     . . . is largely manmade,'' said Reto Knutti, a professor at \n     the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. ``We're \n     less certain than many would hope about the local impacts.''\n       And gauging how warming would affect nature, from crops to \n     fish stocks, was also proving hard since it goes far beyond \n     physics. ``You can't write an equation for a tree,'' he said.\n       The IPCC report, the first of three to be released in 2013 \n     and 2014, will face intense scrutiny, particularly after the \n     panel admitted a mistake in the 2007 study which wrongly \n     predicted that all Himalayan glaciers could melt by 2035. \n     Experts say the error far overestimated the melt and might \n     have been based on a misreading of 2350.\n       The new study will state with greater confidence than in \n     2007 that rising manmade greenhouse gas emissions have \n     already meant more heatwaves. But it is likely to play down \n     some tentative findings from 2007, such as that human \n     activities have contributed to more droughts.\n       Almost 200 governments have agreed to try to limit global \n     warming to below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above \n     pre-industrial times, seen as a threshold for dangerous \n     changes including more droughts, extinctions, floods and \n     rising seas that could swamp coastal regions and entire \n     island nations.\n       The report will flag a high risk that global temperatures \n     will increase this century by more than that level, and will \n     say that evidence of rising sea levels is now \n     ``unequivocal''.\n       For all that, scientists say it is proving harder to \n     pinpoint local impacts in coming decades in a way that would \n     help planners.\n       Drew Shindell, a NASA climate scientist, said the relative \n     lack of progress in regional predictions was the main \n     disappointment of climate science since 2007.\n       ``I talk to people in regional power planning. They ask: \n     'What's the temperature going to be in this region in the \n     next 20-30 years, because that's where our power grid is?''' \n     he said.\n       ``We can't really tell. It's a shame,'' said Shindell. Like \n     the other scientists interviewed, he was speaking about \n     climate science in general since the last IPCC report, not \n     about the details of the latest drafts.\n\n\n                            WARMING SLOWING\n\n       The panel will try to explain why global temperatures, \n     while still increasing, have risen more slowly since about \n     1998 even though greenhouse gas concentrations have hit \n     repeated record highs in that time, led by industrial \n     emissions by China and other emerging nations.\n       An IPCC draft says there is ``medium confidence'' that the \n     slowing of the rise is ``due in roughly equal measure'' to \n     natural variations in the weather and to other factors \n     affecting energy reaching the Earth's surface.\n       Scientists believe causes could include: greater-than-\n     expected quantities of ash from volcanoes, which dims \n     sunlight; a decline in heat from the sun during a current 11-\n     year solar cycle; more heat being absorbed by the deep \n     oceans; or the possibility that the climate may be less \n     sensitive than expected to a build-up of carbon dioxide.\n       ``It might be down to minor contributions that all add \n     up,'' said Gabriele Hegerl, a professor at Edinburgh \n     University. Or maybe, scientists say, the latest decade is \n     just a blip.\n       The main scenarios in the draft, using more complex \n     computer models than in 2007 and taking account of more \n     factors, show that temperatures could rise anywhere from a \n     fraction of 1 degree Celsius (1.8 Fahrenheit) to almost 5C \n     (9F) this century, a wider range at both ends than in 2007.\n       The low end, however, is because the IPCC has added what \n     diplomats say is an improbable scenario for radical \n     government action--not considered in 2007--that would require \n     cuts in global greenhouse gases to zero by about 2070.\n       Temperatures have already risen by 0.8C (1.4F) since the \n     Industrial Revolution in the 19th century.\n       Experts say that the big advance in the report, due for a \n     final edit by governments and scientists in Stockholm from \n     September 23-26, is simply greater confidence about the \n     science of global warming, rather than revolutionary new \n     findings.\n\n\n                               SEA LEVELS\n\n       ``Overall our understanding has strengthened,'' said \n     Michael Oppenheimer, a professor at Princeton University, \n     pointing to areas including sea level rise.\n       An IPCC draft projects seas will rise by between 29 and 82 \n     cm (11.4 to 32.3 inches) by the late 21st century--above the \n     estimates of 18 to 59 cm in the last report, which did not \n     fully account for changes in Antarctica and Greenland.\n       The report slightly tones down past tentative findings that \n     more intense tropical cyclones are linked to human \n     activities. Warmer air can contain more moisture, however, \n     making downpours more likely in the future.\n       ``There is widespread agreement among hurricane scientists \n     that rainfall associated with hurricanes will increase \n     noticeably with global warming,'' said Kerry Emanuel, of the \n     Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n       ``But measuring rainfall is very tricky,'' he said.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   [From The Guardian, July 22, 2013]\n\n     Climate Change Slowdown Is due to Warming of Deep Oceans, Say \n                               Scientists\n\n       Climate sceptics have seized on a pause in warming over the \n     past five years, but the long-term trend is still upwards.\n\n                           (By Fiona Harvey)\n\n       A recent slowdown in the upward march of global \n     temperatures is likely to be the result of the slow warming \n     of the deep oceans, British scientists said on Monday.\n       Oceans are some of the Earth's biggest absorbers of heat, \n     which can be seen in effects such as sea level rises, caused \n     by the expansion of large bodies of water as they warm. The \n     absorption goes on over long periods, as heat from the \n     surface is gradually circulated to the lower reaches of the \n     seas.\n       Temperatures around the world have been broadly static over \n     the past five years, though they were still significantly \n     above historic norms, and the years from 2000 to 2012 \n     comprise most of the 14 hottest years ever recorded. The \n     scientists said the evidence still clearly pointed to a \n     continuation of global warming in the coming decades as \n     greenhouse gases in the atmosphere contribute to climate \n     change.\n       This summer's heatwave, the most prolonged period of hot \n     weather in the UK for years, has not yet been taken into \n     account in their measurements.\n       Peter Stott of the Met Office said computer-generated \n     climate models all showed that periods of slower warming were \n     to be expected as part of the natural variation of the \n     climate cycle, and did not contradict predictions. Given that \n     variation, current temperatures are within expectations.\n       As well as the heating of the deep oceans, other factors \n     have played a significant part in slowing temperature rises. \n     These have included the solar minimum--when the sun is less \n     active and generating slightly less heat, as occurred in \n     2008/2009--and a series of small volcanic eruptions, \n     including that of Iceland's Eyjafjallajokull volcano in 2010. \n     Ash from volcanoes reflects light back into space, and major \n     eruptions in the past have had a severe, albeit temporary, \n     cooling effect.\n       Despite the slowdown in warming, by 2060 the world is still \n     likely to have experienced average temperatures of more than \n     2C above pre-industrial levels--a threshold that scientists \n     regard as the limit of safety, beyond which climate change \n     impacts are likely to become catastrophic. Prof Rowan Sutton, \n     director of climate research at the National Centre for \n     Atmospheric Research at Reading University, said the current \n     pause would only delay reaching this point by five to 10 \n     years.\n       The ``pause'' in the rise of global temperatures has been \n     seized on by climate sceptics, however, who have interpreted \n     it as proof that the science of climate change is mistaken. \n     But despite the slowdown in warming, the warmest years on \n     record were 1998, 2005 and 2010, according to the US National \n     Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n       Prof Sutton said more research was needed on the effects of \n     warming on the deep oceans, as observations of deep ocean \n     temperatures have only been carried out in detail over the \n     past decade and more are needed. Higher temperatures could \n     not only have a devastating effect on marine life, he said, \n     but could also contribute to increases in sea levels as sea \n     water expands.\n       The Met Office warned early in the summer that the UK could \n     be in for a decade of\n\n[[Page S6576]]\n\n     ``washout'' summers, like those of the past six years, \n     because of the effect of climate change on global weather \n     systems, partly as a result of changes in wind patterns \n     caused by the melting Arctic.\n       But no sooner had the meteorologists made their prediction \n     than the weather bucked this trend, with a shift in the \n     Atlantic's jet stream air circulation system giving rise to \n     high-pressure weather fronts and a long period of settled \n     sunny weather.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                       [From NOAA, May 10, 2013]\n\n CO2 at NOAA's Mauna Loa Observatory Reaches New Milestone: \n                              Tops 400 ppm\n\n       On May 9, the daily mean concentration of carbon dioxide in \n     the atmosphere of Mauna Loa, Hawaii, surpassed 400 parts per \n     million (ppm) for the first time since measurements began in \n     1958. Independent measurements made by both NOAA and the \n     Scripps Institution of Oceanography have been approaching \n     this level during the past week. It marks an important \n     milestone because Mauna Loa, as the oldest continuous carbon \n     dioxide (CO2.) measurement station in the world, \n     is the primary global benchmark site for monitoring the \n     increase of this potent heat-trapping gas.\n       Carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere by fossil fuel \n     burning and other human activities is the most significant \n     greenhouse gas (GHG) contributing to climate change. Its \n     concentration has increased every year since scientists \n     started making measurements on the slopes of the Mauna Loa \n     volcano more than five decades ago. The rate of increase has \n     accelerated since the measurements started, from about 0.7 \n     ppm per year in the late 1950s to 2.1 ppm per year during the \n     last 10 years.\n       ``That increase is not a surprise to scientists,'' said \n     NOAA senior scientist Pieter Tans, with the Global Monitoring \n     Division of NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory in \n     Boulder, Cob. ``The evidence is conclusive that the strong \n     growth of global CO2 emissions from the burning of \n     coal, oil, and natural gas is driving the acceleration.''\n       Before the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, \n     global average CO2 was about 280 ppm. During the \n     last 800,000 years, CO2 fluctuated between about \n     180 ppm during ice ages and 280 ppm during interglacial warm \n     periods. Today's rate of increase is more than 100 times \n     faster than the increase that occurred when the last ice age \n     ended.\n       It was researcher Charles David Keeling of the Scripps \n     Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego, who began \n     measuring carbon dioxide at Mauna Loa in 1958, initiating now \n     what is known as the ``Keeling Curve.'' His son, Ralph \n     Keeling, also a geochemist at Scripps, has continued the \n     Scripps measurement record since his father's death in 2005.\n       ``There's no stopping CO2 from reaching 400 \n     ppm,'' said Ralph Keeling. ``That's now a done deal. But what \n     happens from here on still matters to climate, and it's still \n     under our control. It mainly comes down to how much we \n     continue to rely on fossil fuels for energy.''\n       NOAA scientists with the Global Monitoring Division have \n     made around-the-clock measurements there since 1974. Having \n     two programs independently measure the greenhouse gas \n     provides confidence that the measurements are correct. \n     Moreover, similar increases of CO2 are seen all \n     over the world by many international scientists. NOAA, for \n     example, which runs a global, cooperative air sampling \n     network, reported last year that all Arctic sites in its \n     network reached 400 ppm for the first time. These high values \n     were a prelude to what is now being observed at Mauna Loa, a \n     site in the subtropics, this year. Sites in the Southern \n     Hemisphere will follow during the next few years. The \n     increase in the Northern Hemisphere is always a little ahead \n     of the Southern Hemisphere because most of the emissions \n     driving the CO2 increase take place in the north. \n     Once emitted, CO2 added to the atmosphere and \n     oceans remains for thousands of years. Thus, climate changes \n     forced by CO2 depend primarily on cumulative \n     emissions, making it progressively more and more difficult to \n     avoid further substantial climate change.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 10, 2013]\n\n           Heat-Trapping Gas Passes Milestone, Raising Fears\n\n                           (By Justin Gillis)\n\n       The level of the most important heat-trapping gas in the \n     atmosphere, carbon dioxide, has passed a long-feared \n     milestone, scientists reported Friday, reaching a \n     concentration not seen on the earth for millions of years.\n       Scientific instruments showed that the gas had reached an \n     average daily level above 400 parts per million--just an \n     odometer moment in one sense, but also a sobering reminder \n     that decades of efforts to bring human-produced emissions \n     under control are faltering.\n       The best available evidence suggests the amount of the gas \n     in the air has not been this high for at least three million \n     years, before humans evolved, and scientists believe the rise \n     portends large changes in the climate and the level of the \n     sea.\n       ``It symbolizes that so far we have failed miserably in \n     tackling this problem,'' said Pieter P. Tans, who runs the \n     monitoring program at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration that reported the new reading.\n       Ralph Keeling, who runs another monitoring program at the \n     Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, said a \n     continuing rise could be catastrophic. ``It means we are \n     quickly losing the possibility of keeping the climate below \n     what people thought were possibly tolerable thresholds,'' he \n     said.\n       Virtually every automobile ride, every plane trip and, in \n     most places, every flip of a light switch adds carbon dioxide \n     to the air, and relatively little money is being spent to \n     find and deploy alternative technologies.\n       China is now the largest emitter, but Americans have been \n     consuming fossil fuels extensively for far longer, and \n     experts say the United States is more responsible than any \n     other nation for the high level.\n       The new measurement came from analyzers atop Mauna Loa, the \n     volcano on the big island of Hawaii that has long been ground \n     zero for monitoring the worldwide trend on carbon dioxide, or \n     CO2. Devices there sample clean, crisp air that \n     has blown thousands of miles across the Pacific Ocean, \n     producing a record of rising carbon dioxide levels that has \n     been closely tracked for half a century.\n       Carbon dioxide above 400 parts per million was first seen \n     in the Arctic last year, and had also spiked above that level \n     in hourly readings at Mauna Loa.\n       But the average reading for an entire day surpassed that \n     level at Mauna Loa for the first time in the 24 hours that \n     ended at 8 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on Thursday. The two \n     monitoring programs use slightly different protocols; NOAA \n     reported an average for the period of 400.03 parts per \n     million, while Scripps reported 400.08.\n       Carbon dioxide rises and falls on a seasonal cycle, and the \n     level will dip below 400 this summer as leaf growth in the \n     Northern Hemisphere pulls about 10 billion tons of carbon out \n     of the air. But experts say that will be a brief reprieve--\n     the moment is approaching when no measurement of the ambient \n     air anywhere on earth, in any season, will produce a reading \n     below 400.\n       ``It feels like the inevitable march toward disaster,'' \n     said Maureen E. Raymo, a scientist at the Lamont-Doherty \n     Earth Observatory, a unit of Columbia University.\n       From studying air bubbles trapped in Antarctic ice, \n     scientists know that going back 800,000 years, the carbon \n     dioxide level oscillated in a tight band, from about 180 \n     parts per million in the depths of ice ages to about 280 \n     during the warm periods between. The evidence shows that \n     global temperatures and CO2 levels are tightly \n     linked.\n       For the entire period of human civilization, roughly 8,000 \n     years, the carbon dioxide level was relatively stable near \n     that upper bound. But the burning of fossil fuels has caused \n     a 41 percent increase in the heat-trapping gas since the \n     Industrial Revolution, a mere geological instant, and \n     scientists say the climate is beginning to react, though they \n     expect far larger changes in the future.\n       Indirect measurements suggest that the last time the carbon \n     dioxide level was this high was at least three million years \n     ago, during an epoch called the Pliocene. Geological research \n     shows that the climate then was far warmer than today, the \n     world's ice caps were smaller, and the sea level might have \n     been as much as 60 or 80 feet higher.\n       Experts fear that humanity may be precipitating a return to \n     such conditions--except this time, billions of people are in \n     harm's way.\n       ``It takes a long time to melt ice, but we're doing it,'' \n     Dr. Keeling said. ``It's scary.''\n       Dr. Keeling's father, Charles David Keeling, began carbon \n     dioxide measurements on Mauna Loa and at other locations in \n     the late 1950s. The elder Dr. Keeling found a level in the \n     air then of about 315 parts per million--meaning that if a \n     person had filled a million quart jars with air, about 315 \n     quart jars of carbon dioxide would have been mixed in.\n       His analysis revealed a relentless, long-term increase \n     superimposed on the seasonal cycle, a trend that was dubbed \n     the Keeling Curve.\n       Countries have adopted an official target to limit the \n     damage from global warming, with 450 parts per million seen \n     as the maximum level compatible with that goal. ``Unless \n     things slow down, we'll probably get there in well under 25 \n     years,'' Ralph Keeling said.\n       Yet many countries, including China and the United States, \n     have refused to adopt binding national targets. Scientists \n     say that unless far greater efforts are made soon, the goal \n     of limiting the warming will become impossible without severe \n     economic disruption.\n       ``If you start turning the Titanic long before you hit the \n     iceberg, you can go clear without even spilling a drink of a \n     passenger on deck,'' said Richard B. Alley, a climate \n     scientist at Pennsylvania State University. ``If you wait \n     until you're really close, spilling a lot of drinks is the \n     best you can hope for.''\n       Climate-change contrarians, who have little scientific \n     credibility but are politically influential in Washington, \n     point out that carbon dioxide represents only a tiny fraction \n     of the air--as of Thursday's reading, exactly 0.04 percent. \n     ``The CO2 levels in the atmosphere are rather \n     undramatic,'' a Republican congressman from California, Dana \n     Rohrabacher, said in a Congressional hearing several years \n     ago.\n       But climate scientists reject that argument, saying it is \n     like claiming that a tiny bit of arsenic or cobra venom \n     cannot have much effect. Research shows that even at such low \n     levels, carbon dioxide is potent at trapping heat near the \n     surface of the earth.\n       ``If you're looking to stave off climate perturbations that \n     I don't believe our culture is\n\n[[Page S6577]]\n\n     ready to adapt to, then significant reductions in \n     CO2 emissions have to occur right away,'' said \n     Mark Pagani, a Yale geochemist who studies climates of the \n     past. ``I feel like the time to do something was yesterday.''\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to ask Senator Durbin how much time \nhe needs, and I will make a request that he be recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the gentle lady from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am not the gentle lady anymore.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Pardon me?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I remember 10 years of being a gentle lady.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Well, I still think she is a gentle lady.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, that is so nice of the Senator to say.\n  Mr. DURBIN. In addition to being the Senator from California.\n  I see on the floor the Senator from Wisconsin. I do not want to step \nin front of him.\n  All right. Then I ask unanimous consent to be given 5 minutes to \nspeak after the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to talk about what is happening in \nthis Congress or, better yet, what is not happening. We have to pass a \ncontinuing resolution so we can fund this government. That means all \nthe functions--whether it is air traffic controllers, whether it is \nbuilding our highways, whether it is FBI agents, whether it is paying \nSocial Security. All the things we do--Medicare--we have to pass a \ncontinuing resolution to keep this government going--sending meat \ninspectors out to make sure we do not get poisoned, and the rest; you \nname it.\n  And where is the House? All spending bills have to start over there. \nThe Republicans control it. They have not sent us a continuing \nresolution. We also have to make sure we pay our debts--just like all \nAmericans--debts we voted for. Whether it is military spending, \ndomestic spending, spending to help our farmers, spending to help \nrecover from Hurricane Sandy, we have to pay our debts. To do that, we \nhave to increase the debt ceiling.\n  October 15; it is coming. If we do not do it, if the Republicans play \ngames, we will see a crash in the stock market. I am sure every \nAmerican looks forward to that. They are not doing their work because \nthey are obsessed--they are obsessed--with repealing a law they have \ntried to repeal 41 times. They are obsessed.\n  They tried to get it overturned in the Supreme Court. The Supreme \nCourt said it is constitutional. They are trying to take away a law \nthat is helping every American, and I am going to talk about it. They \nare obsessed.\n  They refuse to understand that raising the debt ceiling is not about \nfuture spending, it is about past spending. So their reason is, they \nare very upset about the Affordable Care Act--or ObamaCare, however you \nwant to call it--and they are very upset about the deficit, which has \ncome down by half from its height with this President's leadership.\n  Here is the thing: I do a lot of speaking to youngsters in school. \nWhen I explain to them what the role of a Senator is, I say, in \nessence, it is to make life better for the people--that is what I think \nit is--and to do it in a smart way, and to work with your colleagues to \nmake sure you can compromise and get things done. Whether it is \nbuilding highways or making sure our ports are dredged or funding the \nmilitary, we must work together. No one gets everything he or she \nwants. That is life. You have to compromise. You cannot be an ideologue \nand say: My way or the highway.\n  To go after a law that was passed years ago--that you tried to repeal \n41 times and failed, that you tried to overturn in the Court and \nfailed--and then not to do your most fundamental responsibility of \nkeeping the government open? There is something really wrong about \nthis.\n  Let's take a look at this economy. Why are they so upset at what the \nPresident has been able to achieve?\n  President Clinton left office with a surplus--over $200 billion. \nRemember that.\n  Eight years later, President Bush left office with a $1.3 trillion \ndeficit. I will not go into why because I do not have the time, but \nthat is the fact, and no one can erase it from the books.\n  Since President Obama took office, the projected annual deficit has \nbeen cut in half. It is less than $650 billion. Yet they are willing to \nshut the government down by making believe no progress has been made, \nwhen we have cut the deficit in half and we are trying to get out of a \ndisastrous recession.\n  Under the Clinton administration, the economy created more than 20 \nmillion private sector jobs. Under George W. Bush, we lost 665,000 \njobs.\n  Remember, Clinton, millions of jobs created; George Bush, the \nRepublican, hundreds of thousands of private sector jobs lost.\n  Under President Obama, we have added 3.9 million private sector \njobs--coming out of the worst recession since the Great Depression. You \ncan say what you want, but President Obama and the Democrats here--even \nthough it has been a bear to do it--we have managed to wrap our arms \naround this recession and get us on a course.\n  How about housing? Home prices are up more than 12 percent over the \nlast year. Home sales have increased 47 percent since their crisis low. \nRecent housing starts are up 75 percent from April 2009.\n  Housing was the cause of this recession. People sliced and diced \nmortgages and sold them on Wall Street and brought everything down. \nDeregulation; that was the Republican mantra. It went too far, and we \nlost our way, and people suffered through the worst recession since the \nGreat Depression.\n  The Republicans, instead of working with us to keep the progress up, \nwant to shut the government down, want to say we are not going to pay \nour bills, even though they voted to rack up those bills.\n  Look at the auto industry. In 2009, the auto industry lost more than \n100,000 jobs. Rescuing the auto industry saved more than 1 million \njobs, and the news is great coming out of Detroit. People are buying \ncars.\n  The Republicans put it all at risk by shutting down the government \nand not paying the bills.\n  There are going to be no more bailouts. I was so proud. I offered the \nfirst amendment. I think my friend remembers: No more government \nbailouts to the big banks. So we are on our way to saying, once and for \nall, we are not going to let this crisis happen again.\n  The stock market. Do you know the Dow fell to 6,500, Mr. President? \nSince then, it has rebounded to 15,000--almost 2,000 points above its \nprecrisis record. But yet they will put it all at risk because they are \nsaying they are going to play games, shut down the government, not pay \nthe debt.\n  The last time they played these games--the Republicans--GAO found \nthat threatening to breach the debt limit cost the Treasury $1.3 \nbillion just in 2011, and $18 billion over the next 10 years.\n  The next time a Republican tells you how fiscally conservative they \nare, ask them why it is they added $18 billion to the debt by playing \ngames with the debt ceiling.\n  I want to quote Republican President Ronald Reagan, one of the heroes \nof my friends' party. He said:\n\n       The full consequences of a default--or even the serious \n     prospect of default--by the United States are impossible to \n     predict and awesome to contemplate. Denigration of the full \n     faith and credit of the United States would have substantial \n     effects on the domestic financial markets and the value of \n     the dollar.\n\n  That is Ronald Reagan. In 1983 he said that even talking about a \ndefault had terrible consequences. They are not even talking about a \ndefault, they are planning for a default.\n  My friend, who is such a great leader in the Senate, Senator Durbin, \ninformed us and Senator Reid informed us that the Republicans in the \nHouse have a bill they love. We call it Pay China First. If there is a \ndefault, they will keep paying China the interest we owe them, but they \nwill default on all of the Americans here and all of the contractors, \nthe highway contractors, the people who dredge our ports. They will \ndefault on what they owe the American people, but they will pay China.\n\n[[Page S6578]]\n\n  Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the CBO Director under George W. Bush, said:\n\n       It's a bad idea. Little defaults, big defaults; default's a \n     bad idea period and there should be no one who believes \n     otherwise.\n\n  He said that in 2011. There is no such thing as a good default.\n  I have shown how far we have come with this economy. If we do not \nhave the far right of the Republican Party taking America's country \nhostage, we will continue to grow this economy. But if they play games \nand try to shut down this government, it could all turn around. If they \nplay games and they try to default on the debt, they could turn it all \naround in a bad way, and we will see the results as Social Security \nrecipients start to worry, as Medicare receipts start to worry, as \ncontractors start to worry, as Federal FBI agents can no longer get \npaid--it goes on and on and on.\n  One of the reasons they are so crazed is they are obsessed over the \nAffordable Care Act, which they call ObamaCare. In my time, I want to \ntell you what the Affordable Care Act does and see whether you think it \nis worth shutting down the government over this bill. They tried it 41 \ntimes, but they hope 42 will be their winner. Over 1 million \nCalifornians--this is just in my State--are already newly insured. \nThree million young adults are now insured on their parents' plans--3 \nmillion are now insured, 400,000 in my State. Now 71 million Americans \nare getting free preventive care, such as checkups and birth control \nand immunizations. They do not like that, I guess. They are willing to \nshut the government down over it. Now 17 million kids with preexisting \nconditions, such as asthma, can no longer be denied coverage. Insurance \ncompanies cannot cancel your health insurance because you get sick. \nThere are no more lifetime limits on coverage. Anyone who has had a \ncatastrophic disease knows it is pretty easy to hit that cap. No more \ncaps in a year. No more lifetime caps. This is what they are so \nobsessed about. So they are willing to shut down the government to take \naway these benefits.\n  They said: Oh, health care costs are going to go up because of the \nAffordable Care Act. Well, guess what, health care costs are growing at \nthe slowest rate in over 50 years. Insurance companies now have to \njustify their premium hikes. Before, they just hiked your rates and \nthey could do it with impunity. Now, insurers have to spend at least 80 \npercent of your premiums on your medical care, not on overhead. They \ncannot pocket the money; they have to spend it on health care. Also, \n8.5 million Americans have received rebate checks from their insurance \ncompany because they were overcharged. Is that what the Republicans are \nso upset about? They are willing to shut down the government to take \naway these benefits from the people.\n  Insurance companies cannot deny coverage or charge more for \npreexisting conditions. They cannot charge women more than men. There \nis no more discrimination. Again, in a single year, they cannot impose \ndollar limits on you.\n  The Republicans are upset about the deficit. The deficit has been cut \nin half.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The House has voted 41 times to defund the Affordable \nCare Act. They took it all the way to the Supreme Court, the Republican \nattorneys general. They lost. They made it a centerpiece of the 2012 \nelection. They lost the Presidential election. Now they are willing to \nshut down the government unless they get their way.\n  So I would conclude by asking some rhetorical questions.\n  Why are the Republicans obsessed with kicking young people off their \nparents' insurance?\n  Why are the Republicans so obsessed with stopping preventive care, \nsuch as checkups and birth control and immunizations?\n  Why are Republicans so obsessed with repealing benefits that \nguarantee insurance coverage for children and adults with preexisting \nconditions?\n  Why are they so obsessed with stopping 13 million people from getting \ninsurance who never had the chance before?\n  Why are they so obsessed with stopping 24 million people from getting \ninsurance under the new State health exchanges?\n  Why are they so obsessed with repealing a law that prevents insurance \ncompanies from canceling an insurance policy when someone gets sick? \nWhy are they obsessed that we are stopping that practice?\n  Why are they so obsessed when we say you can no longer have an annual \ndollar limit on benefits?\n  Why are they so obsessed with repealing a law that says to an \ninsurance company: You cannot have a lifetime limit on benefits.\n  Why are they so obsessed with repealing a law that finally stops \ndiscrimination against women? You know, being a woman was considered a \npreexisting condition. Honestly. You would have to pay twice as much as \na man for your health care. If you were a victim of some kind of \nspousal abuse, that was considered a preexisting condition and your \npayments went up or maybe you never even got insurance.\n  I have to that say finally, why are they so obsessed with doing away \nwith the Affordable Care Act when CBO--the Congressional Budget \nOffice--says it will save $109 billion over 10 years and over $1 \ntrillion the following decade?\n  I cannot answer these questions. All I can think is that it is \npolitics. It is politics. I have been here a long time. I am proud of \nit. I thank my people in California for allowing me to have this honor. \nThere were many laws I did not like, believe me. I have served with \nfive Presidents. I did not agree with quite a few of them--two or \nthree--but when I lost a battle, I did not try to shut down the \ngovernment. When I lost a battle, I did not say: We cannot pay our \ndebts. Oh, maybe I voted once or twice as a symbolic vote, but I knew \nthe votes were there.\n  So I would say to my friends, get over your obsession and proceed \nwith your responsibilities to keep this government open. Forget about \nrepealing a health care law that is about to kick in that is good for \nthe people and pay your debts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                         Tribute to Tom Lamont\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to thank a good friend for his \nservice to our Nation, America's soldiers, and their families. Tom \nLamont of Springfield, IL, is retiring this week as Assistant Secretary \nof the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs, the Army's top personnel \nofficer. It is a post Tom has held for more than 4 years. These were \nnot 4 ordinary years; they were 4 of the most challenging in the Army's \nmodern history. The list of challenges Tom Lamont faced from day one \nwas daunting. At the top of his list, he had to help coordinate the \ndrawdown of U.S. troops from Iraq. At the same time he had to support a \nsurge of troops in Afghanistan and then help the return home of those \nsame troops. He also had to address many of the most important issues \nfacing the military and our Army today, including post-traumatic \nstress, traumatic brain injuries, sexual assault in the military, and \nthe disturbingly high incidence of suicide among Active-Duty soldiers \nand veterans.\n  I was proud to introduce Tom Lamont at his confirmation hearing \nbefore the Senate Armed Services Committee 4 years ago. I said then \nthat with the tremendous strain the war in Iraq and Afghanistan had \ncreated for soldiers and their families, the Army needed a leader like \nTom Lamont.\n  As he prepares to complete his mission in the Pentagon, I am proud \nbut not at all surprised that Tom was every bit the leader our Army \nneeded. In the time of this historic challenge for the Army, Assistant \nSecretary Thomas Lamont has consistently risen to the challenge. He \nmade clear from the start that his No. 1 priority was the well-being of \nAmerica's soldiers and their families, especially those coping with \nmultiple deployments.\n  He also supervised the development of the Army's first Total Force \nPolicy--a new policy that integrates the Active Duty, Guard, and \nReserve components of the Army into a single, effective, unified force. \nIt was signed by Secretary of the Army John McHugh just last September. \nThe new Total Force Policy reflects a fundamental fact that, as decades \nof war in Iraq and Afghanistan have demonstrated, our Army Guard, and \nReserve are now as integral to the fight as the Active-\n\n[[Page S6579]]\n\nDuty component and we are not going back. Very few people could bring \nto that task the experience and personal commitment that Tom Lamont \ndid.\n  Assistant Secretary Lamont also oversaw a review of the Army's \nIntegrated Disability Evaluation System. The IDES system is a \npartnership between the Defense Department and the Department of \nVeterans Affairs. It is used to evaluate the wounded, ill or injured \nservicemembers, to determine whether they are fit for duty, and if not, \nwhat disability rating or benefits they receive. Thanks to Tom's focus, \nthe Army's IDES wait times are down more than 40 percent, and the \nprocess is more consistent and less adversarial. We need to cut back on \nthat backlog even further, and we will. Tom Lamont's leadership over \nthe last 4 years has made a real difference in reducing the so-called \nbenefits gap for servicemembers transitioning to civilian life.\n  One reason Tom has been such an effective Assistant Secretary of the \nArmy is the respect he brought to this position for the sacrifices made \nby all soldiers, whether they are Active Duty, Guard, or Reserve. That \nrespect is something Tom learned during his 25 years as a judge \nadvocate general in the Illinois National Guard. He retired from the \nGuard with the rank of colonel in 2007. His years of experience in the \nIllinois Army National Guard gave Tom Lamont a deep understanding of \nthe needs of the Army.\n  Tom is also a respected attorney in our hometown of Springfield, IL, \nand a former partner in two distinguished law firms. One of those \nfirms, the Springfield firm of Brown, Hay & Stephens, is the oldest law \npractice in Illinois. From 1837 to 1841, it employed a young lawyer by \nthe name of Abraham Lincoln. Later, in his second inaugural address, \nPresident Lincoln spoke of the solemn obligation of any nation that has \nbeen through a war. He said we have a moral responsibility ``to bind up \nthe nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle \nand for his widow and orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a \njust and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.'' Tom \nLamont has kept faith with that moral responsibility Abraham Lincoln \nspoke to.\n  Tom Lamont has also served the people of Illinois in many important \npositions: executive Director of the Office of the State Attorney \nAppellate Prosecutor, director of civil litigation in the Office of the \nIllinois Attorney General, executive director of the Illinois Board of \nHigher Education, special counsel to the University of Illinois, and \nmember of the Senate Judicial Nomination Commission.\n  A while back, GEN Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, gave a speech in which he described the historic challenges \nfacing the U.S. Armed Forces. He said in those remarks that ``if we \ndon't get the people right, the rest of it won't matter.'' He went on \nto say, ``We might get the equipment right, the organizational design \nright, modernization right, but if we don't get the people right, we're \ngoing to put the country at risk.''\n  When President Obama nominated Tom Lamont to be Assistant Secretary \nof the Army, he got the people right. His service these last 4 years \nleaves our Army stronger and better prepared for what lies ahead.\n  In closing, I wish to thank Tom for his extraordinary record of \npublic service.\n  Tom and his wife Bridget are good friends of Loretta's and mine. I \nknow better than most the personal sacrifices both have made so Tom \ncould serve this President in the U.S. Army and the Nation he loves. I \nwish Tom and Bridget the best in life's next challenge.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask for 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I wish to salute my colleague from California Senator \nBoxer. The statement she made before I spoke summarized what we face: \nPeople say to me are we really going to shut down the Federal \nGovernment? Is that what we were elected to come here to do, to reach \nan agreement between the parties, between the House and the Senate, to \nshut down the government and cut off the basic services of the \nGovernment of the United States of America, the leading Nation in the \nworld when it comes to striving for social justice as well as peace? \nAre you going to shut down the government? Is that the best you can do \nin this Congress?\n  The answer is it is not worthy of this great institution or this \ngreat Nation for us to entertain the thought of shutting down this \ngovernment or, even worse, to default on America's debt for the first \ntime in our history.\n  People don't understand this term ``debt ceiling.'' Let me explain \nit. Do you have a mortgage on your home? What would happen if you \ndidn't make a payment next month? Oh, you might get by with it, but by \nthe second month there would be a knock on the door, a call, or an e-\nmail. They would be saying to you: You missed your payment, and if you \nwant to stay in this house you better make it.\n  Even if you made that payment, the next time you negotiate a \nmortgage, someone will remember you defaulted, you failed to pay your \nmortgage, and you are likely to pay a higher mortgage rate.\n  Translate that into the United States of America. If we don't pay our \nmortgage, if we don't lift the debt ceiling to reflect spending that \nthis Congress has already engaged in by both political parties, we will \nhave defaulted on America's debt for the first time in history. We may \nget through it. I am sure we will. But at the end of the day what will \nhappen is the interest rate paid by Americans to borrow money will go \nup. It means that $1 sent to Washington in taxes will no longer buy $1 \nworth of goods and services. No. It will buy less because more of that \nis to be paid in interest to someone loaning money to the United \nStates. Golly, it is an awful outcome. I wish we could avoid it.\n  The answer is we can avoid it. The default on America's debt, the \nfailure to extend the debt ceiling, is a self-imposed crisis generated, \nsadly, by the majority in the House of Representatives who happen to \nbelieve this is good politics. The American people will rally to the \nnotion that we are going to default on our debt for the first time and \nwe are going to stop funding the government.\n  What a glorious day for this great Nation, closing the doors of our \ngovernment in every single agency, virtually every single agency, and \ndefaulting on our debt for the first time in history.\n  If that is what the tea party Republicans think is leadership, God \nsave the United States of America. We need leadership where Democrats \nand Republicans sit down and act as adults, not as squealing political \npigs trying to get attention. We need to basically sit down, both \npolitical parties, and solve this problem.\n  I have been waiting patiently, watching. We have asked for a budget \nconference committee to work out our differences. Time and again we \nhave come to the floor over the last 6 months and said Senator Murray's \nbudget which passed the Senate is ready to be negotiated with the \nHouse. Consistently, four Senators on the Republican side of the aisle \nhave taken turns standing up and objecting to working out our \ndifferences and coming up with an agreement on how much we will spend. \nThat is not how you should govern this Nation. I don't believe that is \nhow you should serve in the Senate.\n  The latest excuse--and I won't go into detail--is, of course, \nRepublicans have said: Of course, we have to shut down the government \nand we have to default on our debt for the first time in history to \nstop ObamaCare.\n  Senator Boxer went through the details of what ObamaCare means to \nmillions of families and the opportunity for health insurance for the \nfirst time for many of them in their entire lives. It is working, and I \nthink that is what infuriates many Republicans the most.\n  We can fix it, it can be better, and we should do it. But to bring \nthis government to a halt and to default on our debt over this question \nof a bill that passed over 3 years ago and is the law of the land, \nfound constitutional by the Supreme Court, is the height of \nirresponsibility.\n  The American people have a right to be angry with Congress, but \nplease take a moment and realize that this desperate, awful strategy is \ninspired by one political party, which thinks that\n\n[[Page S6580]]\n\nsomehow this is going to appeal to the American people. I don't believe \nit will. The American people are too smart to fall for that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I sat through the speech given by the \njunior Senator of California. I have a long list of things with which I \ndisagree and I am going to get to as many of those as I can in a \nminute. I feel an obligation to make a statement about some important \npolicy issues that nobody talks about, certainly not partisan in any \nway. I wish to get that out of the way first and then I will have time, \non the time that I have been given, to go back and cover as many of the \nissues that were misrepresented by my good friend, the junior Senator \nfrom California.\n\n\n                               Sri Lanka\n\n  I wish to encourage the Obama administration to review its current \npolicies regarding the country of Sri Lanka and seek further engagement \nto assist them as they continue their progress toward reconciliation \nand reconstruction after 30 years of a bloody civil war against the \nTamil Tiger terrorists.\n  Just 4 years ago Sri Lanka defeated the Tamil terrorists and is \ncurrently recovering from economic, political, and social upheaval \ncaused by this destructive civil war. I think there are a lot of people \nwho didn't expect this to happen with this new administration, but it \nis. Good things have happened. Peace has brought historic postconflict \nrecovery and Sri Lanka is bringing the dividends of peace in an \nexclusive manner, particularly to those in the north and to the east of \nthe country, from where Tamil suicide bombers and other terrorist \nattacks were once launched.\n  Specifically, since the war ended, those two areas have seen an \neconomic growth of 22 percent compared to an average of 7.5 percent for \nthe rest of the country.\n  Sri Lanka has removed half a million antipersonnel mines, resettled \n300,000 internally displaced people, and reestablished vital social \nservices in the areas of health and education.\n  It is also conducting local elections in the formerly Tamil-\ncontrolled north on the 21st of September. I see this as an important \nstep toward political reconciliation. Such processes take time, as we \nlearned from our own Civil War.\n  It seems to me that Sri Lanka is developing into a key economy, both \nin its own right and as a gateway to India. A lot of people don't know \nwhere Sri Lanka is. It is that little island at the bottom of India and \nthat part of the world.\n  Sri Lanka's geostrategic location, the deepwater ports, could be \nvital to the long-term financial and national security interests of the \nUnited States. We want them on our side. Some 50 percent of all \ncontainer traffic, for example, and 70 percent of the world's energy \nsupplies pass within sight of Sri Lanka's coast.\n  U.S. diplomatic efforts there, however, have lagged. As a result, I \nbelieve our long-term economic and national security interests are \nsuffering. At a time when the United States is pivoting or rebalancing \ntoward Asia, we may be giving this island nation reason not to consider \nthe United States a friend and strategic partner.\n  Understandably, the policies of the United States toward Sri Lanka \nhave focused on accountability for what happened during the last phases \nof the civil war, as well as on steps toward political reconciliation \nand respect for human rights. While these aspects are very important \nand deserving of support, I also believe there is the opportunity to \nengage in a wider simultaneous approach that also takes into account \neconomic and national security consideration. Maybe this wider, dual-\ntrack approach would have a positive influence overall and make up for \nlost ground.\n  I have expressed these views in letters to both Secretary Kerry and \nSecretary Hagel in recent months. While both of them agree with me \nabout Sri Lanka and its economic and geostrategic importance to the \nUnited States, both still point to the lack of political transparency \nand poor human rights record to reject a review of the administration's \nposition, which restricts military-to-military relations and foreign \nassistance funding.\n  I take Secretary Kerry and Secretary Hagel at their word and believe \nthe upcoming September 21 provincial council elections in the north can \nbe a meaningful act of political reconciliation that would be between \nthe Sinhala majority and the Tamil minorities. If they are conducted in \na free and fair manner, free of human rights violations, I will \nstrongly renew my request to the administration to reassess our current \npolicies toward Sri Lanka.\n  I know it is a little bit controversial, but we have watched what has \nhappened over the years. We have watched the civil war. Then when you \nconsider the very strategic location of Sri Lanka, it is very \nimportant, in my view, that we establish these relationships and \nrecognize them.\n  Let me mention a few things I took issue with. Some of them I had a \nhard time understanding what the junior Senator from California was \ntalking about when she was singing the praises of this administration.\n  First, I agreed with her on the tragedy at the Navy Yard. I have been \ndown there many times. I was envisioning as I was coming from Tulsa up \nhere on Monday--at that time they said Ronald Reagan Airport was going \nto be closed. They thought it was going to be closed down because of \nthe proximity to the Navy Yard. It didn't turn out that way and we \nended up landing there.\n  When I went down and I saw the scene, which I have seen many times \nbefore, and I looked at it, it was gut-wrenching to think that one \nderanged person could do this. We saw it before in Waco. We have seen \nit in Boston. We have seen it in other places. It is something that I \nassume is going to be with us. I don't know how it can be precluded.\n  I will say this, though. I fully expected several of my liberal \nfriends would use that to try to come up with an excuse for more \nstringent gun regulations. I would only suggest that the District of \nColumbia has the most stringent anti-Second Amendment gun control laws \nanywhere in the country, and that is where this took place. You can't \nsay this has anything to do with it, but I knew it was going to happen.\n  Another thing my friend talked about was the debt, all of this, \ntalking about the other administrations. I would only remind you, this \nis something that is incontrovertible, the amount of debt this \nPresident has had up to today. He has increased our deficit by $6.1 \ntrillion, which is more than all of the other Presidents from George \nWashington on up through recent administrations combined. You wonder \nwhere is all of that money, where did it all go? It went to his social \nprograms.\n  My major concern--the Presiding Officer may have heard I was making \nquite an issue out of the fact the President wanted to send cruise \nmissiles into Syria. I don't think there is anyone naive enough to \nbelieve you can do that and not have repercussions.\n  We have heard from Iran, which I consider to be the greatest threat \nto the United States, in that our intelligence has told us since 2007 \nIran would have the nuclear weapon and the delivery system in place by \n2015. That is a year and a half from now. Yes, it is something where we \nwould be going in.\n  However, in the disarming of America, as I have referred to, I \nremember going to Afghanistan 4\\1/2\\ years ago. It was after the \nPresident's first budget. I went there because I knew what was going to \nhappen to the military in spite of all this spending that has given us \nnew debt, $6.1 trillion. Where did it go? I can tell you a lot of \nplaces where it didn't go. It didn't go to defending America.\n  I went over there. In that very first budget the President had, the \nfirst thing he did was do away with our only fifth-generation fighter, \nthe F-22. He did away with our lift capability, the C-17. He did away \nwith our future combat system, the only advancement of ground \ncapability in some 60 years. He did away with the ground-based \ninterceptor in Poland, which now puts us in a position where we are \nhustling all over trying to figure out where we can get a third site to \nprotect the United States of America against a missile coming in from \nthe East. We have 33 of them out there but they are all on the west \ncoast. That doesn't help us here.\n  On top of that, this administration, in its extended budget, has \ntaken now already $487 billion out of our defense\n\n[[Page S6581]]\n\nbudget and is talking about another $\\1/2\\ trillion through his \nsequestration.\n  I know nobody believes this, and that is why none of the Members on \nthis floor will talk about it, but this disarming of America puts us in \na very serious situation.\n  The junior Senator from California was praising this President and \nall of the things she felt he has been doing, but it is time to hear \nthe truth. She was praising him on ObamaCare and how wonderful this is \nand how thankful everyone is. Why is it the most recent polling showed \n88 percent of the people in America want to do away with the individual \nmandate, and the vast majority of them say it is a bad idea? Those are \nthe words they use. So it is not working.\n  I can remember back when we were going to have Hillary health care, \nback during the Clinton administration, and we asked the question--and \nyou can ask any liberal who wants to get to a single-payer system or \nultimately have socialized medicine, which I think will be down the \nroad in the vision of this administration--if this hasn't worked in \nGreat Britain, it hasn't worked in Denmark and it hasn't worked in \nCanada, why would it work here? They will never tell you this, but they \nwere saying if they were running it, it would work here.\n  Anyway, this is something that is not popular, as was misrepresented \nby the junior Senator from California. Then she said: ``The news is \ngreat coming out of Detroit.'' That is fine, except they filed \nbankruptcy last week.\n  So when we hear all the things that are stated, just keep in mind \nthis is still America, we still have certain values that have been \ncompletely reversed by this administration, and it is time to keep that \nin mind and to move on ahead.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to talk about two \noverarching issues that are confronting the Senate and the House at the \nsame time. Both, unfortunately in this circumstance, are directly \nrelated. Normally, we would talk about these two issues separate and \napart.\n  First of all, the Affordable Care Act and what that means for the \ncountry, what it means for families, the impact it is having now in a \nvery positive way but also what it means for those families in the \nfuture and also the concerns I have about what a small group, but a \nvery powerful group in the Congress, want to do that I would argue \nwould adversely impact the economy.\n  Let me talk first about the Affordable Care Act. I was a strong \nsupporter, worked hard for its passage, and will continue to work hard \non the implementation. We have seen in the last couple of years, since \nimplementation began in 2010, continued in 2011, 2012, and 2013, the \nbenefits the Affordable Care Act have brought to this country. We have \nalso seen where we have had to make changes, where we have had to come \ntogether, often in a bipartisan manner, to make changes to the \nlegislation to make it work. There will be plenty of other changes in \nthe future, but the worst thing we could do right now is to pretend, as \nsome in this body and in the other body do as well, that nothing has \nchanged for the better for families.\n  Let me give a couple of examples. I will use Pennsylvania examples, \nbut of course in every one of these there is a national number that \ncorresponds to the State-by-State numbers.\n  Consider this: In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 222,703 \nPennsylvania seniors saved money on prescription drugs directly as a \nresult of the Affordable Care Act. Health care reform provides seniors \nwho hit the so-called doughnut hole with more than a 50-percent \ndiscount on brand name drugs. Already, just in Pennsylvania, that many \nseniors have had some measure of support when they got into that \ndoughnut hole. That is a very nice way of saying a coverage gap, where \nthey have to come up with the dollars for prescription drugs. I \nmentioned the number of 222,000 seniors in Pennsylvania who have \nalready saved $168 million on prescription drugs directly as a result \nof this legislation. So if you are for repealing this, you have to tell \nus how you are going to help those 222,703 Pennsylvanians with their \nprescription drug coverage if you want to take away that benefit.\n  Two more examples. I will not go through all of these. There are \n5,489,162 Pennsylvanians with preexisting conditions who will no longer \nhave to worry about being denied coverage. That part of the \nlegislation, as the Presiding Officer knows so well, is an enlargement \nof what we had before. What we had in the first couple years of \nimplementation was a legal prohibition that a child who had a \npreexisting condition would not be denied coverage. Imagine where we \nwere before this legislation. The Federal Government and the Nation \nwere saying to those families: We know your child has coverage, we know \nyou are paying the premium for that child, we know that technically \nyour child has some kind of health insurance coverage, but if that \nchild has a preexisting condition, he or she does not get covered.\n  That was the prevailing policy before the Affordable Care Act was \npassed. What we said in the act was that is unacceptable. The United \nStates is not going to say any longer to a family: If your child has a \npreexisting condition he or she will be denied coverage and treatment. \nWe wiped that out by virtue of passage of the act and then \nimplementation.\n  Now we are saying, as implementation proceeds in 2014, that same kind \nof coverage for preexisting conditions will apply to adults as well. We \ncouldn't afford to do it right away, but now we are able to move in \nthat direction. Imagine what happens upon repeal, if we repeal the \nAffordable Care Act, if we go back to the old and, I would argue, very \ndark days, where children and adults with preexisting conditions don't \nget the coverage they need and surely deserve.\n  What kind of a country are we if we say a child whose parents have \nhealth insurance and have been paying premiums should not be covered or \ntreated because an insurance company says they are not entitled to \ncoverage? If we repeal the bill, we are going back to those days. \nWhether it is a child or an adult, the least we can do is say we will \nhave a health insurance system in the United States where if you are \npaying your premiums, you will be given the coverage you are paying for \nand that you are entitled to. We couldn't say that before the passage \nof this act.\n  So repeal of the Affordable Care Act means preexisting conditions are \nno longer covered.\n  I haven't heard a lot from the other side about how they would \nachieve that. Maybe they will. Maybe they will come up with a plan to \ndo that.\n  Finally, this is the third example. There are 91,000 young \nPennsylvanians who have been able to find health care coverage. Under \nthe act, young adults, ages 19 to 25, are able to stay on their \nparents' plan in order to maintain coverage.\n  A lot of families out there had a lot of worry and, frankly, a lot of \nfinancial burden but especially the anxiety of knowing a young person \nwho may have been in college for years--maybe they had a 2-year college \nor 4-year education, but somewhere in that time period of being in \ncollege, roughly that age and after college up through age 25--had no \ncoverage. This has solved that problem. Imagine the numbers across the \ncountry.\n  In both of these instances--young people having coverage on their \nparents' plans and children being covered for preexisting conditions--\nwe are talking in the tens of millions of Americans, children and young \nadults.\n  Those are just three examples--seniors getting help with their \nprescription drug coverage, which they never got before at this level \nof protection and help; children with preexisting conditions, now \nadults; and then, thirdly, young people across the country.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a summary \nentitled ``The Affordable Care Act Is Providing Stability and Security \nfor Middle-Class Pennsylvanians.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nThe Affordable Care Act Is Providing Stability and Security for Middle-\n                          Class Pennsylvanians\n\n       The Affordable Care Act is providing middle-class families \n     with stability and security. Instead of refighting old \n     political battles over health care, Republicans should work \n     with us to improve the law, help make sure people are aware \n     of and take advantage of its benefits, and strengthen the \n     economy.\n\n[[Page S6582]]\n\n     Republicans want to go back to the days when insurance \n     companies were in charge and could deny coverage to children \n     with pre-existing conditions, charge women more than men, and \n     run up premiums.\n\n\n              Providing Benefits for Pennsylvania Seniors\n\n       222,703 Pennsylvania seniors saved money on prescription \n     drugs. Health reform provides seniors who hit the so-called \n     ``donut hole'' with a more than 50% discount on brand name \n     drugs. Seniors will receive larger discounts each year until \n     the ``donut hole'' closes completely in 2020. 222,703 \n     Pennsylvania seniors have saved $168 million on prescription \n     drugs under health reform, for an average savings of $753.\n       1,034,635 Pennsylvania seniors have received free \n     preventive health services. As a result of health reform, \n     seniors have access to free preventive health services such \n     as cancer screening, diabetes screening, and annual wellness \n     visits.\n\n\n  Providing Stable and Secure Coverage for Middle-Class Pennsylvanians\n\n       5,489,162 Pennsylvanians with pre-existing conditions will \n     no longer have to worry about being denied coverage. Under \n     the Affordable Care Act (ACA), insurance companies are \n     already barred from denying coverage to children with pre-\n     existing conditions. Starting in 2014, that protection will \n     be afforded to all Americans, ensuring that those with \n     conditions like cancer, diabetes, asthma, or heart disease \n     will not be denied coverage or charged higher premiums. \n     5,489,162 non-elderly Pennsylvanians have been diagnosed with \n     a preexisting condition.\n       91,000 young Pennsylvanians have been able to find health \n     coverage. Under the ACA, young adults aged 19-25 are able to \n     stay on their parents' plan in order to maintain coverage.\n       3,151,000 Pennsylvanians have received free preventive \n     health services. The Affordable Care Act ensures that most \n     insurance plans provide recommended health services like \n     colonoscopies, Pap smears, mammograms, and well-child visits \n     without cost-sharing or out of pocket costs. 3,151,000 \n     Pennsylvanians have benefited from these services, including \n     1,218,000 women and 761,000 children.\n       4,582,000 Pennsylvanians no longer have to worry about \n     lifetime or annual limits on coverage. Under the ACA, \n     insurance companies can no longer deny coverage to those who \n     need it most by imposing arbitrary lifetime or annual dollar \n     limits on coverage.\n\n\n           Making Pennsylvanians Health Care More Affordable\n\n       123,581 Pennsylvanians have received rebates and greater \n     value from their health insurance. Under the ACA, Americans \n     get greater value from their health insurance. Insurance \n     companies are required to spend at least 80 cents of every \n     dollar paid in premiums on health care as opposed to \n     administrative expenses, executive salaries, or padding their \n     profits. For every dollar spent above that limit, they are \n     required to give rebates back to the American people. Last \n     year, 123,581 Pennsylvanians received an average rebate of \n     $77 for a total of $6,875,277.\n       Pennsylvania has received $5,312,084 in lower premium \n     increases. Because of the ACA, for the first time, insurance \n     companies are required to publicly justify their actions if \n     they want to raise rates by 10% or more. As a result of this \n     effort to fight unreasonable premium hikes, Pennsylvania has \n     received $5,312,084.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. There is a lot more we could talk about, but we don't have \ntime. I will not go into the national numbers because I know others \nhave done that, but these are just some of the examples of what this \nlegislation has meant.\n  The act is not perfect. No act that has been passed by this Senate \nhas ever been perfect, especially something as challenging as health \ncare, and we will make changes to make it work. But the worst thing we \ncould do is for the Senate to turn its back on children and say: You \ndon't deserve to have coverage if you have a preexisting condition or \nturn our back on older citizens who fought our wars, worked in our \nfactories, taught our children, gave us a middle class, and gave us and \nyounger generations life and love and helped us in so many ways and say \nto them: You know what. You can be on your own when it comes to \nprescription drug coverage.\n  That is the Affordable Care Act. But unfortunately this isn't just a \ndebate about the act. Now we are getting into a debate about some \npeople in Washington wanting to use the Affordable Care Act as a \npolitical weapon in other contexts. They say if they do not have a \nrepeal of or a defunding of the Affordable Care Act, that somehow they \nthink a government shutdown would be the right way to go or that we \nwould default on our obligations.\n  Of course, I and many others don't believe that is the right way to \ngo; in essence, in the case of the debt limit, holding the debt limit \nhostage to a relitigation of the Affordable Care Act. That is dangerous \nfor the economy, but I think it is also very bad for those families I \njust mentioned.\n  This debt limit crisis that is ahead of us, just as the end of the \nfiscal year crisis is ahead of us, is manufactured. We don't need to \nhave a crisis on the debt ceiling, but it is being manufactured to make \na political point by some in Washington. Not all Republicans agree with \nthis, certainly not around the country but even here in Washington. But \nsome seem to believe this is the right way to go.\n  This is the kind of edge-of-the-cliff brinkmanship we saw in 2011, \nwhich had a substantial--and I think this is irrefutable--adverse \nimpact on the economy. The Dow dropped 2,000 points because of the last \ndebt ceiling debate, a debate which resulted in us getting an agreement \nat the very last minute, not going over the deadline. But some \napparently think it is a good idea to default on our obligations for \nthe first time since 1789.\n  What does that mean for most Americans? If we have the Dow drop 2,000 \npoints or maybe lower, if we actually go over the deadline, it means a \nloss of savings for Americans. It may not affect people in the Senate \nwho are wealthy or people in the Senate who have job security and \nhealth care security and everything else, but it will hurt a lot of \nAmericans, and it will crater the savings of Americans if that happens.\n  An adverse credit rating, another adverse consequence, means more \nexpensive credit for everyone. It translates into higher costs for \nhousing, education, and other critical household expenses. Local \ngovernments would also bear the burden of a lower credit rating--a drop \nin the credit rating of the United States--which makes every project \nthat much more difficult and expensive.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a Wall Street \nJournal op-ed entitled ``Uncertainty Is the Enemy of Recovery,'' dated \nApril 28, 2013, and written by Bill McNabb, the CEO of Vanguard.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 28, 2013]\n\n                  Uncertainty Is the Enemy of Recovery\n\n                            (By Bill McNabb)\n\n       Anyone hoping for signs of a healthy economic recovery was \n     disappointed by lower-than-expected GDP growth for the first \n     quarter of 2013--a mere 2.5%, far short of the forecast 3.2%. \n     Meanwhile, the stock market continues to soar, hitting record \n     levels in recent weeks. It's a striking disconnect, and one \n     that is discouraging and confusing for Americans as they seek \n     to earn a living and save for the future.\n       Companies and small businesses are also dealing with the \n     same paradox. Many are in good shape and have money to spend. \n     So why aren't they pumping more capital back into the \n     economy, creating jobs and fueling the country's economic \n     engine?\n       Quite simply, if firms can't see a clear road to economic \n     recovery ahead, they're not going to hire and they're not \n     going to spend. It's what economists call a ``deadweight \n     loss''--loss caused by inefficiency.''\n       Today, there is uncertainty about regulatory policy, \n     uncertainty about monetary policy, uncertainty about foreign \n     policy and, most significantly, uncertainty about U.S. fiscal \n     policy and the national debt. Until a sensible plan is \n     created to address the debt, America will not fulfill its \n     economic potential.\n       Uncertainty comes with a very real and quantifiable price \n     tag--an uncertainty tax, so to speak. Over the past two \n     years, amid stalled debates in Washington and missed \n     opportunities to tackle the debt, the magnitude of this \n     uncertainty tax has gotten short shrift.\n       Three economists, Stanford University's Nicholas Bloom and \n     Scott Baker and the University of Chicago's Steven Davis, \n     have done invaluable work measuring the level of policy \n     uncertainty over the past few decades. Their research \n     (available at policyuncertainty.com) shows that, on average, \n     U.S. economic policy uncertainty has been 50% higher in the \n     past two years than it has been since 1985.\n       Based on that research, our economists at Vanguard isolated \n     changes in the U.S. economy that we determined were \n     specifically due to increases in policy uncertainty, such as \n     the debt-ceiling debacle in August 2011, the congressional \n     supercommittee failure in November 2011, and the fiscal-cliff \n     crisis at the end of 2012. This gave us a picture of what the \n     economy might look like if the shocks from policy uncertainty \n     had not occurred.\n       We estimate that since 2011 the rise in overall policy \n     uncertainty has created a $261 billion cumulative drag on the \n     economy (the equivalent of more than $800 per person in the \n     country). Without this uncertainty tax, real U.S. GDP could \n     have grown an average 3% per year since 2011, instead of the \n     recorded 2% average in fiscal years 2011-12. In\n\n[[Page S6583]]\n\n     addition, the U.S. labor market would have added roughly \n     45,000 more jobs per month over the past two years. That adds \n     up to more than one million jobs that we could have had by \n     now, but don't.\n       At Vanguard we estimate that the spike in policy \n     uncertainty surrounding the debt-ceiling debate alone has \n     resulted in a cumulative economic loss of $112 billion over \n     the past two years. To put that figure in perspective, the \n     Congressional Budget Office estimates that sequestration may \n     reduce total funding by $85 billion in 2013. Clearly, the \n     U.S. debt situation is the economic issue of our generation.\n       But it's not just about the numbers. Every time lawmakers \n     seemingly get close to a deal that will restore fiscal \n     responsibility but instead fail, we at Vanguard hear the \n     concerns of investors. They ask: How does this affect my \n     retirement fund? What about my college savings account? How \n     does this affect my taxes? Would I be better off putting my \n     savings under the mattress?\n       Investor anxiety is a critical component in all of this. \n     We'd be foolish to take comfort in the strength of recent \n     stock-market performance. Until the U.S. debt issue is \n     resolved for the long term, market gains and losses will be \n     built on an unstable foundation of promises that cannot be \n     kept.\n       Developing a credible, long-term solution to the country's \n     staggering debt is the biggest collective challenge right \n     now. It should be America's biggest collective priority, too. \n     Any comprehensive deficit reduction must take on the \n     imbalance between revenues and expenditures as a share of \n     GDP. That means entitlement reforms, spending reductions and \n     additional tax revenues.\n       This does not have to be about European-style ``instant \n     austerity.'' Because the U.S. dollar is the world's reserve \n     currency, America doesn't have to balance the budget \n     tomorrow.\n       The key is to provide clarity to businesses, financial \n     markets and everyday savers and investors. Make no mistake: A \n     comprehensive, long-term, binding plan that brings the budget \n     into balance over a reasonable time frame is essential. If \n     Washington fails to achieve one, the consequences will be \n     harsh.\n       The good news is that if reform is enacted, and the costly \n     pall of uncertainty is lifted, the U.S. economy has the \n     potential to bounce back, creating the growth and jobs that \n     are so badly needed. I am confident that our leaders in \n     Washington can make it happen.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. I will not read the article, but I was certainly struck by \nit. Obviously, the author talks about this problem of uncertainty and \nwhat it causes. In support of his op-ed he mentioned the work done by \ntwo economists in measuring and calculating the cost of this \nuncertainty.\n  Here is what they concluded just as it relates to the uncertainty \nthat results from a debt ceiling battle:\n\n       At Vanguard we estimate that the spike in policy \n     uncertainty surrounding the debt-ceiling debate alone has \n     resulted in a cumulative economic loss of $112 billion over \n     the past two years.\n\n  This is what Bill McNabb, who is someone who knows something about \nmarkets and related issues, said in April of this year.\n  So there is a 2-year impact of $112 billion because of a politically \nmotivated and manufactured crisis, because some people want to make a \npolitical statement about the debt ceiling, which puts the economy at \nrisk. I hope that some folks come to their senses because we can have \nand should have debates about reducing spending in a bipartisan \nfashion, how to reduce spending the way a business does, how to reduce \nspending the way a family does. But does it make any sense to do this \nkind of high-wire act? This is very dangerous for the economy.\n  This isn't theoretical. We had a dry run, unfortunately. We had a \nrehearsal of this in 2011. We didn't go over the line, we didn't \ndefault, but we came very close. We came within days of defaulting. \nGetting close to that alone had an adverse impact on the economy.\n  So to say this is fiscally reckless is a vast understatement. I don't \nknow how to express it beyond saying that. To say that it is dangerous \nfor the economy, for jobs, for families, for the middle class, for \ncompanies all over the country; to say that to default on our \nobligations or coming close to that--playing with fire, in a sense--to \nsay that is dangerous is an understatement.\n  Here is what we should do: We should stop the games and the fiscal \nhigh-wire act, and we should focus on what middle-class families want.\n  When I go home to Pennsylvania, they say to me in a couple of short \nwords what they want me to do: Work together to create jobs. Work \ntogether to create the conditions for growth, whether that is tax \ncredits or tax policy, whether it is efforts to jump-start the economy.\n  One of the more depressing charts I have seen in 6 months or maybe \neven 6 years is a chart that was in the New York Times called ``A \nShifting Economic Tide,'' dated July 25, 2013. It depicts the change in \nincome from 1995. There is a long line going up and down with spikes \nand then the line going down. But the two most relevant numbers here \nare the comparison between the top 1 percent during the recession and \nthen in the recovery. The top 1 percent got hit pretty hard, as a lot \nof people did. Even the very wealthy got hit. They lost a little more \nthan 36 percent of their real income. But in the recovery, even though \nthey lost 36 percent, they are up plus-11 in the recovery. So they went \ndown by 36, but they are up plus-11. So they are still not back yet.\n  But what happened to the bottom 90 percent--not the top 1 percent, \nbut what happened to the bottom 90 percent in the recession and \nrecovery? According to this chart, the bottom 90 percent lost 12 \npercent of their real income, but they are still at minus 1.5. They \nhaven't even gotten to zero. They haven't even gotten to positive \nterritory yet when you compare their real income in the recession and \nthe hit they took and where they are today.\n  So what does that mean for us? It means that both parties have a lot \nof work to do. It means that both parties should be working together to \ncreate more jobs and create more economic certainty instead of playing \nthis game, which is dangerous, fiscally reckless for sure, and very \ndamaging to the economy and even the morale of the country. They want \nus to work together. They don't want us to play a games like some want \nto play here.\n  I appreciate the fact that we are having a debate about the \nAffordable Care Act. It is very important to have that debate and make \nsure we get the implementation right. But we should not be using the \nAffordable Care Act as a political weapon in these debates about our \nfiscal policy. I believe we can do that in a rational way as long as \npeople are willing to set aside their political ideology for a short \nperiod of time so we can resolve some of these issues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, what is the pending parliamentary \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. S. 1392 is pending.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Are there any amendments that need to be set aside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, there are not.\n\n\n                           Navy Yard Tragedy\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am going to speak from the heart--a \nheavy heart--because six Marylanders died at the Navy Yard on Monday.\n  I join with all Americans in expressing my deepest condolences to all \nof the families of those killed and injured in the Navy Yard shooting, \nand I particularly express my condolences to the Maryland families.\n  I also thank our first responders, including the local and Federal \nlaw enforcement officers who were first to arrive at the scene and took \ncontrol of this terrible, horrific situation. I thank the doctors and \nall the support staff at MedStar trauma center who worked so hard to \nhelp the injured and saved lives that day and every one of those who \nplayed such an important role in responding to that emergency.\n  My heart goes out to the victims and the families and to everyone who \nis mourning the loss of the men and women who died there. This has \ndeeply affected those of us in Maryland, as it has those in nearby \nVirginia and the District of Columbia. But for us in Maryland, this is \nwhom we mourn, a cluster of people, the dead, the shooting victims. \nThis is Maryland and Virginia--hands across the Potomac--and we just \ncan't believe it.\n  We think of Kenneth Bernard Proctor. He was 46 years old. He was a \ncivilian utilities foreman at the Navy Yard. He worked for the Federal \nGovernment for 20 years. He lived in Charles County and married his \nhigh school sweetheart in 1994. They have two boys, now teenagers. He \nloved his sons and the Redskins.\n  Then there was Sylvia Frasier, who was 52 years old. She was a \nresident of Maryland and one of seven children. She studied computer \ninformation systems at Strayer College. She received\n\n[[Page S6584]]\n\nan undergraduate and her master's degree in computer information \nsystems. She worked hard to get her education, and she wanted her \neducation to work hard for America. She had worked at the Navy Sea \nSystems Command since 2000, and she worked a few nights a week at \nWalmart as a customer service manager, helping her family, paying off \nstudent debt. Sylvia really was a remarkable person.\n  Then there is Frank Kohler. He was 50 years old. He lived in a \ncommunity called Tall Timbers, MD. And we certainly say that Frank was \na tall timber when it came to working for his country. He too was a \ncomputer specialist. He worked as a contractor for Lockheed Martin. He \nwas a graduate of Pennsylvania's Slippery Rock College, where he met \nhis wife Michelle. He was president of the Rotary Club and was honored \nfor his Rotary Club work. Down in southern Maryland, in St. Mary's \nCounty, they have an oyster festival that is coming up. He held the \ntitle ``King Oyster'' for his community service and organizing the \nRotary Club's annual festival to raise money for the much needed Rotary \nClub Challengers. He was a great family man and loved by many.\n  There is John Roger Johnson, who was a civilian employee for the Navy \nwho lived in Derwood, MD, for more than 30 years. He was the father of \nfour daughters and a loving grandfather. His 11th grandchild is due in \nNovember. Like so many who live in our community, he loved the \nRedskins. His neighbors described him as smart, always had a smile, and \nwas always there for his neighbors.\n  Then there is Vishnu Pandit, who was 61 years old. He came from India \nin his early twenties. He lived with his wife Anjali in North Potomac, \nMD. He was the father of two sons. He was well liked in his community \nand was known for helping people and particularly those who are part of \nthe Indian heritage community in Maryland. He was known for talking \nabout job opportunities, educational opportunities, and was a strong \nadvocate for them. He was proud of his heritage from his mother \ncountry, but he was proud of being a citizen of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Richard Michael Ridgell, 52 years old, was a father of three. This \nguy, though, was a Ravens fan. When the Ravens came into Baltimore at \nNo. 1, he bought season tickets and has owned them for the last 17 \nyears. He grew up in a community called Brooklyn, MD, but settled in \nCarroll County in Westminster. He was a Maryland State trooper before \nhe came to work in Federal service, a brave guy, and someone who really \nliked to protect and defend people in many ways.\n  Those are six of the 13 who died, and there are those who are \nrecovering. It is just a heavy heart we have. In the wake of yet \nanother senseless tragedy and mass casualties, I hope we do take action \nto end this kind of senseless act of violence that takes innocent lives \nin our communities. I hope we do something about it.\n  There are those who are calling for renewed background checks, and I \nsupport that, and renewed efforts to get guns out of the hands of \ndangerous people, and I support that. But there are also people who \nsuffer from mental illness. This case is currently under investigation, \nso I am not going to comment on the person we know did this horrific \nact and the struggles he had with the demons inside of him. I just know \nwe have to come to grips with problems. Yes, background checks are one \nthing, but really--and this is where I truly agree with the NRA--we \nhave to do something about mental illness and early detection and early \ntreatment.\n  We mourn for those whose lives were lost on Monday. We mourn for \ntheir families. And we hope now that out of this something positive \ngrows. But I want to say to their families that today is not really the \nday to talk about public policy. The men and women who were at that \nNavy Yard were Federal employees. They worked hard every single day. \nThey were proud to work for the U.S. Government. They were proud to do \neverything from IT service to security service. Some had master's \ndegrees, some had a high school education. Whatever their education, \nwhatever ZIP Code they came from, they really served one Nation and one \nflag.\n  I acknowledge their tremendous service to this country. I also \nacknowledge the wonderful way they were involved with their families \nand their communities. And on behalf of all of Maryland, I know Senator \nCardin and I express our deepest gratitude to them for their lives and \nexpress our heartfelt sympathy and condolences.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland for \nher beautiful remarks on behalf of her constituents and their families. \nOur thoughts and prayers are with the families. I also thank her for \nher thoughts on some of the policy ramifications that come out of the \nterrible tragedy. I know the Senator stands by those families as she \nhas stood by so many military families in the State of Maryland.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Brown follow me after my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Energy \nSavings and Industrial Competitiveness Act of 2013. I believe the \nbeneficial role that energy efficiency improvements can have for \nconsumers and also for industrial competitiveness often gets overlooked \nin today's debate about energy policy. When I travel around my State I \nam always hearing from businesses and manufacturers about the \nimportance of keeping energy affordable. That is why it is so important \nwe are having this debate and that we are looking at taking real steps \non meaningful energy legislation.\n\n  This legislation will help consumers save money on their utility \nbills and help our businesses be more competitive. Minnesota has long \nbeen an example of leadership in energy policy, with the 25 by 25 \nrenewable energy standard. Our largest energy provider, Xcel Energy, \nagreed to a 30-percent standard by 2020. So we have been one of the \nleading States in a bipartisan way. This bill was signed by Governor \nPawlenty, then-Governor Pawlenty, with strong bipartisan support in our \nState legislature. I would say it was also as a result of other things, \nbut I would say it certainly has not hurt our economy. We have one of \nthe lowest unemployment rates. We are at 5.2 percent. It came out today \nthe Twin Cities had its biggest year in the last year of any year in \nterms of economic gain.\n  Minnesota is also leading the way with a 1.5-percent energy \nefficiency standard. Each year our utilities work with consumers and \nbusinesses to find ways to save energy and reduce waste from energy \nefficiency improvements, much like those contained in the Shaheen-\nPortman bill.\n  I believe we need an ``all of the above'' plan to get serious about \nbuilding a new energy agenda for Minnesota, a plan that helps \nbusinesses compete in the global economy, preserves our environment, \nand restarts the engine that has always kept our economy going forward; \nthat is the energy of innovation.\n  Although Senators may differ on the specific details of an ``all of \nthe above'' energy plan, I believe we can find broad agreement that \nenergy efficiency, as we see in this bill, must be a part of any plan. \nSenators Shaheen and Portman have produced a very good bill that I \nstrongly support, but I also know there are many good ideas, many of \nthem bipartisan, that promote energy efficiency, and I thank them for \nthe opportunity to build on their legislation to boost energy \nefficiency.\n  One goal that I share with my friend and colleague from North Dakota \nSenator Hoeven was to find new opportunities to engage the nonprofit \ncommunity in making energy efficiency improvements.\n  I spoke briefly on the Senate floor earlier in the week about this \nimportant issue. When faced with the choice, nonprofits including \nhospitals, schools, faith based organizations and youth centers often \nmake the decision to delay or forgo improvements in energy efficiency \nto help stretch budgets and serve more people.\n  But we know investing in energy efficiency improvements today can \nlead to savings over time that go beyond the cost of the initial \ninvestment. So it is a difficult question. Should we do a little less \nfor a year or two so that upgrades can be made to our heating system so \nthat we can use the long term\n\n[[Page S6585]]\n\nsavings to protect our ability to serve well into the future?\n  That is why I introduced the Nonprofit Energy Efficiency Act as an \namendment with Senator Hoeven, and we have the support of Senators \nBlunt, Pryor, Risch, Schatz, and Stabenow.\n  Our amendment, which is fully offset, would provide $10 million each \nyear for the next 5 years to create a pilot grant program so that non-\nprofits can save through energy efficiency. We worked with stakeholders \nto ensure that grants will achieve significant amounts of energy \nsavings and are done in a cost effective manner. The grants would \nrequire a 50 percent match so that there is complete buy in from the \nnonprofits, and grants would also be capped at $200,000.\n  Our amendment has the support of National Council of Churches, the \nYMCA of the USA, and the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these letters of support for the \nNonprofit Energy Efficiency Act be included in the Record.\n  I again thank Chairman Wyden and Ranking Member Murkowski as well as \nSenator Shaheen and Senator Portman for their tireless efforts to move \nthis important legislation forward.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Klobuchar-Hoeven amendment, the \nNonprofit Energy Efficiency Act, and also support the underlying \nShaheen-Portman legislation.\n  I want to raise another important energy issue that I have worked on \nthis year that impacts nearly every family, business, and industry in \nAmerica--and that is the price of gasoline.\n  This past May in Minnesota in just one week we saw gas prices spike \n40 cents higher per gallon and over 80 cents higher over the course of \none month.\n  We know that this sharp spike in prices was caused when a number of \nrefineries that serve Minnesota and the region went offline for both \nscheduled and unscheduled maintenance, in part to prepare for summer \nfuel blends.\n  I understand the need to adjust for seasonal gasoline blends and \nperform upgrades to protect worker safety and make necessary repairs. \nBut scheduled, routine maintenance should not be an excuse for major \ngasoline shortages and steep price spikes.\n  Gas prices in Minnesota have subsided after setting records this \nspring of over $4.25 a gallon, but we know refinery outages will \ncontinue to have significant impacts, disrupting commerce and hurting \nconsumers, small businesses and farmers if we do not act.\n  That is why I introduced the Gas Price and Refine Capacity Relief Act \nof 2013 with Senators Hoeven, Franken, and Durbin. Our bill requires \nrefineries give advance warning of any planned outage and immediate \nnotification for any unplanned outage.\n  This information would serve as an early warning system and protect \nconsumers from paying the price at the pump when there are production \nproblems within the refining industry. With more transparency--and more \nlead time--fuel retailers will have the opportunity to purchase fuel at \nprices that better reflect the underlying costs of crude oil and better \nreflect supply and demand across the country.\n  When we had this recent increase you couldn't explain it by supply \nand demand. We had ample supplies. Demand was down. The only reason we \ncould find, besides perhaps speculation, was these refineries that had \nplanned closures. What we are trying to do is create an early warning \nsystem and I appreciate the bipartisan support for this bill.\n  The bill would also require the Secretary of Energy look at the \npotential for additional refined fuel storage capacity in our region. \nMinnesota has less storage capacity for refined products than other \nparts of the country and that makes us more vulnerable to the kinds of \nrefinery outages we've experienced this year--both planned and \nunplanned--that led to dramatic spikes in the price of gas.\n  I thank Chairman Wyden for holding a hearing on this issue in July. \nAlthough this amendment will not come up for a vote as a part of the \nbill being considered by the Senate, I look forward to continue working \non this issue so we can prevent another unnecessary spike in gas prices \nlike we saw in Minnesota this spring.\n  Most people wouldn't tie the last issue I wish to discuss today to \nenergy policy. But just ask any power company or construction crew \nacross the country, or even operators of ice skating rinks in Minnesota \nand you would quickly learn about the growing national problem of metal \ntheft and it must be addressed.\n  I have filed my bipartisan bill, the Metal Theft Prevention Act, to \nthe energy efficiency bill to bring attention to metal theft. I \nintroduced it last February with Senators Hoeven, Schumer, Graham, and \nCoons.\n  The bill is the much-needed Federal response to the increasingly \npervasive and damaging crime of metal theft.\n  Metal theft has jumped more than 80 percent in recent years, hurting \nbusinesses and threatening public safety in communities throughout the \ncountry. Metal theft is a major threat to American businesses, \nespecially to power companies. In a recent study, the U.S. Department \nof Energy found that the total value of damages to industries affected \nby the theft of copper wire is approximately $1 billion each year.\n  Across the country, copper thieves have targeted construction sites, \npower and phone lines, retail stores, and vacant houses. They've caused \nexplosions in vacant buildings by stealing metal from gas lines, and \nthey've caused blackouts by stealing copper wiring from streetlights \nand electrical substations. Thieves are even taking brass stars from \nour veterans' graves. On Memorial Day in 2012, thieves stole more than \n200 bronze star markers from veterans' graves in Minnesota.\n  In another case that shows just how dangerous metal theft can be, \nGeorgia Power was having a huge problem with thieves targeting a \nsubstation that feeds the entire Atlanta-Hartsfield International \nAirport, one of the busiest airports in the world. The airport was \ngetting hit 2 to 3 times a week and surveillance didn't lead to any \narrests.\n  Last winter, at a recreation center in St. Paul thieves stole $20,000 \nworth of pipe from the outdoor ice rink, causing the center to close \nuntil local businesses donated labor and materials to make the repairs.\n  This rise in incidents of metal theft across the country underscores \nthe critical need for Federal action to crack down on metal thieves, \nput them behind bars and make it more difficult for them to sell their \nstolen goods.\n  Our Metal Theft Prevention Act will help combat this growing problem \nby putting modest record-keeping requirements onto the recyclers who \nbuy scrap metal . . . limiting the value of cash transactions . . . and \nrequiring sellers in certain cases prove they actually own the metal . \n. . The amendment also makes it a Federal crime to steal metal from \ncritical infrastructure and directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to \nreview relevant penalties.\n  This amendment respects State law. Our intention is not to preempt \nState laws, so if a State already has laws on the books regarding metal \ntheft, they would not apply the Federal law.\n  I realize that the majority of cases will likely continue to be \nhandled by State and local law authorities, but the Federal government \nneeds to be a strong partner, and the Metal Theft Prevention Act will \nsend the clear message that metal theft is a serious crime.\n  The Metal Theft Prevention Act has been endorsed by the National \nRural Electrical Cooperatives, American Public Power Association, APPA, \nAmerican Supply, Edison Electric Institute, National Electrical \nContractors Association, National Association of Home Builders, \nNational Retail Federation, U.S. Telecom Association, and about a dozen \nother businesses and organizations.\n  It also has the support of the major law enforcement organizations--\nMajor Cities Police Chiefs, Major County Sheriffs, National Sheriffs, \nFraternal Order of Police and the National Association of Police \nOrganizations. I would love to just bring this bill to the Senate after \nI have gotten it through the committee already in Judiciary, \nunanimously, but there are people still holding it up.\n  The Metal Theft Prevention Act will not come to a vote in relation to \nthe bill currently pending before the Senate, but it must be a \npriority. We need to do everything we can to protect our critical \nenergy industry infrastructure from unscrupulous metal thieves. And,\n\n[[Page S6586]]\n\nI hope my colleagues will support the Metal Theft Prevention Act as \nwell when it does come before the full Senate.\n  Again, I commend Senator Shaheen and Senator Portman on their \nlegislation to encourage energy efficiency. The bill would save \nconsumers and taxpayers money through reduced energy consumption, help \ncreate jobs, make our country more energy independent, and reduce \nharmful emissions.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               September 17, 2013.\n     Senator Amy Klobuchar, \n     Senator John Hoeven,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators, We write to you on behalf of our \n     organizations, to express our strong support for a bipartisan \n     amendment (#1940) you have sponsored toward the Energy \n     Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act (S.1392; sponsored \n     by Senators Shaheen and Portman and supported by ENR \n     Committee Chairman Wyden and Ranking Member Murkowski.\n       Amendment 1940 will create a pilot grants program in the \n     Department of Energy to award limited, but impactful, \n     matching grants to nonprofit organizations to make their \n     buildings more energy efficient. It authorizes $10 million \n     per year for the next 5 fiscal years (importantly the funding \n     is fully offset by reallocating other DoE spending). The \n     pilot program will provide grants of up to 50% of a \n     nonprofit's building energy efficiency project, with a \n     maximum grant of $200,000.\n       Such a program is much needed. According to the U.S. \n     E.P.A., nonresidential buildings in the U.S. consume more \n     than $200 billion annually in energy costs. The United States \n     is also home to 4000 Boys & Girls Clubs, 2700 YMCAs, 2900 \n     nonprofit hospitals and more than 17,000 museums. These \n     buildings also account for a significant portion of annual \n     greenhouse gas emissions. Many of the energy efficiency \n     incentive or support programs that have been in place the \n     past several years have been structured in the form of tax \n     credits and rebates. Nonprofits--being tax exempt entities--\n     have not been able to take advantage of these programs. \n     Moreover, nonprofit entities are often least able to surmount \n     the ``front end'' investment cost of efficiency retrofits.\n       The Klobuchar-Hoeven amendment, based upon S.717, received \n     consideration in the Senate Energy Subcommittee earlier this \n     year. It is good public policy that enjoys bipartisan support \n     and the support of a broad coalition of nonprofit \n     organizations. We urge you to support Amdt. 1940's inclusion \n     in the Shaheen Portman legislation.\n           Thank you,\n       Association of American Museum Directors, The Baha'is of \n     the United States, Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, \n     Friends Cmte. on Nat'l Legislation (Quakers), Gen'l Conf. of \n     Seventh Day Adventists, Jewish Federations of North America, \n     National Council of Churches, Sojourners, Union of Orthodox \n     Jewish Congregations, U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, \n     YMCA of the U.S.A.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               September 12, 2013.\n       Dear Senator: The YMCA of the USA is the national resource \n     office for the 2,700 YMCAs in the U.S. The nation's YMCAs \n     engage 21 million men, women and children--of all ages, \n     incomes and backgrounds--with a focus on strengthening \n     communities in youth development, healthy living, and social \n     responsibility. YMCAs are led by volunteer boards and depend \n     upon the dedication of their 550,000 volunteers for support \n     and strategic guidance in meeting the needs of their \n     communities.\n       We are writing to express our support for an amendment, \n     #1856, sponsored by Senators Klobuchar and Hoeven, to the \n     Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act, S. 1392.\n       The amendment creates a pilot grants program in the \n     Department of Energy that awards limited, but important, \n     matching grants to nonprofit organizations to make their \n     buildings more energy efficient. It authorizes $10 million \n     per year for the next five fiscal years and is fully offset \n     by reallocating other DOE spending.\n       The U.S. EPA has found that nonresidential buildings \n     consume more than $200 billion in energy costs. Many of the \n     energy efficiency programs are structured as tax credits and \n     rebates. Because nonprofits are tax exempt organizations they \n     have not been able to take advantage of these programs. In \n     addition, many nonprofits don't have the financial resources \n     to invest in energy efficient retrofits. This amendment would \n     help nonprofits significantly cut energy costs.\n       The Klobuchar-Hoeven amendment is sound public policy and \n     has both bipartisan support and broad support among nonprofit \n     organizations. Please support including this amendment in S. \n     1392, the Shaheen, Portman legislation.\n           Thank you,\n     Neal Denton,\n       Senior Vice President and Chief Government Affairs Officer, \n     YMCA of the USA.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            The Jewish Federations\n\n\n                                             of North America,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 12, 2013.\n       Dear Senator: It is our understanding that the Senate will \n     commence consideration this afternoon of the Energy Savings \n     and Industrial Competitiveness Act of 2013 (S. 1392). In this \n     regard, we wanted to share with you our strong support for \n     Amendment Number 1856 filed by Senators Klobuchar and Hoeven.\n       This amendment would establish an energy efficiency pilot \n     program for nonprofit institutions. The Jewish Federations of \n     North America, one of North America's oldest, largest and \n     longest-serving health and social services network supports \n     this amendment for the following reasons:\n       --JFNA has a long history of public private partnerships \n     and working with Congress to promote innovations and \n     efficiencies in nonprofit human services delivery. As such, \n     we endorse the Klobuchar-Hoeven amendment as a timely and \n     necessary pilot program to assist nonprofits to become more \n     energy efficient and environmentally responsible.\n       --JFNA is comprised of 153 Jewish Federations and 300 \n     independent Jewish communities. Within our umbrella, we \n     support and operate thousands of agencies (i.e., schools, \n     community centers, hospitals, health centers, day care \n     facilities, museums, and more) that serve millions of \n     individuals and families within most major population centers \n     across the country. Many of our institutions are several \n     decades old--some were built more than a century ago. The \n     need for these institutions to upgrade and retrofit \n     antiquated and unreliable operating systems is great.\n       --As nonprofits, we know only too well the importance of \n     creating energy efficiencies to our bottom line--to ensure \n     that we maximize the use of philanthropic dollars to best \n     serve the most vulnerable populations and to maintain healthy \n     and vibrant communities across the country. We also know the \n     power and opportunity that is created through \n     congressionally-derived pilot projects. They help to shed \n     needed light on issues of importance to the country. They \n     help to galvanize support for needed public policy shifts. \n     They help to bolster and promote positive change within the \n     nonprofit sector. In this regard, Amendment Number 1856 would \n     provide an important catalyst for energy improvements and \n     modernization within the nonprofit sector.\n       Comprehensive energy efficiency reform cannot succeed \n     without Congress also addressing the issues facing the \n     nonprofit sector. With your support, Senate adoption of \n     Klobuchar-Hoeven Amendment 1856 would be a needed bi-partisan \n     improvement to S. 1392.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Robert B. Goldberg,\n     Senior Director, Legislative Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          United States Conference\n\n\n                                          of Catholic Bishops,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 12, 2013.\n     Senator Amy Klobuchar,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Senator John Hoeven,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Klobuchar and Senator Hoeven: I write in \n     support for your amendment (#1856) to the Energy Savings and \n     Industrial Competitiveness Act (S. 1392). This amendment \n     reflects the policy of your bill, S. 717, The Nonprofit \n     Energy Efficiency Act, which was endorsed by our Committee on \n     Domestic Justice and Human Development.\n       As our committee chair noted back in June, this amendment \n     would ``establish a pilot program at the U.S. Department of \n     Energy to provide grants to non-profit organizations to help \n     make the buildings they own and operate more energy \n     efficient.''\n       I would like to thank both of you for championing \n     innovation in energy policy and ask that your colleagues \n     support your amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Jayd Henricks,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    Association of\n\n\n                                         Art Museum Directors,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 13, 2013.\n     Hon. Amy Klobuchar,\n     Hon. John Hoeven,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Klobuchar and Hoeven, On behalf of the \n     Association of Art Museum Directors, its members and board of \n     trustees, I write to express our strong support for the \n     bipartisan amendment (#1856) that you have sponsored to the \n     Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act (S.1392), \n     which would create a pilot grants program in the Department \n     of Energy to award limited, but impactful, matching grants to \n     nonprofit organizations to make their buildings more energy-\n     efficient.\n       Many of the energy efficiency incentive or support programs \n     that have been in place the past several years have been \n     structured in the form of tax credits and rebates. As \n     nonprofits we have not been able to take advantage of these \n     programs. Your amendment would give museums, schools, houses \n     of worship and other nonprofit institutions the opportunity \n     to make our systems more energy-efficient and thereby allow \n     us to reduce our energy costs. In our case, the cost savings \n     will go into programs that museums offer to the public.\n       The grants program would be particularly useful to the \n     museum field, because many of our institutions are in large \n     buildings that are many decades old and were not designed to \n     modern efficiency standards.\n\n[[Page S6587]]\n\n       Thank you for your leadership on this important piece of \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Christine Anagnos,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Health Policy\n\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the senior Senator from Minnesota for her words \nand especially work on this bill and the consumer issues. She has made \na real name in this body for her work.\n  I rise today to discuss the most significant reform of our Nation's \nhealth policy in decades. The Affordable Care Act is a result of \nextensive policy discussions, late-night deliberations, 400 amendments \nthat we considered in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pension \nCommittee, more than 100 of those amendments that we adopted coming \nfrom Republican ideas and Republican Senators. There is a reason that \npeople across the country, mothers and fathers and students and faith \nleaders and business owners and workers, are paying attention. It is \nbecause the law benefits all Americans, a wide range of Americans and \nespecially in my home State, which I will discuss.\n  More than 900,000 people in Ohio will be eligible for financial \nassistance to buy insurance that provides good coverage at a price they \ncan afford. Ohioans suffering from preexisting conditions will no \nlonger be denied coverage or charged higher premiums. Young Ohioans \nstay on their parents' plan until the age of 26, giving them a chance \nto finish school and secure a job that provides coverage.\n  Those with the greatest need will get the greatest help. For years we \nhave heard countless stories, story after story of Americans frustrated \nby and failed by our health system. Last fall my wife Connie was \nwaiting in line at the local drugstore in an affluent community outside \nof Cleveland. The woman in front of her was, for all intents and \npurposes, negotiating price with the pharmacist to save money. ``What \nif I cut my pill in half and then take it twice a day,'' she asked. The \nvery understanding pharmacist wanted her to take her full medication \ntwice a day.\n  ``But isn't it better, since I can't afford this, to take half a pill \ntwice a day than the whole pill just once,'' she asked.\n  After the woman left my wife asked how often does this happen? The \npharmacist answered, ``Every day, every day all day.''\n  The tide is turning. I hear from constituents at roundtables, in \nrestaurants, in letters and tweets and e-mails about their concerns for \ntheir family's health. A woman in Cuyahoga Falls, a community near \nAkron, explained to me she recently graduated law school. She is a type \n1 diabetic. Without the health care law she would have been paying out \nof pocket for extremely costly lifesaving medication because she could \nnot afford it on her own.\n  I can imagine, she said, there are many Ohioans like me, working hard \nfor my future but finding myself in a tough demanding spot while still \nneeding to care for my health needs. Health care enrollment marks a \nmilestone for millions of Ohioans, including myself. Twenty years ago I \nwas running for Congress and made a promise in 1992 that I would not \naccept congressional health care; I would pay my own health insurance, \nuntil similar coverage was available to all Americans. I did that for \nwell over a decade. I can now say I will be enrolling in the health \ncare marketplace, alongside hundreds of thousands of people from \nOhio. While millions will be able to enroll in benefits beginning in \nless than 2 weeks, the health care law has already provided measurable \nbenefits.\n\n  I wish to share how Ohioans are already helped by provisions in this \nlaw signed by the President 3 years ago. There are 97,000 young adults \nwho are now able to stay on their parents' health insurance until their \n26th birthday. We are closing the doughnut hole. The Senator from \nPennsylvania mentioned what that means for his State. There are similar \nnumbers in Ohio. Closing the doughnut hole for seniors' prescription \ndrugs saves Ohioans an average of $774 a year on medication benefits.\n  There are 6,300 Ohioans who receive rebates from their insurance \ncompanies because those companies failed to follow the new Federal law \nthat required them to spend at least 80 to 85 percent--depending on the \nkind of insurance--of their premium dollars on health care. In other \nwords, if these companies spend more than 15 percent of your dollar \nthat you pay to these insurance companies on marketing, executive \nsalaries, and various kinds of administrative expenses, they owe you \nmoney back because not a high enough percent--85 percent--of your \nhealth care dollar was spent on health care itself.\n  There are 900,000 Ohioans who have received free preventive care, \nwith no copays and no deductibles. Seniors have been tested for \nosteoporosis, diabetes, and all the other kinds of screenings that \nseniors should get.\n  Children are no longer denied coverage for preexisting conditions. My \nwife was diagnosed with asthma at a young age--way before I knew her. \nShe might have been denied coverage today. She, and young people like \nher at that stage in their life, cannot be denied coverage for \npreexisting conditions such as asthma, diabetes, cancer or whatever \nthey might have.\n  Soon all Ohioans will have access to quality, affordable health care. \nIn 2014, we will see all aspects of this health care law fully \nimplemented, which will make a huge difference for business--especially \nsmall businesses--families, and communities.\n  From Ashtabula to Athens, from Bryan to Bellaire, from Mansfield to \nMiddletown, middle-class families across Ohio have been in the horrible \nposition of paying monthly premiums only to find they were stripped of \ncoverage or that the coverage was so minimal as to be useless when they \nbecame sick. That worry will no longer exist.\n  For students at Ohio State or Wooster, Youngstown State or Xavier, \nthe choice between paying for another semester at school or health \ninsurance will not be the concern it has been for so many years. For \nOhioans from Cleveland to Cincinnati already covered, they can keep \ntheir current plan without lifting a finger. The only change they will \nsee are new benefits, better protections, and more bang for their buck. \nFor millions in my State, the new law will mean less worry, less \nanxiety, and more money in their wallets.\n  For some Americans, the health insurance marketplace will lower \npremiums at least 10 percent more than previously expected. Work needs \nto be done. The system is not perfect, but this law is already bringing \nour health care into the future. It is a forward-looking law. I have \nbeen proud to support it.\n  On October 1, frustrations, worry, and failed health care protections \nwill soon become a thing of the past for millions in my State and tens \nof millions around the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I wish to speak for a few minutes in \nsupport of the bill currently before the Senate, S. 1392, the Energy \nSavings and Industrial Competitiveness Act of 2013.\n  It has taken a long time for this bipartisan legislation to make it \nto the floor of the Senate, and I commend Senators Shaheen and Portman, \nas well as Senators Wyden and Murkowski, and all of their staffs for \ntheir hard work.\n  Energy efficiency doesn't grab headlines in the same way as fracking \nor nuclear reactors or even renewable energy policies for wind and \nsolar, but this bill is good, solid policy that will shrink energy \nbills for families and businesses. It is exactly the kind of \nlegislation the Senate should be working on, and I urge my colleagues \nto support it.\n  This bill strengthens and updates the voluntary building codes States \nand tribes can adopt in order to determine and meet targets for energy \nefficiency and continues to strengthen the Federal Government's efforts \nto reduce energy use.\n  As the Nation's largest energy consumer, the Federal Government can \nplay a significant role in helping to provide a market for innovation \nin energy-efficient technologies and in turn\n\n[[Page S6588]]\n\nreduce our Nation's CO2 emissions while also saving \ntaxpayers money. This is the kind of policy everyone should be able to \nagree to. The bill also provides resources to train workers on energy-\nefficient building design and operation, a crucial component of making \nsure advances in energy efficiency translate into real, well-paying \njobs. In addition, the bill provides incentives for more energy-\nefficient manufacturing and the development and deployment of new \ntechnologies.\n  Finally, the bill would establish a Supply Star Program which will \nhelp provide support to companies looking to improve the efficiency of \ntheir supply chains. This program could be particularly helpful to \nHawaii, where transportation of goods from the mainland and other \nplaces can be very costly.\n  While individually these provisions may sound like modest proposals \nor changes, when taken together, the policies in this bill make \nsignificant progress toward reducing energy costs. That is good for \nconsumers and businesses, driving innovation, reducing environmental \nharm, and positioning the United States as a leader in clean energy \ntechnology and jobs.\n  It goes without saying that the cost of energy is an important \nconsideration for families and businesses across our country. When \nenergy costs go up, they can be a drag on the economy. We see this very \nclearly in Hawaii, where we are uniquely impacted by the price of oil.\n  In 2011, Hawaii's energy expenditures totaled $7.6 billion--almost \nequal to 11 percent of our entire State economy. In addition, no other \nState uses oil to generate electricity to the extent we do in Hawaii. \nAs a result, we have electricity prices that average 34 cents per \nkilowatt hour. That is over three times the price on the mainland.\n  Moreover, 96 percent of the money we spend on energy leaves our \nislands to buy oil from places outside of Hawaii. That is money that \ncould be better used to create jobs, bolster paychecks or to make \ninvestments in Hawaii's future.\n  Obviously, our State's energy security and economic potential is \nseverely undermined by a reliance on fossil fuels. While breaking that \nreliance is a challenge, it is also an opportunity. Hawaii has set some \nof the Nation's most aggressive goals for generating renewable energy \nand improving energy efficiency. We are working to show that renewable \nenergy and energy efficiency technologies are not just good for the \nenvironment, they can be an engine for economic growth and innovation. \nThat is what makes the Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness \nAct such an important bill. At its core, this legislation is about \nupdating Federal energy efficiency policies to better meet the needs of \ntoday's marketplace.\n  For example, updating voluntary building codes will give States and \ntribes the opportunity to reduce their energy use while also giving the \nprivate sector signals that there will be demand for innovation. The \nuse of energy savings performance contracts is an example. Energy \nsavings performance contracts are private agreements that make energy \nand water efficiency retrofits more affordable. A third-party company \ncovers the cost of the upgrade, and it is repaid over time from the \nresulting savings in energy costs.\n  Thanks to the State of Hawaii's commitment to improving energy \nefficiency, Hawaii is the Nation's No. 1 user of energy savings \nperformance contracts. In fact, just a few weeks ago the State of \nHawaii was awarded the Energy Services Coalition's Race to the Top \nAward which recognizes the State's commitment to pursuing energy \nsavings through performance contracting. This is the second year in a \nrow that Hawaii has won this award.\n  These are the types of innovative financing models and partnerships \nthat can happen when there is clear, sustained demand for improving \nenergy efficiency.\n  Another aspect to keep in mind is that even something as unglamorous \nsounding as improving building codes or advancing energy-efficient \nconstruction techniques can have a profound impact on the lives of \nfamilies across the country.\n  In 2011, Hawaii's first net-zero affordable housing community of \nKaupuni Village opened on Oahu. The 19 single-family homes and \ncommunity center at Kaupuni Village were constructed to maximize energy \nefficiency and use renewables to achieve net-zero energy performance. \nThe development has earned a LEED Platinum status. Each home in the \ncommunity was designed with optimal building envelope design, high-\nefficiency lighting, natural ventilation, solar water heating, and \nENERGY STAR appliances.\n  Kaupuni Village also provides affordable homes to Native Hawaiians--a \npopulation that has faced many challenges in achieving independence, \nhome ownership, and economic success. These homes were completed at an \naverage cost of less than half the median sales price of homes on Oahu, \nwhich are some of the Nation's highest home costs.\n  Thanks to technical assistance from the National Renewable Energy \nLab, or NREL, this partisanship between the Department of Hawaiian \nHomelands, Hawaiian Electric Company, the State of Hawaii, and private \nand Federal partners is a model for other communities.\n  Homeowners in Kaupuni Village are able to conserve energy and save \nmoney by optimizing their high-tech homes while also maintaining a \nlifestyle firmly rooted in traditions that go back thousands of years.\n  Homeowner Keala Young described her new life at Kaupuni Village by \nsaying:\n\n       We grow our own vegetables. We raise our own fresh-water \n     tilapia.\n       We are passionate about net-zero living. There is so much \n     pride in our home and our community. We feel we can be an \n     example to others.\n\n  These are the types of stories I imagine every Member of the Senate \nwants to tell in order to help bring about stories of strong \ncommunities, happy, vibrant families, and new opportunities that create \na bright future.\n  The Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act is bipartisan \nlegislation that can help to make those stories real for more people in \nHawaii and across the country.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on September 12 I made a statement in this \nChamber about the vote earlier that day by the board of directors of \nthe Millennium Challenge Corporation to approve a second compact for El \nSalvador.\n  As I said then, that vote was expected, and it began the final phase \nof discussions between the United States and El Salvador on a compact \nwhich, if funded, could result in investments totaling $277 million \nfrom the United States and $85 million from El Salvador.\n  I share the view of the MCC board that the compact, if implemented \nfully, would improve the lives of the Salvadoran people, but I also \nnoted that when the MCC was established a decade ago it was not \nintended to be just another foreign aid program. Rather, an MCC compact \nprovides a kind of stamp of approval by the United States indicating \nthat the government of the compact country has demonstrated a \ncommitment to integrity, to good governance and respect for the rule of \nlaw, and to addressing the needs of its people. I said this should be \ndoubly so for a second compact.\n  While El Salvador can point to some success in these areas, it \nremains a country of weak democratic institutions where the \nindependence of the judiciary has been attacked, corruption\n\n[[Page S6589]]\n\nis widespread, and transnational criminal organizations and money \nlaundering have flourished. Nobody knows this better than the \nSalvadoran people.\n  I urged the MCC, the Department of State, and the Government of El \nSalvador, prior to a final decision to provide the funds for a second \ncompact, to do more to address these problems which is necessary for \nthe rule of law and economic growth in that country. Regrettably, \nrather than acknowledge the need to address these problems more \nconvincingly, the reaction of top Salvadoran officials was to accuse me \nof being ``misinformed'' about their country and of meddling in their \naffairs. They reacted similarly when U.S. Ambassador Aponte expressed \nsome of the same concerns.\n  For over 20 years, I have been a friend of El Salvador. I actively \nsupported the negotiations that ended the civil war. I worked to help \nEl Salvador recover from that war, and I supported the first MCC \ncompact which was financed with $461 million from the Appropriations \nsubcommittee that I chair. I obtained emergency funding to help that \ncountry rebuild after devastating floods. And over the past decade I \nhave watched as the Salvadoran people were victimized by increasing \nlevels of crime and violence, a corrupt police force, and some \nindividuals in positions of authority who cared more about enriching \nthemselves or protecting their privileges than improving the lives of \nthe people. So it is disappointing that Salvadoran officials reacted as \nthey did to my remarks last week.\n  As I said then, I appreciate that MCC CEO Yohannes, U.S. Ambassador \nAponte, and other State Department officials have echoed some of the \nconcerns I have raised.\n  The budget of the Millennium Challenge Corporation, which I have long \nsupported, and the funds for a second compact for El Salvador--for \nthose who may not be aware or have forgotten--comes from the Congress. \nIt should not be taken for granted.\n  I hope President Funes and his government will reconsider their \nresponse to these concerns--for the good of the Salvadoran people and \nif they want a second MCC compact to be funded.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/18/senate-section/article/S6589-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6589-S6590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             REMEMBERING BRIGADIER GENERAL DOUGLAS KINNARD\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to pay \ntribute to retired BG Douglas Kinnard, a former University of Vermont \nprofessor and retired general officer who passed away on July 29 of \nthis year at the age of 91.\n  Long before I came to know General Kinnard, he had built a reputation \nas a wise and thoughtful soldier. Respected for his leadership and \nintegrity on and off the battlefield, he honorably served our country \nin three wars, including two tours in Vietnam, despite his misgivings \nabout American strategy and involvement in the conflict. Having \ngraduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point on D-day during \nWorld War II, Douglas Kinnard rose to the rank of brigadier general \nbefore retiring from the Army to pursue his doctor of philosophy at \nPrinceton University.\n  It is no surprise given his intellect and objectivity that when he \nwent searching for his first faculty job, he found a home at the \nUniversity of Vermont. Those who have worked with General Kinnard have \npraised him as an imposing figure that was ``always open and fair'' and \nan ``enjoyable colleague'' who taught his students about real \npatriotism from his own experience.\n  I am grateful that the University of Vermont was able to benefit from \nthe many gifts General Kinnard brought with him to his work in \nBurlington and throughout the country. Marcelle and I send our \ncondolences to his wife Wade and son Frederick. I will miss his steady \ncounsel, which he provided me throughout my Senate career. The many \nsoldiers, students, and colleagues who were fortunate to have known him \nthroughout his long and industrious life will not soon forget his \nimpact.\n  The Burlington Free Press recently paid tribute to General Kinnard \nand his many contributions. I ask unanimous consent that a recent Free \nPress article entitled ``Remembering UVM prof., ex-Army general Douglas \nKinnard'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Burlington Free Press, Aug. 7, 2013]\n\n       The Two Accomplished Careers of Douglas Kinnard, 1921-2013\n\n                            (By Tim Johnson)\n\n       In 1977, midway through his faculty career at the \n     University of Vermont, ex-Army man Douglas Kinnard was \n     invited to appear on ``Good Morning America'' to talk about \n     the Vietnam War with his former commanding officer, William \n     Westmoreland.\n       The appearance preceded the publication of Kinnard's book, \n     ``The War Managers,'' which drew on a detailed survey Kinnard \n     had sent to all the American generals in Vietnam in 1974, a \n     year before U.S. forces finally withdrew. The survey \n     revealed, among other things, that about 70 percent of the \n     generals thought the war's objectives were unclear, and that \n     more than half thought the war shouldn't have been fought \n     with American troops.\n       Mark Stoler, a UVM historian who knew Kinnard, recalls \n     watching the show and thinking that Westmoreland looked \n     uncomfortable while Kinnard remained unruffled. ``He just sat \n     there, smiling,'' said Stoler, who recalled that Kinnard had \n     ``an incredibly sharp mind'' and was eminently clear-headed \n     about that controversial episode in American military \n     history.\n       Kinnard, who died of pneumonia last week in Pennsylvania at \n     age 91, spent about a decade in UVM's Political Science \n     Department during the 70s and 80s, in what for him was a \n     second career following 26 years as an Army officer and \n     service in three wars. He won the respect of his UVM peers \n     partly because of his intellect: He did, after all, complete \n     his Ph.D. work at Princeton in just three years, following \n     his retirement in 1970 as a brigadier general.\n       ``Very capable, very serious,'' said Garrison Nelson, \n     professor of political science. ``A remarkably well-organized \n     guy. A good teacher and a relatively high grader, as I \n     recall. I have very fond memories of Doug.''\n       Kinnard was also prolific. His first book on President \n     Eisenhower, an adaptation of his doctoral thesis, was also \n     published in 1977. ``The Secretary of Defense'' also came out \n     during his UVM tenure, in 1980, and he wrote about Vietnam \n     again later in ``The Certain Trumpet: Maxwell Taylor and the \n     American Experience in Vietnam.''\n       Among Kinnard's eight books were two memoirs, the first of \n     which details his life's remarkably humble beginnings. \n     ``Abandoned'' by a broken family at age 4 and placed in an \n     orphanage in Paterson, N.J., he was moved into a boarding \n     house after several months and raised by an extended Catholic \n     family.\n       ``He had to take care of himself,'' said his son, Frederick \n     Kinnard, in a phone interview. ``He was an adult before age \n     5. He lived with an old Irish spinster above a saloon.''\n       Kinnard made his way through Paterson's St. Joseph Grammar \n     School and Eastside High, became an Eagle Scout, and \n     eventually won an appointment to West Point. He didn't aspire \n     to be a soldier, he told an interviewer in 1977, but chose \n     West Point partly because it was close to home.\n       ``It was a good way to go to college,'' he said. ``I really \n     wasn't thinking about a military career.'' The Army became \n     his career, however, with a series of promotions. He \n     graduated on June 6, 1944--D Day--and was dispatched to \n     Europe where, as an artillery lieutenant and forward \n     observer, he was awarded the Bronze Star for Heroic \n     Achievement. During the Korean War, he served in an artillery \n     unit, and later was assigned to the Pentagon and to NATO \n     headquarters in France.\n       Kinnard did two tours in Vietnam. The first, beginning in \n     1966, was as chief of operations analysis under Gen. \n     Westmoreland. When he returned to the United States he was \n     promoted to brigadier general, but he was having doubts about \n     the war and mulling a career in academia. Of the war, he told \n     an interviewer for the Princeton Independent in 2004:\n       ``The more I dealt with [the war and U.S. strategy], the \n     more skeptical I became, especially about the assumption \n     underpinning [General] Westmoreland's and American strategy: \n     that if we punished the enemy enough, he would negotiate an \n     end favorable to us. I was convinced that we really did not \n     understand the enemy or his motivations, or even his \n     strategy. The premise that our punishment would bring us \n     victory was to build a strategy on a house of cards.''\n       Kinnard wanted to retire but the Army refused and sent him \n     to Vietnam again, in 1969, this time commanding artillerymen. \n     The Independent interviewer asked him how he felt about being \n     sent back to Vietnam, given his doubts about the war.\n       ``You must understand that I had already applied for \n     retirement, and that was turned down,'' he said. ``So when \n     the decision was made that I would definitely go back, then I \n     had to concern myself with my job and not worry about my \n     personal feelings. As Commanding General of Force Artillery, \n     I commanded eight thousand troops in sixty firebases from the \n     Cambodian border to the South China Sea. I had to visit those \n     people daily and get involved in the planning, so I had to \n     toss my personal feelings--gone! Nothing can stand in the way \n     of the welfare of your troops. Your job is to defeat the \n     enemy; your job is to take care of your\n\n[[Page S6590]]\n\n     troops and keep your casualties down. And that's what I \n     did.''\n       Later in that tour he served as chief of staff of the \n     Second Field Force and aided in planning of the Cambodian \n     incursion of 1970, which incited fierce protests in the \n     United States. The U.S. bombing of Cambodia that had preceded \n     that operation was unknown to him, he said, as it was to the \n     American public.\n       After he returned home he retired and headed to Princeton \n     as a 48-year-old graduate student. He didn't conceal his \n     military background but didn't advertise it either. When he \n     started looking for a faculty job, he impressed his \n     interviewers at the University of Vermont.\n       ``He was an imposing presence,'' said Stoler, who shared \n     with Kinnard a scholarly interest in military history.\n       ``I remember Professor Kinnard as a very professional and \n     enjoyable colleague,'' said Frank Bryan, who retired from UVM \n     recently as a political science professor. ``Our areas of \n     expertise were different, of course, but I can say he was a \n     very good `department citizen'--always open and fair and \n     collegial.''\n       Nancy Viens was Kinnard's secretary at UVM for two years. \n     She typed ``The War Managers'' for him.\n       In the beginning, she said, ``I was very intimidated about \n     working for a 6-foot general from the Army. I'd signed (anti-\n     war) protest petitions and all that.''\n       He surprised her, though, telling her, ``I'm not your \n     average run-of-the-mill general.''\n       ``He turned out to be one of the nicest people I've ever \n     known,'' she said, adding that he kept in touch with her for \n     years after they both left UVM. Of the Vietnam War debates, \n     she said, ``He had sympathy for both sides. He did his job as \n     a general and then he got out.''\n       In the Independent interview, Kinnard was asked what he \n     taught UVM students about the Vietnam War.\n       ``I taught them that it was a war that should not have been \n     fought,'' he said. ``It should not have gone past the \n     advisory effort. I traced for them all the presidential \n     decisions that were made, going from Truman all the way up \n     through Nixon, and showed how each one led to another. But \n     those decisions were made at political levels; the generals \n     had no part in them.''\n       He acknowledged that patriotism could take many forms, and \n     that the war opponents had done the country ``a great \n     service.''\n       Following their joint appearance on ``Good Morning \n     America,'' Kinnard told the Independent interviewer, \n     Westmoreland gave him a ride to Laguardia Airport, and \n     Kinnard gave Westmoreland a copy of his book.\n       ``Well, God, he called me for a whole week, asking, `Who \n     said this?' and `Who said that?''' Kinnard recalled. ``I \n     said, I can't tell you that, General Westmoreland,' because I \n     had promised the respondents anonymity. I went away to Maine \n     for a week, and the book arrived in the mail with his notes \n     written on damn near every page.''\n       After Kinnard left UVM, he continued lecturing and writing, \n     holding positions at the University of Oklahoma, Naval War \n     College, National Defense University and University of \n     Richmond. In 1994, President Clinton appointed him to the \n     American Battle Monuments Commission and he helped plan the \n     World War II memorial on the National Mall.\n       ``He wasn't a retiring type,'' Frederick Kinnard said.\n       ``Doug Kinnard had the wonderful facility of being highly \n     knowledgeable and impeccably honest,'' said Sen. Patrick \n     Leahy, D-Vt., in an email. ``I've relied on his good judgment \n     for years. Marcelle and I were sorry to learn of his passing \n     and send condolences to his family.'' Besides his son, \n     Douglas Kinnard is survived by his wife, Wade Tyree Kinnard. \n     He will be buried at West Point Aug. 15.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/18/senate-section/article/S6590-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GRAMEEN BANK\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to speak about \ntroubling actions by the Government of Bangladesh against the Grameen \nBank.\n  Founded in 1983 by Professor Mohammed Yunus, the Grameen Bank has \nbeen a model of the immense potential of microfinance for economic \ndevelopment. By providing small loans to the world's poorest people who \npossess the skills but not the financing needed to start a small \nbusiness, microcredit institutions have shown to be successful in \npromoting the most effective means of poverty reduction, the \nempowerment of women. The Grameen Bank, about which volumes have been \nwritten, has been a leading example of these successful borrower-owned \nbanks, and the model has spread from Bangladesh throughout Southeast \nAsia and beyond.\n  The proposal of the Government of Bangladesh to dissolve the Grameen \nBank into 19 separate entities would curtail one of the best mechanisms \nfor reducing poverty in Bangladesh. This radical restructuring would \nfragment Grameeen's governance structure, essentially rendering it \npowerless. It would move ownership of the bank from the people with a \nvested interest in its success to an assortment of agencies with no \nlegal relationships with the public.\n  The force behind the efforts to weaken the Grameen Bank is none other \nthan Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who has clashed with Professor Yunus \nsince the latter won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 and expressed \ninterest in running for public office himself. Threatened by Professor \nYunus' popularity, the Prime Minister has tried for years to undermine \nhis authority and influence.\n  The Grameen Bank has been targeted by the government-created Grameen \nBank Commission, and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was instrumental in \nYunus' removal from his position as Grameen's managing director through \nan age mandated retirement although no such mandate exists for the \ncountry's private banks. Most recently, the government has accused \nseveral microcredit companies founded by Professor Yunus of failing to \npay taxes, which he has denied as baseless. The Prime Minister's \nvendetta against Professor Yunus seems to have no limit.\n  I want to echo the sentiments of my friend Senator Durbin who has \nspoken about this, as well as 17 Senators, who sent a letter to Prime \nMinister Sheikh Hasina last year. I join them and leaders of goodwill \naround the world in supporting the Grameen Bank and Professor Yunus. \nThey have been bright spots in one of the world's poorest countries \nwhose own nationalized banks are failing.\n  Millions of Bangladesh's poorest people, particularly women, need \naccess to the credit the Grameen Bank provides. Rather than continue to \npersecute Professor Yunus, the Prime Minister and her government should \nlearn from his example and redirect their efforts to helping improve \nthe lives of the people they have a responsibility to serve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/18/senate-section/article/S6590-2", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6590-S6591]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO THE LYNN FAMILY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention of \nthe Senate a notable family whose work has made a unique and meaningful \ncontribution to the Vermont newspaper community and to our State. The \nLynn family runs several Vermont newspapers, reporting local news and \nserving general commerce in these communities.\n  In 1984, Angelo Lynn bought the Addison County Independent, marking \nthe beginning of a family newspaper operation based out of Middlebury, \nVT. Today, Angelo's three daughters have joined a five-generation \nnewspaper tradition, each taking on a different Vermont town newspaper. \nWith Elsie running the Colchester Sun and the Essex Reporter, Polly \nrunning the Mountain Times in Killington, and Christy working side by \nside with her father overseeing the advertising sales team of the \nAddison County Independent, the Lynn family reports stories Vermonters \ndepend on.\n  While some of the biggest newspapers struggle, local papers are \nthriving, and the Lynn family has embraced the opportunity to influence \nthe future of the newspaper industry. Focusing on local government, \nevents, schools, sports and businesses, the Addison County Independent \nis a vital piece of the community it serves. It is personal and caring, \nand it reflects what matters to the residents of the community.\n  I congratulate Angelo Lynn on the success of his family-run newspaper \noperation. Mr. Lynn, his daughters, and his brother Emerson have \nharnessed local newspapers to strengthen our Vermont communities. I \nhave included the New York Times article ``Vermont Sisters with Roots \nin News Embrace Small-Town Papers'' that covers each Lynn family \nmember's individual story. I ask that the text of this article, dated \nAugust 15, 2013, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Vermont Sisters With Roots in News Embrace Small-Town Papers\n\n                        (By Christine Haughney)\n\n       Middlebury, VT.--King Lear's three daughters had their \n     lands and loyalties to fight over. Jane Austen's Dashwood \n     sisters had the prospect of marriage to occupy them, and \n     Anton Chekhov's three sisters had local military officers to \n     brighten their days.\n       None of them ever contemplated a future as risky as \n     newspapers.\n       For a long time, neither did the Lynn sisters, even though \n     they are a fifth-generation newspaper family. Polly, Christy \n     and Elsie\n\n[[Page S6591]]\n\n     Lynn left behind their father's dusty but cozy newsrooms for \n     college and careers.\n       Now they are back. Elsie, 26, moved home in 2010 after she \n     ran out of money while working and traveling through Asia. \n     She manages two of her father's weeklies in the Burlington \n     suburbs of Colchester and Essex.\n       Polly, 29, returned in 2011 from Denver, and has thrown \n     herself into running the weekly newspaper in Killington, the \n     popular ski town. Christy, 28, moved back in June after her \n     boyfriend finished graduate school in Vancouver. She helps \n     her father, Angelo, running the business side of Middlebury's \n     paper, The Addison County Independent.\n       It is conventional wisdom that newspapers are a fading \n     enterprise. Last month, the Tribune Company bought 19 local \n     television stations even as it sought to sell its portfolio \n     of papers, and twice in August, big-city papers changed \n     hands: The New York Times sold The Boston Globe and other \n     properties for $70 million, after paying $1.1 billion for The \n     Globe 20 years ago, and the Graham family said it would sell \n     The Washington Post after eight decades of ownership.\n       But instead of fleeing the newspaper business, the Lynn \n     sisters have embraced it, and not just because it is part of \n     their heritage.\n       ``I've grown up in the papers,'' said Elsie Lynn. ``But I \n     don't think that's the reason I'm in it. The future is \n     exciting for me. We have this chance and this opportunity to \n     be pioneers and change our career and change this industry.''\n       The papers the Lynn sisters help run have been surprisingly \n     profitable. They have not faced bankruptcy like newspapers of \n     the Tribune Company including The Los Angeles Times and \n     haven't cut coverage like The Times-Picayune of New Orleans. \n     In these parts of Vermont, where Internet connections are \n     less reliable and winter snowstorms can block roads for days, \n     readers often prefer print.\n       Mr. Lynn said that he had run his newspapers debt-free for \n     a decade. While his papers aren't making money yet from their \n     digital efforts, his newspaper and phone book businesses \n     generate about $4.5 million in gross revenue.\n       ``We can't afford not to make money,'' Mr. Lynn said as he \n     sat in his office here surrounded by photographs of his \n     daughters, the family dogs dozing loudly nearby. ``There's no \n     future losing money in any of these papers.''\n       It helps that Mr. Lynn has a long history in the business. \n     His great-grandfather, Charles Scott, bought The Iola \n     Register in Kansas in 1882. Mr. Lynn was raised upstairs from \n     the offices of another nearby Kansas paper called The \n     Humboldt Union. In 1984, Angelo Lynn bought The Addison \n     County Independent in Vermont and started building up his \n     chain of papers. Mr. Lynn's older brother, Emerson, owns two \n     papers with his wife, Suzanne, and Angelo as well as two \n     other Vermont papers.\n       Angelo Lynn speaks fondly of the newspaper life. He spends \n     his weekends hiking and skiing with his daughters and \n     weekdays churning out enterprising local journalism.\n       ``Once you become part of a community, you see the good \n     that a paper does,'' Mr. Lynn said. ``That's very \n     fulfilling.'' His daughters' newspaper futures were less \n     certain. When Elsie Lynn arrived at the newsroom of The \n     Colchester Sun and The Essex Reporter, she had never studied \n     journalism or held a journalism job. She wasn't convinced she \n     wanted to work with her father and uncle.\n       ``I've said, `Man, I don't know, Dad, if this is what I \n     want to do,' '' she said as she sat in her threadbare \n     newspaper office in a converted stable space on the outskirts \n     of Colchester. ``He said `No pressure.' ''\n       She settled in, typing up wedding announcements, but before \n     long her father asked her to review the papers' finances. \n     Elsie discovered they were owed $120,000 from advertisers. In \n     three months, she collected $90,000. She also saved her \n     father labor costs by absorbing multiple job titles. Elsie \n     said she often logged 13-hour days writing and editing \n     stories and promoting them on social media.\n       Polly Lynn was living in Colorado working for an \n     educational tour company with her partner, Jason Mikula, when \n     her father received an offer to buy The Mountain Times in \n     Killington. Mr. Lynn asked the couple, who were already \n     thinking of moving, to come to Vermont to run it. The couple \n     took over in September 2011 just as Hurricane Irene hit and \n     Killington was hit with some of the storm's worst flooding. \n     She produced the first editions from her father's dining room \n     table.\n       Since then, Polly said, she has kept a nonstop schedule of \n     publishing deadlines and has designed a hyper-local news app \n     for Killington. She spends evenings attending town planning \n     meetings and winters skiing with sources and advertisers.\n       There has already been a payoff. Polly and Mr. Mikula \n     increased the paper's revenue by 15 percent, or about \n     $100,000, by improving editorial content and strengthening \n     its advertising relationships, according to Mr. Lynn.\n       Mike Miller, a Killington business owner and former \n     selectman, said local businesses appreciated the couple's \n     forthright approach: when they made early mistakes on \n     advertisements, they admitted they were wrong, fixed them and \n     even offered to make more creative advertisements. They also \n     appreciate the couple's efforts to participate in the \n     community.\n       ``I'm just amazed at their energy,'' Mr. Miller said. ``If \n     there's something that there are going to be more than 10 \n     people there, they cover it.''\n       In some ways, Christy Lynn had the toughest transition. \n     While her sisters work at papers an hour's drive from their \n     father, she works steps away from him. Her father focuses on \n     editorial content, and she oversees the advertising sales \n     team and comes up with new promotions.\n       She has accomplished some small coups. She realized that \n     the Waterfalls Day Spa in Middlebury was promoting itself on \n     social media but did not advertise much in the paper. So she \n     persuaded the owners to advertise more in both the paper and \n     online. Mr. Lynn said that advertising revenue grew 6 percent \n     in this year's first quarter under Christy's watch.\n       Gary Greene, a newspaper sales broker, said successful \n     community newspapers shared specific traits. Unlike larger \n     newspapers, local community papers have little debt and don't \n     depend heavily on classified advertising. They hire enough \n     employees to report on town meetings and sports events and \n     publish material people can't find elsewhere. They are in \n     county seats, where they receive legal notices and \n     advertisements from local businesses.\n       Mr. Greene, who sits on the boards of small newspaper \n     chains nationwide and sees their financial statements, says \n     those qualities are critical to profitability.\n       ``These papers have all made money through the downturn,'' \n     Mr. Greene said. ``What other business categories are doing \n     15 to 20 percent margins? Most businesses would love to make \n     that kind of money.''\n       For now, newspaper analysts say these papers' futures \n     remain promising as long as they remain the sole information \n     source. Alan D. Mutter, a newspaper consultant who writes the \n     Reflections of a Newsosaur blog, said that there was still \n     value in information like school lunch menus and high school \n     sports scores.\n       ``Weeklies in healthy communities that do a good job \n     reporting on local news and serving local businesses are by \n     far the healthiest of publications,'' he said.\n       ``The Messenger has been in business for 150 years,'' said \n     Emerson Lynn, referring to one of his Vermont papers, The St. \n     Albans Messenger. ``Do I think Google is going to be in \n     existence for 150 years? Not a chance.''\n       It's unclear how long the Lynn sisters will work in \n     newspapers. While Mr. Lynn has made no succession plans, he \n     also doesn't want to sell. While some of the nation's largest \n     papers are being sold for a small fraction of their purchase \n     price, the market for smaller community papers is healthier. \n     Mr. Greene, the newspaper broker, said that this year his \n     company closed eight deals with 23 publications, nearly \n     double the sales volume in 2011 and 2012. And the resale \n     value of smaller newspapers--the deals worth less than $20 \n     million--is higher than that of bigger papers and chains.\n       It also helps that the Lynn family seems committed to the \n     business. In March, Angelo and his wife, Lisa Gosselin, \n     invited his brood and their partners and dogs for dinner at \n     his home, a renovated camp building on Lake Dunmore. Dinner \n     conversation revolved around food, skiing and newspapers. \n     Polly warned her father to expect calls of complaint about a \n     forthcoming article.\n       None of them talked about how long they would remain in the \n     business. But long after they finished their dessert of \n     poached pears and blueberry pie, they lingered at the table \n     to chat. Before they left, Elsie remembered that The \n     Colchester Sun was sponsoring a cold-water dive into Lake \n     Champlain.\n       ``Who is going to jump in the lake with me?'' she asked.\n       There was a flurry of reporterlike questions: ``How cold is \n     the water? When is it?''\n       But one by one, they all agreed to take the plunge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/18/senate-section/article/S6591-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6591-S6592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JIMMY ROSE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a Kentuckian \nwho has become a hero to many in my home state and across the country \nfor his honest and moving portrayal of life in southeastern Kentucky. I \nam speaking of Jimmy Rose, the man from Pineville who has risen to fame \nthis summer for his appearances on the television show ``America's Got \nTalent'' and his performance of the hit song ``Coal Keeps the Lights \nOn.''\n  Last night, millions of Americans tuned in to see Jimmy's performance \nin the final round of the competition, held in New York City. I know I \nspeak for thousands of Kentuckians when I say that no matter what the \noutcome tonight, he is truly a winner in our hearts, and his original \nsong is a winner with people all over.\n  Jimmy is a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who learned how to play guitar \nfrom a fellow marine while deployed in Iraq. He has worked as a coal \nminer and he himself wrote the song ``Coal Keeps the Lights On'' to \nraise awareness about how excessive regulations are hurting jobs in his \nhometown and in the coal industry.\n  Coal is part of a vital energy sector in the State of Kentucky. But \nJimmy\n\n[[Page S6592]]\n\nis tired of seeing coal mining jobs disappear from Pineville, from his \nnative Bell County, and from the region. I agree with him, 100 percent.\n  From Jimmy's first appearance on ``America's Got Talent'' earlier \nthis summer, he became a phenomenon. People could identify with the \nwords he sang, and they could identify with his courteous disposition \nand steadfast character as the trademarks of the people of southeastern \nKentucky. Fans across the country have happily supported, voted for, \nand sung along with Jimmy Rose.\n  I commend Jimmy Rose for putting a face on a problem that is all too \noften overlooked by some in Washington--the plight of the coal miner \nand the many hard-working Kentuckians whose jobs are related to the \ncoal industry. In these difficult economic times, we should be doing \neverything we can to protect these jobs and protect a way of life for \nthousands of families.\n  I think Jimmy's message is an important one. And I want to \ncongratulate Jimmy Rose for all his success to date. I am certain that \nwe will be hearing much more from him in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/18/senate-section/article/S6592-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO REAR ADMIRAL MARK D.

Guadagnini is retiring from the United States Navy and his \nposition as the Director of U.S. Fleet Forces Command's Maritime \nHeadquarters. On this occasion, I believe it is fitting to recognize \nRear Admiral Guadagnini's years of distinguished service and dedication \nto fostering the relationship between the military and this Chamber.\n  Rear Admiral Guadagnini is a 1980 distinguished graduate of the U.S. \nNaval Academy. Over the course of his career, he participated in six \ncombat Operations, including Desert Storm, Provide Comfort, Deliberate \nForce, Southern Watch, Enduring Freedom, and Iraqi Freedom, \naccumulating almost 5000 hours of flight time and accomplishing nearly \n100 combat missions. He has led at the highest levels of operational \naviation command at Strike Fighter Attack Squadron 15, Carrier Air Wing \n17, and Carrier Strike Group NINE.\n  In addition to his impressive accomplishments at sea, he was also one \nof our most well-rounded officers, serving as a test pilot, flag aide, \nfleet staff officer, manpower distribution officer, a Capitol Hill \nliaison, and, not coincidentally, as one of my first and best \nlegislative fellows 20 years ago. While in the flag ranks, Rear Admiral \nGuadagnini leveraged his expertise serving as the chief of Naval Air \nTraining; head of Human Resouces for the Naval Aviation Enterprise; \nDeputy Commander for Fleet Management at U.S. Fleet Forces Command, and \nlastly, as the director of Maritime Headquarters at U.S. Fleet Forces \nCommand.\n  I could not be prouder of the accomplishments that ``Guad'' has \nearned while wearing the uniform of the world's greatest fighting \nforce.

MILTON RUSH\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing the distinguished teacher and agricultural scientist, Dr. \nMilton C. Rush. Dr. Rush devoted his career to his students, his \nresearch, and his tireless efforts to protect and enhance one of our \nmost important sources of nutrition.\n  Dr. Rush began his career in rice pathologies in 1970 as a professor \nat Louisiana State University after receiving a doctor of philosophy \ndegree in plant pathology from North Carolina State University. For the \nnext 40 years at Louisiana State University, Dr. Rush has provided the \nagricultural community with invaluable research on rice pathology that \nhas greatly benefited farmers throughout the State of Louisiana and the \nNation. Under his leadership, the LSU rice program experienced its \ngreatest years of agricultural research expansion and development. \nThrough his years of service as an educator and pathologist, Dr. Rush \ncreated enduring changes in a wide breadth of research and direction to \nimpact and improve the lives of countless students, rice growers and \nconsumers within and throughout his community.\n  Perhaps Dr. Rush's greatest accomplishment came in his development of \na new rice variety, which he named after his beloved wife, Blanca \nIsabel. This new high-yielding, early harvest, long-grain rice variety \nwas the culmination of decades of research focusing on the epidemiology \nand control of rice diseases, rice tissue transformation, and the \nbreeding of disease-resistant rice strains. This new purple rice is \nbred in Louisiana and contains anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant \nproperties. His outstanding development of a more healthful and \nnutritious variety of rice will continue to provide unparalleled \nbenefits to the citizens and communities of Louisiana and the Nation, \ndelivering an improved alternative for generations to come.\n  Dr. Rush has been honored frequently during his distinguished career. \nAmong these honors are the Florence Avalon Daggett Professorship in \nRice Pathology, the LSU AgCenter's Distinguished Service Award, the \nSedberry Award for outstanding graduate professorship, memberships to \nthe American Phytopathological Society, the Rice Technical Working \nGroup, the Germplasm Advisory Committee, and two terms as president of \nthe Louisiana Plant Protection Association Constitution Committee. Dr. \nRush's career leaves a legacy of accomplishment and dedication to his \nfamily and all those who are a part of the agricultural communities \nthat his tireless work impacted.\n  Dr. Rush has been and continues to be an inspiration to all those who \nhave benefited from his decades of service to the field of rice \npathology. It is with my heartfelt and greatest sincerity that I ask my \ncolleagues to join me along with Dr. Rush's family in recognizing the \nlife and many accomplishments of this incredible mentor, professor, and \nagricultural scientist, as well as his lasting impact throughout the \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/18/senate-section/article/S6592-3", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6592-S6593]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AIR FORCE 66TH BIRTHDAY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today--September 18--marks the Air Force's \n66th birthday. For 66 years, our Nation has entrusted the Air Force \nwith preserving peace and freedom, and defending our democracy. Since \nits beginnings on July 26, 1947, when President Harry Truman signed the \nNational Security Act of 1947 on board the presidential aircraft, the \nSacred Cow, and set the creation of the United States Air Force in \nmotion, to its instrumental role in the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan, \nthe Air Force has always served America admirably and I have every \nconfidence that it will continue in this proud tradition.\n  The Air Force tracks its origins back to 1907, when the Wright \nBrothers conducted the world's first airplane flight over the sands of \nKitty Hawk, NC. Just like the Wright Brothers whose innovation spurred \naviation, the vast success and numerous achievements of the Air Force \nwould not be possible without the talented Airmen who fuel innovation \ntoday, enabling the Air Force to fly faster, further, and utilize \ntechnology that the Wright Brothers could not have imagined over 100 \nyear ago.\n  Today, the United States Air Force is the largest, most capable, and \nmost technologically advanced air force in the world, with about 5,300 \nmanned aircraft in service, 246 Unmanned Combat Air Vehicles, and 450 \nintercontinental ballistic missiles. The Air Force prides itself on \nfive core missions; Air and Space Superiority; Intelligence, \nSurveillance and Reconnaissance; Rapid Global Mobility; Global Strike; \nand Command and Control. The Air Force's commitment to core missions \nillustrates its vast capability and has remained steadfast since the \nAir Force's establishment as a separate service 66 years ago. Our \namazing Airmen today are constantly adapting and improving to meet the \nchallenges of a fast-paced security environment and an ever-evolving \nbattlespace across the globe.\n  The United States Air Force is, and will continue to be, the United \nStates' key asymmetric advantage across the spectrum of conflict. \nWhether responding to a national security threat, a\n\n[[Page S6593]]\n\nnatural disaster, or crisis engagements, the Air Force provides Global \nVigilance, Global Reach and Global Power to ensure that the U.S. is \ncapable of responding to events around the world. Without the Air \nForce's supremacy in air, space and cyberspace, the U.S. would not be \nable to move troops and equipment to war zones, send relief to \ncountries devastated by natural disasters, provide air support to \ntroops on the ground, or gather crucial intelligence through electronic \nwarfare and stealth technology.\n  But let us not forget the true power behind the Air Force is its \nAirmen. The Air Force comprises over 330,000 personnel on active duty, \n185,000 civilian personnel, and 180,000 in the Air National Guard and \nAir Force Reserves. These flexible, adaptable, and innovative Airmen \nemploy unmatched air, space, and cyberspace capabilities. Our Airmen \ntoday are driven by the ideals of the Warrior Ethos and commit \nthemselves to succeed in any mission our Nation asks of them. Our \nAirmen believe that our Constitution and the freedom it guarantees are \nworth fighting for. They sacrifice their personal comfort and safety to \nanswer a higher calling: service in the cause of freedom, both here at \nhome and abroad. I am awed by our servicemen and women's ability to \nadapt and succeed in a total force mission that at various stages has \ncalled upon them to be scholars, teachers, policemen, farmers, bankers, \nengineers, social workers, and, of course, warriors--often all at the \nsame time.\n  Above all, I am perpetually thankful for their willingness to serve, \nand I have the greatest faith in their ability to face the difficult \nand dangerous missions that lie ahead. These patriots have always been \nthe strength of our Nation. The unwavering dedication to duty, to our \ncountry, and to all Americans is embodied in the Air Force vision, \n``The World's Greatest Air Force--Powered by Airmen, fueled by \ninnovation.'' For 66 years, our Air Force has been on a mission to \nprotect the skies so that our society may be free. Let us remember our \nAir Force Airmen for this achievement today, and wish them a happy 66th \nbirthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/18/senate-section/article/S6593-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6593]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, September 15 through October \n15 is National Hispanic Heritage Month. This is a time to remember and \nto celebrate the integral role of Hispanic Americans in the economy, \nculture and identity of our Nation.\n  In New Mexico, we enjoy a rich Hispanic heritage that goes back over \n400 years. Santa Fe, the oldest capital city in the United States, was \nfounded a decade before the Pilgrims arrived at Plymouth Rock. New \nMexico has the highest percentage of Hispanics of any State. From the \nSpanish colonists to immigrants from Latin America, the Hispanic \ncommunity has informed our history, our art, and our sense of who we \nare as a people.\n  New Mexico is blessed with a blend of cultures and backgrounds like \nnowhere else. Our State is called the ``Land of Enchantment,'' not just \nfor the beauty of our landscapes but also for the vibrant diversity of \nour culture.\n  The annual Spanish Market in Santa Fe is the largest exhibition of \ntraditional Spanish Colonial and Hispanic art in the United States.\n  New Mexico is home to the National Hispanic Cultural Center, which is \nthe fastest growing cultural institution in our State. The center, \nlocated in Albuquerque, is a guardian of Hispanic arts, culture and \nhumanities, reaching people throughout the world.\n  Like America as a whole, the Hispanic community is itself diverse, \nrepresenting a rich mosaic of nationalities and backgrounds. Its values \nof family, faith and hard work are the values that unite all of us as \nAmericans and New Mexicans, and make us both more compassionate and \nstronger. Indeed, the story of Hispanics is a vital part of the \nAmerican narrative--of overcoming hardship, of sacrifice, persevering, \nand helping one another.\n  During times of war and peace, at home and abroad, the Hispanic \ncommunity has been a rich part of the fabric of the American story. \nFrom the time of the Revolutionary War, Hispanics have fought and died \nfor our freedoms. Forty-one have received the Congressional Medal of \nHonor, the highest military honor our Nation can bestow. Hispanics \ncontinue to contribute in communities throughout the Nation--in \nbusiness, in education and the arts, and at every level of government \nservice. Their talents and sacrifices are integral to our past, and \ncrucial to our future.\n  The late Dennis Chavez from New Mexico was the first American-born \nHispanic to be elected to the Senate. He was a trailblazer for the \npeople of New Mexico and for the Hispanic community.

PAUL EMERY\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and honor \nthe late Dr. Paul E. Emery's extensive service and commitment to the \npsychiatric community and the people of New Hampshire.\n  At an early age, Paul knew he wanted to become a psychiatrist. His \ncalling was to help people overcome their challenges, and he did so \nwith great compassion. He was a highly skilled and dedicated doctor who \nwas loved by many.\n  He trained at Syracuse Psychopathic Hospital, Western New England \nPsychoanalytic Institute, and Yale University. He was also an NIMH \nfellow at Austin Riggs Center in Stockbridge, MA. His training was \ninterrupted by the Korean war, during which he was promoted to captain \nand served as the division psychiatrist and chief of the Mental Hygiene \nClinic in the U.S. Army. He received several commendations for his \noutstanding service.\n  He started his private practice of psychiatry in Concord, NH, and \npracticed for more than 23 years. During this time, he was a consultant \nfor Concord Hospital, St. Paul's School, and the Division of Public \nHealth Program on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse. He was also the medical \ndirector for the Forensic Unit of the New Hampshire State Hospital. He \nlater became the first medical director and then executive director for \nthe VA's First Center on Stress Recovery in Brecksville, OH. \nSubsequently, Dr. Emery became chief of psychiatry at the Manchester \nVAMC. After his retirement from the VAMC, he became staff psychiatrist \nat Manchester Counseling Services and Elliot Hospital. In addition, he \nserved on the New Hampshire Parole Board.\n  Dr. Emery had an academic/faculty appointment at Dartmouth Medical \nSchool from the 1960s until he retired in 2005. He published about 30 \nscientific articles and chapters dealing primarily with post-traumatic \nstress disorder.\n  He founded the N.H. Psychiatric Society in 1972 and held various \nchairmanships and offices in that organization, including serving as \nits president during the 1980s and as chairman of the ethics committee \nduring the 1990s. He was also active in the N.H. Medical Society and \nwas its vice president during the mid-1970s.\n  Dr. Emery touched so many lives, and I join with citizens across New \nHampshire in honoring the many contributions he made to our State and \nthe psychiatric community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/18/senate-section/article/S6593-3", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6593]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/18/senate-section/article/S6593-4", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6593-S6594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n\n[[Page S6594]]\n\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/18/senate-section/article/S6594-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PROPOSED AGREEMENT FOR COOPERATION BETWEEN THE PARTIES TO THE NORTH \nATLANTIC TREATY FOR COOPERATION REGARDING ATOMIC INFORMATION, INCLUDING \n A TECHNICAL ANNEX AND SECURITY ANNEX (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE \n                      ``ATOMAL AGREEMENT'')--PM 20\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit to the Congress, consistent with sections \n123 and 144 b. of the Atomic Energy Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2153 and \n2164(b)), the text of the Agreement Between the Parties to the North \nAtlantic Treaty for Cooperation Regarding Atomic Information, including \na technical annex and security annex (hereinafter collectively referred \nto as the ``ATOMAL Agreement''), as a proposed agreement for \ncooperation authorizing the exchange of U.S. Restricted Data and \nFormerly Restricted Data within the context of the North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization (NATO) between the United States of America and the \nfollowing member of NATO: the Republic of Croatia (hereinafter the \n``New Party'').\n  In addition, I am pleased to transmit my written approval, \nauthorization, and determination concerning the ATOMAL Agreement with \nrespect to the New Party, with a copy of the memorandum of the \nSecretary of Defense with respect to the agreement. The ATOMAL \nAgreement entered into force on March 12, 1965, with respect to the \nUnited States and the other NATO members at that time. The Czech \nRepublic, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Poland, Spain, the \nRepublic of Bulgaria, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Latvia, \nthe Republic of Lithuania, Romania, the Slovak Republic, and the \nRepublic of Slovenia subsequently became parties to the ATOMAL \nAgreement. The New Party has signed this agreement and has indicated \nits willingness to be bound by it. The ATOMAL Agreement with respect to \nthe New Party meets the requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, \nas amended. Although the ATOMAL Agreement continues in force with \nrespect to the United States and the other current parties to it, it \nwill not become effective as an agreement for cooperation authorizing \nthe exchange of atomic information with respect to the New Party until \ncompletion of procedures prescribed by sections 123 and 144 b. of the \nAtomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.\n  For more than 40 years, the ATOMAL Agreement has served as the \nframework within which NATO and the other NATO members that have become \nparties to this agreement have received the information that is \nnecessary to an understanding and knowledge of, and participation in, \nthe political and strategic consensus upon which the collective \nmilitary capacity of the Alliance depends. This agreement permits only \nthe transfer of atomic information, not weapons, nuclear material, or \nequipment. Participation in the ATOMAL Agreement will give the New \nParty the same standing within the Alliance with regard to nuclear \nmatters as that of the other current parties to the ATOMAL Agreement. \nThis is important for the cohesiveness of the Alliance and will enhance \nits effectiveness.\n  I have considered the views and recommendations of the Department of \nDefense (DOD) and other interested agencies in reviewing the ATOMAL \nAgreement and have determined that its performance, including the \nproposed cooperation and the proposed communication of Restricted Data \nthereunder with respect to the New Party, will promote, and will not \nconstitute an unreasonable risk to, the common defense and security. \nAccordingly, I have approved the ATOMAL Agreement with respect to the \nNew Party and authorized the DOD to cooperate with the New Party in the \ncontext of NATO upon satisfaction of the requirements of section 123 of \nthe Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.\n  The 60-day continuous session period provided for in section 123 \nbegins upon receipt of this submission.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, September 18, 2013.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/18/senate-section/article/S6594-2", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO \n PERSONS WHO COMMIT, THREATEN TO COMMIT, OR SUPPORT TERRORISM THAT WAS \n   ESTABLISHED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13224 ON SEPTEMBER 23, 2001--PM 21\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 1518. A bill improving outcomes for youth at risk for sex \ntrafficking, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, there is an epidemic of abuse that is \ntaking place in America today. Recent reports estimate that hundreds of \nthousands of children and youths are at risk of domestic sex \ntrafficking.\n  Individuals on the frontlines in the fight against domestic sexual \ntrafficking of children report that instances are on the rise. They \ntell us former drug dealers have moved on to sex trafficking. They also \ntell us technological advances have made this type of trafficking \neasier as smart phones and other devices provide distance and increased \nlevels of anonymity. Certain Web sites that post classified ads \nsoliciting sexual partners also help facilitate trafficking.\n  The risk of sex trafficking is compounded every year for up to 30,000 \nyoung people who are ``emancipated'' from foster care. Too many of \nthese emancipated youth turn 18, pack their few belongings in a trash \nbag and are driven to a homeless shelter, leaving them vulnerable and \nexposed to traffickers and other predators.\n  While in foster care, children and youth are also at increased risk \nfor trafficking.\n  In July of this year, the FBI's Innocence Lost National Initiative, \nwhich combats domestic sex trafficking of minors, launched Operation \nCross Country, a 3-day effort. Operation Cross Country recovered 105 \nchildren and arrested 152 traffickers. The efforts of the Innocence \nLost National Initiative and the results of Operation Cross Country are \nlaudable. However, they also revealed a disturbing element of our \nNation's child welfare and foster care systems. According to some \nreports, up to 60 percent of sexually exploited children are recruited \nout of the child welfare and foster care programs. That is an \nunbelievable statistic, but it is apparently true. Because of the \ntrauma and past abuse suffered by children and youth in these systems, \nthey are particularly vulnerable to traffickers.\n  FBI officials involved in Operation Cross Country report:\n\n       Law enforcement refers to these young children as \n     ``children with a void.'' Once the\n\n[[Page S6599]]\n\n     pimp identifies that void and makes every attempt to fill it, \n     a dependency between the child and the perpetrator develops.\n\n  Law enforcement officers also report:\n\n       The most vulnerable victims forced into sex trafficking \n     range in age from 13 to 16. Most of the children come from \n     either foster care homes or are considered runaways.\n\n  In order to combat domestic sex trafficking and improve outcomes for \nchildren and youth in foster care, systemic changes need to be made in \nthe current child welfare system.\n  Therefore, today I am introducing the Improving Outcomes for Youth at \nRisk for Sex Trafficking Act of 2013. The short title of the bill is I \nO Youth.\n  We do owe these youth. These are our country's most damaged and most \nvulnerable children. Yet most kids who age out of foster care face \nnegative outcomes such as homelessness, teen pregnancy, drug addiction, \nand trafficking. We ought to do better.\n  This legislation I am introducing today addresses some of the \nwidespread conditions in the child welfare and foster care systems that \nmake these children and youth particularly vulnerable to being sexually \ntrafficked. I am sure most Americans would be surprised to learn that \nmost child welfare agencies will not serve trafficked children and \nyouth who are not in the custody of a biological or foster family or \nliving in a group home.\n  Often these children, who are not legally able to give consent for \nsex, are arrested for prostitution and referred to the juvenile justice \nsystem. In many States, the courts and the juvenile justice system are \nill-equipped to deal with the trauma these children and youth have \nendured.\n  My bill requires that States provide services to youth who have been \ntrafficked or are at risk of being trafficked. The bill also redirects \nresources to improve the current court system to better identify and \naddress needs of trafficked youth.\n  Many youth in foster care are routinely denied the opportunity to \nparticipate in normal age-appropriate activities and social events such \nas playing sports, participating in afterschool activities, and \nenjoying a social life with friends. This lack of contact and \nengagement in healthy and meaningful activities deprives young people \nof important social connections. Preventing youth from having normal \nexperiences impairs their healthy development and contributes to \nisolation and loneliness, which in turn makes them vulnerable to \ndomestic sex trafficking, homelessness, drug abuse, poor educational \noutcomes, poverty, and, of course, other negative outcomes.\n  My bill includes a number of provisions to encourage, enhance, \nsupport youth in foster care, facilitate their participation in age-\nappropriate activities and social events. I hope these provisions will \npromote healthy development, increase meaningful opportunities to form \nmeaningful connections, reduce the risk of vulnerability to domestic \nsex trafficking, and other negative outcomes.\n  Another major risk factor for vulnerability to sex trafficking and \nother negative outcomes for older youth in care is a continued reliance \non congregate care facilities. These facilities are routinely targeted \nby traffickers and are often warehouses for youth who are rarely, if \never, allowed to engage in healthy age-appropriate activities and \nsocial events.\n  I understand that many of the children and youth in foster care are \ndeeply traumatized and present with many acute physical and mental \nconditions. Some of these children and youth need intensive treatment \nto help them manage or overcome these conditions. I am pleased to \nreport there are many good providers who are doing this work who \nsupport the legislation I am introducing today.\n  I O Youth refocuses Federal priorities of connecting vulnerable youth \nwith caring, permanent families. For those remaining in congregate care \nfacilities, my legislation requires that youth have improved access to \nnormal, age-appropriate activities.\n  Youth in foster care report that they feel uninvolved, unaware, and \ndisconnected to any planning around their care or their future. They \nare not informed of their rights while in foster care. This can lead to \na sense of disenfranchisement and a lack of connection to siblings, \nrelatives, or other caring adults. In many cases, this lack of \nconnection contributes to the void so often preyed upon by traffickers.\n  My bill requires that State child welfare agencies provide ongoing \nfamily finding for older youth in foster care. I O Youth, this bill, \nalso requires greater participation of youth in planning for their \nfuture and encourages States to find individuals willing to be involved \non an ongoing basis with the youth in foster care.\n  Individuals who work with victims of domestic sex trafficking tell us \nthe single biggest challenge with access to these victims is the lack \nof accessible and affordable housing. For older youth who have been \nemancipated from foster care, not having a place to sleep is often a \nreason why they enter into the sex trade. In order to improve housing \noptions for these at-risk youth, my bill redirects funds from the \nsocial services block grant in order to provide housing to trafficked \nand other vulnerable youth.\n  We live in very contentious times. There are fierce policy and \npartisan divides on many political issues. Domestic sex trafficking of \nchildren and youth from foster care is not one of those issues. If \nthere is any issue under the Sun that is without controversy, it is \nthis one.\n  Last June, the Senate Finance Committee heard from a courageous \nsurvivor of domestic sex trafficking. She told us that she had been \nsold:\n\n       to several other pimps that had sex with me and forced me \n     to have sex with other men. My story is sad, but it's common. \n     And, girls like me are all around, but people don't see them \n     so they remain victims.\n\n  This young gentlelady went on to change her life, hold a regular job, \nand to testify against some of these so-called pimps. What a courageous \nyoung woman.\n  It is time for us to pay attention to these girls and to all the \nchildren and youth in the foster care system.\n  I expect my legislation to have broad, bipartisan support in the \nSenate. I am pleased that a number of organizations already support the \nbill, and I am particularly gratified that organizations that work \ndirectly with young people have come out so strongly in support of my \nlegislation. I have received letters from support for I O Youth from \nFosterClub, Children's Home Society of America, the National Network \nfor Young People in Foster Care, the National Center for Housing and \nChild Welfare, Covenant House International, Human Rights Project for \nGirls, The Children's Village, National Children's Alliance, and the \nInternational Centre for Missing & Exploited Children. I am hopeful the \nSenate can come together to act quickly on my legislation. We owe these \nyouth that much.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 1521. A bill to prohibit Federal agencies from requiring seafood \nto be certified as sustainable by a third party nongovernmental \norganization and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Responsible \nSeafood Certification and Labeling Act which I am introducing today. \nThis bill addresses an issue of great importance to fishermen, seafood \nproducers and coastal communities in my state and around the country--\nthe issue of how fisheries are managed sustainably. Based on the most \nrecent economic data, the Alaska seafood industry supported more than \n63,000 direct jobs and contributed over $4.6 billion to the state's \neconomy. Nationally, those numbers go up to 165,800 total jobs and an \neconomic contribution of $15.7 billion.\n  The salmon fisheries are a major part of my State's seafood economy \nand commercial fishermen around the State harvested more than 265 \nmillion salmon this season. With nearly 1 in 7 Alaskans employed in the \ncommercial seafood industry, and numbers like the ones I just shared, \nyou can understand why I take seriously how the Federal Government \naffects my State's fishermen.\n  On June 5, the National Park Service announced new guidelines to \npromote healthy food options for concessionaires at National Park \nService facilities. These guidelines include the following statement:\n\n       Where seafood options are offered, provide only those that \n     are `Best Choice' or `Good\n\n[[Page S6600]]\n\n     Alternatives' on the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch \n     list, certified sustainable by the Marine Stewardship \n     Council, or identified by an equivalent program that has been \n     approved by the NPS.\n\n  Within the week, I was hearing from constituents, and they were not \nhappy. Digging further into the origins led to policies developed by \nthe Department of Health and Human Services and the General Services \nAdministration that served as precursors to the NPS Guidelines, and an \nindication that this is a broader problem within the Federal \nGovernment.\n  How bad could this be? Why are these guidelines a problem? Why I am \nso concerned? Before delving into those questions, I want to \nacknowledge what some of you may know: Alaska salmon is a `Best Choice' \naccording to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. You can check your smart phone \napp. Problem solved, no impediment to the Park Service allowing its \nvendors to serve Wild Alaska salmon to its visitors, or any other \nFederal agency creating a problem for wild Alaska seafood . . . right? \nWrong! It is a problem, a big problem, and here is why.\n  I believe it is bad Federal policy to allow third party certifiers, \nincluding Non-Governmental Organizations, NGOs, from the UK, to be the \narbiters of what seafood is allowed to be sold in National Parks, or \nprocured by Federal agencies. Not too long ago, wild Alaska salmon \nserved as the flagship species for--MSC. Now MSC is disparaging the \n``sustainability'' of Alaska salmon. These NGOs have political agendas, \nlack transparency, and are soliciting payment for their certification \nschemes. These NGOs are meddling, and their efforts to usurp Federal \nand State management expertise is harming U.S. seafood interests. What \nstarted as voluntary efforts to differentiate well-managed fisheries, \nto create market value for seafood products, to reward responsible \nfishermen and processors, has turned into an aggressive scheme \napparently intent on taking over federal and state management \nresponsibilities, intruding into the fabric of fisheries management in \nmy State and around the country. The U.S. currently spends almost a \nbillion tax dollars each year to sustainably manage American fisheries \nin compliance with the Magnuson-Stevens Act. There is no reason to let \ngroups with no accountability interfere with this process.\n  On July 12 I sent a letter to HHS, GSA, and the Park Service stating \nmy concerns, defending wild Alaska seafood, and requesting that all \nthree agency heads meet with me to discuss how to change these \nguidelines. At an Energy and Natural Resources Committee oversight \nhearing on the Park Service's maintenance backlog, I questioned \nDirector Jarvis on this issue. When Director Jarvis responded that he \nwould make sure wild Alaska seafood would be included, I said that is \nnot good enough, this is a national issue important to seafood \ninterests around the country, and federal agency regulations, policies \nand guidelines need to be changed to eliminate the references to third \nparty certification NGOs.\n  The bill I am introducing today will prohibit any U.S. Federal agency \nfrom requiring or endorsing the use of any third party non-governmental \norganization's label, criteria or other scheme to certify fish or \nseafood as sustainable. This prohibition will apply to any federal \nagency's purchase of fish or seafood, the sale of fish or seafood by a \nvendor or lessee on federal land or property, and any reference to a \nseafood sustainability standard developed by a third party non-\ngovernmental organization in any regulation, policy or guideline.\n  This is the right Federal policy for the Alaska seafood industry, and \nfor our Nation's fishermen and coastal communities that depend on \nhealthy and sustainable fisheries. It also is the right policy to \nensure that hard working fishermen and the coastal communities that \ndepend on them are not disadvantaged by the agenda of several misguided \nNGOs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Brown, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. \n        Johnson of South Dakota):\n  S. 1523. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code to make permanent \nqualified school construction bonds and qualified zone academy bonds, \nto treat qualified zone academy bonds as specified tax credit bonds, \nand to modify the private business contribution requirement for \nqualified zone academy bonds; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I am proud to partner with \nSenator Sherrod Brown to introduce the Rebuilding America's Schools \nAct. This legislation would provide a permanent path forward so our \nNation's students can learn in high-quality settings. Investing in \neducation is key to the future success of our Nation, so we have to \nmake choices that support teachers and strong curricula, textbooks, and \ntechnology. We must also invest in school facilities.\n  Studies show that the learning environment affects students' academic \nachievement, as well as their behavior. It also makes a difference in \nthe effectiveness of teachers. When the Department of Education asked \nprincipals about the caliber of their facilities in 2005, 43 percent \nreported that environmental factors like excessive noise, poor \nlighting, or inadequate ventilation interfered with instruction. The \nnumber was even higher when it came to portable or temporary buildings \nand classrooms. Building on these sentiments is a recent report by the \nAmerican Society of Civil Engineers, which gave our Nation's school \nfacilities a grade of ``D.'' Clearly, we have significant work to do.\n  I have fought for many years to provide the Federal support needed to \nhelp improve our existing schools and build new ones, so that our \nstudents have the best environment possible to learn and grow. For most \nstudents, their school is the center of their lives. School is where \nfriendships are built, knowledge is gained, and the foundation is laid \nfor them to excel in society.\n  The Rebuilding America's Schools Act would provide important \nadditional Federal resources to build and renovate schools through the \nqualified zone academy bond program and the Qualified School \nConstruction Bond Program. Since 1998, qualified zone academy bonds \nhave helped renovate and repair schools in every State. In 2010-2011, \nschool districts in 49 States used $11 billion in qualified school \nconstruction bond financing to build and renovate 21st century schools \nin communities across the country. The need is great--the National \nEducation Association estimates that our public school systems need as \nmuch as $322 billion to bring our school facilities up to modern \nstandards. Our legislation would make significant progress in helping \nto finance these desperately needed improvements.\n  In addition to helping make sure that no child has to attend classes \nat a deteriorating school, this legislation will help create good-\npaying construction jobs and stimulate our local economies.
