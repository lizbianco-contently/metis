Mr. President, as I have indicated, we are going to take up \nthis important government funding bill today. Senator Mikulski, the \nChair of the Appropriations Committee, has performed an extraordinary \nservice in negotiating this bill. And I think it is fair to give a nod \nto Senator Shelby, of course, who has been involved in this. They get \nalong extremely well and set a good standard for everyone in the \nSenate.\n  The bill achieves many of our important priorities. It gives the \nAffordable Care Act the secure financial footing it deserves, gives our \nmilitary the tools it needs to combat ISIS, it addresses the rape kit \nbacklog, helping police and prosecutors prevent sexual assault, it \nincreases funding for students' loans, ensures that the President's \nExecutive action in protecting families can move forward, and it \nprovides funding to fight the Ebola epidemic.\n  There are lots of other things in it. I have just hit a few of the \nhighlights from my perspective.\n  There are things in this bill that I wouldn't have included--the \nDemocrats wouldn't have included had we written the bill alone. I don't \nsupport the weakening of Dodd-Frank and the restrictions on the \nDistrict of Columbia and other things, but I didn't write this bill. \nSenate Democrats didn't write this bill alone. It is a compromise. That \nis what legislation is all about.\n  The Presiding Officer has been a Governor for the State of Maine. He \nis now a legislator and has been a legislator, and he knows that \nlegislation is the art of compromise. Any chief executive who has to \nwork with a legislature, as Presidents of the United States do, does \nnot get everything he wants. Legislation is a compromise. And that is \nwhat this legislation is.\n  We are going to consider this legislation to keep our government open \nand funded, and we are going to do it today--I hope. There are Senators \nwho are unhappy with this legislation, and they will have a chance to \nmake their objections heard. I hope we can complete work on this bill \nas soon as we finish the Defense bill. That depends on everyone's \ncooperation here. But there isn't a lot of time. The government funding \nruns out at 12 o'clock midnight on Saturday.\n  When we started this Congress, the government was running on \nautopilot. Since 2011, we have lurched from crisis to crisis, with the \ncountry constantly under threat of a shutdown or financial catastrophe. \nIt is a very bad habit, and one the American people are very, very \ntired of, as they should be.\n  This bill is, I repeat, far from perfect. But when we pass it, we \nwill be able to end this Congress knowing we put our country on a more \nsecure financial footing than when this Congress started. We can then \ngo home to our States, tell our constituents we passed legislation that \nkeeps America safe, makes college more affordable, spurs the economy, \nand keeps our government operating.\n  Talk about a CR for 3 months should scare everyone. So we are not \nthere. We are going to have a bill that funds this government for the \nnext fiscal year. We can be satisfied that we left our priorities \nbetter funded and more secure, and our government on a more sound \nfoundation than when this Congress began.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/12/senate-section/article/S6700-2", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6700-S6701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MARK PRYOR\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am going to take just a minute, because \ntime is running out, to talk about a couple of Senators.\n  I rise to honor Senator Mark Pryor of Arkansas upon his departure \nfrom this institution. I have been in the Senate 28 years, and there \nhas been a Pryor here for 22 of those years. I first worked with Mark's \ndad, David Pryor. David Pryor left this institution because he had \nquite a significant heart attack. What a fine Senator. I have said \nbefore, and I will say again, he was the best legislator I ever served \nwith, whether during my experience in the State legislature of Nevada \nor here: David Pryor. He was very, very good.\n  Six years after David left, Mark came. What a good legislator he is. \nHe is just such a fine person. But it is no surprise to me that he \nfollowed in his dad's footsteps. After all, the Pryor family has worked \nas public servants in Arkansas for five generations. Mark's great-\ngreat-grandfather was a sheriff. Mark's great-grandfather was a \nsheriff. Mark's grandfather Edgar was a county sheriff also in \nArkansas. In fact, just last year, an Arkansan said to Mark: ``I'm for \nMark Pryor not because of his dad David but because of Edgar.'' That is \nhow deep the Pryor roots run in Arkansas.\n  On Mark's desk is a plaque that reads: ``Arkansas Comes First.'' This \nwas a plaque that was on his dad's desk and that Mark put on his desk. \nThis has been Mark's mission since he has been here--to put Arkansas \nfirst. The Senate and the entire country have benefited from the \ninfluence of the Pryors in the United States Senate--David and Mark.\n  Mark was born in Fayetteville, grew up in Little Rock, and attended \nthe University of Arkansas as an undergraduate and later to law school. \nWhile working as an attorney in private practice, he began his public \nservice in 1990, when he ran for a seat in the House of \nRepresentatives. He was elected and served there for 4 years.\n  In 1996, Mark was faced with the fight of his life. He had a \nsituation occur near his Achilles tendon on one of his legs. They tried \nphysical therapy, but it didn't seem to get well, and they discovered \nhe had a very rare form of cancer--clear-cell sarcoma--in his left leg. \nSo it is an understatement to say it was a trying experience for Mark. \nHe was faced with the prospect of dying or losing his leg.\n  Mark was buoyed in this difficult experience that he had by his \nfamily, his friends, and the people of Arkansas praying for him. It was \nquite a spiritual experience for Mark and his family. This experience \ndeepened his compassion for those who suffer physically, financially, \nand emotionally, and he has translated that into his public service.\n  In 1998, he was elected attorney general of the State of Arkansas. In \nhis 2002 Senatorial election he bucked the national trend to become the \nonly Democrat to defeat a Republican incumbent. Bucking trends would \nquickly become one of his hallmarks here on Capitol Hill. As a Senator, \nhe has shown courage in voting according to his conscience.\n  Key among his legislative accomplishments have been bills to extend \ntax benefits and improve medical services for men and women to make the \nproducts that people buy, especially children, safe. He has also been a \nstrong advocate for honest and transparent business practices in order \nto preserve our American tradition of responsible free enterprise.\n  His respect for tradition extends to the Senate itself. I say this \nfor a number of reasons, but once a reporter asked him what he would do \nif he had absolute power over Congress. In his characteristic fashion, \nhe responded he would instill in his fellow Senators greater respect \nfor each other and for the world's greatest deliberative body. That is \nwhat Mark Pryor said.\n  While some may have disagreed with Mark, they never ever questioned \nhis sincerity, his integrity. I admire his impeccable dedication to his \nconscience.\n  Mark Twain said:\n\n       The proper office of a friend is to side with you when you \n     are in the wrong. Nearly anybody will side with you when you \n     are in the right.\n\n  With apologies to Mark Twain, if eternal agreement were the price of \nfriendship, we would all have fewer friends. Friendship can transcend \npolicy preferences, as Mark's and mine do. We agree on most everything. \nThere are a few things we don't agree on politically, but that doesn't \nmatter. It doesn't matter because he is my friend.\n  He is a friend to my wife and me. It is no secret there are many \npeople--the Republican leader and his wife--who reached out to console \nme and Landra during her terrible accident, and then when the cancer \nwas ravaging her body. But she pulled through that. And one reason she \ndid, I am convinced, is Mark Pryor. Mark Pryor, who almost died from \ncancer, called my wife often--often--texted her often telling her: You \nare going to be OK; don't be afraid. So my wife loves Mark Pryor.\n\n[[Page S6701]]\n\n  We were talking about the elections not long ago, and I said: I have \nnever prayed to win an election, and this election I didn't either. She \nsaid: Well, I did. That is how she feels about Mark Pryor.\n  I am really honored to have served with Mark Pryor, who is such a \ngenuine person, so sincere. He has been an invaluable asset, his \nservice here in the Senate. I congratulate Mark on his exemplary \nservice here in the Senate.\n  Mark will always be my friend. There is a quote that bears directly \non my feelings about Senator Pryor: ``A good friend is hard to find, \nhard to lose, and impossible to forget.'' I will never ever forget Mark \nPryor. He is a unique, one of a kind, kind, thoughtful, considerate \nman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/12/senate-section/article/S6701-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this morning I would like to wish a \nfond farewell to a woman we are all going to miss: Nancy Erickson, the \nSecretary of the Senate.\n  It is her birthday today. Nancy is the kind of person you would \nexpect to get cards from Democrats and Republicans on a day like this. \nAnd it is no secret why. She is fair, she is honest, she has always had \na warm smile on her face. And that is no small matter, because Nancy \nhas a really tough job. The title doesn't do it justice. Nancy admits \nshe had to Google ``Secretary of the Senate'' when the position was \noffered to her.\n  Let me tell you a little more about what Nancy does. On the one hand, \nthere is an administrative element to her position. That is true. We \nwould run out of printer paper without her. But she is also the keeper \nof this institution.\n  Nancy respects the Senate. In fact, she loves the Senate. Her \ngreatest joy is overseeing preservation of the Senate's storied art and \nhistory.\n  I am particularly grateful to her efforts to secure and repair an \nimportant painting of my personal hero, Henry Clay. I understand it was \na painstaking process, but it was a credit to the Senate and to our \ncommon history as America.\n  Here is the point: Nancy may be a ``Secretary,'' but only in the way \nyou would think of John Kerry or Condoleezza Rice being a \n``Secretary.'' In other words, Nancy is pretty important.\n  She presides over the Chamber. She signs the bills we pass. And, \nimportantly to the Senate staff, she signs the checks they receive. So, \nyou see, Nancy is actually a minor celebrity around here on payday.\n  But she is something else entirely on game day. Nancy is one of the \nbiggest Packers fans you will ever meet. There is no interrupting her \nwhen the green and gold take the field. Fortunately for Nancy, her \nhome-State Senator John Thune feels the same way. So you often see the \ntwo South Dakotans--one a Democrat, the other a Republican--debating \nthe finer points of last night's game.\n  There is a reason I say this. Nancy goes out of her way to build \ntrust across the aisle, even in unconventional ways. The folks in my \noffice who work closest with Nancy have nothing but kind words to say \nabout her. Some call her a personal friend. In fact, the remarkable \nwoman I nominated to replace Nancy, Julie Adams, is just such a person. \nI know Nancy couldn't be happier for Julie, and neither could I.\n  And while Nancy is going to miss the Senate, I know she is also \nlooking forward to seeing more of her family. I know how important \nNancy's parents are to her in particular. We are glad Nancy will be \nable to see more of them, even though we are going to miss her.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Sheila Dwyer\n\n  The Senate is also going to miss Nancy's deputy. Sheila Dwyer is \nanother Democrat my staff can't speak highly enough of. Sheila has had \na long run here in the Senate. She has seen it from a lot of different \nangles. She has been a page, a scheduler, and now Assistant Secretary \nof the Senate. Along the way, she has worked for members such as \nMoynihan, Hollings, and Robb. It is an impressive career. It makes you \nunderstand why, as Leader Reid mentioned earlier, Sheila is known \naround here as the ``Mayor of Capitol Hill.''\n\n\n                Tribute to Robert Paxton and Mark Tratos\n\n  We also can't forget to wish a fond farewell to Robert Paxton and \nMark Tratos.\n  Robert, Nancy's chief of staff, is a fellow Kentuckian who has worked \nin the Senate for more than a quarter century. And we understand that \nMark, Robert's No. 2, is expecting his first child soon.\n  So we wish both Robert and Mark all the best, just as we offer Sheila \nwell-deserved recognition for a job well done, just as we bid the \nfondest of farewells to Nancy--and a very happy birthday as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/12/senate-section/article/S6701-3", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                         Farewell to the Senate\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, after 36 years as a Member of the United \nStates Senate, this is likely my last opportunity to address its \nMembers as colleagues, and to address the people of my State as \nconstituents, and to thank them for placing their trust in me.\n  The highest honor any citizen of a democracy can receive is to be \nelected to represent his or her fellow Americans to be their fiduciary.\n  To the Senate staff, including the floor staff, the Capitol Police, \nand those throughout the Capitol complex who work so hard to keep \nthings here moving, thank you for your service and support for us \nthrough the long days and nights.\n  To my staff, thank you for your strong loyalty to the people of \nMichigan, to our Nation, and to me. And thank you for believing in \npublic service. I am immensely proud of what the men and women who have \nworked on my staff for the last 36 years have helped to accomplish.\n  My staff back in Michigan has helped make communities across our \nState safer and more prosperous. Countless times they have helped \nindividual constituents resolve an issue, making a real difference in \nthousands of lives.\n  The Armed Services Committee and Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations--PSI--staffs have worked tirelessly through long hours \nand complex issues, sacrificing nights and weekends and vacations to \nhelp address the pressing issues of our Nation.\n  My personal office staff has been instrumental in addressing a \nbreathtaking range of issues--from preserving our American auto \nindustry, to making our tax system fairer, to protecting our \nirreplaceable Great Lakes, to making medicine available to fight \naddiction, and much, much more.\n  As to my mentor, my big brother Sandy, Congress is keeping the better \nhalf of ``Team Levin,'' as I retire to Michigan while Sandy remains in \nCongress.\n  To Barbara, my wife of 53 years, to our three daughters Kate, Laura, \nand Erica; to their husbands Howard, Daniel, and Rick; and to our six \ngrandchildren, Bess and Samantha, Mark,\n\n[[Page S6702]]\n\nNoa, and Ben Levin, and Beatrice and Olivia Fernandez--thank you for \nyour love and support, which has meant so much to me.\n  I have been asked many times if I am leaving the Senate out of \nfrustration with gridlock. The answer is: No. My family and friends, \nand those of you with whom I serve, know how much I love the Senate and \nthat I will love my work until the last day here, and that I will leave \nhere with unabashed confidence in the Senate's ability to weather \nstorms and to meet the Nation's needs.\n  I know firsthand the challenges before this Senate. I believe one of \nthe greatest is the need to meet the fundamental economic challenge of \nthis era: the growing gap in our society between a fortunate few and \nthe vast majority of Americans whose fortunes have stagnated or fallen.\n  While I believe that the economists who tell us this inequality is \nholding back economic growth are right, this isn't just about economic \ndata. It is about our Nation's heart and soul. This growing gulf \nbetween a fortunate few and a struggling many is a threat to the dream \nthat has animated this Nation since its founding, the dream that hard \nwork leads to a better life for us and for our children.\n  To restore the connection between hard work and greater opportunity, \nI hope the next Congress will act on many fronts, strengthening \neducation and worker training programs, making greater investments in \ninfrastructure and research that foster growth. And as I have said here \nmany times, it should pay for these needed investments by closing \negregious tax loopholes that serve no economic purpose, but enrich some \nof the wealthiest among us and our most profitable corporations.\n  Many foresee a continuation of polarization and partisanship in the \nSenate and say it is naive to suggest that the next Congress might come \ntogether, break out of gridlock, and accomplish great things. But I \nknow the Senate can do better because I have seen it happen with my own \neyes.\n  The Senate has indeed demonstrated, even in our own era, that \nbipartisanship is not extinct. The Senate Armed Services Committee has \nupheld a more than 50-year tradition of bipartisan cooperation to \nproduce an annual Defense Authorization Act that advances the security \nof our Nation. I am grateful to the members of the U.S. military and \ntheir families for their selfless sense of duty. But I am also grateful \nfor the way they have inspired us, year after year, to come together \nacross lines of party and ideology to support them. They not only \nprotect us, they unite us. Congress has come together over the years to \nmake improvements in pay, benefits, and health care for the men and \nwomen of the military; to reform the way in which we buy the weapons \nthey use to carry out their missions; to adopt policies to protect them \nfrom sexual assault; and to provide improved education benefits through \na modern GI bill, and reform the way in which we care for our wounded \nwarriors. We are training and equipping the militaries of nations under \nassault by extremists and religious fanatics so that those nations can \ndepend more on themselves for their own security and less on America's \nsons and daughters.\n  We have passed a defense authorization bill to accomplish these \nthings each year for more than half a century by laying aside partisan \ndifferences for the common good. We have never allowed disagreements \nover policy to interfere with our duty to our troops and their \nfamilies, and I am deeply grateful to the many ranking Republican \npartners I have been fortunate to work with in that endeavor: people \nsuch as John McCain and John Warner and Jim Inhofe.\n  John McCain, my great friend, who has demonstrated extraordinary \ncourage in war and in this Senate, will take the gavel of the Armed \nServices Committee, and my trusted wingman and friend Jack Reed will \nbecome ranking member. At a pivotal moment for the Senate and for this \nNation, the Armed Services Committee will be in strong hands.\n  I have seen firsthand additional powerful evidence that the Senate \ncan work together to meet the Nation's needs, and that is in the work \nof the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations--PSI--which I have been \nprivileged to chair for 10 years, working with Republican partners--and \nI use the word partners advisedly--such as Tom Coburn, John McCain, and \nSusan Collins. Our subcommittee has exposed the tax avoidance schemes \nof some of the most powerful corporations and wealthiest individuals. \nWe have shined a light on abusive credit card practices. We have \ninvestigated wasteful and ineffective government programs. We have \nconfronted market manipulators and exposed conflicts of interest, \nmortgage fraud, and reckless schemes by some of the most powerful \nbanks, schemes aided by some of the largest accounting and law firms. \nWe have demonstrated how those activities helped bring our economy to \nits knees, destroying jobs, reducing the value of our homes, and \ndamaging our neighborhoods. The work of PSI has helped lead to reforms \nthat have strengthened our financial system and reduced credit card \nabuses.\n  The power of PSI lies in the in-depth work of our staffs, and in the \nwillingness to confront powerful and entrenched interests. Like the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, PSI is strengthened by a dedication to \nbipartisanship and a respect for the rights of the Senate minority. We \nhave recognized the danger of using investigative power for partisan or \npolitical purposes, and we have ensured that our great staffs, majority \nand minority, participate together in every investigation.\n\n  Indeed it is protection of the minority that is the singular hallmark \nof the Senate. The majority cannot always have its way. The Senate is \nmore than just a place where the hot tea is cooled in the deliberative \nsaucer that President Washington famously spoke of. Protections for the \nminority make the Senate more than just a place to slow things down; \nthose protections make it a place where we work things out. It is those \nprotections that force compromise that is essential to unifying and \ngoverning our country. Making progress in the Senate requires solutions \nthat while they may not provide everyone with everything they want, are \nbroadly accepted as in the common interest. When compromise is thwarted \nby ideological rigidity or by abuse of the rights that our rules afford \nus, the Senate can become paralyzed, unable to achieve the lofty task \nthat the Founders set forth before us.\n  Polarization is exacerbated by forces outside this Chamber. For \ninstance, we seem to make news more often these days by our responses \nin the corridors outside this Chamber to reporters questioning us about \nthe latest breaking story or rumor than we do by debating or \nlegislating inside this Chamber. The viral nature of information and \ndisinformation and the expectation that public officials will be \nimmediately responsive to every news flash with but a few seconds to \nthink through the implications or consequences or pros and cons has led \ntoo often to less thoughtful discourse, and that has helped drive \nrhetorical wedges between us.\n  The incoming Senate has an opportunity to restore a greater measure \nof bipartisan compromise by revisiting one of the most contentious \nissues we face, one that we struggled with at the beginning of this \nCongress; that is, the Senate rules.\n  I believe the excessive use of the filibuster to obstruct \nconfirmation of President Obama's nominees was damaging to the Senate \nand to the Nation. Any President--Democratic or Republican--should have \nthe ability to choose his or her team. But the Senate majority \neliminated obstructions to Presidential nominations through the use of \nthe nuclear option, effectively accomplishing a rules change outside \nthe rules, a method I could not support. In doing so, a precedent was \nestablished that the majority could effectively change the rules as it \nwished by overruling the Chair and the Parliamentarian. That precedent \nwill not serve the country well in the future because it leaves the \nminority with no protection, diminishing the unique role of the Senate.\n  I hope the Senate next year considers reversing that precedent while \nsimultaneously--and I emphasize simultaneously--amending the rules so \nas to assure the President's ability to fulfill his or her \nconstitutional duties. Put simply, I believe the Senate should do the \nright thing in the right way. It\n\n[[Page S6703]]\n\nshould amend the Senate rules, as provided for in the rules, to adopt \nthe substance of the changes we made last year. I know my good friend \nSenator Lamar Alexander, who was part of the bipartisan Group of 8 who \nworked closely and successfully together on this issue in 2012, has \nproposed something similar. Such action by the Senate next year would \nbe a welcome victory for comity and for compromise, and it would I hope \nrepresent a step back from a precedent that leads to effective rules \nchanges by simple majority. It would be a step toward a better \nfunctioning Senate.\n  No leader alone, no single Senator, neither party by itself, can \ndetermine the Senate's course, but together the Members of this body \ncan move the Senate forward and in doing so help move forward the \nNation we all love. I will enjoy reading about the Senate's progress in \nthe years ahead as Barbara and I are sitting on a Lake Michigan beach \nor showing the world to our grandchildren.\n  I thank the Chair, I thank my dear friends, the leaders of this body, \nand I see my brother sitting here, and I am not allowed to refer to my \nfamily in the Gallery, so I will not do that.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                         TRIBUTES TO CARL LEVIN\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, during his 36 years representing Michigan \nin the Senate, Senator Carl Levin's character and expertise have been \ndescribed in many ways. He has been named by Time magazine as one of \nthe 10 best Senators. He has been hailed by our military as a leader on \nnational security. He is recognized by families in Michigan and \nthroughout our country as a dedicated champion for economic opportunity \nand fairness.\n  But perhaps the best description of Senator Levin's philosophy of \npublic service is a word he himself used in an interview for the George \nMitchell Oral History Project at Bowdoin College in Maine. That word is \n``fiduciary.''\n  It is the word that embraces the concepts of trust and confidence, of \nethics and responsibility. In that interview Senator Levin elaborated \non what the word means to him as a public servant. He said it meant to \nbe accessible and open, to listen to other points of view, and to be \nwell informed. Then when it is time to decide, to use his best judgment \nand vote for what is best for his State and his country, even though it \nmay not be the popular choice at the time.\n  ``Fiduciary'' may indeed be the best word to describe our colleague \nSenator Levin; but to me, based upon decades of firsthand experience, \nthere is another phrase that also comes to mind. He is truly a \nSenator's Senator. My colleagues may be surprised to learn that I have \nknown Senator Levin far longer than most of the Members of this \nChamber. You see, when he was first elected to the Senate in 1978, the \nsame year as Maine Senator Bill Cohen, for whom I was working at the \ntime, both of them served on what was then known as a Senate \nGovernmental Affairs Committee and also on the same subcommittee, \nOversight of Government Management, for which I was first the minority \nstaff director and then the majority staff director. So I have known \nand worked with Senator Levin for the entire time he has been a Member \nof this Chamber. From the very start, Senator Levin's diligence as a \nwatchdog for the American people impressed me.\n  Ten years after I left the committee, I returned as Senator Cohen's \nsuccessor and sought a seat on the Governmental Affairs Committee \nprecisely because, thanks to the example of Senator Levin and Senator \nCohen, I saw the importance of accountability in government and \nbusiness practices. As the chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, it was my honor to begin my Senate service with Senator \nLevin as our ranking member, who was a far more experienced Senator \nthan I was at the time.\n  So I have seen firsthand how deeply Senator Levin cares about the \nSenate as an institution and its unique place in our Constitution and \nin its role in our system of government. He is a person of \nextraordinary integrity and has a sense of purpose that sets a high \nstandard for all of us in public service.\n  He works well with Senators across the aisle because he works hard. \nFrom the very first time I saw Senator Levin in action back in 1978, I \nsaw the importance that he placed on extensive, exhaustive preparation \nfor our committee investigations and hearings. As many evasive or ill-\nprepared witnesses learned to their chagrin, the eyes behind those \ntrademark reading glasses focused like a laser because he has always \ndone his homework.\n  If Senator Levin were to be remembered for his contributions to just \none area of policy, it would be our Nation's defense. He has been a \nmember of the Armed Services Committee throughout his time in the \nSenate, including 10 years as both the chairman and the ranking member. \nDuring our work together on that committee, I saw his mastery of such \ncomplex matters as emerging global threats and advanced weapons \nsystems. Above all, his focus has always been on the men and women in \nuniform and their families, from improving their standard of living to \nbetter caring for our wounded warriors.\n  As a fiduciary of the principles that are our Nation's foundation, \nCarl Levin has been a faithful trustee and truly a Senator's Senator. I \ncannot imagine this body without him, without his wisdom, his \nintegrity, his insight. So I thank him for his years of extraordinary \nservice, and I wish him all the best in the years to come.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, Senator Carl Levin has been my Senator \nfor 36 years, and it has been one of the great honors of my life to \nserve for the last 14 years as his partner, as well as his friend, \nrepresenting Michigan.\n  The year he was elected, ``Grease'' was the year's highest grossing \nmovie and ``Staying Alive'' was music's biggest hit, and you should see \nSenator Levin dance. So Senator Levin has outlasted disco, the Soviet \nUnion, and all six of the people who challenged him in elections, \nincluding an astronaut. That is because integrity never goes out of \nstyle.\n  Senator Levin has never wavered in his devotion to Michigan and to \nhis country. As we heard today and as we each know, he has brought that \npatriotism to the Armed Services Committee. No one has done more to \nensure that our men and women in uniform are battle-ready, with the \nsupplies and technology they need to be the best military in the world, \nthan Senator Carl Levin, or to make sure they receive fair pay and full \nhealth benefits. Carl Levin puts his coalition together year after year \nto make that happen.\n  He has never lost faith in government's capacity to be a force for \ngood, and we heard that again in his comments today. This was passed \ndown to him from his parents, who saw how the New Deal rescued families \nfrom desperate poverty.\n  A young Carl Levin admired President Harry Truman--especially Truman, \nthe Senator who drove cross-country, stopping in cities where defense \ncontractors were committing fraud and waste at the expense of America's \nwartime economy.\n  Truman himself would be very proud to see Senator Levin leading the \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations. As a former civil rights \nattorney, Senator Levin relished the chance to cross-examine those he \nsuspected of dishonesty toward taxpayers and the American people. It is \nnot literally a trial-by-fire, but that committee room has definitely \nbecome a sweat lodge for unscrupulous executives or anyone who has \ntried to get rich by getting one over on average Americans. They sweat \nbecause they know Senator Levin has done his homework--boy, has he done \nhis homework. He digs so deep, he knows more about what they are going \nto say than they do.\n  David used a slingshot to bring down Goliath, but Carl Levin can \ntopple a tycoon with nothing but a binder full of subpoenaed documents, \nand we have all seen him do it. In 2007 he shined a light on abusive \npractices of credit card companies, leading to laws that have brought \nabout more transparency. Thanks to Senator Carl Levin, your credit card \nstatement contains more disclosures so you know what is going on.\n  Those of us in Michigan also see a softer, gentler side. His heart is \nin Detroit, where he was born and raised and now lives with his wife \nBarbara. His soul is nourished by the tranquility he finds in northern \nMichigan in the\n\n[[Page S6704]]\n\nUpper Peninsula--Isle Royale, a place to which he has made many trips.\n  If you have been to Detroit recently, you know the city is in the \nmidst of a spectacular comeback. I believe it is the most spectacular \ncomeback in modern history. Everywhere you look, you see evidence of \nSenator Carl Levin's hard work. He led the way on getting Federal \nfunding for Detroit's International Riverfront, which is spectacular. \nHe worked with me and others in leading the effort to secure critical \nfunding for the M-1 Rail project, championing that every step of the \nway--a streetcar that will inject even more vibrancy to the historic \nWoodward Avenue, which is already attracting scores of entrepreneurs \nand small businesses.\n  Five years ago I was proud to stand with Senator Levin as we \npassionately worked to rescue our American automobile industry and give \nthem a chance to grow and move forward, and I saw his commitment and \nfiery passion for making sure we did not let them down, the men and \nwomen who worked so hard in Michigan and across the country. That \nrevival has done so much to lift the economy of greater Detroit and all \nof Michigan.\n  Senator Levin knows that manufacturing is the backbone of our State's \neconomy, but he also knows that the landscapes, the soil, and the water \nare all part of who we are, including our Great Lakes. It is in our \nDNA, and I know it is in his. That is why he has pushed for years to \nhelp Sleeping Bear Dunes be recognized as a national lakeshore, and we \nare seeing the outcome of his work as we look at this beautiful \nnational resource. He fought for the Federal sanctuary at Thunder Bay \nand for the creation of the Keweenaw National Historic Park. It has \nbeen an honor for me to stand with him as he chaired our Great Lakes \nTask Force, our bipartisan task force, and fight for funding for the \nGreat Lakes Restoration Initiative, which has had a miraculous effect \non the quality of freshwater that is vital for Michigan and the Nation.\n  I could stand here for hours talking about his accomplishments, the \nfootprints and handprints and marks he has made on Michigan and, most \nimportantly, the people and communities of Michigan. But, as we heard \nthis morning from colleagues and will continue to hear, they are small \nin comparison to the testament of his character, his compassion, his \nhumor, and the unassailable strength of his convictions.\n  Senator Levin, you will be missed in Michigan and certainly by me and \nthe Senate. I know you and Barbara and your daughters and \ngrandchildren, including your one grandson--who is kind of \noutnumbered--will be grateful to have you so you can show them the \nworld from your perspective and show them the continued beauty of \nMichigan. You have given so much, and we are grateful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I wish to talk about Senator Levin \nfrom a different perspective than my colleagues have. There is a \nseduction that goes on around here. You can get lulled into a false \nsense of security by excellent staff. Carl Levin is fortunate that he \nhas excellent staff, but what many of us are tempted to do at times is \nto allow staff to do the arcane and tedious work of checking statutory \nlanguage.\n  I have been blessed to have a front-row seat to watch Carl Levin \nwork. From my seat on the Armed Services Committee and on the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, I have not only watched his excellent \nstaff, I have watched Carl Levin. This is a man who understands every \nnook and cranny of statutory construction. He would never be lulled \ninto a false sense of security that he understood the bill just because \nof what he was told.\n  I will think of Carl Levin fondly in one way: his shoulders slightly \nstooped, his hand grasping a piece of paper, not an electronic device, \nhim walking quickly toward me with his head down, peering over those \nubiquitous glasses, saying: Claire, have you read the language? Claire, \nhave you read the language? Read the language. Read the language.\n  He understands the hazards of a misplaced comma. He understands the \ndanger of using an ``and'' instead of an ``or.'' He understands that \nthe essence of our work is to make sure we craft language that lives up \nto our purpose and ideals.\n  Carl Levin is a Senator's Senator. There are no sharp elbows, no \nheated rhetoric, and, frankly, there is no star power on cable TV. No \none is dying to get Carl in front of a camera because he will say \nsomething incendiary or pick a fight, which all of our friends are \nanxious for us to do--if we would only pick a fight.\n  Carl is methodically doing the grind-it-out work of legislating. He \nhas the tools of a great Senator: intellect, integrity, good manners, \nand an unsurpassed work ethic. I will always call him my most important \nmentor in the Senate. He has taught me more than I can ever say. I will \ntry desperately to live up to the ideal he has set for all of us.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Senator McCaskill for her comments. We are \ntalking about a Senator's Senator, a man who reads the language of the \nlegislation and knows how to legislate.\n  I came here 18 years ago and have served on the Armed Services \nCommittee that entire time, and my admiration and respect for Carl \nLevin has grown every year. It has grown because it is deserved. He is \na remarkable leader. He never showboats and always wants to do the \nright thing. He serves his country first, and he runs a committee that \nis, in my mind, the best-run committee--according to the ideals of the \nRepublic of which we are a part--that exists in either House today. It \njust works the way it is supposed to.\n  His subcommittees work. We have amendments in subcommittees that are \ndisputed. If you don't like the result, you bring it to the full \ncommittee, and the full committee meets, and if it takes 2 full days, \nit takes 2 full days; everybody gets to bring up their amendments.\n  Senator Levin is always brilliantly able to solve differences through \nproper wording of the committee's legislation. As Claire suggested, he \nhas an extraordinary lawyer's ability to get the right words and make \nthe bill say what the committee wants it to say. I think that is \nspecial, and I am pleased to have been a part of it.\n  The Armed Services Committee authorizes one-half of the discretionary \nbudget of the United States. It impacts the lives of men and women in \nharm's way right now. We need to get it right. It involves a lot of \nmoney and a lot of responsibility. It is a well-run committee that sets \nan example for what we ought to see more of in the Senate.\n  There is a fairness about his work. Somehow we have always passed an \nauthorization bill, and somehow it is almost always unanimous or very \nclose to unanimous. There may be one or two issues that maybe should \nnot have been tacked on to the bill that causes someone not to vote for \nit, but when it is over, normally every Member--Republican and \nDemocrat--is satisfied with the ability to have their voice heard and \ntheir ideas put into the bill, if possible. But if you lose in \nsubcommittee and you lose on the floor and you have had your say in \nboth places, it kind of makes you feel like, what more can I do? If the \nrest of the bill is OK, I will try to support it. These markups take \ntime because we are dealing with a large portion of federal funding.\n  Finally, I would like to say how much I appreciated his wisdom he \nshared with us as we dealt with the nuclear option--the so-called \nnuclear option that changed the rules of the Senate. Senator Levin, who \nis a lawyer's lawyer, said something that was very profound, and it was \nreflected again in his remarks today, and that is, if a majority can \nchange the rules, there are no rules. If a majority can change the \nrules of the Senate at a given moment to overcome objections from the \nminority, then there are virtually no minority rights--you have a pure \nmajoritarian body. I think that is what Carl was sharing with us in his \nbrilliant speech that all of us ought to read.\n  I thank our chairman for the leadership he has given and for the \ncourtesy he has shown to me and all our Members. I wish him great \nsuccess in his future endeavors, and I hope he will continue to \ncontribute his wisdom to the body politic.\n\n[[Page S6705]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, it has been summed up here, and I want the \nSenator from Michigan to hear what has been summarized so meaningfully \nby all of our colleagues, because this is the best of this institution \nin terms of how it performs. It has been embodied here in the public \nservice of Carl Levin for 36 years. What we have heard from testimonies \non both sides of the aisle is that because of how he has conducted \nhimself as an individual and how he has conducted himself as a public \nservant and how he has conducted himself as a leader in this Senate is \nan example of exactly how this institution is supposed to function.\n  Isn't it rather symbolic that on the last couple of days of the \nsession, the bill that will be passed is the bill Senator Levin has \nushered through the Senate? He never broke tradition. He made sure the \ndefense authorization bill was going to be passed by hammering out the \ndifferences with the House and shepherding it through the parliamentary \nprocess. And it has happened every year because of his extraordinary \nleadership.\n  I will close simply by saying that because he is all of the things we \nhave heard--the consummate gentleman, the humble public servant, his \nrazor-sharp mind, and the best lawyer, by the way, in the entire \nSenate--because he is all of those things, he also is the embodiment of \na Senator because when he gives someone his word, that is it. A person \ndoes not have to worry anymore.\n  The future Senate should take a lesson from the life and the \nleadership of Carl Levin from Michigan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise with honor and pleasure to be able \nto say thank you to my dear friend. I am the most junior Member, \nbesides the Presiding Officer, in this body today. When I first came to \nthe Senate, I asked to be on the Armed Services Committee. West \nVirginia has a proud heritage of an awful lot of people--percentage-\nwise probably more than most States--having served in all of the \nbranches of the military. So that is very near and dear to me, and our \nNational Guard is very near and dear to our State. So there were many \nreasons why I wanted to be on the Armed Services Committee.\n  When I got here, it was one of the most toxic times of the political \narena, if you will. It was not what I expected, to say the least. And \nseeing the toxic atmosphere that I came into, people would say it \ndidn't used to be this way; it used to work. The process worked. The \nwhole aura of the Senate was there, and we are losing that. That was \ntheir excuse for telling me that is why it is not working today, but it \nused to work.\n  Then I became part of this committee called the Armed Services \nCommittee with this unbelievable chairman whose name is Carl Levin. I \nwatched and observed. I didn't say a whole lot at first because \nfreshmen aren't supposed to, but I watched and I learned and I saw the \nsystem the way I imagined it probably was 20, 30, 40 years ago when it \ndid work. I saw the Senate, and I was thinking, Why can't the rest of \nthe Senate work the way the Armed Services Committee works? There is \none reason. We don't have enough Carl Levins. We just don't have enough \nCarl Levins.\n  Carl Levin is practical, reasonable, and sensible. It made sense to \nme what he would say.\n  Just recently I have had difficulties on a piece of legislation that \nis very important. Carl spoke to me in terms that my father would have \nspoken to me, and I understood very well: State your opposition, record \nyour opposition, and look at the whole situation as the betterment and \nthe good of the bill, which is better than basically this piece that \nyou oppose. He said I could explain my opposition.\n  Carl Levin would say this, too. He would say: Listen, I can't tell \nyou what to do. I can't tell you what to do. Really, you have to do \nwhat you think is right, but let me give you some points to think \nabout. He has been an unbelievable mentor who will give us the ability \nto kind of process this whole system we are in.\n  Let me say this, Carl. I am sorry that I didn't have the honor and \nthe opportunity and the pleasure to serve with you for many more years. \nI really am. Or I am sorry I didn't get here soon enough, whatever the \ncase may be. But the Senator from Michigan has left an impression on me \nas to how this place should work.\n  Robert C. Byrd, my predecessor, felt as passionately as you do. There \nis a process here and there is a reason for the process, which is to \nmake us talk to each other, to make this place work. There should never \nbe a situation we would get into that is important to the American \ncitizen or this country where we can't work it out and can't get at \nleast 60 votes. There should never be a time that we cannot get 60 \nvotes. If we do that, then basically just changing a rule is not going \nto change the attitude and the atmosphere we create. I believe very \nstrongly in that. And I appreciate the Senator's fight.\n  In the hills of West Virginia, we have a saying: They are good \npeople. You meet somebody and someone says, They are good people.\n  Carl, you are good people. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, one of the great honors of serving in the \nU.S. Senate--and it is a great honor to serve in this body--is the fact \nthat I have had the opportunity to serve with Carl Levin. I think \nSenator Levin represents the very best of our political system, the \nvery best of the U.S. Senate, and why I am so proud to be a part of \nthis institution.\n  I must tell my colleagues I came from the House of Representatives \nand I had the great pleasure to have as one of my closest friends in \nthe House of Representatives Carl's brother, Sandy. Sandy is an \nincredibly talented person who believes in public service, as does his \nbrother Carl, and the two of them have devoted their family reputation \nto public service and they have given so much back.\n  Carl, what you have done for our national security, for our national \ndefense, the type of attention you have paid to make sure this country \nis as well prepared as it needs to be, you have done that in an \nexemplary way. I can tell you what you have done for the people in \nMichigan, the type of Senator you have been. You have been a great U.S. \nSenator for your State, as well as a great U.S. Senator for the United \nStates. That is not always an easy balance, but you have been able to \ndo it.\n\n  As so many colleagues have said, when we seek advice, when we need a \nSenator to help us understand something, we go to Carl Levin. Some of \nmy constituents have a hard time believing that we read the bills \naround here. Carl Levin reads the bills around here. He has found \ntypographical errors in some of my legislation. He has found ways to \ncorrect us when we didn't express ourselves the way we should have. He \nwrites me notes all the time. I thank him for that dedication.\n  As several of our colleagues have pointed out, there is no one here \nwho has a greater love for the traditions--the best traditions--of the \nU.S. Senate, a Senate that debates and respects each other. One of the \ngreat opportunities I had was to sit in a room with Lamar Alexander and \nCarl Levin and others and talk about that, and how we could restore the \nbest traditions of the U.S. Senate.\n  So, Senator Levin, I want you to know, I will always be indebted to \nserving in this body with you and learning from you and recognizing \njust what one person can do to carry out the honor and dignity of \npublic service. You really define public service. For that, I am very \ngrateful, the people of Michigan are grateful, and the people of \nAmerica are grateful. Congratulations on your great service.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, it is no surprise to any of us that the \nfirst thing Carl Levin did when he spoke today was thank his staff. He \nthanked them, and then he thanked the police force and the \ngroundskeepers and the food service people and the people who too many \nin this world ignore. That was the first thing he did.\n  The second thing Carl did in his address was to talk about the gulf \nbetween the fortunate few and the struggling many. That has been what I \nmost\n\n[[Page S6706]]\n\nadmire about Carl Levin--that he is always aware of that and always \nfighting the fight for people who have a lot less privilege than those \nof us do who dress like this and get really great titles. And no one, \nfrankly--no one in this body--has stood up against special interests \nfor the most powerful interests in this town more effectively and more \nenergetically than Carl Levin. For that, I am grateful, and I know so \nmany in this country are grateful as well.\n  Thank you, Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, when I came here in 2009, we were in the \nmiddle of an enormous meltdown due to high-risk trading inside our \nmajor banks. I wondered whether we as an institution were capable of \nundertaking this challenge of changing the circumstances around that in \norder to not have another 2007, 2008 meltdown that would do so much \ndamage to families across this country. So I put out an email to \neveryone that said, Is anyone interested in taking on this issue for \nthe future stability of our financial system? The next day I came to \nthe floor and Senator Levin said, the email you sent out, I want to \ntalk to you about that. I want to partner in taking this on. \nImmediately, he basically said: ``We will work together. I am not the \nsenior Senator who wants to take over this effort,'' although I would \nhave been glad for that to happen. There was not the ego in it; there \nwas the intellect and the passion and the determination to fix a \nproblem. To me, the Senate should be about people coming together to \nfix problems to make this Nation work better.\n  That event is deeply burned into my mind. The result, because of \nSenator Levin's efforts, was the Volcker rule that said high-risk \ntrading should not be done on the banks' books, proprietary trading and \nhigh-risk instruments. It will make a significant difference in the \nyears to come.\n  But what I want to thank my colleague for is the attitude of coming \ntogether to solve the important problems for America, even if that \nmeans taking on very powerful special interests. I hope we will see a \nlot more of that from this Senate in the years to come, but it will be \na much bigger challenge without the Senator here. We will miss him \ngreatly.\n  Thank you so much, Senator, for your service to our Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the Senate at its best has been said to \nbe the one authentic piece of genius in the American political system. \nCarl Levin is the Senate at its best. I thank him for his courtesy, his \ndecency, his scholarship, and his sense of public service. I thank him \nfor his reminder that if we are going to have the trust of the American \npeople to write rules for them, we should follow our own rules.\n  It has been a privilege to serve with Senator Levin.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I too want to spend a couple of moments \nreflecting upon my long friendship and association with Senator Carl \nLevin from Michigan.\n  Much has been said this morning about Carl the person and the \nSenator. Let me say this: I don't know of anyone in this body who has \nexhibited more of an intellectual honesty, a calm demeanor, and a sense \nof fierce loyalty and perseverance. I don't know who exhibits those \nqualities more than Carl Levin.\n  Carl embodies the best of what I think it means to be both a citizen \nand a U.S. Senator. Barbara and Carl, Ruth and I have enjoyed many \nmeals together over the years, having great conversations about \neverything. I want to say to my friend Carl, I hope that Michigan and \nIowa are not so far apart, and that we can continue to get together in \nthe future.\n  I will say, Carl, right now I hope you don't hold it against me for \nall of the times the Hawkeyes will beat the Wolverines in the future. \nDon't let that be a stumbling block.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I will be very brief because I know we \nhave some other things coming up before going on to the NDAA, and I \nwill be standing here with my good friend and brother Carl at that \ntime. I recall when I was first elected to the House of \nRepresentatives--it is hard for me to believe that was 28 years ago--\nand I became good friends with a guy named Levin. It was not Carl. It \nwas his brother. There was a real sincere, lovable attitude about him. \nI can remember talking over some of these sitting by him during some of \nthe debate on very partisan things. I thought this guy is really neat. \nIt is the kind of thing where you can't dislike him. Then I came over \nhere 20 years ago, and there is another one. I have two major \ncommittees, Environment and Public Works and the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. I thought this is remarkable because while on occasion we \nwill differ--I am talking about the chairman and me--and I am the \nranking member of that committee--occasionally we will come up on an \nissue where we don't agree. On two occasions, last year and this year, \nwe had to go into this process of the ``big four.'' That is where it \ngets contentious because at that point you have to come up with a bill. \nThere was never a time that, yes, we have to give in. I don't know \nwhether he gave in more than I gave in. But whatever it was, it all had \nto happen and it did happen and it happened because of Carl more than \nme.\n  Chairman Levin and I can both say the same thing, and people will \nhate me and they love him. I always wonder how you get by with doing \nthat, but you do. He is a lovable guy whom I will sincerely miss and \nthat relationship, and I hope you will be back often so you can be here \nto remind other people what a real statesman is.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I want to take a moment to thank Carl Levin for his \nfriendship. It has been previously noted that Carl is recognized as \nhaving perhaps the greatest intellect in the Senate. Carl has been, for \nso many years, a forceful fighter against waste in the military, and in \nrecent years he has led the Senate in telling us it is absurd that \nlarge multinational corporations are able to avoid hundreds of billions \nof dollars in taxes by storing their money in offshore tax savings.\n  He has been a leader on that and for those of us who are concerned \nabout the needs of our kids and elderly and infrastructure, all of the \nterrible problems facing this country, this is an issue we have to \nfocus on.\n  I think Senator Carl Levin has been a Senator's Senator. He has been \na model of what a good Senator should be, and it is not surprising that \npeople from all political persuasions will come to the floor to thank \nhim for his service.\n  Senator Levin, thank you very much for your time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I want to echo what everyone has said. I had the honor \nof traveling on a codel with Chairman Levin to Pakistan, Afghanistan, \nwhen I had been here just a few weeks. So I was traveling with the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee. The respect he got from \neveryone--from the generals down to the privates, especially in \nAfghanistan--was remarkable. Carl fought to increase the ratio of our \ntroops to contractors. When we took the majority back in 2006, Carl \nstarted doing the kind of oversight of the contracting that had led to \na lot of waste, fraud, and abuse in Iraq. He has used PSI in the way it \nwas intended by Harry Truman. I thank him especially for the work he \ndid on the credit rating agencies, Wall Street credit rating agencies. \nRight now Standard & Poor's is being prosecuted by--or sued by the DOJ \nfor about $5 billion. Part of what they are using are emails the \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations obtained, in which basically \nthe credit rating agencies internally were saying we better give this a \nAAA rating; otherwise, we are going to lose our business. That in no \nsmall way led to the meltdown we had because all this junk was getting \nAAAs and those were bets on bets on bets on bets and that is what led \nto the meltdown.\n  Carl always seems to go to where that kind of top-down fraud or \nmalfeasance is going. When we talk about--as\n\n[[Page S6707]]\n\nhe opened, as Sherrod mentioned when he talked about the disparities \nand how this is rigged very often from the top down, talking about the \noffshoring and the work they did in PSI, the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations--that is, on tax havens on inversions--and I hope to \ntake that up as Carl leaves.\n  Carl leaves a lot of unfinished business. Everything that has been \nsaid is who Carl is. Everyone should know that. One thing that has not \nbeen said is hamisha. Carl, you are one of the most hamish men I have \never known. Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Mr. KING. I wanted to speak very briefly, because as Senator Manchin \npointed out, I am the most junior person in the place.\n  I want to say a couple of things about Carl Levin. As has been said \nhere repeatedly, Carl is a man of immense intellect and character, and \nI wanted to explain how that came to be. I thought that would be \nimportant to lay on the Record.\n  It came to be because Carl Levin and his brother spent their boyhood \nsummers in the State of Maine. That imparts character to anyone who is \nlucky enough to have that experience.\n  Secondly, I want to mention--because it has been mentioned several \ntimes--about the travel. I had the great good fortune to travel after \nhaving been here about 6 months. Carl and I--as members of the Armed \nServices Committee--went to Turkey and Jordan to try to get some \ninsight into the situation in Syria. My only advice to anyone in this \nbody is if you are ever invited to travel with Carl Levin, spend the \nprior 2 or 3 months in the gym. I have never been so exhausted in my \nlife, and we would be at 10 p.m., after all-day meetings and touring of \nrefugee sites, and Carl would say: Can't we have another meeting? Isn't \nthere someone else we can talk to? His absolute passion for information \nand data upon which to make decisions is I think exemplary.\n  The final thing I want to note is--and it has been talked about how \nhe is a Senator's Senator, which is certainly true. My observation and \nin fact my experience this year in the markup of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act is the highlight of my experience in this body. The \nreason it is, is cause it worked like it is supposed to work. We had 2/\n2 days of markup. They were about 10-hour days, as I recall. There were \nover 200 amendments. Through Carl's leadership, most of those \namendments were compromised and worked out between the parties and \nbetween the individuals who were moving the amendments, but we ended up \nwith about 20 we couldn't resolve in that way. I was so struck by this. \nI went back and looked at the record of that markup. Of the 20 \namendments that were voted on in the committee, not a single one of \nthose amendments was decided on a party-line vote. There were votes of \n13 to 12 or 16 to 4 or whatever the vote was but not a single party-\nline vote. I think that in itself is an extraordinary achievement in a \nbody that is often driven by partisan divisions. I think it is \nattributable in large measure to Carl Levin's leadership.\n\n  Everybody had their say. Everybody had their opportunity to put their \nthoughts forward. Everybody had an opportunity to get a vote if they \nfelt that was necessary. Of course, in the end, the bill came out of \nthe committee--I think it was 25 to 1--and that is what legislating is \nsupposed to be all about. That is a lesson for us because people felt \nthey got their amendments, they got their discussion, they got their \nideas out. Even if they weren't successful, at the end, they voted for \nthe bill because they were invested in the process. That is what I \nlearned from this man who I think has been an inspiration for those of \nus who are coming along behind. Again, I am so honored. One of the \ngreat joys of my life has been to serve with you for 2 years. One of \nthe great sadnesses of my life is it is only 2 years, but I deeply \nappreciate what you have done for this body and for the United States \nof America.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Thank you.\n  Mr. KING. Bless you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. My good friend from Iowa is waiting patiently, so I will \ncurtail my remarks. I would like to say to my dear friend Carl--whom we \nwill all miss--if we had to put a headline on what is happening today, \nit is: ``Mr. Integrity Retires from the Senate.''\n  There is no one in this body on either side of the aisle whose \nintegrity is more respected than yours. At these times in America, \nwhere people have such distrust of government and elected officials, to \nhave somebody who is so widely trusted by his constituency and by the \nMembers of this body who have worked with him closely over the years on \nboth sides of the aisle is a real tribute. You are Mr. Integrity. That \nis one of many reasons we will miss you.\n  Again, I have more to say, but in deference to my dear friend from \nIowa, who I see is ready to roll, I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I will be brief as well and say that I am going to miss \nmy colleague, and I told him that personally. I want to share a couple \nof reasons. One, as a new Member on the other side of the aisle, when I \nfirst got here, Carl--whom I had gotten to know a little bit through \nhis brother, who I see is on the floor today, who has fought many \nfights with him on the squash court, but they remain dear friends. He \ncame to me and said: You ought to join the Auto Caucus. I am not a big \ncaucus guy. Most caucuses don't do much in this place, and then I saw \nwhat he was doing with the Auto Caucus and he agreed to allow me come \non as cochair. We had an than opportunity to help fight for the \nautoworkers in Michigan and Ohio and around the country make sure that \nthe renaissance of the auto industry is sustained. As I am sure has \nbeen said by many here today, he went out of his way to make it not \njust by bipartisan but nonpartisan. He does his homework.\n  We share some committee assignments. We don't always agree. Sometimes \nwe disagree on fundamental issues. He is always prepared and does his \nhomework and has the best of intentions. That says a lot for him and \nthe reason he is viewed as such a leader of the Senate. When I got \nhere, I was honored to serve on the Armed Services Committee. There we \nwere able to work together on a number of projects, including ones that \nfrankly he may not have normally thought were priorities but because I \nwas a new Member and interested in helping my State and on specific \nprojects, he stood up for me. I will not forget that. We have done \nlegislation together and had the opportunity to work together on \nimportant projects that have to do with the Great Lakes, including \nGreat Lakes restoration, where he has been a nonpartisan partner. I \njoin my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and say this is one of \nthose giants of the Senate who will be missed.\n  Although I have only been here for 4 of his many years of service, I \nwas privileged to serve with him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to the senior Senator \nfrom Michigan, Carl Levin. I have known Carl for many years and am \ngrateful for his friendship. Throughout his career, Carl has always put \nthe needs of Michigan and this nation above his own.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S6707, December 12, 2014, in the third column, there is \nan omission following the language:I yield the floor. Mr. \nPresident, I wish to pay tribute to the senior Senator from \nMichigan...\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: I yield the floor. \nMr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to the senior \nSenator from Michigan...\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Senator Levin was born in Detroit in 1934 and has called Michigan his \nhome nearly his entire life. As a young man, he left only briefly to \nattend Swarthmore College and later Harvard Law School. After passing \nthe Michigan Bar, Carl worked for five years in private practice in \nDetroit before beginning his career in public service. He first served \nas General Counsel for the Michigan Civil Rights Commission from 1964 \nto 1967. Carl then entered elected office, serving on the Detroit City \nCouncil from 1969 to 1977.\n  In 1978, Senator Levin successfully ran for a U.S. Senate seat and \nhas never looked back. He has since won five more elections to become \nthe longest-serving Senator in Michigan history. Carl chaired the Armed \nServices Committee from 2001 to 2003 and again from 2007 to the \npresent. Whether it was pushing for higher pay or ensuring that our \nveterans received proper medical treatment, Carl has always made sure \nthat our soldiers and their families were well taken care of.\n\n[[Page S6708]]\n\n  Senator Levin has also served as chairman of the Senate Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations. He has never had any patience for \ncorruption or abuse, and so has been perfectly suited for this job. As \nchairman, Carl launched numerous investigations into high-profile \nissues, including the Enron scandal and abusive credit card practices. \nThe findings of these investigations were crucial in helping us draft \nlegislation to prevent future abuses.\n  Mr. President, Senator Levin has dedicated his life to public \nservice, and his retirement is well deserved. He is an honest man who \nhas served his country well. I wish him, his wife Barbara, and their \nfamily the very best.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I know that Senator Harkin is waiting to speak. Senator \nHarkin is truly one of the greatest Senators I have ever served with \nand Senator Harkin is one of the greatest people I have ever known. He, \nRuth, Barb, and I have spent quality time, which is not always true for \nmany of us in the Senate to have that opportunity.\n  I thank everyone. The words have meant so much to me and my family \ntoday.\n  I am going to join my family now. I know Tom will forgive me for not \nlistening, but I will be reading what you say. You, Ruth, Barb, and I \nwill have some more quality time together--perhaps not as much fun as \nbeing in the Senate, but we will make the best of it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                         Farewell To The Senate\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, almost 2 years ago I announced I was not \ngoing to seek a sixth term in the Senate. That decision and that \nannouncement didn't seem all that difficult or hard at that time. After \nall, 2 years was a long time off. Since then, I have been busy with \nhearings, meeting constituents, getting legislation through the HELP \nCommittee, and working on appropriations.\n  But now, knowing this will be my final formal speech on the floor of \nthe Senate; knowing that in a few days a semitruck is going to pull up \nto the Hart Senate Office Building and load hundreds of boxes of my \nrecords of 40 years--30 in the Senate and 10 in the House--and haul all \nof that off to Drake University and the Harkin Institute on Public \nPolicy and Civic Engagement in Des Moines, IA; seeing my office at 731 \nHart Senate Office Building stripped almost bare and the shelves \ncleaned; when I will soon cast my last vote; when I will no longer be \nengaged in legislative battle; when I will no longer be summoned by the \nSenate bells; and when I will soon just be No. 1,763 of all of the \nSenators who have ever served in the Senate--now the leaving becomes \nhard and wrenching and emotional. That is because I love the Senate. I \nlove my work here.\n  It has been said by a lot of pundits that the Senate is broken. No, \nit is not. The Senate is not broken. Oh, maybe there are a few dents, a \ncouple of scrapes here and there--banged up a little bit--but there is \nstill no other place in America where one person can do big things--for \ngood or for ill--for our people and our nation.\n  I love the people with whom I work. This is a deaf sign. ``I-L-Y'' \nmeans ``I love you.''\n  To the Senators, staff, clerks, Congressional Research Service, \ndoorkeepers, cloakroom, police, restaurant employees, and, yes, the \npages--and especially to those who labor outside the lights, the \ncameras, and the news stories--who make this Senate function on a daily \nbasis, I thank you.\n  I particularly thank my wonderful, dedicated, hard-working staff, \nboth present and past, both personal and committee staff. When I say \ncommittee staff, I mean the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies, which I \nhave been privileged to chair or be ranking member of since 1989; also \nthe Committee on Agriculture, on which I have served since 1985 and \nwhich I chaired twice for two farm bills, once in 2001 and 2002 and the \nsecond one in 2007 and 2009; and the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions, which I have chaired since the untimely death of \nSenator Ted Kennedy in 2009.\n  I first heard Pat Leahy say this, so I always attribute it to him: We \nSenators are just a constitutional impediment to the smooth functioning \nof staff. This is truer than most of us would probably like to admit.\n  Also in thanking my staff, I don't just mean those who work in \nWashington. I would never have been reelected four times without the \nhands-on, day in, day out constituent service of my Iowa staff. The \ncasework they have done in helping people with problems is every bit as \nimportant as any legislative work done in Washington.\n  In 2012 our office marked a real milestone--100,000 constituent \nservice cases that we processed since 1985. I cannot count the number \nof times Iowans have personally thanked me for something my staff has \ndone to help me.\n  There is a story out our way that I have heard for a long time. It is \na little story. If you are driving down a country road and see a \nturtle--see that image of a turtle--sitting on a fence post, you can be \nsure of one thing: It didn't get there by itself.\n  I can relate to that turtle. I didn't get here by myself. My staff \nhelped. I thank my staff, both past and present, who so strongly \nsupported me when I was right and so diplomatically corrected me when I \nwas wrong and who all labored in a shared commitment to provide a hand \nup, a ladder of opportunity to those who had been dealt a bad hand in \nthe lottery of life.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na list of the names of my staff so they will be forever enshrined in \nthe history of the Senate.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       My Personal Office Staff: Brian Ahlberg, Elizabeth Stein, \n     Lindsay Jones, Lilly Hunt, Sonja Hoover, Mandy McClure, Kate \n     Waters, Susannah Cernojevich, Jim Whitmire, Richard Vickers, \n     Katharine Jones, Jayme Wiebold, Joseph Petrzelka, Eric Jones, \n     Elizabeth Messerly, Lauren Scott, Mark Halverson, Eldon Boes, \n     Tom Buttry, Michele Reilly Hall, and Richard Bender. Those \n     staffers serving me in Iowa: Robert Barron, Amy Beller, \n     Alexander Lynch, Pamela Ringleb, John Moreland, Jule \n     Reynolds, Omar Padilla, Robert Hamill, Ryan Helling, Kimberly \n     Taylor, Tamara Milton, Tom Larkin, Alison Hart, Jessica \n     Gordon, Suellen Flynn, and Sandi O'Brien. My LHHS Sub \n     Committee on Appropriations staff: Adrienne Hallett, Kelly \n     Brown, Lisa Bernhardt, Mark Laisch, Mike Gentile, Robin \n     Juliano, and Teri Curtin. Lastly my HELP Committee Staff: \n     Derek Miller, Lauren McFerran, Molly Click, Abraham White, \n     Jenelle Krishnamoorthy, Wade Ackerman, Andi Fristedt, Brian \n     Massa, Colin Goldfinch, Caitlin Boon, Mildred Otero, Aissa \n     Canchola, Amanda Beaumont, Brit Moller, Leanne Hotek, Libby \n     Masiuk, Mario Cardona, Liz Weiss, Michael Kreps, Sarah Cupp, \n     Zachary Schechter Steinberg, Kia Hamadanchy, and Lee \n     Perselay.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Most of all, I thank my wife, Ruth, the love of my life, \nmy wife of 46 years. You have been my constant companion, my soul mate, \nmy strongest supporter, and my most honest critic. You have been my joy \nin happy times and my solace when things just didn't go right. So I am \nlooking forward to more adventures, love, and excitement with her in \nthe years ahead.\n  To our two beautiful, smart, caring, and compassionate daughters, Amy \nand Jenny, I thank you for always being there for your dad, for giving \nme such wondrous joy in being a part of your growing up. I am so proud \nof both of you.\n  To my son-in-law Steve and to my grand kids, McQuaid, Daisy, and \nLuke: Look out, because here comes grandpa.\n  There is so much I want to say, but I want to be respectful of those \nwho have come to share this moment with me--my staff, here and there, \nmy family, friends, and fellow Senators.\n  But I want to state as briefly as I can why I am here, what has \npropelled me, and what has been my guiding philosophy for all these \nyears.\n  It has to do with that ladder of opportunity I just mentioned. You \nsee, there is nothing wrong in America with being a success. There is \nnothing wrong with having more money, a nicer home, a nicer car, \nsending your kids to good schools, having nice vacations, and a great \nretirement. That is a big part of the American dream.\n  But I believe when you make it to the top, and you make it to the \ntop, and you make it to the top, and I make it to the top, one of the \nprimary responsibilities of our free government is to make sure we \nleave the ladder down for others to climb. Now, mind you, I said a \nladder. I didn't say an escalator. An escalator is a free ride. Don't \nbelieve in that.\n  If you follow my analogy a little bit more, with a ladder you still \nhave to\n\n[[Page S6709]]\n\nexert energy, effort, and initiative to get up. But, in order to do \nthat, there must be rungs on that ladder. That is where government \ncomes in, to put some rungs there--the bottom rungs--everything from \nmaternal and child health care programs, Head Start, the best public \nschools, the best teachers, affordable and accessible college, job \ntraining.\n  Sometimes people fall off that ladder. Sometimes, through no fault of \ntheir own, they have an illness, they have an accident. That is why we \nhave a safety net, to catch them--programs like disability insurance, \nworkers' compensation, and job retraining programs to get them back up \non that ladder once again.\n  Thirty-five years ago we looked around America and we saw millions of \npeople who, no matter how hard they tried, could never climb that \nladder of success. No matter how hard they tried, they could never do \nit.\n  These were our fellow Americans, our brothers and sisters with \ndisabilities. So what did government do? We built them a ramp and we \ncalled it the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  Again, we didn't build a moving walkway, did we? See, with a ramp, \npeople still had to show energy and initiative to get up. I have often \nsaid there is not one dime, not one nickel in the Americans with \nDisabilities Act given to a person with a disability.\n  What we did is we broke down the barriers. We opened the doors of \naccessibility and accommodation, and we said to people with \ndisabilities: Now, go on, follow your dreams, and in the words of the \nArmy motto, be all you can be.\n  I can remember standing on the floor and leading the charge on the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act. Once again, I felt a lot like that \nturtle, with a lot of people helping. When I think of the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act, I think of people in the Senate such as Senator \nLowell Weicker, Senator Bob Dole, and Senator Ted Kennedy; in the \nHouse, Tony Coelho, Steve Bartlett, and Steny Hoyer; and in the \nexecutive branch, at the head of it all, President George Herbert \nWalker Bush, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, and Boyden Gray. On the \noutside, there are people like Ed Roberts, Marca Bristo, Bob Kafka, and \nthe indomitable Justin Dart.\n  Here the one person who worked his heart out to bring it together--it \nis that staff again I tell you about--is Bobby Silverstein. It would \nhave never happened without him.\n  So I believe government must not be just an observant bystander to \nlife. It must be a force for good, for lifting people up, for giving \nhope to the hopeless.\n  I have never had an ``I love me'' wall in the office. What I did have \nwere two items by my door when I walk out to vote or go to a committee \nmeeting or whatever. One is a drawing of a house in which my mother was \nborn and lived in until she was 25 years of age when she immigrated to \nAmerica. That little house was in Suha, Yugoslavia, and is now Suha, \nSlovenia. That little house had a dirt floor and no running water. That \nwas my mother's house.\n  The second item on my wall is my father's WPA card. It says: Notice \nto Report for Work on Project, WPA Form 402, to Patrick F. Harkin, \nCumming, IA. You are asked to report for work at once on a project as a \nlaborer for $40.30 per month. There is a signature by a supervisor. It \nis dated 7/1939, 4 months to the day before I was born.\n  My father was then 53 years old. He had worked most of the time in a \ncoal mine in southern Iowa, was not in the best of health. There were \nno jobs--no jobs. Life looked pretty bleak. Things looked hopeless. And \nthen my father, who only had a sixth-grade education--as he told me \nlater--got a letter from Franklin Roosevelt. He always thought Franklin \nRoosevelt sent this to him personally. He always said: I got that \nletter from Franklin Roosevelt, and I got a job.\n  That was important for a lot of reasons, not only for the money and \nthe dignity of work, but it gave my father hope--hope that tomorrow \nwould be better than today and that our family would stay together. You \nsee, there were five kids and a sixth one on the way--me. It gave him \nhope that his kids would have a better future.\n  The project he worked on is called Lake Ahquabi. My friend Senator \nGrassley knows about Lake Ahquabi. It is right south of Des Moines. It \nis a State park now, with a lake and recreation, and people still use \nit today.\n  Every Federal judge who is sworn in takes an oath to ``do equal right \nto the poor and to the rich.'' Let me repeat that: to ``do equal right \nto the poor and to the rich.'' Can we here in Congress say we do that, \nthat we provide equal right to the poor and the rich alike? Our growing \ninequality proves we are not. Maybe we should be taking that oath.\n  There are four overriding issues I hope this Senate will address in \nthis coming session and in the years ahead:\n  No. 1, as I mentioned, the growing economic inequality in America. It \nis destructive of lives, it slows our progress as a nation, and it will \ndoom broad support for representative government. When people at the \nbottom of the economic ladder feel the government is not helping them \nand, in fact, may be stacked against them, they will cease to vote or \nthey will turn to the siren song of extreme elements in our society. \nHistory proves this to be true.\n  I don't have a cookie-cutter answer or a solution, but it must \ninclude more fair tax laws and trade laws, more job training and \nretraining, rebuilding our physical infrastructure, and manufacturing. \nI believe it must include some things seemingly unrelated, such as \nquality, free early education for every child in America.\n  The answer to closing the inequality gap must include rebuilding \nlabor unions and collective bargaining. If you traced the line over the \nlast 40 years of the growing economic inequality in America and also \nput that over another line showing the loss in the number of union \nworkers, they are almost identical. I do not believe it is a stretch to \nsay that organized labor--unions--built the middle class in America, \nand they are a part of the answer in strengthening and rebuilding our \nmiddle class.\n  I believe another part of the answer is raising the minimum wage to \nabove the poverty line and indexing it for inflation in the future.\n  We need more flex-time laws, especially for women in our workforce.\n  We need to strengthen Social Security, as in Senator Brown's bill--\nnot cutting, not raising the retirement age, but strengthening Social \nSecurity.\n  We need a new retirement system for all workers in America--not \nanother 401(k) but a system in which employers and employees contribute \nand which can only be withdrawn as an annuity for life after one \nretires. I ask you to look at what the Netherlands has, that type of \nretirement system. Lack of a reliable retirement is one of the most \nunderreported, unexamined crises on our national horizon, and it is a \nbig part of our growing inequality.\n  Finally, we must continue to build on the Affordable Care Act. The \ncost and availability of good health care has in the past widened that \ninequality gap, and we are now starting to close that element of the \ninequality. I believe we need to add a public option to the exchange as \nanother choice for people. We must continue support for prevention and \npublic health, moving us more and more from sick care to real health \ncare.\n\n  I believe that the second overriding issue confronting us is the \ndestruction of the family of man's only home--our planet Earth--through \nthe continued use of fossil fuels. We know what is happening. The \nscience is irrefutable, the data is clear, and the warning signs are \nflashing in neon bright red: Stop what you are doing with fossil fuels. \nWe must shift massively and quickly to renewable energy, a new smart \nelectric grid, retrofitting our buildings for energy efficiency, and \nmoving rapidly to a hydrogen-based energy cycle.\n  The third issue I commend to the Senate for further development and \nchanges in existing laws is the underemployment of people with \ndisabilities. As you all know, ensuring the equal rights and \nopportunities for people with disabilities has been a major part of my \nwork in the Senate for the past 30 years.\n  We have made significant strides forward in changing America to \nfulfill two of the four goals of the American with Disabilities Act; \nthose two are full participation and equal opportunity. We have done \nall right on those. The other two goals--independent living and \neconomic self-sufficiency--need more development.\n  I ask you all in the next Congress to do two things to advance these \ntwo\n\n[[Page S6710]]\n\ngoals of independent living and economic self-sufficiency: First, help \nStates implement the Supreme Court's decision in the Olmstead case to \nmore rapidly deinstitutionalize people with disabilities and provide \ntrue independent living with support services. This will save money, \nand the lives of people with disabilities will be better and more truly \nindependent. Second, we must do more on employment of people with \ndisabilities in competitive integrated employment.\n  We all get the monthly unemployment figures every month. Last month \nunemployment held steady at 5.8 percent officially. My friend Leo \nHindery has better calculations to show the real rate is probably about \ntwice that figure. Also, we know the unemployment rate among African \nAmericans is about twice that--11.1 percent. How many of us know, \nthough, that the unemployment rate among adult Americans with \ndisabilities who can work and want to work is over 60 percent? Yes, you \nheard me right, almost two out of every three Americans with a \ndisability who want to work and who can work cannot find a job. That is \na blot on our national character.\n  Thankfully, some enlightened employers have affirmative action plans \nto hire more people with disabilities. Employers are finding many times \nthat these become their best employees; they are more productive, and \nthey are the hardest working, most reliable workers.\n  I ask you to meet with Greg Wasson, the CEO of Walgreens, and Randy \nLewis, who was the senior vice president there and is now retired. \nWalgreens has hired many people with disabilities in their distribution \ncenters, and now Mr. Wasson has set a goal of 10 percent of all of \ntheir store employees will be people with disabilities. This needs to \nbe emulated by businesses all over America. There are others making \nstrides in this area. I will mention a few: Best Buy, Lowe's, Home \nDepot, IBM, Marriott. These are some of the other large companies that \nare moving forward, hiring people with disabilities. We need to learn \nfrom them what we, the Federal and, yes, maybe the State government can \ndo to help in this area. We also need to implement policies to help \nsmall businesses employ more people with disabilities.\n  I dwell on this perhaps because I feel I haven't done enough on this \nissue of employment for people with disabilities, and we have to do \nbetter. I will say, however, that our HELP Committee passed this year \nand President Obama signed into law a new reauthorization of the old \nWorkforce Investment Act, now named the Workforce Investment and \nOpportunity Act. In this law there is a new provision I worked on with \nothers to get more intervention in high school for kids with \ndisabilities to prepare them for the workplace through things such as \nsummer jobs, job coaching, internships. However, this is just starting \nand funding is tight, but it will do much for young people with \ndisabilities to enter competitive integrated employment. I thank all \nmembers of the HELP Committee for their support of this bill but \nespecially Senator Murray and Senator Isakson for taking the lead to \nget this bill done, along with Senator Enzi, Senator Alexander, and me.\n  While I am mentioning the HELP Committee, let me thank all members of \nthe HELP Committee for a very productive last 2 years, during which we \npassed 24 bills signed into law by the President. These are important \nbills dealing with things such as drug track and tracing, compounding \ndrugs, the Workforce Investment Act that I just mentioned, the Child \nCare and Development Block Grant Newborn Screening Act, and many more.\n  I would like to publicly again thank Senator Lamar Alexander for \nbeing such a great partner in all these efforts. Senator Alexander will \nbe taking the helm of this great committee in the next Congress. \nSenator Alexander certainly has the background to lead this committee, \nbut he also combines that background with a keen mind and a good heart, \nand I wish him continued success as the new chairman of the HELP \nCommittee.\n  The fourth issue I hope future Senates will take care of concerns the \nU.N. Convention on the Rights of Persons With Disabilities. I don't \nthink anything has saddened me more in my 30 years here in the Senate \nthan the failure of this body to ratify the Convention on the Rights of \nPersons With Disabilities, or the CRPD, as it is known. It has been \nratified by 150 nations. It is modeled after our own Americans with \nDisabilities Act. It has broad and deep support throughout our \ncountry--supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Business \nRoundtable, veterans groups, every disability organization, every \nformer living President, every former Republican leader of this Senate: \nSenator Dole, Senator Lott, Senator Frist. In November we received a \nletter from the National Association of Evangelicals supporting it.\n  I would also point out that Senator Dole has worked his heart out on \nthis. If you remember, he was here on the floor 2 years ago this month, \nright before we brought it up. I thought we had the votes for it. Under \nour Constitution it takes two-thirds, and we failed by six votes. But \nBob Dole has never given up on this--never.\n  Well, I hope the next Senate will take this up and join with the rest \nof the world in helping to make changes globally for people with \ndisabilities.\n  I came to Congress--the House--in 1974 as one of the Watergate \nbabies. But with my retirement and the retirement in the House of \nCongressman George Miller and Congressman Henry Waxman, we are the last \nof the so-called Watergate babies, with two exceptions. Among all of \nthe Democrats elected in that landslide year of 1974, there were a few \nRepublicans, and one is left--my senior colleague from the State of \nIowa, Senator Chuck Grassley.\n  I have the greatest respect for and friendship with Chuck. Several \nweeks ago, here on the floor, he said some very gracious things about \nme, and I thank him for that. I especially appreciated his observation \nthat even though he and I are like night and day when it comes to \npolitical views, there is no light between us when it comes to Iowa. We \nhave collaborated on so many important initiatives for the people of \nIowa, and I think we made a heck of a good tag team on behalf of our \nState. So, again, I salute and thank my friend and colleague of nearly \n40 years, Chuck Grassley. Carry on, Chuck.\n\n  The other exception I mentioned is again my lifelong dear friend, \nRick Nolan, who was in the 1974 class who voluntarily left Congress \nafter three terms, returned to the House in 2012, and was recently \nreelected.\n  So 40 years later, this Watergate baby has grown up, gray.\n  I came to the Senate 30 years ago as a proud progressive, determined \nto get things done. As I depart the Senate, I can say in good \nconscience that I have remained true to my progressiveness.\n  I have worked faithfully to leave behind a more vibrant Iowa, a more \njust and inclusive America, and a stronger ladder and ramp of \nopportunity for the disadvantaged in our communities.\n  You might say that my career in Congress is the story of a poor kid \nfrom Cumming, IA--population 150--trying his best to pay it forward, \nsaying thank you for the opportunities I was given by leaving that \nladder and ramp of opportunity stronger for those who follow.\n  If I have accomplished this in any small way--if any Americans are \nable to lead better lives because of my work, I leave office a \nsatisfied person.\n  So I am retiring from the Senate, but I am not retiring from the \nfight. I will never retire from the fight to ensure equal opportunity, \nfull participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency \nfor every disabled person in America. I will never retire from the \nfight to give a hand up and hope to those who have experienced \ndisadvantage and adversity. And I will never retire from the fight to \nmake this a land of social and economic justice for all Americans.\n  Let me close with a single word from American sign language.\n  On July 13 of 1990, I stood here and gave an entire speech in sign \nlanguage. It confused Senator Kerry who was sitting in the Chair. He \ndidn't know what to do. And the recording clerks didn't know what to \ndo, either. But then I had to give it verbally. Well, I didn't want to \ndo that today.\n  But there is one sign I want to leave with you. It says something \npowerful--powerful. One of the most beautiful signs in American Sign \nLanguage. And might I teach it to you?\n  Take your hands and put them together like this, put your fingers \ntogether, put your hands together like\n\n[[Page S6711]]\n\nthat. You kind of close them, and it looks like an A when you do that. \nNow move it in a circle in front of your body.\n  That is it, pages, you have got it.\n  This is the sign for America.\n  Think about it. Think about it. All of us interconnected, bound \ntogether in a single circle of inclusion--no one left out. This is the \nideal America toward which we must always aspire.\n  With that, Mr. President, for the last time, I yield the floor.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaine). The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                         Tributes To Tom Harkin\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, my colleagues who are waiting to speak \nto honor Senator Harkin, I am not going to take the amount of time I \ndid on his birthday. I want to tell my colleagues that what I said on \nhis birthday, on November 19, I probably should have waited and said \ntoday.\n  But I want to speak about our working relationship, and I want \nSenator Harkin to know that I have enjoyed my working relationship with \nhim, together working for Iowa. I compliment him on the many \naccomplishments he has made. I consider him a friend. And as he goes \nback to Iowa, we will maintain that friendship, I am sure.\n  I would ask my colleagues if they would think about looking at what I \nsaid before on his birthday, because I am not going to repeat that \nhere. But I think we ought to recognize that Senator Harkin worked hard \nup to his last day in the United States Senate, because one of his \nworks over the last 25 years was on inhumane labor issues around the \nworld, and he traveled to Oslo very recently to honor a person who \nreceived the Nobel Peace Prize for that crusade, as well as all the \ngood work that Senator Harkin has done on it. And probably that person \nreceived the award because of Senator Harkin so long suggesting that \nthe individual deserved that attention.\n  I am going to be very brief today, since my prior remarks outlined \nour friendship and his record in some detail. It is in the \nCongressional Record for posterity.\n  Senator Harkin and I have been a duo from our home State of Iowa for \na long period of time. His voice is familiar. So is his point of view, \nso is his work ethic for the people of Iowa.\n  He has been a champion for individuals with disability, for the \nelderly, for early childhood education, nutrition, and wellness; for \nconservation, renewable energy, and the environment. We could go on and \non about his passion for these causes, and many others.\n  Senator Harkin's legislative accomplishments are numerous. He leaves \na lasting body of work that improves the quality of life for people who \ndon't always have a high profile in the Halls of Congress.\n  One of Senator Harkin's greatest legacies is his ability to translate \nhis drive and passion into legislative accomplishments. As the saying \ngoes: He doesn't just talk the talk, he walks the walk.\n  Senator Tom Harkin lives and breathes the causes important to him, \nand the United States and Americans have a better quality of life \nbecause of it.\n  It will be a new era when the Senate doesn't see him rising to speak \nin his characteristic fiery delivery. And it may not have been so fiery \ntoday, but he did speak with emotion about the things he believes in.\n  I am grateful for his friendship and his long service to the people \nof Iowa and the Nation. While I will miss him around the Capitol, I am \nconfident I will see him at home in Iowa. Senator Harkin is not one to \nturn off his enthusiasm for important issues, and I feel sure--and he \nhas already told us today--he will continue his contribution to public \nservice wherever and whenever the spirit moves him. And we know by his \nstatement today it is already moving him. He has plans for the future \nto continue these crusades.\n  With that in mind, I will say so long rather than goodbye. Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I start by saying that as Senator Harkin \nwas so eloquently speaking today, it reminded me of a story of those \ngoing by the casket of President Roosevelt.\n  A reporter stopped someone and said: Did you know President \nRoosevelt?\n  And he said: No, but he knew me.\n  There are people across this country--people with disabilities, \nworkers, folks trying hard to get up that ladder--who want to know \nthere are rungs on it, or want to be able to stay in the middle class, \nwho may not be able to say they know Senator Tom Harkin personally, but \nhe knows them.\n  We are so grateful, and I am personally grateful, for your friendship \nand your leadership and mentorship.\n  I want to speak for a moment as Chair of the Agriculture, Nutrition, \nand Forestry Committee, where I had to follow the tough act of Senator \nTom Harkin writing the previous two farm bills.\n  He has shaped agriculture and food and nutrition policy in the House \nand Senate for 40 years, having a tremendous impact, more than we can \neven imagine, in terms of not only advocating for Iowa farmers--and I \nknew every day what Iowa needed; that is for sure--and having both \nSenator Harkin and Senator Grassley on the committee gave the one-two \npunch for Iowa. But I have to remind all of my colleagues that Senator \nHarkin really is the father of modern conservation, of protecting our \nwater and our soil and our air, our wildlife habitat, our forests.\n  Senator Harkin is the father of modern conservation. He wrote the \nconservation stewardship program that he created in 2002 and expanded \non in 2008, and we protected it in the last farm bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Thank you.\n  Ms. STABENOW. And he gave new strength to the farm safety net for all \nof our growers. He has been at the forefront of an energy future that \nhe talked about today, driven by renewable energy and moving forward to \nget us to cleaner sources of energy. That creates jobs, as I know has \nhappened in Iowa because of his leadership. So we thank you.\n  There are so many things--the fresh fruit and vegetable program in \nschools where children in low-income schools have an opportunity to eat \nan apple rather than something out of the vending machine that isn't \ngood for them, the opportunities for children to have healthier \nchoices. Senator Harkin has led over and over and over again. I can go \nover every part of our agriculture and food policy improvements that \nhave been made that have been led by Senator Tom Harkin, and we are so \ngrateful.\n  Senator Tom Harkin has been a personal mentor for me. In the toughest \ntimes of getting this last farm bill done, Senator Harkin gave me words \nof advice and wisdom--and many times encouragement--and for that I am \nvery grateful, and have learned so much.\n  I secondly want to thank Senator Harkin for being a hero for \ngenerations of people with disabilities, including people in my own \nfamily, who have had doors opened because of what he has done. The \nAmericans with Disabilities Act revolutionized the possibilities and \nthe opportunities for people. And it is about opportunity; it is not \nabout giving people something for free, but opening doors which they \nstill have to walk through. Senator Harkin has done that in a way that \nwill be with us forever, when we look at building structures and \nopportunities in workplaces for people who want to work but just need a \nlittle different kind of opportunity and now have that available.\n  It was clear when Senator Harkin spoke about his family how it shaped \nhis sensibilities and passions. I remember his speaking about growing \nup in a two-bedroom house in Cumming, IA, that he shared with his \nparents and five siblings. That is pretty challenging. Growing up with \nhis brother Frank who was born deaf gave him an understanding of the \nobstacles to those with disabilities and a commitment came from his \nheart and soul about making life better--and he has. You have.\n  I recall also when he talked about his father losing his 40-acre \nfarm, and the New Deal giving him a chance to support you and to \nsupport your family despite the fact that he had a sixth grade \neducation. He had the opportunity to move ahead and work hard because \nsomebody out there, who didn't know his name, gave him an opportunity \nto do so, which is what is our job to do.\n\n[[Page S6712]]\n\n  I know Senator Harkin's crusades to protect workers on the job was \ninfluenced by witnessing his father struggle with black lung disease, \nlooking at him as a coal miner and what he went through.\n  I believe Senator Harkin is the definition of a self-made man. He \ngrew up taking advantage of opportunities as well as enduring the \nchallenges and the circumstances of his life, transforming and using \nthat experience to create better opportunities for everyone across the \ncountry.\n  He is a patriot, having served in the Navy. He gained his education \nthrough the GI bill and understands that is an important part of \ncreating opportunity and giving back to people who serve for us and lay \ntheir lives on the line for us.\n  I know you are totally committed in your heart and soul to education \nstarting at birth right on through for the rest of our lives.\n  So I want to thank you, finally, for your leadership on the HELP \nCommittee, your hard work and your passion in health care, your support \nworking with me on mental health care, your efforts on education, your \nefforts in pensions--which, by the way, are promises we need to keep. \nAll of the things you have done through the HELP Committee are things \nthat will last for a long time to come.\n  I know in Iowa, thanks to you, there are 8 times more community \nhealth centers then there were 25 years ago--wow--so somebody can see a \ndoctor and they can take their children to a doctor, which will live on \nin their lives.\n  I want to thank you for being someone who knows how to make laws, \nsomebody who wants to solve problems, who in his heart and soul is \npassionately, lovingly concerned about our country. I know that you and \nRuth and your daughters and your grandchildren will have many more \nopportunities to enjoy each other's lives but know there are people in \nthis country who are enjoying opportunities because of you, and we \nsalute you.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Senator Harkin's legacy is he stands as a champion of \nAmericans with disabilities. It will be a long time before there is a \ngreater champion of Americans with disabilities in this body and I \nsalute him for that.\n  I salute him secondly for his leadership and style of leadership. I \nhad the privilege of the last 2 years as ranking member of the HELP \nCommittee. Senator Kennedy used to say that we have 30 percent of the \njurisdiction of the Senate, and it seems like it sometimes. If you know \nour committee, down one row is the murderers' row of liberals or \nprogressives who are of the Democratic persuasion; and down the other \nside is a pretty good row of conservatives of the Republican \npersuasion--12 on this side, 10 on this side. So we have plenty of \ndifferences of opinions and we don't hesitate to express them. Yet \nduring these 2 years, Senator Harkin and his leadership style have \nfound a way for there to be 24 pieces of legislation, signed by the \nPresident of the United States, many of them very significant, some of \nwhich took several years to do, whether it was the compounding \npharmacy, which was so important in our State, the tragedy of \nmeningitis from unsterile products; whether it was the track-and-trace \nlegislation or the changes in workforce development that gave more \ndiscretion to Governors and the citizens in their communities. His \nstyle of leadership permitted that to happen and I am grateful to him \nfor that. I would suggest to the Senate as we look forward to a time \nwhen the Senate might be more functional and more productive that one \nway to earn the respect of the people of this country for this body, \nwhich is supposed to be the one authentic piece of genius of the \nAmerican political system, is to look at the way the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee has operated over the last 3 years under \nthe leadership of Senator Harkin. I salute him for his service and I \nthank him for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I rise to talk about Senator Harkin. As the soon-to-be \nChairman of the HELP Committee, Senator Alexander is right about the \nHELP Committee, it is an important committee. Sometimes I say it is not \nthat important unless you care about your health, your kids' health, \nyour parents' health, your kids' education or your education, if you \nwant to work sometime in your life, and you plan to retire. Other than \nthat, it is not very important.\n  But I want to talk a little bit about Tom Harkin, not as a Senator \nbut as a staffer. We have seen today when the Senators give their final \nspeeches, they talk about their staff. Tom came in 1969 as a staffer \nfor Neal Smith from Iowa. The staffers, as much as we treasure our \nstaffers, they love this work for their Member and they love working in \nthis institution, and they love working in Congress--at that point he \nwas in the House. So at this point he is, I believe, 29 or 30 years \nold. This was during the Vietnam war, and there was something called \nVietnamization. President Nixon asked a congressional delegation to go \nto Vietnam to look at how Vietnamization was working and what was going \non. While Tom Harkin was there as a staffer, a couple of Congressmen \nwere told about some conditions on an island called Con Son where there \nwere prisoners that the South Vietnamese Government was abusing very \nbadly. The Congressmen requisitioned a plane to go to Con Son, about \n100 miles off the coast of the mainland of Vietnam, and I believe the \nsupervisor of the group who was there to talk about the Vietnam prison \nsystem said this was sort of like a Boy Scout recreational camp--that \nis exactly what he said.\n  So when they landed there, Tom took a couple staffers and Members, \ngot a map from someone who had told him about this secret prison, and \nfound it, where there were people being horribly abused. Tom took \npictures. Tom was told to turn over the film. Tom didn't turn over the \nfilm. Tom was then told that his employment in the Congress depended on \nhim turning over that film--a 30-year-old staffer at the beginning of \nwhat most staffers hope is a career. That film showed up in ``Life'' \nmagazine and had a profound effect, and Tom's career was over.\n  That takes a lot of guts. That takes courage. That takes the courage \nof your convictions, and that is what I have seen in Tom Harkin. I \nlearned about this when Franni and I went with Ruth and Tom on a codel \nto Vietnam. I just spoke about Carl Levin and talked about a codel with \nhim, and I talked about this codel with Tom. I have got to go on more \ncodels, I just figured out.\n  This is what I observed, because this was the Chairman of the HELP \nCommittee, and I got to watch that courage and that courage of his \nconvictions, as well as what Lamar talked about, working well across \nparty lines.\n  I hold the seat that Paul Wellstone formerly held. I would say that \nTom was Paul's best friend. Tom every once in a while talks about his \nbrother and the experiences behind Tom's signature achievement, the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act. Paul Wellstone led on mental health \nand mental health parity, and that was because of his brother. And that \nis the legacy I want to carry on. I have not had Paul here to be a role \nmodel, but I have had Tom Harkin, and it has been a privilege.\n\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, we are going to continue with the \nMinnesota theme, and I think Senator Harkin knows that our two States, \nMinnesota and Iowa, share more than just a border. We share a lot of \npeople with relatives on either side of the border. I cannot tell you \nhow many of my friends have their roots in Iowa and how many people in \nIowa have their kids in Minnesota.\n  We also share citizens who have a strong sense of involvement. We \nhave some of the highest voter turnouts in the country. We both have \nnotorious caucus systems where people like to turn out and make their \nviews known, and our States have produced politicians such as Tom \nHarkin and Hubert Humphrey, who came up through that tradition and \nunderstand that you are there to represent the people of your State \nbecause when you go home, they actually come up to you in grocery \nstores, on the street, call you by your first name, and understand that \nyou are there to represent them.\n  We also share farming and we share this enormous belief in science. \nWe actually share Norman Borlaug. There is\n\n[[Page S6713]]\n\na new statute--the Presiding Officer must go see it--of Norman Borlaug \nin Statutory Hall. He was born in Iowa and studied in Iowa, but also \nstudied at the University of Minnesota. He created the Green \nRevolution, which has helped so many impoverished people in countries \nall over the world by reducing hunger.\n  Tom Harkin has followed in that tradition. He believes in science, \nbelieves in investing in agriculture research, and believes in \ninvesting NIH.\n  The other thing about Tom and me that I knew no other Senator would \naddress is our Slovenian heritage. When Tom leaves--and I see Senator \nBrown is here--and with the former Senator from Ohio, Senator \nVoinovich, no longer here, I will remain, I think, as the only \nSlovenian Senator here. I am hoping someone will come forward and tell \nme they have Slovenian blood. For a while 3 percent of the U.S. Senate \nhad roots in Slovenia, which is very interesting given how \ninfinitesimal the population of the country is compared to the rest of \nthe world.\n  Tom loves his Slovenian roots. Like Tom, my ancestors came from \nSlovenia to America to work in the mines. It is a big part of our lives \nand what we believe in.\n  One time Tom came to my Minnesota Morning breakfast and saw that \nevery Thursday I serve potica to my constituents, and that is unique to \nSlovenians. It is a rolled dough with either apples or walnuts in it. \nMy grandma used to make it. She would literally borrow card tables and \nroll the dough throughout her entire kitchen.\n  I found a number of places on the Iron Range of northern Minnesota, \nwhere my dad grew up, that make this potica, and we bring it in.\n  Tom came and tried it and decided that for Christmas he would send a \npotica to every Member of the Senate for Christmas. He called my office \nand said they don't make it in Iowa. I said, let me give you the name \nof a baker on the Iron Range. He personally called this woman and said: \nThis is Tom Harkin. I am the Senator from Iowa. I am calling to order \n100 poticas from you, one for every Member of the Senate for Christmas. \nAnd in very gruff Slovenian fashion, she said: I am sorry, it is \nChristmas, and we are booked. We do not have the poticas to send to \nWashington, DC. Then he said: I don't know if you know who I am. I \nchair the Agriculture and Forestry Committee--big forestry area--of the \nSenate. And she said: I know exactly who you are, but we do not have \nthe poticas to send to Washington.\n  So at that moment, he called me. I gave him the names of a number of \nother bakers, he found one, and every Senator got a potica for \nChristmas.\n  The last thing I will say about Tom that we share in common--we both \nrepresent States that believe in helping people who are the most \nvulnerable. He did that with his support for small farmers with the \nfarm bill, and he did that in his support for the disability community.\n  I was at the House this week talking about the ABLE Act with some of \nthe Members, and to a tee, every Republican brought up--because Tom \ncould not be there--Tom's work on the ABLE Act. They knew we would not \nhave the bill that Senator Casey worked on without Tom Harkin, and, as \nyou know, this is just the next step for the disability community. It \nwill allow parents and grandparents and friends and neighbors to set up \nfunds so that if they are not there when this young person grows up, \nthere will be money set aside for them.\n  Tom Harkin was Paul Wellstone's best friend in the Senate. Paul would \nsay: Politics is about improving people's lives. That is what Tom has \ndone every day in the Senate.\n  Thank you, Tom.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, in January of last year, I walked onto the \nSenate floor for the second time in my life. The first time that I got \nto be on the Senate floor was in 1995 when I was an intern for my \nSenator, Chris Dodd. Back then it was a little bit easier for interns \nto come here, and he brought me down to the Senate floor one afternoon.\n  I knew what I wanted to do. I had a small handful of people I wanted \nto meet. I don't know if I ever told this to Tom, but I wanted to meet \nTom Harkin, and I got to do that. Twenty years ago he was a giant in \nthe Senate. The one point I wish to make is this--I had the chance to \nserve with Tom on the HELP Committee and I have seen his legislative \nability and the respect he commands here, but I have only known him for \n2 years.\n  Anyway, the point I want to make is that the effect he has had on the \nlegislative process stands as an achievement in and of itself. I would \nargue that I am one of tens of thousands of public servants who decided \nto go into this line of work, decided to care about the kind of things \nI care about because I watched Tom Harkin on TV growing up.\n  I came from a family that was nonpolitical. My parents were both \nregistered Republicans. There is no genetic reason why I do this other \nthan seeing people like Tom fight on behalf of the disabled and the \ndisenfranchised and the dispossessed. He gave me the idea that there \nwas some worth to being in this line of work. If you grew up after \nVietnam, you were taught this was crooked or not worth being a part of, \nand then there was a handful of people like Tom Harkin who told you it \nwas worth being a part of.\n  The legacy that Senator Harkin will have--whether it is the farm \nbill, the Americans with Disabilities Act, or the Workforce and \nInvestment Act, that is all you need to leave this place fulfilled. But \nto think there are tens of thousands of people who, like me, are doing \nthis kind of work and trying to keep up the legacy you are going to \nleave is something to be proud of as well. I feel lucky to be a Member \nof this body in part because I got to meet Tom Harkin 20 years ago, I \nwas able to follow his lead, and I was able to be inspired by him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Tom Harkin is my hero. Tom Harkin has never shied away \nfrom a fight when it comes to workers rights not only for Iowa but for \nworkers all across the country and workers around the world.\n  He has come to many of us repeatedly and said: Don't forget what our \nobligation is to the community of men and women around the world who \nlabor with their hands, who fight challenges every day, who are abused \nin the workplace, who are abused as children in the workplace, and Tom \nHarkin has been the single strongest voice for as long as I can \nremember for those workers.\n  Tom comes from a right-to-work State. It is not always easy to stand \nup for labor unions and organized labor. We have a press and media in \nthis country which is consistently anti-labor.\n  We have a political class in this country at every opportunity that \ntries to undermine organized labor and undermine the rights of human \nbeings to organize and bargain collectively, and Tom recognized that is \none of most important rights that human beings have.\n  Tom Harkin, being from a right-to-work State, knows he will face a \ndifficult election darn near every 6 years. One of the little-noted \nhistorical facts about Tom Harkin--and I have not heard anyone else \nmention--is that Senator Harkin has defeated more incumbent Members of \nCongress than any elected official in United States history, and that \nis not because of the luck of the draw or some lottery in Des Moines or \nIowa City or Davenport. It is because Tom Harkin doesn't shy away from \nhis strong beliefs in the rights of humanity--organizing and collective \nbargaining rights. When you are willing to stand up day after day--not \njust in quiet groups in the Democratic Caucus--on this floor and you \nare willing to stand up in Dubuque and the more conservative parts of \nsouthwest Iowa and argue for labor rights, you are saying to the other \nside: Bring them on. Bring on big money, bring on anti-labor forces. He \nexpected to have tough elections, and that is why Tom Harkin is my hero \nand always will be.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I too rise to share a few comments about \nmy friend Tom Harkin who has contributed so much to this fight and to \nput rungs on the ladder so ordinary people across America have a fair \nshot to thrive.\n  When I first came out here as an intern in 1976, you were already \nover on\n\n[[Page S6714]]\n\nthe House side--no, not yet. It was about 1974, and I was working away, \nso I didn't get to meet you then. But there were a series of speeches \nby Senators when I was an intern here on the Senate side, and one of \nthem was by Hubert Humphrey.\n  Hubert Humphrey was well known for saying that a society should be \njudged by how they treat those in the dawn of their lives, children, \nthe twilight of their lives, seniors, and those who are in the shadow, \nthe sick and disabled. When I think of that vision, I see Tom Harkin. I \nsee Tom Harkin fighting for children who are oppressively working \naround the world under unacceptable circumstances. Tom Harkin carries \nout the fight for those children and for children's health care.\n  I have seen him fight for our seniors, and just this week he was \nspeaking passionately about the obligations we have to honor the \nretirement strategy so people can serve their senior years in dignity. \nHe fights for those who are disabled, which we have heard about so much \ntoday.\n  I thank Tom Harkin for taking his years on this planet and dedicating \nthem to this battle for those in the dawn of their life, for those in \nthe twilight of their life, and for those in the shadows. No one has \ndone a better job.\n  I also wish to thank Tom for the recent battles I have had a chance \nto be a part of--the fight to end discrimination in the workplace for \nour LGBT community, which you shepherded through your committee and got \nto the floor for the first time in which this bill has been enforced \nsince 1996, and proceeded to pass by a 2-to-1 bipartisan majority \nbecause of that firm foundation laid out in the committee.\n  I wish to thank you for your minimum wage bill and for saying to \nAmerica: Here is a vision: No one who works full time should live in \npoverty. That is absolutely right. We didn't win the battle over \nminimum wage, but we advanced the conversation--you advanced the \nconversation. I thank you for doing so, and for carrying out battle \nafter battle, and in so many cases, succeeding. And in those cases when \nthe circumstances weren't yet all lined up, you continued the fight, \ncarried the voice so we would find that moment in the future when we \ncould secure a victory for ordinary working people, for those who are \ndisabled, for our children, and for our seniors.\n  I thank you for your service in the Senate. Well done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. The Senator from Oregon has thanked Tom for his service \nin the Senate. I wish to thank him for his service before he was in the \nSenate when he and I were kids--well, not exactly--but when we served \nin the United States services. We spent some time in airplanes--not in \nthe same airplane, but roughly at the same time. A lot of times people \ncome up to me and thank me for my service in the Navy--and I am sure \nthey do that with you--and I tell them that I loved it. I loved the men \nand women I served with, I loved the missions, and it was an honor to \ndo that. I wanted to start off by thanking you for that, and to say \nthat is one of the bonds which has drawn us together as friends right \nfrom the start.\n  The Senator from Oregon mentioned your strong effort to raise the \nminimum wage, which ultimately was not successful. I want to mention a \ncouple of issues I have had the privilege of working on with you that I \nthink have been very successful. There is a battle that needs to \ncontinue to be fought, and I plan to continue to do that, and my hope \nis that you and others will do it too.\n\n  As veterans, I know how important the GI bill was for me and for you \nas well. I think we got about $250 a month on the GI bill, and I was \nhappy to have every dime of it. I moved from California to the \nUniversity of Delaware when I got out of the Navy, got an MBA, and I \nstill flew for the Navy and the Reserves, and it was a huge help for \nme.\n  The folks who get the GI bill today come back from Afghanistan and \nIraq or wherever, and if they have served for 3 years they get the GI \nbill, as you know, and that means they get full tuition. If they go to \nthe University of Iowa, Delaware State, Iowa State, they get free \ntuition. They get free books, fees, tutoring. In my State they get a \n$1,500-a-month housing allowance. That is the GI bill today.\n  There are a bunch of colleges around the country that--just as they \ndid when my dad came back from World War II or when my Uncle Ed came \nback from the Korean war, others have come back from Vietnam and so \nforth--there are scam artists involved with postsecondary training \nschools, sometimes colleges, and they see the GI with that benefit, and \nthey see it as if it were a dollar sign on their back, and they want to \ngo after the dollar sign and separate the value from the benefit.\n  The Senator from Iowa has worked on this so hard, trying to make \nsure--there are plenty of for-profit postsecondary schools and such \nthat do a good job, and there are some that don't. Nobody has been as \nactive in trying to make sure that we clean this up as you have been, \nmy friend, and my friend from Illinois, Dick Durbin, and I am pleased \nto be the wingman on this. I promise that Senator Durbin and I aren't \ngoing away. The folks who do this job right, the for-profits that are \ndoing a good job by veterans and taxpayers, we salute them; and those \nwho do not, we are going after them. So I thank you and your staff for \nstanding up for veterans consistently.\n  The other thing I wanted to mention is that many people are having \nlunch right now across the eastern part of our country, maybe getting \nready, over in Iowa, to have some lunch. If people go into a chain \nrestaurant where there are 15 or more restaurants in that chain across \nthe country--I think it is 15 or 20--they look at the menu to order, \nand right there they see the calories. If they want more information \nabout the fats, trans fats, the amount of sodium in the food--all kinds \nof information--they get it.\n  We are a nation where obesity is a huge problem, a huge cost driver \nin health care. I thank the Senator for leading the charge on menu \nlabeling, which is the reality in our country, and you should feel good \nabout that. I feel very good about that.\n  It has been a blessing knowing you and serving with you, Tom. There \nis an old saying: Flattery won't hurt you if you don't inhale. You are \nhaving a lot of flattery thrown at you here today, so don't breathe too \ndeeply and you should be OK.\n  We thank and salute you and your wife Ruth and your family. In the \nNavy, when people have done a really good job, we say words like \n``bravo zulu,'' and I say bravo zulu to you. When people are ready to \nweigh anchor and sail off into the sunrise, we say things like ``fair \nwinds and following seas,'' and I say that to you as well. God bless \nyou.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will speak briefly because I put a statement in the \nRecord, but I just want to say, Tom, that next to the State of \nIllinois, I spend more time campaigning in your State of Iowa than any \nother State. Obviously the Presidential caucus brought me over there, \nand I have come to know your home State of Iowa and to appreciate that \neven though there is an extraordinary Iowa-Illinois democratic \norganization, it is a tough State and there are elections that are \nhotly contested.\n  I recall that when I was running for the Senate in 1996, you called \ninto our headquarters and spoke to my campaign manager, who said: How \nis it going, Senator Harkin?\n  And you said: I am besieged.\n  It was a tough campaign, but you survived it and many others. I think \nit is because of two things: No. 1 is your dogged determination, and \nNo. 2 is your commitment to values that you have never given up on.\n  I think there is an authenticity to Tom Harkin that has saved him in \ntough years. People who disagreed with you respected you because you \nstood up for what you believed in. Some of the ideals you and I believe \nin may not be as fashionable politically as they once were. There was \nonce a time when I worked for a man named Paul Douglas who called \nhimself in the Senate ``a good liberal.'' You don't hear that word much \nanymore, do you? But the fact is, those of us who believe there are \nmoments in our Nation's history and in the lives of ordinary people \nwhere the American family, through our government, needs to step in and \nhelp--and you have done it. You have done it so\n\n[[Page S6715]]\n\nmany times. I won't repeat all that has been said, but whether you were \nfighting for working families, fighting for the poor, fighting for the \ndisabled, fighting to make sure every family had peace of mind when it \ncame to food safety--I am not sure that has been mentioned, but the \nSenator from Iowa worked on that, and I thank him for that leadership \nand inspiration.\n  Finally, let me say I have been happy to team up with you on this \nissue involving for-profit schools.\n  I will tell my colleagues that the Senator's hearings set a standard \nin terms of asking the right questions and hard questions of an \nindustry that by and large exploits young people and their families, \nsinking these kids deep in debt at the expense of American taxpayers \nand doing it many times with the promise of nothing but a worthless \ndiploma when it is all over.\n  I know, because I have tried, that the industry--the for-profit \ncolleges have friends in high places in Washington, DC. I can promise \nyou this: As long as I can do it physically, I will continue to wage \nthis battle in your name and in your memory because of all your \nleadership in this area.\n  Thank you for being a friend. Thank you for being a neighbor. And \nthank you for really standing up for the right causes over the course \nof your public service.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I am going to be brief. The truth is that \nthe Senator we are honoring right now, Tom Harkin, will go down in \nhistory as one of the great Senators of this particular period in \nAmerican history. Not many Senators, if any, have a list of enormous \naccomplishments anywhere close to what Senator Harkin has accomplished.\n  I would like to tell my colleagues a little story. It turns out that \ncoincidentally, really, I have traveled with Senator Harkin to a number \nof places around the world as part of congressional delegations. Like \nmost congressional delegations, we meet with the leadership of the \ncountry, the President and so forth. But what was interesting in \ntraveling with Senator Harkin is wherever you go, he gets honored by \nordinary people in those countries.\n  We went to Vietnam a number of years ago. Many people will not \nremember, but the truth is that one of the very first people ever to \nexpose the terrible prison conditions that the South Vietnam Government \nhad established was Tom Harkin. So we go there and we meet people who \nhad been imprisoned in tiger cages, and they said: Senator Harkin, \nthank you very much for exposing those conditions and improving our \nlives.\n  There was a very emotional response.\n  Then I go with him to Ghana, and it turns out that in Ghana and in \ncountries in Africa, Tom Harkin had been a leader in fighting against \nchild labor. There were kids 8 or 9 years of age who should be in \nschool who were out picking crops. And Tom Harkin, working with people \nall over the world, had a real impact on getting those kids into \nschool.\n  We went to a school, a beautiful school which is partially funded by \nthe U.S. Government. We have bright kids who are in school, and they \nwere so proud of the assistance we had given them, where they were in \nschool and not working in fields.\n  Then we go to Chile. We go to Chile and we meet with the President of \nChile, all the dignitaries of Chile. Who knew this? We go to Chile, and \nTom Harkin gets an award from the government.\n  In the very dark days of the Pinochet government, when the \ndemocratically elected President of Chile, Salvador Allende, was \noverthrown in a violent coup by Pinochet--with, unfortunately, the \nassistance of the U.S. Government--and people were rounded up and put \ninto prison camps and tortured and killed, Tom Harkin goes knocking on \nthe door to one of the prison camps. He goes knocking on the door--\npretty crazy, but that is what he did. He was met with soldiers with \nguns. But he exposed that particular prison camp and played a role in \nfacilitating the ending of some of the more barbaric actions of the \nPinochet government.\n  Those are three trips I made with him. That is about all. I am sure \nhe has gone on other trips. That is a pretty good record, \ninternationally.\n  Then, back home, in terms of disability issues, I can remember and \nothers can remember that 30, 40, 50 years ago, families had kids born \nwith disabilities, and often those kids were institutionalized, they \nwere hidden, they were an embarrassment to the family. Something bad \nhappened; there was a child with a disability--Down syndrome, whatever \nit may be. Think about the revolution that has taken place, the \nmainstreaming of those kids. I know in Vermont and all over this \ncountry, kids with disabilities who are sitting in classrooms right \nnow, loved and respected by their fellow students, educating their \nfellow students, making them more human, more compassionate. I think \nmany of us have been to high school graduations where people with \ndisabilities get their diploma and people stand up and applaud those \nkids.\n  There has been a transformation of the culture in terms of how we \ndeal with people with disabilities through the Americans with \nDisabilities Act. That didn't happen by accident. Tom Harkin wasn't the \nonly person who did it, but he helped lead the effort here in the U.S. \nCongress to say that people with disabilities are part of the human \ncommunity and we are going to treat them with the dignity they deserve.\n  Then we have all the other issues that people have talked about. \nProbably nobody in the Congress has been a stronger fighter for working \npeople and organized labor than Tom Harkin.\n  I think people come here, regardless of political persuasion, to try \nto make a difference and do what they think is right. We disagree about \nwhat is right, but I think when we look at the list of accomplishments \nand the enormously hard work that has gone into those accomplishments, \nthis man, Tom Harkin, will go down as one of the great Senators of our \nperiod.\n  Tom, thank you so much for all you have done.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to recognize a dear friend, Senator \nTom Harkin. Senator Harkin will be retiring at the end of the month, \nbut his influence will be felt long after he leaves this Chamber. I \nspeak for all of my colleagues when I say he will be sorely missed.\n  I consider myself lucky to have worked with Tom, and even luckier to \ncall him a friend. Tom has devoted his life to public service.\n  Like any good statesman, Tom is humble about his achievements. \nHumility is a trait so often lacking in accomplished men, but Tom is an \nexception. The allure and glamor of Beltway life never held sway over \nTom, and his years spent in the Nation's capital have only shown that \nhe is an Iowa man through and through.\n  The only thing that runs deeper than Tom's Iowa roots is the corn \nthat grows there. Tom still lives in the very same house in the very \nsame town where he was born--Cumming, IA, population: 383--a far cry \nfrom this bustling metropolis. His family still keeps a farm in \nCumming, and I am sure he looks forward to spending many peaceful days \nthere in his retirement.\n  Tom grew up in a family of modest means. His father was a coal miner \nand his mother a Slovenian immigrant who passed away when Tom was just \n10 years old. From an early age, Tom developed his signature work ethic \nby taking various odd jobs on farms, at construction sites, and even in \na bottling plant.\n  Tom's service to our Nation began long before he came to Congress. He \nattended Iowa State University on a Navy ROTC scholarship and served as \nan active-duty Navy pilot for 5 years after graduation. Even after his \nfull-time military service, he continued to serve as a pilot in the \nNaval Reserve. Tom is a man who always has and always will put our \ncountry first. Even though he and I often disagreed on matters of \npolicy, I always knew that Tom had the best interests of our Nation and \nthose of his constituents in mind.\n  Tom and I first became good friends when I joined him in sponsoring \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act in 1989. At the time, Tom was a \nfirst-term Senator approaching reelection, and to support the ADA was \npolitically risky. But true to form, Tom bucked political expediency to \nchampion a law that the\n\n[[Page S6716]]\n\nlate Senator Ted Kennedy would describe as the ``emancipation \nproclamation'' for those with disabilities. Although the ADA faced \nserious opposition, passing this legislation was personal for Tom, \nwhose brother, Frank, grew up deaf, and whose nephew was quadriplegic. \nIn the lives of these loved ones, Tom saw how lack of opportunities for \npersons with disabilities could make their lives all the more \nchallenging.\n  My friendship with Tom was forged in the battles we fought to move \nthe ADA through both chambers of Congress. I will never forget the day \nthe Senate passed the bill in 1989. After the vote, Tom and I left the \nfloor and walked into the anteroom, where there were hundreds of \npersons with disabilities in wheelchairs, on crutches, and with various \nother disabilities waiting to receive us. Overcome with emotion, both \nof us broke down and cried. It was a moment I will never forget.\n  I am not exaggerating when I say that Tom's work on this hallmark \nlegislation will have resounding effects for generations to come. \nBecause of the ADA, millions of Americans with disabilities can now \npursue the American Dream.\n  Throughout his Senate career, Tom has always been there to help those \nwho could not help themselves. His work has affected the lives of \nmillions. Senator Harkin deserves not only our recognition, but also \nour gratitude. I want to wish him, his wife Ruth, and their family all \nthe best.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have a parliamentary inquiry. It is my \nunderstanding that we were to begin at 12 o'clock for 3 hours until the \nfirst motion on the NDAA, and that would begin now, it looks like, \nabout an hour late; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 3 \nhours of debate, with 1 hour each for the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. \nCoburn, and the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, and with 30 minutes each \nfor the Senator from Alaska, Ms. Murkowski, and the Senator from \nOklahoma, Mr. Inhofe, or their designees.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Thank you, Mr. President. Before the Senator from Iowa \nleaves, let me make one comment. I look at him and all of those who are \nsaying nice things about the Senator from Iowa--and I am from Iowa, so \nI can say this. My colleagues need to remember that even conservatives \ncan love Tom Harkin. I think it is important for people to understand \nthat.\n  I have to say that I have been to I think at least 10 of the \nairshows, and spending 90 percent of my time--my wife and his wife, the \nfour of us together, because we are both pilots--sitting around and \nlying about airplanes, we got real close to each other.\n  I can say the same thing about my good friend Senator Sanders, and I \nhave said this on the floor before: The two of you are two of my \nfavorite in-the-heart liberals because you are not ashamed of it. You \nstand up--exactly what the Senator from Vermont just said. The things \nthat I have seen you do, you have a big heart. You have your own \nphilosophy. You are not a demagogue. You live your philosophy.\n  So I just want you to know there are a lot of Republicans who love \nSenator Harkin just as much as the liberals do. All right. Thank you.\n  We should have started with Senator Levin and myself kicking this \noff. I think we were a little bit late in starting, so Senator Levin is \nnot here now. He will be here in about 30 minutes.\n  Let me make one comment about Senator Levin. I did so this morning. \nThis person chairing these committees--and he has been through 16 of \nthe NDAAs in the past, and no one else can say that. No other Member \nhas ever done that. Over his 36 years of service, he has concentrated \non his concern for the defense of America. This is interesting because \nas the ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, he and I \nhave worked together. We even participated in two of the events called \nthe Big 4.\n  The Chair knows this, but some of my colleagues may not. When it \ncomes time and the committees are unable to pass a bill, then the \nranking member and the chairman of the House and the ranking member and \nthe chairman of the Senate--the Big 4--get together and they draft a \nbill. That is what happened this year and last year.\n  Last year I was getting panicky because we didn't pass that bill \nuntil December 26. What would happen if we didn't, then it would be a \ncrisis on December 31. So I want to say, Senator Levin, I have \nenjoyed--I regret we won't be able to have the same positions because, \nof course, Senator Levin is--such as our friend from Iowa--retiring \nafter this term.\n  Let me mention the NDAA bill is the most important bill we do every \nyear. I don't think anyone is ever going to debate that. We had the 52 \nconsecutive years--and this is going to be the 53rd consecutive year we \nhave been able to pass it. It seems as though each year it is always \nhard to do, because at the last minute there are other people who want \nto get things in the bill that were not there. But we have to keep in \nmind, in defense of the big-four approach to this, we passed this bill. \nWe passed it out of the Senate Armed Services Committee on May 23. We \nhave been wanting to get it on floor since May 23.\n  Senator Levin and I have come down countless times and begged our \ncolleagues on the Democratic side and the Republican side to get their \namendments down so we could consider their amendments. We had a lot of \namendments that did come down. Of the amendments that came down, I am \nvery proud to say that we incorporated almost all of them. Forty-seven \nof those amendments are a part of this bill. So it is not as if the \namendments were considered.\n  I know some people who are opposed to this bill may come along later \nand say we didn't consider all the amendments. We considered almost all \nof them but adopted 47 of the amendments which is a record. In spite of \nthe pushing for months on the NDAA--I don't know what the reasons were \nand I am not going to point the fingers, but we didn't get it on the \nfloor--we have to do it at the last minute. I want to just say, in my \nheart I believe--I know the House wound up most of their business--but \nif we don't pass this bill, there is no other train leaving this \nstation. There is no other way to do it, because in this bill, when \npeople stop and think about it, there are some things I don't like \nabout the bill. I have to admit that, but there are so many good \nthings. If we go through December 31, and this is the reminder we have \nto have in our own minds, we have right now 1,779,343 enlisted \npersonnel who are in service right now. They will lose their benefits \nif we don't pass this bill. I am talking about reenlistment bonuses.\n  I asked the chair, do you realize--I think he does but not many \npeople do--just flight pay. There is a huge pilot shortage right now \nbecause the private sector is hiring them up and we are having a hard \ntime keeping them. We have a flight pay incentive. That incentive would \ngo way.\n  Does it mean anything? Yes. It is a $25,000 incentive, and it lasts \nfor--it goes for 10 years each year. But if they wake up on January 1 \nand find out they don't have their flight pay incentive, how many of \nthese existing warriors in the sky are going to drop out and go to work \nfor one of the airlines? I don't know. But a lot of them will, I can \nassure you of that.\n  I think we need to remind people how much it costs to train a new \none. Instead of a $25,000 bonus to reach the standards of the level of \nan F-22 pilot, it costs $17 million. Stop and think about the millions \nand millions of dollars that would be lost just from the flight pay. \nThese things are happening.\n  A lot of good things are in this bill and some are controversial. The \nhousing starts are in this bill--none of the housing starts. I am \ntalking about military construction for our kids that are out there. \nOne of the controversial areas is in Gitmo. This is one of the very few \nareas where Chairman Levin and I disagreed with each other. Gitmo is a \nresource that can't be replaced. He would be for closing it.\n  We are now keeping the restrictions we have right now and keeping it \nopen for another year so we can look at it next year and spend more \ntime on it.\n  We have the counterterrorism partnership funds, and so many of these \nthings are in this bill that I think are very significant. We are \nsupporting the needed Aircraft Modernization Program. You hear a lot \nabout the F-35. The F-22 was terminated by the President and terminated \n6 years ago. So\n\n[[Page S6717]]\n\nwhat we have in the fifth-generation aircraft, that is it, the F-35.\n  What we are doing is continuing with that modernization program, a \ncontroversial area. The support for ground support is the A-10. The A-\n10 is probably the ugliest airplane in the sky, but you ask any of our \ntroops on the ground what they want to see coming when they are in \ndanger, it is the A-10. That is going to continue. There is not going \nto be one reduction in that.\n  I know the Armed Services Committee next year will look at that \nfreshly and maybe make changes. AWACS, the President wanted to take \nseven of the AWACS planes out, and that would be 25 percent of the \nAWACS fleets. That is a great big plane that has a circle on the top \nthat goes out and brings back information to save lives. That is there.\n  The authorizing the military construction of family housing projects \nthat has been started, they would come to a stop without this bill. \nThat means we would have paid the contractors. There are going to be \nbreach-of-contract lawsuits and everything else.\n  I will only mention one other thing--the Russian-made rocket engines. \nA lot of people hear about that and they say: Why in the world, with \nall the problems with Putin, with what is going on in the Ukraine, \naround the world--I just got back from Lithuania, and I also went over \nto Ukraine. I am seeing things with our allies over there that they \nwould ask the question: Why are you buying Russian-made rocket engines? \nWe are, but those are being fazed out. We have directed the Secretary \nof Defense to develop a U.S. rocket to replace that rocket. That is \ngoing on right now.\n  By the way, I have to say this. I mentioned Ukraine. I can't tell \nyou, when we look and see what is happening over there--I had a great \nexperience. I was over there just 3 days before our elections. It \nhappened to be 3 days after their elections. In the Ukraine, President \nPoroshenko was so proud, and he sat there and told me: In Ukraine, we \nhave to get 5 percent of the vote to have a seat in Parliament. The \nCommunists, for the first time in 96 years, didn't get 5 percent. So \nthere will not be one Communist in Parliament in Ukraine. That is \nincredible. Those are our friends over there. They are the ones we need \nto keep our defense strong, and we directly address that in this bill.\n  I will only say one thing about the lands package. It is the \nmost controversial part of this bill because it is something which has \nnothing to do with Defense. On the other hand, when we are in \nnegotiations and there are some things that should not perhaps come in, \nin this forum, and I thought--I even characterized it as outrageous at \nthe time that that was made part of this bill. I have to say this--any \nchanges in the bill, by the way, are going to result in not having a \nbill, and all the things I just mentioned would happen. But I started \nreading some of these provisions from a conservative Republican's \nperspective, getting in and being able to produce and drill in some of \nthe public lands, let some of our public lands rejoice in this \nrevolution that we are having out there with shale. The ranchers in \nOklahoma tell me the grazing rights issues that are in these land \npackages are good. I hear some people saying, well, there is something \nto do with a women's committee starting or something like that.\n\n  Let's keep in mind, I say to my fellow conservatives, that if Marsha \nBlackburn's bill that became a part of this bill--now, it shouldn't \nhave happened, but nonetheless it did. It is so overriding we pass a \nbill and not allow something like that to actually kill the bill.\n  I would say we are still a nation at war right now. We will be back \nto discuss this further, and I do want to have an opportunity to \nrespond to some of the critics of this bill. Keep in mind. This is the \nlast opportunity we have before December 31--before January when we \ncome back in--and on December 31 it would be a crisis. I say to my good \nfriends on the left and on the right, we have to have the bill. This is \nthe last bill we can pass.\n  I would like to recognize Senator Ayotte, the very courageous Senator \nwho has been a major part of the provisions to this bill, and I will go \nso far as to say as the most active member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I want to thank the senior Senator from \nOklahoma, Mr. Inhofe, for his leadership, along with Senator Levin, \nworking hand in hand to get the Defense authorization done this year. \nThis is so important. I know all of us would like to have a process \nwhere we can have an open amendment process here, but I know that \nSenator Levin and Senator Inhofe worked very hard. We had this ready to \ngo a long time ago. I thank you for your work and your commitment on \nthis, and I thank you for the way you and Senator Levin have run this \ncommittee in a respectful bipartisan manner.\n  As we look at the importance of the Defense authorization, making \nsure that we get this done before we go home, we have to understand \nwith the threats we are facing around the world right now, now would \nnot be the time for the first time in over 50-plus years not to pass \nthe Defense authorization, given what it means to support for our men \nand women in uniform, their readiness, their equipment, the training, \nthe support for their families, military construction, investment in \ntechnology that they need to keep us safe.\n  So I want to thank Senator Inhofe for his work on this. I also want \nto take the opportunity to thank Senator Levin, who is retiring this \nyear, for being an incredible chairman of this committee. I have to say \nthis has been one of the best experiences I have had since I have \ngotten to the Senate. I have been here for 4 years, and Senator Levin \nhas conducted this committee and treated everyone with respect. He has \ngotten us all to work together, where almost every year we passed out \nthe Defense authorization almost unanimously--how often does that \nhappen--and most times unanimously in a divided Congress.\n  I wish Senator Levin the best, because he has been so knowledgeable \nand so committed to ensuring that our Nation is safe and committed to \nour men and women in uniform.\n  On a personal note, he has been so respectful to me and someone who I \nthink has run the committee so very well and has served our country \nwith such dignity and such dedication. I wish he and his wife Barbara \nthe best in the future.\n  He is someone whom this body will miss. Certainly as the chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee, he has treated everyone on both sides of \nthe aisle with incredible respect and given us opportunities to raise \nissues that are important to us. I think he is a model of how we should \nconduct ourselves. We can disagree with each other but still find ways \nin common ground where we can work together to get things done for the \nAmerican people.\n  I come to the floor to discuss the Defense authorization and the \nprovisions in it that are so important to not only my home State of New \nHampshire but to the country and also to address some of the provisions \nI want us to keep an eye on as we go forward. With skill and courage, \nour men and women in uniform are doing their job. It is essential we do \nour job as well. In a time of war, we cannot neglect our constitutional \nduty to provide for the common defense.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee I have been privy to many \nbriefings, as the Presiding Officer has, as a member of the committee \nabout the threats facing our country and the needs of our men and women \nin uniform, the concerns we have of ensuring our troops are ready and \nthat we are prepared to address potential threats to the country.\n  In this bill, my home State of New Hampshire, we are a State that is \nvery dedicated to serving, just as the Presiding Officer's State of \nVirginia is very dedicated to serving. There are many provisions in \nthis bill that I have introduced and supported that I am proud of that \nwill make a difference to our national security and to our men and \nwomen in uniform.\n  I would like to talk about some of those provisions. In terms of \nsupporting our troops and our families, it is very important that we \npass this bill every year because it authorizes expiring benefits for \nour troops that if we don't reauthorize, they would expire, including \ndozens of specific special incentive pays for our troops and their\n\n[[Page S6718]]\n\nfamilies, particularly those who are serving us overseas and facing \ngreat danger as we stand here today.\n  The Defense bill also authorizes more than one dozen provisions to \nenhance protections for victims of sexual assault and extends to the \nSecretary of the VA the authority to provide rehabilitation and \nvocational benefits to servicemembers with severe illnesses and \ninjuries.\n  It also strengthens the Department of Defense's suicide prevention \nefforts. Unfortunately, suicide is happening to too many of those who \nhave served our Nation and is an issue that we are so concerned about \non a bipartisan basis.\n  The bill also authorizes $6.3 billion for needed military \nconstruction and family housing projects. Included among that \nauthorization are military construction projects at Pease Air National \nGuard Base in New Hampshire to prepare for the arrival of the KC-46A, \nnot to mention a very important energy conservation project at the \nPortsmouth Naval Shipyard. The shipyard has continued to invest in \nenergy conservation and to save taxpayer dollars while doing so, and I \nam pleased it is included in this bill.\n  The Defense bill also maintains critical close air support capability \nin the Air Force, which our troops need, in that it ensures that the \nAir Force cannot prematurely retire the A-10 aircraft in fiscal year \n2015.\n  Having traveled to Afghanistan and hearing directly from the men on \nthe ground, I know how important it is they have the very best air \nsupport to keep them safe.\n  The bill also authorizes continued funding for the Virginia Class 10-\nboat multiyear procurement program, including two in fiscal year 2015, \nwhich is very important because keeping the 10 boat multi-year \nproduction and procurement program on track--and I know the President \nshares this concern--will help achieve savings in excess of 15 percent, \ncompared to purchasing only one per year. It makes cost sense, and we \nneed to continue to invest in our attack submarine program.\n  With the help of the skilled workers at the Portsmouth Naval \nShipyard, these submarines will protect vital shipping lanes and U.S. \nnational security interests around the world for decades to come. With \nthe administration's discussion of a shift to the Asia-Pacific and the \nimportance of that area of the world to our economy and our interests, \nour attack submarine fleet is so critical in meeting our needs around \nthe world.\n  These measures, which are included in this bill, will help ensure \nthat Portsmouth and Pease will remain valuable national security \nassets. I am so proud of the members of our National Guard, everyone \nwho serves at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, and the incredible workers \nthere who do the maintenance of our attack submarine fleet.\n  The bill also includes provisions of ``never contracting with the \nenemy'' legislation. This is legislation which I have previously \nintroduced which has allowed our military to ensure that dollars don't \nflow to our enemies. So when we are contracting in places such as \nAfghanistan, we have given them tools to cut off contracts sooner to \nmake sure the contracts aren't going to the wrong people.\n  This legislation will extend those authorities across the Federal \nGovernment, to USAID, and to the State Department to ensure that our \ntaxpayer dollars don't go to people who are acting against our \ninterests. So I appreciate USAID and the State Department working with \nme on this legislation, and I am very pleased it is included in these \nprovisions.\n  These are a few of the positive examples of the importance of this \nDefense authorization bill. There are many other important provisions \nin this bill. That is why it is important that we get this done today \nor tomorrow.\n  There are two areas of issues that I want to address briefly which I \nam a little concerned about on this bill. As a Member of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee--and I am also married to a veteran--I plan to \nvote for this bill because of the positive components. But one of the \nareas with which I am concerned is that we are again looking at \ncompensation and we are looking at housing allowances of our men and \nwomen in uniform. It reminds me a little bit--it is not an exact \nanalogy--of when we had the budget agreement over 1 year ago. There was \nan adjustment made to the cost-of-living increases. It was a cut, \nreally, in the military retirement of some of those who have served our \ncountry.\n  I was someone who came to the floor to reverse this reduction to the \ncost-of-living increases, which for some of our men and women in \nuniform, who had served so admirably, would have cost them up to \n$80,000 a year in their retirement. We are talking about enlisted \npeople who worked so hard, and it would make such a big difference for \nthem.\n  One of the reasons I came in that regard to fight against what was \nincluded in the budget agreement was because there seemed to be a \ndisconnect.\n  That budget agreement made changes to civilian retirement but only \nprospectively to those who were just joining the retirement program. \nWhen it came to making the cuts to the military retirement and to their \ncost of living, it was affecting current recipients. So there seemed to \nbe a disconnect. How could we ask those who have given the most--have \nsacrificed so much to defend us--to make a sacrifice when we were \ntreating other civilian employees differently. I am pleased Congress \nreversed that.\n  What came out of that is that we need to have a greater understanding \nof the unique sacrifices our men and women in uniform make. The \nsacrifices they make are different than that of other workers--the \ntraveling they do, the danger they face. Often their spouses can't have \nsecond careers because they are constantly moving.\n  Since 2000, collectively as a Congress, we worked hard to correct the \npay-and-benefit structure for those who wear the uniform to close what \nwas a 13.5-percent gap between the private sector and what our men and \nwomen in uniform were getting. We eliminated out-of-pocket housing \nexpenses--that used to be 20 percent--and expanded health care for \nretired military personnel over the age of 65.\n  But as I look at the provisions of this bill, I don't want us to \nerode the work we have done to recognize our men and women in uniform \nand the positions and the danger they face. In this bill, generally, \nthe dollar amounts associated with the provisions about which I am \nconcerned are much smaller than those involved with the COLA debate \nearlier this year. Again, we are back looking toward our men and women \nin uniform in several areas.\n  These problematic provisions relate to the compensation and health \nbenefits for our servicemembers and their families. More specifically, \nthey relate to the basic allowance for housing or BAH, TRICARE pharmacy \ncopays, and basic pay for our servicemembers.\n  BAH is currently designed to cover 100 percent of servicemembers' \nmonthly housing costs. The BAH provision in this NDAA will allow the \nSecretary of Defense to reduce BAH payments so they only cover 99 \npercent of a servicemember's monthly housing costs.\n  Obviously, that is a small reduction. But it is the significance of \nthe reduction I am concerned about. We can't keep going down this road, \nwhere we are trying to choose between military readiness and making \nsure our men and women in uniform have the compensation they need in \nterms of compensation and support for their families. That is why I am \nconcerned about this provision.\n  In terms of pharmacy copays, while the Pentagon's budget request is \nimportant to understand, they requested a much greater increase in \nfuture years in copays than this body would accept--than the Armed \nServices committees would accept. The negotiated NDAA would still \npermit a $3 pharmacy copay increase for non-Active-Duty TRICARE \nbeneficiaries who fill prescriptions outside of military treatment \nfacilities.\n  Congress has worked hard to close the military-civilian pay gap, but \nthis year's NDAA is once again only set to give our military a 1-\npercent pay raise for the second straight year.\n  I believe our military servicemembers deserve a higher pay raise. I \nwill continue to push for that in the future, and I hope it is \nsomething we can work together on because we have to keep up with \ninflation for our men and women in uniform. It is very important.\n  One of the reasons it is important is that they are our greatest \ntreasure. The reason we have such a wonderful\n\n[[Page S6719]]\n\nmilitary--we can have the very best equipment, we can have the greatest \ntechnology--but the reason we have the best military in the world is \nbecause of our great men and women in uniform.\n  We can never lose sight of that. We can never lose sight of the \nimportance of our all-volunteer force. As we look at where we are with \ndefense spending, one thing that very much concerns me is the incoming \nimpact of sequester again in 2016 and 2017. It is my hope this body \nwill understand and work together in addressing sequester for our \ndefense because I see us continuing to be in a situation where our \nmilitary leaders come to us and ask us to take from the men and women \nin a way that is unacceptable because they are worried about sequester, \nthey are worried about the readiness of our troops, and they are \nconcerned they won't be able to provide the training and equipment our \ntroops need to meet and face the threats around the world and to ensure \nthat our men and women in uniform never become part of a hollow force.\n  The Presiding Officer serves on the Armed Services Committee with me. \nIt is my hope as we look at this NDAA that we don't set a precedent \nwhere we are continuing to take from our military, that we continue to \nlook to how we can work together to address sequester in the coming \nyears, because there is a big disconnect of where we are now. If we \nimpose the sequester in 2016 and 2017 with the threats we face around \nthe world, with what our men and women need to address those threats to \nkeep this country safe, what they deserve in terms of our support, \ngiven what we are asking them to do--they are the very best, and they \ngo out and do it on our behalf every single day. It is my hope we can \nwork together.\n  I have addressed these issues in my additional views to the 2015 \nDefense authorization, and it is my hope we will recognize the treasure \nthat is our men and women in uniform going forward, that we will cut \nthrough the partisan politics, that we will address sequester, and that \nour men and women in uniform will know that we will continue to stand \nby them.\n  This Defense authorization is important, but it also prefaces the \nchallenges we face coming forward in 2016 and 2017, which I believe we \nwill not be able to fully meet unless we come together and address \nsequester.\n  We do need to get the Defense authorization done today. There are \nprovisions that are very important for our national security. The \nissues I have addressed as concerns today I hope we aren't addressing \nthem again next year. I hope we can correct them and make sure that we \nare giving the men and women in uniform a pay raise that is better than \nthis year. I hope that together we can continue to work on a bipartisan \nbasis in the Armed Services Committee, as Chairman Levin has \nchampioned, as Senator Inhofe, as the ranking member has done as well, \nand I look forward to doing that in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                         Omnibus Spending Bill\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Later today or tomorrow, we are going to be dealing with \nthe $1 trillion omnibus bill, and I will explain why I will be firmly \nvoting against that bill.\n  But before I do, I think it is important to put the budget in the \nbroader context of what is happening in America. We can't look at a \nbudget in the abstract; we have to see it in the context. The context \nis that right now most Americans understand the middle class of this \ncountry is disappearing.\n  Median family income has gone down by $5,000 since 1999. Today the \nmedian male worker is making $700 less in inflation-adjusted dollars \nthan he made 41 years ago. The median female worker is making $1,300 \nless than she made 7 years ago. Meanwhile, while the middle class \ndisappears and we have more people living in poverty than at almost any \ntime in modern American history, the gap between the very rich and \neverybody else is growing wider. We have massive wealth inequality in \nAmerica. One family, the Walton family, owns more wealth than the \nbottom 40 percent of the American people. The top one-tenth of 1 \npercent owns more wealth than the bottom 90 percent of the American \npeople. Today, unbelievably, 95 percent of all new income is going to \nthe top 1 percent and corporate profits are at an all-time high. That \nis the overall reality of what is going on with the American economy \ntoday. And in the midst of that, we have the budget. So let's talk a \nlittle about this $1 trillion budget and how it addresses or doesn't \naddress the problems facing our country.\n\n  Are there good things in this budget? The answer is: Absolutely. I am \nchairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, and I want to thank \nChairman Mikulski and others for making sure that our VA gets the kind \nof budget they need. Included in that budget, by the way, is also a \nprovision called advanced appropriations for the VA, which will mean \nthat in the event of a government shutdown, veterans will still be able \nto get the disability benefits they desperately need. And there are \nother provisions in there that are very good.\n  But overall, if you look at the budget in the context of contemporary \nAmerican society, this is simply not a good budget. Let me pick up \nthree points where I have strong disagreements.\n  I think the vast majority of the American people understand that we \nhave huge unmet needs in this country. I expect in the Chair's State of \nVirginia, in Vermont, and all over this country we all know our \ninfrastructure is crumbling--our roads, bridges, water systems, \nwastewater plants. Our rail system is falling behind Europe, Japan, \nChina. We have enormous work to be done. The American Society of Civil \nEngineers tells us we have to invest $3 trillion into rebuilding our \ninfrastructure.\n  In terms of college, we know there are hundreds of thousands of \nbright young people who can't afford to go to college. Others are \ngraduating school saddled forever with these terrible debts from \ncollege or graduate school.\n  This budget doesn't address those problems. It doesn't address the \ncrisis of childcare, and the fact that in Vermont and around the \ncountry it is very hard for working-class families to get quality, \naffordable childcare.\n  But what this budget does do--people don't know it--roughly 60 \npercent of the budget goes to defense spending. It goes to defense \nspending. Sixty percent of the discretionary budget goes not to our \nkids, not to our elderly, not to students, not to working people, not \nto the infrastructure, not to all of the huge unmet needs we face as a \ncountry, but it goes to the military.\n  Does anyone here deny we need a strong military, a strong National \nGuard? I don't. We do. But sometimes, in tough times, you have to make \ntough decisions. And I think spending $554 billion on the military is \ntoo much.\n  I would point out, Mr. President, what I am sure you know; that it is \nclear--it has been admitted--that the military can't even audit itself. \nWe don't even know effectively and appropriately how the military is \nspending its money. They do not even have the computer technology to \ntell us where they are spending.\n  What we also know is that cost overruns in the military are \nextraordinary. Time after time after time an agreement is reached about \nhow much a weapons system will cost, and it turns out the contractor \nwas just joking because there is a huge overrun. And then we have \nfraud. Fraud. Virtually every major military contractor has been \ninvolved in fraud resulting in either convictions or settlements with \nthe government.\n  So we have folks here who last year were talking about cuts in \nnutrition programs, education, health care--you name it, programs that \nare life and death for working families--yet when it comes to the \nmilitary, we can spend $554 billion. I think that is too much.\n  Second of all, when you look at the global economy and you look at \nour international partners, I find it interesting that every other \nmajor country on Earth provides health care for all of their people as \na right except the United States; yet in terms of their defense \nspending, they are spending a heck of a lot less than we are. We are \nspending now almost--almost--as much as the entire rest of the world \ncombined.\n  So I object in this bill to the significant amount of money being \nspent on the military, and I would have hoped\n\n[[Page S6720]]\n\nthere would be more opposition to this large military expenditure.\n  The second point I want to make, and it has not gotten a whole lot of \nattention, is the impact this legislation will have on working people \nin terms of cuts in pensions. There are provisions in this bill, \nwritten in secret, which allow significant cuts in benefits for \nretirees who are members of multiemployer pension plans.\n  Let me quote from a recent Washington Post article regarding the \nchange in this bill:\n\n       The change would alter 40 years of federal law and could \n     affect millions of workers, many of them part of a shrinking \n     corps of middle-income employees in businesses such as \n     trucking, construction and supermarkets.\n\n  Reuters mentions this:\n\n       The centerpiece is a provision that would open the door to \n     cutting current beneficiaries' benefits, a retirement policy \n     taboo and a potential disaster for retirees on fixed incomes.\n\n  What does that mean? When you go to work for a company, you get \nwages, you get benefits, but you also, in some cases, get a promise in \nterms of a pension--what you will get when you retire after 20 years, \n30 years, 40 years of work. What this bill does is allow companies to \nrenege on that promise. It is my understanding that, in some cases, the \ncuts in pensions could be draconian. I am talking about a 50-percent \ncut.\n  Imagine somebody who has worked his or her entire life, expects to \nretire with a certain level of income, and suddenly, after 20, 30, 40 \nyears of work, wakes up in the morning and finds out that promise has \nbeen cut in half. Wow. That is awful. That is totally awful.\n  I remember back, as the American people do, that Wall Street--the \nCEOs of Wall Street--engaged in illegal and reckless behavior, which \ndrove this economy into the worst recession in modern history, \nimpacting millions and millions of people's lives. And what happened to \nWall Street? Well, Congress bailed them out. Congress bailed out the \nfolks on Wall Street whose criminal action caused the recession. Yet \nnow we have working people who have done nothing wrong except work \ntheir entire lives--10, 20, 30 years--and through no fault of their \nown, they are not getting bailed out. They are going to see a 50-\npercent reduction in their pensions.\n  That is unacceptable and that opens--it just opens up a future in \nterms of pensions which I think is very frightening for the American \npeople. So I can't support that provision as well.\n  The last point I want to make is getting back to Wall Street. In my \nvery strong opinion, we have reached the stage with Wall Street where \nthe major financial institutions are just too big, they are just too \npowerful. Anyone who thinks that Congress regulates Wall Street has got \nit backwards. The reality is that Wall Street, with their incredible \nwealth and lobbying capabilities and campaign contributions, regulates \nthe United States Congress. You cannot see a better example of that \nthan what is in this legislation.\n  This is the headline from a recent article in the New York Times: \n``Banks' Lobbyists Help in Drafting Financial Bills.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthis article.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 23, 2013]\n\n           Bank's Lobbyists Help in Drafting Financial Bills\n\n                    (By Eric Lipton and Ben Protess)\n\n       Washington.--Bank lobbyists are not leaving it to lawmakers \n     to draft legislation that softens financial regulations. \n     Instead, the lobbyists are helping to write it themselves.\n       One bill that sailed through the House Financial Services \n     Committee this month--over the objections of the Treasury \n     Department--was essentially Citigroup's, according to e-mails \n     reviewed by The New York Times. The bill would exempt broad \n     swathes of trades from new regulation.\n       In a sign of Wall Street's resurgent influence in \n     Washington, Citigroup's recommendations were reflected in \n     more than 70 lines of the House committee's 85-line bill. Two \n     crucial paragraphs, prepared by Citigroup in conjunction with \n     other Wall Street banks, were copied nearly word for word. \n     (Lawmakers changed two words to make them plural.)\n       The lobbying campaign shows how, three years after Congress \n     passed the most comprehensive overhaul of regulation since \n     the Depression, Wall Street is finding Washington a \n     friendlier place.\n       The cordial relations now include a growing number of \n     Democrats in both the House and the Senate, whose support the \n     banks need if they want to roll back parts of the 2010 \n     financial overhaul, known as Dodd-Frank.\n       This legislative push is a second front, with Wall Street's \n     other battle being waged against regulators who are drafting \n     detailed rules allowing them to enforce the law.\n       And as its lobbying campaign steps up, the financial \n     industry has doubled its already considerable giving to \n     political causes. The lawmakers who this month supported the \n     bills championed by Wall Street received twice as much in \n     contributions from financial institutions compared with those \n     who opposed them, according to an analysis of campaign \n     finance records performed by MapLight, a nonprofit group.\n       In recent weeks, Wall Street groups also held fund-raisers \n     for lawmakers who co-sponsored the bills. At one dinner \n     Wednesday night, corporate executives and lobbyists paid up \n     to $2,500 to dine in a private room of a Greek restaurant \n     just blocks from the Capitol with Representative Sean Patrick \n     Maloney, Democrat of New York, a co-sponsor of the bill \n     championed by Citigroup.\n       Industry officials acknowledged that they played a role in \n     drafting the legislation, but argued that the practice was \n     common in Washington. Some of the changes, they say, have \n     gained wide support, including from Ben S. Bernanke, the \n     Federal Reserve chairman. The changes, they added, were in an \n     effort to reach a compromise over the bills, not to undermine \n     Dodd-Frank.\n       ``We will provide input if we see a bill and it is \n     something we have interest in,'' said Kenneth E. Bentsen Jr., \n     a former lawmaker turned Wall Street lobbyist, who now serves \n     as president of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets \n     Association, or Sifma.\n       The close ties hardly surprise Wall Street critics, who \n     have long warned that the banks--whose small armies of \n     lobbyists include dozens of former Capitol Hill aides--\n     possess outsize influence in Washington.\n       ``The huge machinery of Wall Street information and \n     analysis skews the thinking of Congress,'' said Jeff \n     Connaughton, who has been both a lobbyist and Congressional \n     staff member.\n       Lawmakers who supported the industry-backed bills said they \n     did so because the effort was in the public interest. Yet \n     some agreed that the relationship with corporate groups was \n     at times uncomfortable.\n       ``I won't dispute for one second the problems of a system \n     that demands immense amount of fund-raisers by its \n     legislators,'' said Representative Jim Himes, a third-term \n     Democrat of Connecticut, who supported the recent industry-\n     backed bills and leads the party's fund-raising effort in the \n     House. A member of the Financial Services Committee and a \n     former banker at Goldman Sachs, he is one of the top \n     recipients of Wall Street donations. ``It's appalling, it's \n     disgusting, it's wasteful and it opens the possibility of \n     conflicts of interest and corruption. It's unfortunately the \n     world we live in.''\n       The passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, which took aim at \n     culprits of the financial crisis like lax mortgage lending \n     and the $700 trillion derivatives market, ushered in a new \n     phase of Wall Street lobbying. Over the last three years, \n     bank lobbyists have blitzed the regulatory agencies writing \n     rules under Dodd-Frank, chipping away at some regulations.\n       But the industry lobbyists also realized that Congress can \n     play a critical role in the campaign to mute Dodd-Frank.\n       The House Financial Services Committee has been a natural \n     target. Not only is it controlled by Republicans, who had \n     opposed Dodd-Frank, but freshmen lawmakers are often \n     appointed to the unusually large committee because it is seen \n     as a helpful base from which they can raise campaign funds.\n       For Wall Street, the committee is a place to push back \n     against Dodd-Frank. When banks and other corporations, for \n     example, feared that regulators would demand new scrutiny of \n     derivatives trades, they appealed to the committee. At the \n     time, regulators were completing Dodd-Frank's overhaul of \n     derivatives, contracts that allow companies to either \n     speculate in the markets or protect against risk. Derivatives \n     had pushed the insurance giant American International Group \n     to the brink of collapse in 2008. The question was whether \n     regulators would exempt certain in-house derivatives trades \n     between affiliates of big banks.\n       As the House committee was drafting a bill that would force \n     regulators to exempt many such trades, corporate lawyers like \n     Michael Bopp weighed in with their suggested changes, \n     according to e-mails reviewed by The Times. At one point, \n     when a House aide sent a potential compromise to Mr. Bopp, he \n     replied with additional tweaks.\n       In an interview, Mr. Bopp explained that he drafted the \n     proposal at the request of Congressional aides, who expressed \n     broad support for the change. The proposal, he explained, was \n     a ``compromise'' that was actually designed to ``limit the \n     scope'' of the exemption.\n       ``Everyone on the Hill wanted this bill, but they wanted to \n     make sure it wasn't subject to abuse,'' said Mr. Bopp, a \n     partner at the law firm Gibson, Dunn who was representing a \n     coalition of nonfinancial corporations that use derivatives \n     to hedge their risk.\n       Ultimately, the committee inserted every word of Mr. Bopp's \n     suggestion into a 2012\n\n[[Page S6721]]\n\n     version of the bill that passed the House, save for a slight \n     change in phrasing. A later iteration of the bill, passed by \n     the House committee earlier this month, also included some of \n     the same wording.\n       And when federal regulators in April released a rule \n     governing such trades, it was significantly less demanding \n     than the industry had feared, a decision that the industry \n     partly attributed to pressure stemming from Capitol Hill.\n       Citigroup and other major banks used a similar approach on \n     another derivatives bill. Under Dodd-Frank, banks must push \n     some derivatives trading into separate units that are not \n     backed by the government's insurance fund. The goal was to \n     isolate this risky trading.\n       The provision exempted many derivatives from the \n     requirement, but some Republicans proposed striking the so-\n     called push out provision altogether. After objections were \n     raised about the Republican plan, Citigroup lobbyists sent \n     around the bank's own compromise proposal that simply \n     exempted a wider array of derivatives. That recommendation, \n     put forth in late 2011, was largely part of the bill approved \n     by the House committee on May 7 and is now pending before \n     both the Senate and the House.\n       Citigroup executives said the change they advocated was \n     good for the financial system, not just the bank.\n       ``This view is shared not just by the industry but from \n     leaders such as Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke,'' said \n     Molly Millerwise Meiners, a Citigroup spokeswoman.\n       Industry executives said that the changes--which were \n     drafted in consultation with other major industry banks--will \n     make the financial system more secure, as the derivatives \n     trading that takes place inside the bank is subject to much \n     greater scrutiny.\n       Representative Maxine Waters, the ranking Democrat on the \n     Financial Services Committee, was among the few Democrats \n     opposing the change, echoing the concerns of consumer groups.\n       ``The bill restores the public subsidy to exotic Wall \n     Street activities,'' said Marcus Stanley, the policy director \n     of Americans for Financial Reform, a nonprofit group.\n       But most of the Democrats on the committee, along with 31 \n     Republicans, came to the industry's defense, including the \n     seven freshmen Democrats--most of whom have started to \n     receive donations this year from political action committees \n     of Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and other financial \n     institutions, records show.\n       Six days after the vote, several freshmen Democrats were in \n     New York to meet with bank executives, a tour organized by \n     Representative Joe Crowley, who helps lead the House \n     Democrats' fund-raising committee. The trip was planned \n     before the votes, and was not a fund-raiser, but it gave the \n     lawmakers a chance to meet with Wall Street's elite.\n       In addition to a tour of Goldman's Lower Manhattan \n     headquarters, and a meeting with Lloyd C. Blankfein, the \n     bank's chief executive, the lawmakers went to JPMorgan's Park \n     Avenue office. There, they chatted with Jamie Dimon, the \n     bank's chief, about Dodd-Frank and immigration reform.\n       The bank chief also delivered something of a pep talk.\n       America has the widest, deepest and most transparent \n     capital markets in the world,'' he said. ``Washington has \n     been dealt a good hand.''\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. And let me quote from that article:\n\n       In a sign of Wall Street's resurgent influence in \n     Washington, Citigroup's recommendations were reflected in \n     more than 70 lines of the House committee's 85-line bill. Two \n     crucial paragraphs, prepared by Citigroup in conjunction with \n     other Wall Street banks, were copied nearly word for word.\n\n  In other words, it is not even Members of Congress writing these \nbills, it is Wall Street writing the bills and getting them into this \nlegislation.\n  Now what does this legislation do? Well, we suffered the worst \neconomic crisis since the 1930s because of the greed, recklessness, and \nillegal behavior on Wall Street. What Wall Street did is engage in \nabsolutely reckless speculation, and then the chickens came home to \nroost. People could not pay back the debts they incurred on subprime \nmortgages, and the entire financial system of the United States of \nAmerica and the world was on the verge of collapse. So Congress, a few \nyears ago, passed Dodd-Frank. It didn't go anywhere near as far as I \nwould go. I believe we should break up these major financial \ninstitutions. I don't believe you can control them. I don't believe you \ncan regulate them. They regulate the Congress. But Dodd-Frank took some \nsteps toward that, and there was one provision I will quote--section \n716.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthis section I am going to quote from.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     SEC. 716. PROHIBITION AGAINST FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BAILOUTS OF \n                   SWAPS ENTITIES.\n\n       (a) Prohibition on Federal Assistance.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law (including regulations), no Federal \n     assistance may be provided to any swaps entity with respect \n     to any swap, security-based swap, or other activity of the \n     swaps entity.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Federal assistance.--The term ``Federal assistance'' \n     means the use of any advances from any Federal Reserve credit \n     facility or discount window that is not part of a program or \n     facility with broad-based eligibility under section 13(3)(A) \n     of the Federal Reserve Act, Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corporation insurance or guarantees for the purpose of--\n       (A) making any loan to, or purchasing any stock, equity \n     interest, or debt obligation of, any swaps entity;\n       (B) purchasing the assets of any swaps entity;\n       (C) guaranteeing any loan or debt issuance of any swaps \n     entity;

In \n     establishing the appropriate transition period to effect such \n     divestiture or cessation of activities, which may include \n     making the swaps entity an affiliate of the insured \n     depository institution, the appropriate Federal banking \n     agency shall take into account and make written findings \n     regarding the potential impact of such divestiture or \n     cessation of activities on the insured depository \n     institution's (1) mortgage lending, (2) small business \n     lending, (3) job creation, and (4) capital formation versus \n     the potential negative impact on insured depositors and the \n     Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corporation. The\n\n[[Page S6722]]\n\n     appropriate Federal banking agency may consider such other \n     factors as may be appropriate. The appropriate Federal \n     banking agency may place such conditions on the insured \n     depository institution's divestiture or ceasing of activities \n     of the swaps entity as it deems necessary and appropriate. \n     The transition period under this subsection may be extended \n     by the appropriate Federal banking agency, after consultation \n     with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the \n     Securities and Exchange Commission, for a period of up to 1 \n     additional year.\n       (g) Excluded Entities.--For purposes of this section, the \n     term ``swaps entity'' shall not include any insured \n     depository institution under the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Act or a covered financial company under title II which is in \n     a conservatorship, receivership, or a bridge bank operated by \n     the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\n       (h) Effective Date.--The prohibition in subsection (a) \n     shall be effective 2 years following the date on which this \n     Act is effective.\n       (i) Liquidation Required.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) FDIC insured institutions.--All swaps entities that are \n     FDIC insured institutions that are put into receivership or \n     declared insolvent as a result of swap or security-based swap \n     activity of the swaps entities shall be subject to the \n     termination or transfer of that swap or security-based swap \n     activity in accordance with applicable law prescribing the \n     treatment of those contracts. No taxpayer funds shall be used \n     to prevent the receivership of any swap entity resulting from \n     swap or security-based swap activity of the swaps entity.\n       (B) Institutions that pose a systemic risk and are subject \n     to heightened prudential supervision as regulated under \n     section 113.--All swaps entities that are institutions that \n     pose a systemic risk and are subject to heightened prudential \n     supervision as regulated under section 113, that are put into \n     receivership or declared insolvent as a result of swap or \n     security-based swap activity of the swaps entities shall be \n     subject to the termination or transfer of that swap or \n     security-based swap activity in accordance with applicable \n     law prescribing the treatment of those contracts.

Any such \n     determination by the Financial Stability Oversight Council of \n     a prohibition of federal assistance shall be made on an \n     institution-by-institution basis, and shall require the vote \n     of not fewer than two-thirds of the members of the Financial \n     Stability Oversight Council, which must include the vote by \n     the Chairman of the Council, the Chairman of the Board of \n     Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Chairperson \n     of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

NEW PRODUCT APPROVAL CFTC--SEC PROCESS.\n\n       (a) Amendments to the Commodity Exchange Act.--Section \n     2(a)(1)(C) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. \n     2(a)(1)(C)) is amended--\n       (1) in clause (i) by striking ``This'' and inserting ``(I) \n     Except as provided in subclause (II), this''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end of clause (i) the following:\n\n       ``(II) This Act shall apply to and the Commission shall \n     have jurisdiction with respect to accounts, agreements, and \n     transactions involving, and may permit the listing for \n     trading pursuant to section 5c(c) of, a put, call, or other \n     option on 1 or more securities (as defined in section 2(a)(1) \n     of the Securities Act of 1933 or section 3(a)(10) of the \n     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on the date of enactment of \n     the Futures Trading Act of 1982), including any group or \n     index of such securities, or any interest therein or based on \n     the value thereof, that is exempted by the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission pursuant to section 36(a)(1) of the \n     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with the condition that the \n     Commission exercise concurrent jurisdiction over such put, \n     call, or other option; provided, however, that nothing in \n     this paragraph shall be construed to affect the jurisdiction \n     and authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission over \n     such put, call, or other option.''.\n\n       (b) Amendments to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.--The \n     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended by adding the \n     following section after section 3A (15 U.S.C. 78c-1):\n\n     ``SEC. 3B.

This is the title of the provision, 716, that this bill \nrepeals: ``Prohibition Against Federal Government Bailouts of Swaps \nEntities.''\n  Now to quote from that section:\n\n       (A) Prohibition on Federal Assistance--notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law (including regulations), no Federal \n     assistance may be provided to any swaps entity with respect \n     to any swap, security-based swap, or other activity of the \n     swaps entity.\n\n  That is what is being repealed. So Wall Street, as a result of the \nwork of Citigroup and the other Wall Street companies, can now continue \nto engage in reckless derivatives speculation. And when they make a \nwhole lot of money, they get richer. But when they lose money, because \nof the repeal of this provision, it is the taxpayers of this country \nwho have to bail them out.\n  Does anybody--anybody--think that makes any sense at all? That is in \nthis bill.\n  So for those reasons and more, I would hope very much that the Senate \nrejects this agreement and that we renegotiate. No one wants to see the \ngovernment shut down, but we must negotiate an agreement that is much \nfairer to the American people and to the working families of our \ncountry.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I inquire of the Senator from Wisconsin \nhow much time she is going to need to take.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Senator, less than 10 minutes.\n  Mr. COBURN. I would prefer she go ahead and I will do all mine in \nconsequence, if I may.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his \ncourtesy, and I am delighted to rise today to mark the passage of the \nFiscal Year 2015 National Defense Authorization Act. This bill is a \nproduct of bipartisan negotiations between the House and Senate Armed \nServices Committees, and I thank Chairman Levin and Ranking Member \nInhofe, Chairman McKeon and Ranking Member Adam Smith in the House for \ntheir hard work.\n  This critical bill establishes our national security policy and \nsupports our dedicated men and women in uniform and their families. I \nam particularly pleased that the legislation supports Wisconsin \nmanufacturers and workers who build ships and engines and military \nvehicles that help our Nation meet its national security needs.\n  On the eve of his retirement from the Senate, I want to offer a \nspecial thank\n\n[[Page S6723]]\n\nyou to Senator Carl Levin for his magnificent work as chairman of the \ncommittee on this bill and for working with me to include a military \nland transfer in Wisconsin at the site of the former Badger Army \nAmmunition Plant. I have been working on this project since my election \nto the House of Representatives 16 years ago, and I am extremely \ngrateful to Chairman Levin and his staff for helping me push this \nlegislation across the finish line.\n\n  The extraordinary piece of land I am talking about consists of some \n7,500 acres. It is bordered by the rolling Baraboo Hills, which hosts \nthe largest flock of upland forest of oak and maple and basswood still \nstanding in southern Wisconsin. It is bounded also by Wisconsin's \nbeautiful Devils Lake State Park and a segment of the Ice Age Trail, \nwhich is part of the National Trails System. To its east it is skirted \nby the mighty Wisconsin River that flows toward the Mississippi.\n  For the better part of the past century, it has been the site of a \nbustling manufacturing plant, once the largest munitions plant in the \nworld which produced munitions for American troops that they used from \nWorld War II through Vietnam. We can see a historic aerial photograph \nto my left of what that property looked like with the Baraboo Bluffs \nand the Wisconsin River. Before that, the site was home to 90 \nlandowners who farmed the land, and well before that, the land was \ncherished ground for the Ho-Chunk Nation, whose people grew traditional \ncrops and gathered medicinal plants from the land. This land is revered \nby the Ho-Chunk Nation and is connected to their ancestral history, \nwith oral history of the land dating back hundreds of years.\n  In 1997 discussions began on the future of this land after the Army \nclosed the plant, declaring it to be surplus to its needs, and began \nthe process of remediation of the contaminated soil at the site. Some \nthought it should be sold for commercial development, but the local \ncommunity opposed that option, understanding that the land's unique \nattributes needed to be preserved and wishing to see it restored to its \nnatural beauty.\n  I always felt that the community--and not bureaucrats in Washington--\nshould be empowered to make decisions about the future of this site. I \nregarded this as a once-in-a-generation and maybe a once-in-a-lifetime \nopportunity for this community. So as a freshman Member of Congress, I \nsecured a Federal grant to establish a community consensus process to \nrecommend a reuse plan. This process brought every stakeholder to the \ntable.\n  In 2001, after nearly 2 years of hard work, the Badger Reuse \nCommittee issued a report supported by all the participating parties--\nincluding State and Federal and tribal entities--outlining agreement on \nfuture uses. Some said that consensus would be nearly impossible, but \nwe proved that local stakeholders, working together, could achieve a \nvisionary future for this incredible property. What was that consensus? \nThe consensus was that the property should be comanaged in perpetuity \nas one property for agricultural, recreational, educational, and \nconservation purposes.\n  The photo to my left shows a stark contrast to the photo you just saw \nof the Badger Army Ammunition Plant, as the property has been gradually \nrestored over time. Since that time, most of the parcels at this site \nhave been transferred--one parcel to the U.S. Department of Agriculture \nfor dairy forage research, another to the State of Wisconsin to provide \nopportunities for low-impact recreation. But one major parcel essential \nto the community's vision at this site has been caught in bureaucratic \ndisagreement for nearly a decade.\n  This legislation will finally allow that parcel to be transferred \nfrom the Army to the Department of the Interior, which will hold the \nland in trust for the Ho-Chunk Nation. This transfer has been stalled \nby an interagency dispute over which Federal agency would have \nresponsibility for future environmental cleanup at the site. The \nlegislative intent of this provision follows the legislative intent of \nour environmental superfund laws: The polluter must pay for \ncontamination they caused.\n  As to future uses, the Ho-Chunk Nation participated in the consensus \nprocess that culminated in the Badger Reuse Plan, where they expressed \ninterest in holding the lands in trust in order to preserve native \nprairie habitat and graze bison. Since that time, the Ho-Chunk Nation \nhas reaffirmed their interest in receiving this land for prairie \nrestoration--a reuse that reaffirms the vision of the Badger Reuse \nCommittee that all the new holders of these lands--the U.S. Department \nof Agriculture, the State of Wisconsin, and the Ho-Chunk Nation--would \nmanage the property in coordination with one another, reflecting the \nsite as a whole.\n  In October of this year the tribe updated its land use plan for the \nparcel in this transfer. I ask unanimous consent to have that document \nand a technical description of this transfer printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From Ho-Chunk Nation, Oct. 2014]\n\n  Land Management Plan for Former Badger Army Ammunition Plant Parcels\n\n\n                            1.0 Master Plan\n\n                         1.1 Executive Summary\n\n       The Ho-Chunk Nation (HCN) has requested the transfer of an \n     estimated 1552.71 acres of the Badger Army Ammunition Plant \n     (BAAP) declared as surplus pursuant to 25 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 450j(f)(3). This transfer would be for the use and \n     benefit of the Ho-Chunk Nation and their people. The BAAP \n     land has very important historic and cultural significance to \n     the Ho-Chunk people, as it lies within their aboriginal \n     territory and includes a number of historic and pre-historic \n     sites of significance to the tribe.\n       The transfer of a portion of the BAAP land to the Nation \n     would allow for the restoration of the natural habitats \n     including prairie, wetlands and oak savanna. Habitat \n     restoration activities would complement the reintroduction of \n     a bison herd onto the BAAP property. The bison program will \n     be vital to combating diabetes and other health problems \n     which are common among the Ho-Chunk People. Lastly, the \n     transfer would allow for an increased level of protection and \n     preservation of the historical and cultural elements found on \n     the property.\n       The purpose of acquiring the BAAP parcel is, as reflected \n     in the mission statement of the United States Department of \n     the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs ``to enhance the \n     quality of life, to promote economic opportunity, and to \n     carry out the responsibility to protect and improve the trust \n     assets of American Indians, Indian Tribes and Alaska \n     Natives.'' In accord with those objectives and the Indian \n     Self-Determination Act, acquisition of this property for the \n     benefit of the Ho-Chunk Nation would provide, promote and \n     enhance the Ho-Chunk Nation programs for historic and \n     cultural resource protection, natural resource enhancement, \n     education, employment and economic development. The property \n     would be used to strengthen and expand these programs that \n     are supported, in significant part, by contracts between the \n     Nation and the Department pursuant to the Self-Determination \n     Act, and will primarily benefit the Nation's 7,415 enrolled \n     tribal members.\n\n\n                            1.2 Introduction\n\n       The Badger Army Ammunition Plant occupies 7,354 acres in \n     the predominantly rural countryside of Sauk County, \n     Wisconsin. The Badger Plant was constructed in 1942 following \n     the United States entry into World War II. The Plant provided \n     ammunition propellant for the duration of the war effort, and \n     was again operative during the Korean and Vietnam Wars. In \n     late 1997 the U.S. Army determined that the BAAP facility was \n     no longer needed to meet the United States defense needs.\n       Subsequent efforts to define a future for the Badger \n     property have proved challenging due to the site's unusually \n     rich natural and cultural history, the wide range of \n     potential reuse options, and the complexity of local, state, \n     national, and tribal interests involved. The current scenario \n     would result in the Ho-Chunk Nation acquiring 1552.71 acres \n     with the remaining acreage being divided amongst several \n     landowners including the WI Dept. of Natural Resources, U.S. \n     Dept. of Agriculture-Dairy Forage Research Center, Bluffview \n     Sanitary District, WI Dept. of Transportation and the Town of \n     Sumpter.\n\n\n                        1.3 Goals and Objectives\n\n       The resources of BAAP will be managed by the Ho-Chunk \n     Nation to promote, preserve, and enhance its unique natural, \n     scenic, and cultural features. Management activities are \n     intended to:\n       Protect the aesthetic, cultural, scenic, and wild qualities \n     as well as the native wildlife and plant communities. Special \n     emphasis will be placed on designated federal and state-\n     listed species, species of special concern, and other unique \n     biotic features.\n       Protect, conserve, and maintain all significant cultural \n     sites.\n       Provide for and manage the use and enjoyment by visitors \n     and maintain a diversity of low-impact recreational \n     opportunities for people of all abilities.\n       Utilize sound natural resource and agriculture management \n     practices to improve water quality, maintain soil \n     productivity, and protect wildlife habitat.\n       Develop a bison program to support HCN nutritional programs \n     and provide educational opportunities.\n       Strive to operate a self-supporting project through grants, \n     donations, bequests, and possibly fee-based recreation that \n     is consistent\n\n[[Page S6724]]\n\n     with the overriding commitment to preserve Badger's natural, \n     historical and cultural features.\n       Ultimately establish and maintain a visitor's center that \n     includes information and exhibits on Badger's geologic and \n     natural uniqueness, bison management, cultural significance \n     and history of the ammunition plant. The center would also \n     provide information and exhibits on the history of Native \n     Americans and Euro-American habitation of the Sauk Prairie, \n     as well as an educational classroom.\n\n\n                        2.0 Land Management Plan\n\n                    2.1 Overall Ecosystem Management\n\n       Ecosystem is a term that has crept into the nation's \n     collective vocabulary and is commonly used in regard to \n     environmental issues; but what does it really mean, and how \n     is it relevant to the management of the Badger Army \n     Ammunition Plant? Ecosystem is derived from ecology, the \n     branch of biology that studies the relationships between \n     living organisms and their environment, and their dependency \n     upon each other for survival. When the organisms and the \n     environment interact, an ecosystem is formed. The \n     exploitation or neglect of any organism can upset the \n     delicate balance such that the system is forever changed.\n       An ecosystem not only encompasses water, land, air and \n     wildlife, it also includes people. Of all the organisms in an \n     ecosystem, Homo sapiens have the most impact and the greatest \n     influence in preventing the loss and exploitation of other \n     species. The demise of species and their habitat is all too \n     often the unfortunate consequence of humans trying to conquer \n     their environment for the sake of development and economic \n     gain. Natural and cultural resources, and the environmental \n     processes that affect them, are fundamentally influenced by \n     society and vice versa.\n       Understanding the complex interrelationships within an \n     ecosystem and a commitment to their maintenance are essential \n     in ensuring a vital ecosystem--a high quality of life, \n     healthy environment, and a productive, sustainable economy. \n     The National Park Service states that ``The long-term \n     sustainability of the environmental, societal, and economic \n     systems on which public lands and their surrounding human \n     communities depend, requires a collaborative approach that \n     integrates scientific knowledge and maintains flexibility in \n     order to make adjustments over time.'' (Sustainability can be \n     defined as a contract among the people, the land, and future \n     generations which maintains and renews resources for the \n     long-term.) Therefore, the knowledge and skills of natural \n     resource professionals will be used to preserve the Badger \n     Army Ammunition Plant as a distinct resource, rather than \n     relying on nostalgia and politics to make management-related \n     decisions.\n       The primary goals of ecosystem management are to conserve, \n     restore, and maintain the ecological integrity, productivity, \n     and biological diversity of natural landscapes. The \n     overriding objective is to ensure the ecological \n     sustainability of the land. The Ho-Chunk Nation will adapt an \n     ecosystem management approach that will encompass the natural \n     environment, society, and economy--the entire system. This \n     vision is based on the awareness that the resources protected \n     within Badger are not isolated from the surrounding \n     communities and environment but are inextricably linked to \n     them. Any upcoming strategies that the Ho-Chunk Nation \n     embarks upon to preserve and protect the property will work \n     towards providing a balance between human needs and long-term \n     environmental protection.\n       Ecosystem management will strive to restore and sustain the \n     health, productivity, and biological diversity of ecosystems \n     and the overall quality of life through a natural resource \n     management approach that is fully integrated with social and \n     economic goals. Although the ecosystem management approach is \n     more effective than species-by-species management, the needs \n     of certain key species must receive priority attention as \n     part of ecosystem management.\n       For every action there is an equal or greater reaction. The \n     activities of the visitors, though they may be low-impact, \n     will inevitably affect the ecosystems of Badger, adjacent \n     land, and local communities. It will be the Ho-Chunk Nation's \n     primary responsibility to balance the repercussions of all \n     activities with the health of the ecosystems while \n     contributing to the local economy. Education and information \n     are the keys to the preservation and protection of the Badger \n     property and its resources. In addition to providing \n     ecosystem management, the Ho-Chunk Nation will strive to \n     include education in all management activities. The more \n     visitors and the local community understand the dynamics of \n     the ecosystem of which they are a part, the greater their \n     respect will be for the many elements comprising the system. \n     Providing a deeper understanding of the web of life will be \n     beneficial to the visitors of today, as well as to the future \n     generations who will be the ultimate caretakers of the land.\n\n\n                          2.2 Land Management\n\n                             2.2.1 Mission\n\n       Land Management will ensure protection of the soils, \n     waters, flora, and fauna that comprise the Badger property \n     through sound management techniques and consideration of the \n     human influence.\n\n\n                         2.2.2 Management Goals\n\n       Provide resource-based research opportunities for \n     educational purposes.\n       Explore both traditional and innovative land and water \n     management practices.\n       Improve and maintain wildlife habitat.\n       Preserve and protect biological diversity.\n       Restore and develop the native ecosystems.\n       Improve aesthetic views.\n       Improve and maintain the health of the natural ecosystems, \n     especially where recreation activities are likely to be most \n     intense.\n       Develop monitoring programs for wildlife, vegetation, and \n     water quality.\n       Control and eradicate invasive species, such as garlic \n     mustard, buckthorn, reed canary grass, olives and \n     honeysuckle.\n       Monitor management and visitor impacts on the natural \n     features of the Badger property and use gathered information \n     to modify management actions when necessary.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                        Statement for the Record\n\n                 [Senator Tammy Baldwin, Dec. 11, 2014]\n\n\nTechnical description of Section 3078 of H.R. 3979, the Carl Levin and \nHoward P. ``Buck'' McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n                               Year 2015\n\n       I am offering this statement to clarify the legislative \n     intent of Section 3078 of H.R. 3979 and to detail the \n     intended use of the land which will be transferred as a \n     result of Section 3078.\n       Earlier this year, when Congress first began its \n     consideration of the National Defense Authorization Act for \n     FY 2015, I drafted this provision for inclusion as an \n     amendment to S. 2410, the Senate Armed Services Committee-\n     reported version of the bill. I then successfully worked with \n     numerous Congressional committees of jurisdiction to ensure \n     that my amendment--numbered 3393 and filed on June 26, 2014--\n     would be considered in scope for an eventual conference \n     committee between the Senate and House. That amendment text \n     served as the framework for the ultimate transfer language \n     included as Section 3078 in H.R. 3979, the final conference \n     committee reported defense bill.\n       Section 3078 of H.R. 3979 transfers approximately 1,553 \n     acres of land located within the former Badger Army \n     Ammunition Plant to the Department of Interior in trust for \n     the Ho-Chunk Nation.\n       The transfer has been stalled by an interagency dispute \n     over the federal government's responsibility for \n     environmental cleanup at the site. The legislative intent of \n     this provision follows the legislative intent of our \n     environmental superfund laws--the polluter must pay for \n     contamination they caused. For many decades, the Department \n     of Defense operated the Badger Army Ammunition Plant on this \n     property. Among other things, this legislation makes clear \n     that the Army retains responsibility for environmental \n     contamination from Department of Defense conduct or \n     activities prior to transfer and is responsible for taking \n     any necessary remedial actions related to environmental \n     contamination in the future.\n       This responsibility for environmental remediation applies \n     to activities of the Department of Defense, which includes \n     activities conducted by contractors on behalf of the \n     Department of Defense. Most of the activities conducted on \n     the 1553 acres of land to be transferred to the Ho-Chunk \n     Nation were performed by independent contractors or other \n     contractors for the U.S. Army, the Department of Defense, or \n     both. Section 3078(c)(2) of H.R. 3979 is intended to ensure \n     that the Secretary of the Army remains responsible for \n     remediating hazardous substances resulting from the \n     activities of the Department of Defense, and that the \n     ``activities of the Department of Defense'' includes \n     activities undertaken by the officers and agents employed or \n     contracted by the Department of Defense; but nothing in this \n     section is intended to diminish or increase the liability of \n     any third party or otherwise affect the liability of any \n     third party as established under any other provision of law.\n       While this legislation transfers the land to Interior in \n     trust for the Nation, it also makes clear that Interior does \n     not take on liability or responsibility for certain conduct \n     or activities that took place on the land before the \n     transfer. The Department of Interior's Indian Affairs budget \n     should not, now or in the future, be tapped to remediate \n     environmental contamination on the property that was caused \n     by the Department of Defense. Those funds are intended for \n     the benefit of all federally recognized Indian tribes. \n     Therefore, this legislation seeks to clarify that the \n     Department of Defense, not the Department of Interior, is \n     responsible or liable for any environmental contamination \n     that occurred from the activities of the Department of \n     Defense prior to the transfer.\n       This legislation will quickly transfer the lands and allow \n     the Ho-Chunk Nation to quickly make use of them. This \n     acquisition will be expedited by a number of things, \n     including that the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) is not \n     required to conduct any additional processing before the land \n     is placed in trust. Instead, the acquisition of the land in \n     trust by the Bureau of Indian Affairs is effectuated by this \n     legislation. The structures on the property will be \n     transferred to the Ho-Chunk Nation in fee as soon as the \n     Nation provides the Secretary of Interior with a tribal \n     resolution authorizing the transfer.\n       I would also like to explain the intended use of the land \n     following the transfer. In 1997, the Army declared they would \n     no longer use this site and stakeholders gathered together to \n     recommend future uses for the property. The Ho-Chunk Nation \n     was one of multiple stakeholders, including representatives \n     of local governments, the State, the\n\n[[Page S6725]]\n\n     federal government, and citizen groups that participated in \n     this process. In 2001, these stakeholders issued their \n     recommendations in the Badger Reuse Plan, which set forth a \n     vision that the land would be co-managed by three main \n     property owners, and that those property owners would manage \n     them in coordination that reflects the site as a whole. \n     During the reuse process, the Ho-Chunk expressed interest in \n     holding lands at the site in trust in order to preserve \n     native prairie habitat and graze bison, and the Badger Reuse \n     Plan recommended they receive the land accordingly. Since \n     that time, the Ho-Chunk Nation has reaffirmed their interest \n     in receiving the land for prairie restoration. In October of \n     this year, the tribe updated its Land Use Plan for the parcel \n     in this transfer, further affirming their prairie restoration \n     goals for the site--goals that will be able to turn to \n     actions now that this long-stalled transfer is finally \n     resolved.\n\n  Ms. BALDWIN. These 1,553 acres represent the last major parcel at the \nBadger Army Ammunition Plant site to leave Army management. The \nresolution this transfer will bring is long overdue, and I am proud to \nhave played a role in defining the community's vision and bringing it \nto a reality.\n  The action we take this week--hopefully later today--will benefit \nmany generations to come.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I first congratulate my colleague from \nWisconsin. There is a lot of controversy over lands packages, and her \nvery pleasant example is what isn't controversial.\n  The reason we have a discussion about what is going on is the very \nmundane--the very things we can get done have never been brought \nforward on the floor without being brought forward with a very \ncontroversial land project. So I agree with her 100 percent that what \nis happening for her and the people of Wisconsin and her tribal nation \nis absolutely appropriate.\n  The question we ought to ask and the question that causes all the \ntrouble is, Why in the world does the Federal Government own 640 \nmillion acres of our land and have all sorts of rules--of our land--\nthat say we can't utilize it in a way that is best for our citizens, \nbest for our States, best for our region, best for the ecology, and \nbest for preservation of history? Until Congress solves that problem, \nwe are going to continue to have these battles.\n  What is disappointing to me is we spent 1\\1/2\\ years looking at the \nNational Park Service--which nobody in this body read. It is quality \nscholarship. It is scholarship that the Park Service agrees with. It is \nscholarship that the historians of the Park Service agree with. It is \nscholarship that the people who write about the parks agree with.\n  So today we have before us a bill that has 68 separate land items in \nit, of which 40 are totally noncontroversial, which could have been run \nacross the floor 2 years ago, I would tell my colleague from Wisconsin, \nbut they were chosen not to because the desire is to get recognition at \nhome and expand the National Park Service.\n  If we were to happen to just take the couple hours to read this, we \nwould see right now why expanding the National Park Service is a \ndisastrous idea. The reason it is a disastrous idea is our parks are \nfalling apart--a $12 billion backlog on our most pristine, greatest \nnational monuments and parks with which we have set the pace for the \nrest of the world in terms of recognizing and valuing such wonderful \nnatural landscape and creation. But we have ignored that because the \ndesire to please a parochial benefit at the expense of harming these \nmost precious resources cannot be resisted by most of our colleagues.\n  So I find myself on the floor today. I know I won't win this battle, \nbut I won't quit fighting. We should fight for what we have already \ninvested in. We should preserve what we have already invested in. We \nare falling behind $250 million a year.\n  It is ludicrous to say this bill doesn't cost anything. It costs $320 \nmillion a year, the ``no cost park program'' that we are putting out \nand saying it doesn't cost anything.\n  I was born in Wyoming. I love Yellowstone. I love the Great Rocky \nMountains national forest. I love our wonderful programs. But the vast \nmajority of the parks we have created in the last 20 years are nothing \nbut drains on the National Park Service. We have the data--this has the \ndata to show that. We are going to do the largest expansion of national \nparks since 1978 in this bill, and we don't have the money for it.\n  So what will happen as this goes through? And I say to my colleague \nfrom Wisconsin, you are absolutely right--yours should fly through \nhere. It is not a significant cost. You are absolutely right. But \nfixing the real problem is restoring the right to the States to the \nlands that are there, taking it out of the hands of the Federal \nGovernment, and letting the States make the decisions about what \nhappens to the land within their confines.\n  So it is disappointing to me that when great scholarship is done and \nis recognized, parochialism trumps even the reading of the information \nwith which to make good decisions. And it is a blight on the Senate. We \ndon't have to agree with everything in this, but we can't deny the \nfacts that are totally documented in this. We can't deny the statements \nof the National Park Service. We can't deny the people we are actually \ncharging to do this--we can't deny their concerns about what we are \ngetting ready to do.\n  Let me read for a moment what Harry Butowski, a historian who \nrecently retired from the National Park Service, said about this bill. \nHe summed up how Congress is out of touch with National Park Service \nneeds and priorities when he was expressing his opposition to the lands \npackage in the national defense authorization bill, of all places.\n  He said:\n\n       I think it is irresponsible for Congress to create so many \n     new parks, heritage areas and expansions of existing units \n     and not provide the funding and manpower necessary to manage \n     what we now have.\n       I think the National Park System should not be added to or \n     expanded until we can fund and staff all of our parks and \n     programs. To add more units at this time is just not \n     responsible. It is the opposite of good management.\n\n  Here is the historian for the Park Service telling us as Members of \nthe Senate: You are irresponsible in what you are doing.\n  I know we will blow that off. That doesn't mean anything. But this is \nsomebody who has had his eye on the Park Service for years.\n\n       . . . Perhaps what Congress should do is an analysis of the \n     entire National Park System and start getting rid of marginal \n     units that cost many dollars and have few visitors.\n\n  That is exactly what this report recommends. But nobody read it, \nstudied it, considered it, to try to solve the problem. And it doesn't \nmean we cannot have new national parks--we can--but we ought to have a \nplan to take care of the ones we have now before we add additional \nnational parks and put at risk the most fantastic National Park System \nin the world.\n  Here is what the first National Park Director stated--the first one--\nand we ought to pay attention to him.\n\n       The national park system as now constituted should not be \n     allowed to be lowered in standard, dignity, and prestige by \n     the inclusion of areas which express in less than the highest \n     terms the particular class or kind of exhibit which they \n     represent.\n\n  Let me tell you, this is exactly what he is talking about.\n  Hinchcliff Stadium in Patterson, NJ, is going to add $100,000 to the \nPark System. Does it have historical significance? Yes. Should it be \npart of the Park System? Absolutely not. Does it look good for those \nwho sponsored it back home? Yes. Get the attaboys back home. But what \ndamage do you do to Yellowstone, Yosemite, Rocky Mountain National \nPark, Grand Mesa, Grand Canyon? What pain, what lack of maintenance, \ncomes across from that?\n  I have stated before, I have no problem with land swaps and \nconveyances. I think we ought to make them easy, and the best way to \nmake them easy is to get the Federal Government out of them, and return \nthe land that is in Wisconsin that the Federal Government owns to the \npeople of Wisconsin. They will be the best stewards of that land. Same \nthing in Oklahoma, in Colorado, in California, in Washington State, and \nArizona, and in Nevada, where it has the largest percentage ownership \nby the Federal Government. We have to kowtow to a bunch of bureaucrats \nin Washington for the people in the State of Nevada to do what is in \nthe best interests in the State of Nevada of the land that is there? \nThat makes no sense.\n  I have mentioned the bill is not deficit neutral--$310 million, \nincluding\n\n[[Page S6726]]\n\nmore than $200 million in cost to the National Park System, is going to \ncome through with this bill, and unless you assume that nothing is \ngoing to happen that is authorized in this, there is no way you can \ndeny this doesn't cost another half a billion dollars a year. As a \nmatter of fact, I found it interesting listening to the chairwoman of \nthe energy committee this past week when she was excited about this \nland package because we are clearing all the old land pieces of \nlegislation.\n  So we are taking care of the politicians, but are we taking care of \nthe parks? Are we doing what is in the best long-term interest of \npreserving the pristine, unique aspects of our country as we add \nballfields or the old Colt manufacturing facility in Connecticut? \nReally, a national park? Does it meet the requirements as set out in \nparks? No, it doesn't come close to meeting requirements for a national \npark, but it is in there, because it is going to look good to a \npolitician back home.\n  I kind of used the commonsense test. The country is broke. We had a \n$460 billion deficit last year. We are going to add a half a billion \ndollars on to a park system that has a $12 billion deficit in terms of \nbacklog of repairs of what we already have. Most people with any \nsemblance of common sense would say that is really stupid. It is really \ndestructive of the whole goal of the National Park System in the first \nplace.\n  The final point I would make is the NDAA. Even though it is a \nnecessary bill, I want it to pass, I want us to have what we need for \nour military, this bill represents the worst of Washington; because \nwhat we have added to a must-pass bill are measures that are very low \npriority in terms of the long-term priorities of the country and fiscal \nsoundness of the country, but are really high priorities for the \npoliticians in this body. It is amazing how we can take something as \nimportant as the Defense authorization bill--the measure that is going \nto give our military leaders what they need to make the decisions to \ndefend this country in this very dangerous world today, and lard it up \nwith things that don't need to be happening right now--shouldn't be \nhappening right now, and can be happening in other ways.\n  The reason I will assuredly lose this vote is because it has already \nbeen bought and paid for, because 35 States have something in title \nXXX, and most politicians up here don't have the courage to vote \nagainst their State interests when it harms the national interest. It \nis just not there.\n  Alaska: Two provisions, $3 million; backlog on Alaska parks, $121 \nmillion. Arizona: Two provisions worth $2 million; backlog, $592 \nmillion in terms of their national parks. California: Four provisions \nthat reduce the deficit by $225,000, but a backlog of $1.6 billion at \nYosemite and other parks throughout California. Colorado: A provision \nworth $500,000, backlog, a quarter of a billion dollars. Connecticut: \nOne provision, $9 million, backlog, $6.2 million. This is the \nColtsville National Historic Park.\n\n  But none of that--none of that--meets the requirements as set out by \nthe National Park Service of meeting the requirements for a park. So we \njust violate the rules--to heck with the rules--because we are going to \ndo it.\n  Georgia: $400,000--they have a $100 million backlog. Idaho: $17 \nmillion backlog. Kentucky: $112 million backlog. Maryland: One \nprovision worth $12 million, and a $363 million backlog on our parks in \nMaryland. Massachusetts: Quarter of a billion dollars in backlog. \nMaine: $72 million in backlogs. Mississippi: A $26 million provision--a \nquarter of a billion dollars in backlog in our battlefield parks in \nMississippi. Montana: Five provisions--great parks out there--$348.8 \nmillion in backlogs. But we are going to spend this money. North \nCarolina: One little small provision--6 million bucks, but a backlog of \na half a billion dollars in our pristine parks.\n  I won't continue.\n  I understand the frustration of my colleagues in terms of trying to \nget land conveyances. We can do them, but not if we always hijack them \nwith something that is of better parochial and political benefit for \nthe Member, and that is why they don't go through. The land conveyances \naren't hard to get through. We always add them with something that is \ncontroversial that shouldn't be there, to the benefit of a politician.\n\n\n                            Motion to Refer\n\n  Mr. President, I send a motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] moves to refer the \n     House message to accompany H.R. 3979 to the Committee on \n     Armed Services with instructions to report back forthwith \n     with changes to strike title XXX, the nondefense related \n     lands portion of the bill.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I will be asking for a vote on this \nmotion. I am sure it will be tabled, and I understand that, but I hope \nthe American public has gotten a flavor of what we are doing.\n  Here in the end of December, we are trying to get one of the most \nimportant pieces of legislation out, which is the Defense authorization \nbill. We are trying to get the appropriations bill through December 30 \nof next year, and what we do is put the politicians' interests first.\n  Maybe that is too harsh. Let me take that back. Maybe we put the Park \nService's best interests last, which is even worse.\n  I have asked direction from the Chair. I have three other areas that \nI need to speak on today. I will hold those or follow the direction of \nthe Chair in terms of bringing forth both motions and discussions.\n  I would also ask unanimous consent to have an article by Kurt \nRepanshek, dated December 9, 2014, entered into the Record, the \n``Traveler's View.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the National Parks Traveler, Dec. 9, 2014]\n\n Traveler's View: Senate Should Either Fund New Parks In Defense Bill, \n                           or Strip Them Out\n\n                          (By Kurt Repanshek)\n\n       There are at least 75 million reasons why the U.S. Senate \n     should either fully fund the national park projects contained \n     within the defense authorization bill, or strip them out.\n       For the National Park Service, already billions of dollars \n     in the red with its maintenance and operations budget, and \n     cutting staff in crucial areas such as cultural resources, to \n     be asked to add seven new national park units, adjust the \n     boundaries of nine units, and redesignate two of those units, \n     without any new funding, is incredibly poor legislating by \n     Congress and will not enhance, but rather degrade the overall \n     system.\n       This is not to judge the worthiness of the prospective \n     units as part of the National Park System, but rather to \n     point out the fiscal absurdity in play. Congressional Budget \n     Office figures show it would cost the Park Service at least \n     $75 million over a five-year period to get these units up and \n     running, and millions more to operate them on an annual \n     basis. At the same time, the Park Service's maintenance \n     backlog has crept up to $11.3 billion, and some of those \n     needs are critical.\n       According to the Park Service, 90 percent of the roads in \n     the system are considered to be in ``fair'' or ``poor'' \n     condition; ``28 publicly accessible bridges within the parks' \n     transportation system are ``structurally deficient'' and in \n     need of rehabilitation or reconstruction;'' ``approximately \n     36 percent of all trails throughout the National Park Service \n     (6,700 miles out of a total of 18,600) are in a ``poor'' or \n     ``seriously deficient'' condition'' and; ``since 2005, the \n     number of national parks in regional air quality non-\n     attainment areas has more than doubled; 128 parks now are in \n     non-attainment areas, where air pollution levels regularly \n     exceed the national ambient air quality standards.''\n       We like to view the national parks as ``America's best \n     idea,'' and members of Congress certainly like to point to a \n     unit in their home districts. But if we can't afford the 401-\n     unit park system we have today, how can we possibly justify \n     new units?\n       There's no urgent need to add the sites listed in the \n     defense bill at this time. The Blackstone River Valley has \n     been part of the park system as a heritage corridor since \n     1986; Valles Caldera National Preserve currently is under the \n     U.S. Forest Service; the Coltsville Historic District in \n     Connecticut is under the aegis of the Hartford Preservation \n     District; the proposed Lower East Side Tenement National \n     Historic Site is currently a museum; the Harriet Tubman \n     Underground Railroad National Historical Park actually exists \n     today as a national monument President Obama designated in \n     2013; the Atomic Heritage Foundation currently is preserving \n     sites that would fall into a Manhattan Project National \n     Historical Park, and; public and private efforts currently \n     are at work to protect the fossil-rich landscape of Tule \n     Springs near Las Vegas.\n       Congress would be much wiser, and the National Park Service \n     much better off, if it simply added $100 million to the \n     agency's budget in an effort to chip away at the maintenance \n     backlog. While $100 million would\n\n[[Page S6727]]\n\n     barely dent that staggering sum, it'd be money better spent \n     at this time than forcing the Park Service to decide where to \n     further cut its existing budget to manage these additions.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank Senator Reid for coming to the floor. Since we \nlast asked this unanimous consent on the Taxpayers Right to Know, I \nhave had a conversation with the administration and Shaun Donovan, the \nhead of OMB. When Shaun came to see me in our committee of jurisdiction \nover his nomination, one of the things he assured me is that he would \ntry with all due haste to move forward on the things for transparency \nfor the Federal Government, one of President Obama's key projects. He \nassured me he had the capability to lead that organization, even when \nthings are hard and difficult.\n  So I would like to describe for a minute what the Taxpayers Right to \nKnow is. President Obama, myself, John McCain, and Tom Carper passed a \nbill when President Obama was in the Senate, which was the Federal \nTransparency and Accountability Act. It made it so that Americans could \nstart seeing where their money was spent. We have since then passed the \nDATA Act which would be an improvement on that, and the third and final \nstep in that is the Taxpayers Right to Know.\n  Now what does that mean? That means the taxpayer has the right to \nknow where their money is being spent. The taxpayer has the right to \nknow what programs are out there. The taxpayer has the right to know \nwhat is working and what isn't.\n  So we hear from the administration in a long conversation that this \nis too hard. You know, we didn't tell that to our troops in Afghanistan \nor Iraq, that this is too hard. And their real complaint is under the \ndefinition of a program. Well, most of us know what a program is. We \nknow it when we see it. But the fact is, we will never control spending \nnor will we accentuate what is working well until the Taxpayers Right \nto Know Act is implemented.\n  What I told the Director of OMB is there is one agency already \ntotally compliant with this. It is called the Department of \nEducation. If they can do it, why can't everybody else? They know what \nthe definition of a program is. They figured it out. I see this as an \nexcuse not to be transparent with the American public. This has 38 \nbipartisan cosponsors in the Senate, and it passed the House \nunanimously. There is only one objection in the Senate, and that is \nfrom the OMB. Everybody else recognizes this is commonsense, good-\ngovernment transparency.\n\n  I recognize the important role the majority leader has in terms of \nrepresenting the administration's views. I just happen to say he ought \nto tell them to take a hike this time because the American people will \nbenefit greatly, and it really is not that much more work.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2113\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 531, S. 2113. I ask that the committee-\nreported substitute be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third \ntime and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and \nlaid upon the table.\n  I wish to also note that this bill is going to pass next year. The \nPresident is going to get it anyway. Either he is going to veto it or \nhe is going to make Shaun Donovan implement it. Why don't we get after \ngood government now rather than wait 3 or 4 months?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COBURN. I reserve the remainder of my time and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, earlier there was a lot of discussion \nabout the NDAA--the Defense authorization bill--and the very important \nprovisions which are contained in that which will provide for our men \nand women who serve us so honorably. I concur with all who have spoken \ntoday about the importance and significance of this bill and why we \nshould pass it and why we should pass it today.\n  An area of controversy that has certainly come up--and my colleague \nfrom Oklahoma has pointed it out very clearly--is the public lands \npackage that has been attached to the NDAA. I will speak a little bit \nabout where we are today and why we are dealing with this issue and why \nit is important that the Senate and Congress advance these public lands \nprovisions for our country.\n  I had an opportunity to speak in greater detail yesterday, but I felt \nit was important to let colleagues know why we deal with public lands \nbills traditionally in a package.\n  The Presiding Officer comes from a Western State, but Hawaii does not \nhave large portions of land held by the Federal Government.\n  In the 12 Western States, which includes Alaska--93 percent of the \nFederal lands that are held by this country are contained in these 12 \nWestern States. What does it mean when you are a State like Alaska \nwhere some 68 percent of your lands are Federally held? What does it \nmean when you are a State like Nevada, where our majority leader is \nfrom, where 85 percent of your State is held in public lands? It means \nthat when you want to do a conveyance, a conveyance doesn't come about \njust because you are able to get a real estate attorney and you have a \ntransaction; it literally requires an act of Congress.\n  We are dealing with one provision in this public lands bill that \nSenator Franken, from Minnesota, has been working on. It is a \nconveyance of one acre of land that is currently held by USGS, and it \nis a conveyance to a school district. Most people around this country--\nor certainly on this end of the country--would say: Wow, that really \nrequires congressional action? That really requires a vote? That really \nrequires the President to sign it into law? The answer is in the \naffirmative.\n  We have been processing, as a committee--on the Energy Committee and \ncommittees on the House side--public lands bills throughout this \nCongress. We have been working on some of these public lands measures \nnot for months, not for years, but in several instances a decade. It \nhas taken a decade to bring about some of these conveyances and these \nexchanges.\n  I believe it is important to set the record straight--for those who \nare suggesting that somehow or other this was conjured up in the dark \nof the night or that there has been no process for these bills--and let \ncolleagues know about the procedural process that has led to its \ninclusion in the NDAA.\n  For the record, I will note that the process included not only the \ncommittees of jurisdiction for the lands bills but the committees who \ncrafted the NDAA bill, leadership from both sides, and individual \nMembers who all agreed to cobble together a package that was fair and \nbalanced, bipartisan, bicameral, revenue neutral--which is \nexceptionally important--and also addresses the need for conservation \non one end and economic development and jobs and prosperity on the \nother end. With this package of bills, one can see that compromise come \ntogether.\n  It has been noted that these public lands bills have nothing to do \nwith defense authorization, but I will say that this is not without \nprecedent. Adding lands to an NDAA bill has been done in the past. We \nhave seen it in the past several NDAAs. What we did here was to amend \nthe existing lands package within the House-passed NDAA--which is \nhardly out of balance or unusual.\n  As I said before, I would much rather have us move individual bills \nthrough the floor as we process them, but many Members have said to me: \nWell, your small lands transaction is important, but does it really \nrise to the level of occupying floor time? It is tough to win the \nundivided attention of the Senate on some of these measures.\n  Just because this issue doesn't rise to a level of keen interest in \nthis body doesn't mean these issues are not critically important for \nindividuals, communities, and States around our country, and so it is \nhard to put that together. But just because it is small or more \nlocalized or perhaps more parochial--like this one acre of land we are\n\n[[Page S6728]]\n\ntrying to convey to this school district--doesn't mean we should \ndisregard it or overlook it or not try to enact it because somehow or \nother it is not as important as the other things we do around here.\n  So knowing how valuable and precious floor time is around here, we \nworked together. We have been working together for months--again, in a \nbicameral and bipartisan way--to combine many of the bills that are in \nthe package. The result of what we have in front of us is provisions \nthat will help boost natural resources and community development while \nwe are also advancing conservation. We are moving toward economic \ndevelopment in certain areas, creating jobs. We have opportunities in \nboth Nevada and Arizona to create thousands of good-paying jobs and \nwill increase our resources and our minerals security.\n  Other aspects of the bill focus on conservation. There are additional \nwilderness provisions that are in there, but again, as we attempt to \nachieve that balance, what we have in front of us is a good structure.\n  I want to make sure colleagues recognize that when we are discussing \nthe concern my colleague from Oklahoma has raised, the concern he has \nso well articulated that within our National Park System we have a \nmaintenance backlog that is awful--and in many cases it is \noverwhelming. To his credit, he has given keen attention to this \nmaintenance backlog we have and has pressed us to do more to improve \nthat situation. He put together a very considerable report that we are \nusing in the energy committee to help build a series of necessary \nreforms that will be required to deal with our issues within the \nNational Park Service. Thanks to Senator Coburn's good work on this \nissue, we will be able to see some true reforms.\n  I met yesterday afternoon with Director Jarvis in my office, and I \nmade it clear to him as the head of Park Service that this is going to \nbe an area on which we must be focused. Our national parks are a \nnational treasure, but when we can't attend to their needs and ensure \nthat they are maintained to the level that, as Americans, we all want, \nthen we are failing on that.\n  He has a very good point when he says we need to be doing something \nabout maintenance and backlog. I agree. We actually have a couple of \nprovisions in this public lands bill that will help us with that, and \none of them is the bill Senator Coburn has sponsored which will allow \nfor donors to have discreet recognition within our parks. So if you \nwant to give a private donation, there is a way for recognition. We \nalso have a provision in here that will allow for minting of a coin, \nwhich again will help with private dollars. Those private pieces are \nvery important, but we need to do more, we will do more, and my \ncommitment is to help do that.\n  One of the things that I think are important to recognize with the \npark provisions that are included in title XXX is that it is critically \nimportant to recognize the local support these park provisions have \nthat will encourage economic development, tourism, and recreation. The \nagreement includes five new national historic parks, and it transfers \nmanagement of two existing Federal areas to the Park Service. All of \nthe new historical parks have been formally studied and have been \nrecommended for inclusion in the National Park System. They focus on \nspecific historic sites of national significance.\n  Studies have also been done--and my colleague has referenced that--on \npotential additions to the National Park System. These study \nauthorizations have previously passed the House under suspension or \ngone through the Senate by unanimous consent. Again, we are not trying \nto go through the backdoor. The study that has been conducted and the \nprocess that has taken place in both the House and Senate is to ensure \nthat there is that local support and that this is not just something a \nMember wants to attach his or her name to, that this has local support, \nand that in turn will help us with some of the funding issues we are \ngoing to need to address for our park systems.\n\n  I wish to conclude my remarks quickly because Senator Flake was asked \nfor a few minutes and I would like to defer to him. First, the issue \nhas also come up about existing national heritage areas. I think it is \nimportant for colleagues to know that we do provide for limited \nextensions for existing heritage areas, but there are no new heritage \nareas that are created. I think it is important to recognize that when \nwe talk about extensions, it is extensions of existing heritage sites.\n  So with that, if I may, I wish to yield to my colleague from Arizona, \nSenator Flake. We have been working not only with Senator Flake but \nwith Senator McCain on a provision that will certainly not only benefit \nhis State, but it will benefit the United States in terms of jobs, \neconomic opportunity, and a mineral resource; namely, copper, that is \nextraordinarily important to us.\n  With that, I turn to Senator Flake.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Alaska for \nyielding, and I wish to thank her also for her hard work on this lands \npackage. These are difficult pieces of legislation to put together. It \nis particularly living the West, when we have States such as Arizona \nthat are about 87 percent publicly owned by either the Federal \nGovernment, State government or tribal governments. To have access and \nto have rural communities have access to economic development when we \nare dealing with resources that are often on these lands, and when land \nexchanges need to be done, it is extremely difficult to do that because \nit is often seen as a parochial interest, and it is difficult to get \nsupport from around the country for something that is needed in Arizona \nwithout putting a package together that has other items that are needed \nin other States, particularly in the West. So I wish to compliment the \nSenator from Alaska and others who worked so hard to put this complex \npackage together that has many beneficiaries and also to put it \ntogether in a way where we are not contributing or increasing the size \nof the Federal or State, that we are promoting economic development in \nStates such as Arizona.\n  As the Senator mentioned with regard to Arizona and what this does, \nit allows land exchange to happen that will allow a copper mine to be \ndeveloped that will ultimately produce, likely--or can produce--about \n25 percent of the copper needed for manufacturing, for use in this \ncountry. That is not just an economic development issue; that is a \nnational security issue as well, to make sure we are more independent \nwith regard to our source minerals.\n  In terms of economic development of the State, it is huge. We are \ntalking about thousands of jobs over the next several decades that will \nbe produced and will continue economic development for rural \ncommunities in Superior, Globe, and Miami, that have had a tough time \nand that will be good for those communities and for the entire State.\n  So I commend again those who have put this together. It is never good \nto see a big package with so many things in it; that is what we want to \nget away from, and hopefully we can in the new Congress. But it has \nbeen very difficult to move individual pieces of legislation over the \npast couple of years. So unfortunately we are often saddled with trying \nto put together a package and attaching it to a larger bill, which is \nthe case here. But again, kudos to those who worked so hard to put it \ntogether. I appreciate the indulgence of this body to have a package \nsuch as this in the NDAA bill. I plan to vote for it and I encourage my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank my colleague from Arizona. As he has pointed \nout, not only is this measure important to the State of Arizona, but \nthe State of Nevada will also gain the benefit of being able to access \ncopper resources in that region as well, bringing jobs and bringing a \nresource.\n  So contained in this package--and again a balanced package--we are \ntalking about the Federal land conveyances for economic and community \ndevelopment. We have mentioned the opportunity for mineral production \nwith two copper mines, one in Arizona, one in Nevada; an opportunity \nfor increased timber production in my State. We will finally realize \nthe obligation to settle the land claims with the Native people of the \nsoutheastern part of the State in\n\n[[Page S6729]]\n\nthe Sealaska region, 40-some years after the promise for their lands \nconveyance. They are still awaiting their conveyance. This measure we \nhave in front of us will not only fulfill that decades-old promise, but \nit will allow for a continuation of timber within their region, albeit \nvery, very, very reduced.\n  But in order to move to that second growth transition the Forest \nService is always talking about, we have to have an industry that is \njust staying alive, and this Sealaska lands provision will help with \nthat. But it was also crafted in a way that took into account the \nconcerns of the fisheries, the stewardship for other lands, placing \nadditional lands in a conservation area--so again a key balance.\n  The other provisions that relate to our Federal lands and our ability \nto access them I think are important, making them productive. The \nprovision allows for land management agencies with the needed authority \nto renew and process grazing permits and leases. This is a measure that \nmy colleague from Wyoming and my colleague from New Mexico have been \nworking on, and in terms of something that provides certainty to \nAmerica's ranching community, this is so key, this is so important.\n  We also worked to expand the successful BLM permit streamlining \nprogram to boost oil and gas production from the Federal lands. So it \nis kind of the economic development piece, but the conservation piece I \nthink is equally important. It does designate wilderness. It designates \napproximately 245,000 acres of wilderness in total. But I think what is \nimportant for colleagues to recognize is that just about half of those \nacres are already managed as if it were wilderness. In other words, \nthey are in wilderness study areas or roadless areas. So again we \nlooked at those measures where there was support at the local level, at \nthe State level, represented by the Members of Congress who had worked \nover the years to gain the level of support for these provisions. There \nis no cram-down. There is no designation from the executive as to \nmonument status. This is how the process is designed to work.\n  We also returned 26,000 total wilderness study areas to multiple use, \nagain for greater activity on those lands.\n  We protect private property rights in all of our special land \ndesignations. There is no private property that can be condemned or \nacquisitions through eminent domain. Private activities taking place \noutside of the special land designation are not going to be precluded \nby such designations, and we have insured that there are no buffer \nzones or protective perimeters that would encroach on personal and \npublic rights.\n  I have been asked about the impact on hunting and fishing on our \npublic lands, because that is something that particularly those of us \nin the West care a great deal about. I have heard some concerns that \nthere may be negative impacts. But I want to be clear that the \nwilderness bills in this agreement actually affirm the responsibility \nand the authority of the States for the management of fish and \nwildlife.\n  In the wilderness bills that we have in New Mexico and in Nevada, \nthey have incorporated restating the law--this is section 302 of \nFLPMA--to provide assurances that the wilderness designations do not \ngive the Secretaries any new authorities to close Federal lands to \nhunting, fishing or trapping that they don't already have.\n  So we have put in place protections again trying to find the balance \nbetween the conservation and the development, providing for access, \nensuring that private rights are respected, ensuring that our \nopportunities for use and enjoyment as well as economic activity are \npreserved; trying to find a package that is balanced from the \nbicameral, bipartisan perspective, making sure we are not imposing \ncosts; again, a revenue-neutral proposal. I think that is also worth \nstressing.\n  I have seen something out there that suggests there is an impact on \ndirect spending from title XXX. The fact is it is revenue neutral over \nthese next 10 years. We do not take anything from the Defense \nauthorization perspective within this bill with this lands package. \nThat was never the intent. It was not the design, and it will not \nimpact that.\n\n  With that, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the lands \npackage. I wish to congratulate the Senator from Alaska as well as the \nSenator from Louisiana for their work, and particularly in support of \nadding Hinchliffe Stadium to Great Falls National Park in Paterson, NJ. \nIt has a special place in the hearts of many New Jerseyans, and it has \nplayed a vital role in the story of America's fight against \ninstitutionalized segregation.\n  Critics of this legislation are using a mixture of the stadium \nshowing overgrown shrubs and graffiti on the walls--asking, What does a \nstadium such as this have to do with this and should it be in with our \nnational park system?\n  Unfortunately, the picture being circulated only shows a side of the \nstory at a different time. What it fails to show is the dedicated work \nof the surrounding community to clean up Hinchliffe Stadium. So I \nbrought three photographs that I think illustrate the work being done \nin Patterson and to put to rest this notion that the stadium is an \nabandoned place that the community doesn't care about.\n  The first is a picture of dozens of local residents working together \nto clean up the stands, paint the walls, and begin the process of \nrestoring this vital community center. The second is a closeup picture \nof just a handful of these volunteers. These are young people taking \nthe time to improve their community and honor the history that was \nbehind the stadium. The third shows the final product--much different \nthan what my colleague showed--of their hard work. These pictures were \ntaken earlier this year at an event where 700 volunteers worked to \nclean up Hinchliffe Stadium.\n  The argument that we are dumping this land on the National Park \nService is simply false. The legislation specifically prohibits the \nPark Service from directly purchasing this land, meaning that the \ncommunity of Paterson will continue to be intricately involved in the \nmanagement and preservation of the stadium.\n  I think these photographs illustrate the dedication of the residents \nthat Paterson and the surrounding area have to protecting Hinchliffe \nStadium. There is a reason for this dedication. Hinchliffe Stadium has \nthe designation of being one of the few remaining sites that hosted the \nNegro League Baseball. In the 1930s and 1940s, Hinchliffe was the home \nof the Black Yankees, and in 1933 the stadium hosted what was called \nthe Colored Championship. In 1936, the field was home to the New York \nCubans, a team made up of players from Cuba, the Dominican Republic, \nMexico, and Puerto Rico.\n  Some of baseball's greatest stars, including Satchel Paige, Josh \nGibson, and Larry Doby all took the field at Hinchliffe Stadium. Doby \nwent on to become the first African-American player joining the \nAmerican League, helping Jackie Robinson break down the color barrier.\n  Contrary to the negativism and misrepresentations we are hearing \ntoday, Hinchliffe Stadium should be part of the Paterson Great Falls \nNational Park. I know it, everyone who knows about its history knows \nit, and America should know it as well.\n  I am proud to be a sponsor of the legislation adding Hinchliffe \nboundaries to the national park. This bill has been championed by \nCongressman Pascrell in the House of Representatives, where it was \npassed by a House vote earlier this year.\n  I want to read briefly from a guest columnist editorial Congressman \nPascrell wrote with another individual. He said that Hinchliffe Stadium \nin Paterson is one of the last remaining stadiums associated with the \nNegro League Baseball.\n\n       It is where sports and racial history coalesce. Hinchliffe \n     Stadium is the only National Historic Landmark in baseball \n     and only one of two professional Negro League venues \n     considered nationally significant.\n\n  Cal Ripken, 2007 Hall of Famer, when he talked about Hinchliffe, \nsaid:\n\n       Not only does it deserve recognition for its place in \n     history, but it deserves the opportunity to be restored into \n     a place where tomorrow's youth will be able to walk in the \n     footsteps of yesterday's legends and experience the history \n     of this community firsthand.\n\n\n[[Page S6730]]\n\n\n  I am also pleased with this legislation that is cosponsored by \nSenator Booker and formerly by Senator Jeff Chiesa, a Republican who \nserved in the Senate for a period of time after the passing of Senator \nLautenberg. And speaking of Senator Lautenberg, he was one of \nHinchliffe's greatest champions, and he was proud to count Paterson as \nhis hometown.\n  The version of the legislation that we consider today includes \namendments suggested both by the Parks Service and by House \nRepublicans. That is why it passed by voice.\n  Some critics cited the previous National Park Service study opposing \nthe inclusion of the stadium in the national park. The study was \ndiscredited by 25 distinguished scholars at the time. Since then, the \nPark Service has completed an additional study and designated the \nstadium as a national historic landmark.\n  I believe strongly that the story of our fight against \ninstitutionalized segregation is a story worth telling.\n  Critics of this legislation may look at Hinchliffe Stadium and see a \nrundown sports field. Not me. When I look at Hinchliffe Stadium, I see \na field of dreams, an enduring reminder of how far we have come since \nthe days of separate but equal, when institutional segregation \nmarginalized the works, the dreams, and the achievements of African \nAmericans. I see a community coming together decades after Hinchliffe \nfirst earned a place in the canon of American history to preserve the \nlegacy it represents. I urge my colleagues to join me in standing up \nfor this legacy and supporting the inclusion of Hinchliffe Stadium in \nthe Great Falls National Park as part of the national lands package.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, first, let me thank Senators Landrieu \nand Murkowski for their work on this legislation. I was listening to \nSenator Murkowski go through how this process came together. I also \nlistened to Senator Coburn's concerns about the process that has been \nused.\n  Let me share with my colleagues why I strongly support the inclusion \nof the lands package in the National Defense Authorize Act and \nencourage my colleagues to support the vote later today. I reference \nspecifically the Harriet Tubman National Historic Park. Talk about \nfrustration. This park, although approved through studies and it went \nthrough all the appropriate ways for its designation, was held by one \nSenator on a hold for 3\\1/2\\ years, and that is despite the fact that \nsince 2012 there was an offset to make sure it did not cost any \nadditional resources--a requirement that I was told I needed to satisfy \nto remove the hold.\n  There is a lot of frustration here. I appreciate what Senator \nMurkowski did and the history she went through. She is absolutely \nright. If we tried to bring these bills to the floor on an individual \nbasis, we would never get done the work of the Senate. These land \nissues have been vetted, and I can tell you in regard to the Harriet \nTubman National Historic Park, it is very much needed.\n  This Senate did pass this particular designation earlier this year, \nso this has already been passed by the Senate. In the House, I worked \nwith Congressman Harris and Congressman Moffett dealing with some of \nthe same issues that Senator Murkowski mentioned a few moments ago, and \nthat is to make sure we have the right balance between the lands that \nare designated as part of the historic park and the landowners' rights \nin the community. The balance that Senator Murkowski said generally in \nregard to the provisions applies in regard to the Harriet Tubman park. \nI thank Congressman Harris and Congressman Moffett for their help.\n  I also want to acknowledge the work of my colleagues--Senator \nMikulski, Senator Gillibrand, and Senator Schumer--and thank them for \ntheir help in bringing about this package and bringing about the \nability today to finally pass the designation of the Harriet Tubman \nNational Historic Park. This will be the first woman, the first \nAfrican-American woman to have such a recognition under our National \nPark System. This is an appropriate person for this historic moment. I \nthink most people know that Harriet Tubman was considered the Moses of \nher people. She was born into slavery in Dorchester County, MD, the \nEastern Shore of Maryland. For the first 30 years of her life, she \nlived in slavery, and then on her own, by herself, she escaped slavery \nand made her way to liberty in 1849. She did this alone. The courage of \nthis woman--she didn't stop there; she then came back and rescued \nothers slaves and brought them to freedom through the Underground \nRailroad, which took slaves from slavery to freedom.\n  I am proud of the historic significance of the State of Maryland in \nthat regard, with the birthplace of Harriet Tubman and where the \nUnderground Railroad operated.\n  The Eastern Shore is on the eastern part of our State. I could take \nyou to the western part of the State, Cumberland, where you can see the \nchurch in which the slaves on their way to freedom were sheltered \nbefore they went through a tunnel to the railroad and literally went to \nPennsylvania and freedom.\n  This is an incredible opportunity. We have the landscape, we have the \nproperty on the Eastern Shore of Maryland.\n  In Auburn, NY, we have where Harriet Tubman lived the later years of \nher life. After escaping and becoming free, she was a spy for the \nNorth, for the Union during the Civil War. She then went on to help \nwith women's suffrage. She set up a home for the aged African Americans \nin New York. A lot of those properties still exist today up in New York \nand will be part of the Harriet Tubman National Historic Park.\n  This is an appropriate way to honor a real hero of our country but \nalso to provide a way for young people and all the people in this \ncountry to learn more about Harriet Tubman. It will help the local \neconomies of New York and Pennsylvania. It is part of the National Park \nSystem's dedication to African-American history. I think it is very \nappropriate to at long last be able to get this done.\n  For those who express frustration, we had this paid for a long time \nago, we worked out all the balances a long time ago, and we thought \nthis would be done a long time ago. But today we have a chance to get \nit done, and I urge my colleagues to support the package and support \nthe NDAA bill.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Madam President, I rise in strong opposition to the \nmotion to refer, which would remove the public lands title from the \nDefense authorization bill.\n  Like some of my colleagues, I think an appropriate place to start \ntoday is to thank Chair Landrieu and Ranking Member Murkowski for their \nefforts on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. They worked so \nhard to come up with a package that could actually move in this divided \nCongress.\n  The bills in this package have been the subject of incredibly long \ndebate. Many of them, such as the bill we just heard about from my \ncolleague in Maryland, have been under consideration for years. Almost \nall the bills included in the public lands package have received \nhearings in either the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee or \nthe House Natural Resources Committee, and almost all of the bills were \nfavorably reported by these committees. For example, every provision in \nthe lands package relating to a national park designation or expansion \nand every provision designating Federal land as wilderness in this \npackage was closely considered by the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee and cleared the committee with bipartisan support.\n  I should note that many of these provisions were not only the subject \nof committee hearings in this Congress and markups in this Congress but \nin previous years as well.\n  The public lands title is the product of lengthy negotiations with \nthe House, with both Republican and Democratic priorities included. \nSome Senate provisions were modified to address concerns raised by the \nHouse of Representatives, and other House provisions were modified to \naddress Senate concerns. This package is a compromise. There is a lot \nin it that I love but a few things that I absolutely don't support. \nThere are also things that I had hoped would be in this package that \nwill not be in this package. But that is the nature of compromise and\n\n[[Page S6731]]\n\ngovernance. Frankly, that is something we need a lot more of around \nhere.\n  This package conserves our Nation's resources, our water resources, \nand our wildlife habitat. It preserves our Nation's culture and history \nand allows for the smart and responsible development of our public \nlands as well. We have a responsibility to future generations to be \ngood stewards of our shared culture and the natural world.\n  Madam President, it will come as no surprise to you or to many of my \ncolleagues that as I travel across New Mexico, what I hear time and \nagain from people is that they are frustrated with Washington, that \nCongress can't get anything done, and that ``compromise'' sounds like a \ndirty word to some of our colleagues. We have an opportunity to change \nthat today. Let's work together and be willing to compromise in order \nto get things done for our constituents and for the American people. \nOur constituents across this great Nation deserve no less.\n  I would urge my colleagues' support of the package and opposition to \nthe motion to refer.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I understand there is still 5 or 6 \nminutes remaining of my time. If there are other colleagues who would \ncare to speak on the significance of title XXX of NDAA, natural \nresources, and the related provisions, I am certainly happy to yield to \nthem.\n  I thank my colleagues who have come to the floor on both sides of the \naisle to speak to some of the specifics that are contained within this \nbill because I think it helps to understand why we are at this late \npoint in the calendar with a package of different bills focusing in \ndifferent areas, whether it is a small land conveyance, whether it is \nthe creation of a wilderness area that has come about through a great \ndeal of compromise and collaboration, or whether it is a collaboration \nthat will allow for economic opportunity through mineral development, \ntimber harvest, or grazing opportunities. I think it does speak to the \ndiversity of what we are dealing with, with so many of our public lands \nand the reality that they are different all over. It is very different \nin Alaska from what my friend in New Mexico experiences. The similarity \nwe have is that we don't have the ability to do it on our own; we have \nto come to the Federal Government.\n  What will happen is, whether you are in New Mexico or whether you are \nin Alaska or points in between, you have local consensus emerge around \nan issue. They bring it to the State, and the State works with us at \nthe Federal level, Members of the House and Members of the Senate. We \ncontinue to work this process. It usually is a very collaborative \nprocess.\n  Just because it is collaborative does not mean we agree on every \nissue. There is a great deal of give and take that goes on, because \nwhen you are talking about your public lands, every acre is precious to \nsomebody. I know that full well in the legislation we have been working \non, the See Alaska bill, for almost a decade now.\n  The fishermen have certain interests, those who harvest timber have \ncertain interests, the conservationists have certain interests, the \nschool district has certain interests. So how we build this takes time. \nBut it seems as though the only place we do not get time is here on the \nSenate floor. We do not have the time allocated to us, nor do--I would \nbe happy to spend hours and perhaps days discussing issues such as we \nhave raised in this public lands bill. But I do not think most of my \ncolleagues are interested in debating a reversionary clause for a \nparcel of land in downtown Anchorage that can be sold so they can have \nan opportunity, in Anchorage, to build something new there. It just \ndoes not rise to that level of immediacy and concern.\n  So, again, we do the best we can to try to be balanced, to try to put \ntogether something that works for all. It is a balancing act. It \nrequires a level of finesse. If we were to have put together a package \nthat was overly weighted towards new wilderness or new parks, not only \nwould my constituents back home not support it, I could not support it. \nWe have to work together on bill packages of this nature.\n  I want to recognize the good work of those on the energy committee \nwho have worked with us to construct something that is good, balanced \nand fair. I will acknowledge my chairman of the energy committee, \nSenator Landrieu, who has worked with us to find that level of balance.\n  I do hope that as we look at a new Congress, we will be working \ntogether as colleagues to try to figure out a better path for the \nendgame for these smaller bills. I have been part of way too many lands \npackages now where we have the same debate: Why is it attached to this? \nWhy are we doing this now? I would like to get us to a place where \nthere was a more certain process so that Members knew their small \nconveyance bill, their small study, did not get caught up in end-of-\nsession kind of madness, or caught up in things that distract from what \nit is that delegation has been attempting to do for that State, for \nthat part of the country.\n  I would ask my colleagues--I have spoken with many on this side of \nthe aisle as well as the Democratic side of the aisle--let's be working \ntogether to figure out how we can relieve this bottleneck, because I \nsincerely want to do that. But what we have in front of us today is our \nopportunity to bring some finality, to bring some conclusion, to bring \nsome resolve to issues that have been outstanding for a considerable \namount of time, as I mentioned, in several instances almost a full \ndecade.\n  Let's clear the deck. Let's move this lands package on this NDAA bill \nso that next Congress we can begin with the many public lands bills \nthat are still in the queue, that are still waiting for a process. But \nyou can count on me to be working with my colleagues to ensure that we \nhave a way forward that will be more expeditious than we have seen \nhistorically.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, later today I will be offering a motion \nto attempt to undo a precedent set in 2011 that took away the right of \nall Senators, a right that was provided by Senate rules for Senators to \nsuspend the rules in a postcloture environment to offer an amendment.\n  It is a very high bar. It requires 67 votes to ever pass an amendment \nunder that. This right allowed the minority or individual Senators to \ncircumvent parliamentary obstacles, namely the filling of the tree to \nreceive votes. History now shows us that the filling of the tree has \noccurred two times more under the leadership of Senator Reid than all \nof the leaders in the past--91 times.\n  The question will essentially be, Do we want to keep the Reid motion \nto suspend the precedent prohibiting motions to suspend the rules \npostcloture by sustaining that precedent? This is not a nuclear option, \ndoes not have anything to do with that.\n  As I thought about bringing this forward, I thought about how \nimportant it is for the new minority. I am not going to be with you. \nBut it is my valid opinion, I believe, that you are not going to see \nthe limitations on your amendments that we have seen in the last 6 \nyears under the new leadership of the Senate. But if we were to see \nthat, this is a particularly good way to have the Senate vote on a \ntopic of interest to the American public.\n  So when this is offered, voting yes keeps the Reid precedent which \nsays even postcloture you cannot offer to suspend the rules, even with \na 67-vote margin and have a vote. Voting no will reverse the Reid \nprecedent. If the precedent is overturned by a majority of Senators \nvoting against the ruling of the Chair, the rights of all Senators, as \nwritten in the Senate rules to suspend the rules postcloture, would be \nreturned--Democrats, Republicans, all.\n  If I am successful in overturning this precedent, I am not planning \non following up with another motion allowing me to offer an amendment \nat this time. The whole goal is to try to restore the Senate. So I have \nno ulterior motive with another amendment if I were to win this \nattempt.\n\n[[Page S6732]]\n\n  The distinguishing characteristics of the Senate are the right to \noffer amendments and the right to debate. That is what makes it unique. \nThat is what forces consensus. Throughout his tenure, my colleague, the \nSenator from Nevada, has aggressively deployed a tactic to block other \nSenators from offering amendments to legislation. This tactic is known \nas filling the tree. It fills all available slots for all amendments \nwith shell legislation, preventing all other Senators from offering \namendments, both of his party and the opposition party.\n  He has done this 91 times during his tenure as the majority leader. \nFrom 1985 to 2006, it only occurred 40 times. What this tactic \neffectively does is shut down every other individual Member of the \nSenate from even input into legislation and carrying on the \nresponsibility they were granted by the citizens of their State to \noffer amendments to pieces of legislation coming through the Senate.\n  Starting in 2010, as Senator Reid continued to use the filling-of-\nthe-tree maneuver, Senators in both parties resorted to other \nprocedural options to assert their rights as Senators. Under rule V of \nthe Standing Rules of the Senate, the other rules may be suspended, \nincluding blocking amendments by filling the tree.\n  From 2010 until October 6, 2011, Senators filed more than 30 notices \nand the Senate held 15 separate votes to suspend the rules and allow \namendments to be offered during postcloture debate, as was the history \nof the Senate for its entire history.\n  On October 6, the majority leader interpreted Senate rules with a \nsimple majority, ending the right of Senators to suspend the rules \npostcloture. He called up a motion to suspend the rules that had been \nfiled on the previous day by myself. He made a point of order that a \nsingle motion to suspend the rules was dilatory. A single motion to \nsuspend the rules was dilatory under rule XXII.\n  Never before had the Senate ruled that a single motion to suspend the \nrules was dilatory. In fact, the Senate Parliamentarian had previously \nupheld the maneuver. As such, the Presiding Officer correctly ruled \nthat the postcloture amendment was not dilatory under rule XXII. A \nsingle motion to suspend the rules cannot be considered a delaying \ntactic.\n  Senator Reid's point of order was, therefore, not sustained. He then \nappealed the ruling of the Chair and held a vote to overturn it by a \nsimple majority of 51 to 48. The Chair's decision was overturned. Every \nRepublican and one Democrat voted against this appeal, instead voting \nto uphold the Presiding Officer's decision which reflected the written \nrules of the Senate.\n  This vote established a new precedent to interpret the meaning of the \nword ``dilatory.'' Only it did so in the most heavyhanded way, fully \nintended to block the ability of Senators to offer amendments. From \nthat point forward, it was considered out of order to offer postcloture \nmotions to suspend the rules, despite such right being explicitly \nprovided for under Senate rules.\n  In order to overturn this precedent, a Senator must offer another \npostcloture motion to suspend the rules for the purpose of considering \nan amendment.\n  The Presiding Officer most likely will rule that the motion is not in \norder based on the 2011 precedent.\n  At that point, the Senator offering the motion will appeal the ruling \nof the Chair on the basis that a single motion to suspend the rules \npostcloture is not dilatory. The Senator would then ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  If a simple majority of Senators vote to overturn the decision of the \nChair, the precedent will be reversed, restoring the right explicitly \nprovided in the rules that allows Senators to offer motions to suspend \nthe rules postcloture as before.\n  This issue is unrelated to the nuclear option and will have no impact \non the outcome of that debate.\n  Senators who support or oppose changing that issue can both support \nthis effort.\n  At the appropriate time, I will be offering that motion. I came to \nthe floor today to put my colleagues on notice of my intent.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to temporarily set \naside the pending amendment so that I may call up my amendment, \namendment No. 3996, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will not support the unanimous consent proposal of \nSenator Lee for several reasons. He may want to state his motion first \nbefore I give the reasons for objecting to it, but I will object and, \nif necessary at this point, I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have no objection to the Senator stating his purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. I thank my distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from \nMichigan, whose presence we will miss and whose leadership we have \nappreciated over the years.\n  Madam President, I have offered this amendment today, which is an \namendment that was crafted several years ago by me and Senator \nFeinstein. We created this as a document that we originally called the \nDue Process Guarantee Act. Senator Feinstein and I had one objective \nwith the Due Process Guarantee Act, which was to guarantee the right of \nthe American people that while they exist, while they live from day to \nday on U.S. soil, they will be free from indefinite detention without \ntrial, without their rights that are protected by our Constitution, \nwithout the rights we have come to associate with our habeas corpus \nguarantees and our other constitutional protections.\n  These are rights that we understand are inseparably connected with \nliberty and they long predated the existence of our Constitution and \nour Republic. They were so fundamental, in fact, that not only were \nthey incorporated into our Constitution--this right to be free from a \nchance of being locked up by government indefinitely in prison, without \ntrial, without counsel and so forth--they were discussed at length at \nour Constitutional Convention. They were discussed at length by members \nof our founding generation as they debated and discussed the merits of \nour Constitution.\n  Notably, in Federalist No. 84, James Madison referred to these \nrights, and he quoted a great luminary of that time--a luminary who is \nstill a legal force to this day--Judge William Blackstone. He quoted a \nvery meaningful excerpt from volume 1 of William Blackstone's \n``Commentaries on the Laws of England,'' published in 1765.\n  I want to read briefly some of what he said there that is relevant to \nthis day. He says these rights are very important; they are the right \nto be free from detention, from arbitrary indefinite detention. He \nsays:\n\n       To bereave a man of life, or by violence to confiscate his \n     estate, without accusation or trial, would be so gross and \n     notorious an act of despotism, as must at once convey the \n     alarm of tyranny throughout the whole kingdom. But \n     confinement of the person, by secretly hurrying him to gaol, \n     where his sufferings are unknown or forgotten; is a less \n     public, a less striking, and therefore a more dangerous \n     engine of arbitrary government. And yet sometimes, when the \n     state is in real danger, even this may be a necessary \n     measure. But the happiness of our constitution is----\n\n  And here he is referring, of course, to the British constitution at \nthe time\n\n       --that it is not left to the executive power to determine \n     when the danger of the state is so great, as to render this \n     measure expedient. For the parliament only, or legislative \n     power, whenever it sees proper, can authorize the crown, by \n     suspending the habeas corpus act for a short and limited \n     time, to imprison suspected persons without giving any reason \n     for so doing.\n\n  So in other words, he was referring to something contemplated and \nbuilt into our constitutional structure as well, which is that, sure, \nthere may be times of invasion, there may be times of national \nemergency, of an exigency so great, so threatening to the safety of the \npeople that this kind of action might be warranted. But where that does \nhappen, it has to happen by an express declaration by the legislative\n\n[[Page S6733]]\n\nbody--that the right to habeas corpus is, in fact, being suspended.\n  I will conclude with this quote, where he says:\n\n       . . . this experiment ought only to be tried in cases of \n     extreme emergency; and in these the nation parts with its \n     liberty for a while, in order to preserve it for ever.\n\n  What was true in William Blackstone's time remains true today. What \nwas true during the founding era, remains true today. What was true at \nthe time of the drafting and the ratification of our other \nconstitutional protections, including those in the Fourth, Fifth and \nSixth Amendments to the Constitution, remain true today. That is that \nwe are a free people, and as a free people, we have come to expect \ncertain rights that we have. By virtue of being Americans--Americans \nliving on U.S. soil--we have the right to be free and to be free from \nthis risk of indefinite detention without trial.\n  When those very rare circumstances might arise, as arose, for \nexample, during the Civil War, where they cannot be allowed to stand, \nthey may be suspended only by an act of Congress expressly suspending \nthe habeas corpus protections we have come to rely on.\n  For this reason, Senator Feinstein and I put this bill together. I \noffer it up now as an amendment. I understand this motion has already \nbeen objected to, and I state my concerns with the objection.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the reasons that I object to the offering \nof the amendment at this time are several.\n  First, the amendment which Senator Lee asks consent to offer is not \ngermane to the bill, it is not in order postcloture, and it would amend \na statute of jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee relative to a \nsubject not addressed in this bill.\n  Second, when we included a similar provision in our bill several \nyears ago, the House objected and insisted the provision be dropped. So \nthe inclusion of this provision would require, at the least, difficult \ndiscussions with the House when there is no time for such discussions.\n  When I voted for a similar provision which was offered several years \nago, the language was somewhat different than it is now.\n  The bottom line is there is simply not enough time left before we \nadjourn to debate even a single amendment, and surely not a single \namendment of this complexity, to vote on it, and to reconcile the \nprovision, if it were adopted, with the House of Representatives and to \npass the bill again in both Houses.\n  And those are the reasons for my objection.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Levin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 4329\n\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I intend to call up H.R. 4329, the Native \nAmerican Housing and Self-Determination Reauthorization Act, but I \nwould like to say a few words about the bill before I do. This bill \nreauthorizes programs that support housing for Native Hawaiians, Alaska \nNatives, and American Indians.\n  Earlier this week, the senior Senator from Montana asked unanimous \nconsent that the Senate take up and pass S. 1352, the Native American \nHousing and Self-Determination Reauthorization Act of 2013. The bill \nwould reauthorize programs that promote and support affordable housing \nfor Native Americans, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians. My good \nfriend, Mr. Lee, the Senator from Utah, who is on the floor this \nafternoon, objected to passing this important Senate bill, noting his \nobjections to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act.\n  I am here on the floor today to offer an alternative--H.R. 4329. Like \nthe Senate bill which was objected to earlier this week, this bill is a \nbipartisan bill. H.R. 4329 reauthorizes the Native Hawaiian Housing \nBlock Grant, the Section 184 Indian Home Loan Guarantee Program, and \nprograms that provide support for housing funding for Native American \nveterans.\n  Let me note here that we know that Native Americans enlist in the \nmilitary at a higher rate than other segments of this country. Of \ncourse, the House bill I am referring to supports many other good \nprograms and, yes, including the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant \nand the Section 184A Native Hawaiian Home Loan Guarantee Program.\n  We know the housing need in Indian country is staggering. Congress \nknew and recognized this fact when it created the broader Indian \nhousing programs earlier to help address those needs and when it \nreauthorized these programs again and again.\n  Is the House bill perfect? I would say no. But I must applaud my good \nfriend, Congressman Don Young of Alaska, my colleagues, Congresswomen \nColleen Hanabusa and Tulsi Gabbard, and of course the bill's sponsor, \nCongressman Steve Pearce, for their work in crafting a bill that passed \nthe House by voice vote. There were no Republican objections. There \nwere no Democratic objections. To rely on an old adage, let us not \nallow perfection to be the enemy of the good. And this is a good bill.\n  Should we forget our promises and responsibilities to our indigenous \npopulation? I freely admit that we have not always been good stewards \nof our responsibilities, and we have not always been good friends with \nIndian Country. But we try, and with this bill we again are trying.\n  Let me now turn to address Senator Lee's specific early objections to \nthe Senate bill. The Senator stated that he believes the blood quantum \nrequirement in the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act is unconstitutional. I \nwould say to my friend from Utah that in the context of Federal Indian \nlaw, which is applicable here, blood quantum requirements are not \nviewed as unconstitutional racial classifications. Instead, they \ndemonstrate connectivity to an indigenous political entity which \nCongress can treat under the Indian commerce clause. It is why Congress \nset a blood quantum requirement of 50 percent or more for the Hawaiian \nHomes Commission Act, a blood quantum requirement of 50 percent or more \nfor the Indian Reorganization Act, and 25 percent or more for the \nAlaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Native Hawaiians, Native \nAmericans, and Alaska Natives are indigenous people all, which my \ncolleague Senator Lee acknowledges.\n\n  My colleague might argue that in the Supreme Court's decision in Rice \nv. Cayetano, the Court held that ``ancestry . . . is a proxy for \nrace.'' I would respond to my colleague by saying that I was the \nLieutenant Governor of Hawaii at the time, serving under Ben Cayetano, \nwho is named in the Rice v. Cayetano suit, and I had the opportunity to \nsit in the Supreme Court while the Rice case was being argued. That \ncase is broadly, but often incorrectly, cited because it was quite \nnarrow in its applicability. The Supreme Court in that case held that a \nState--a State--could not restrict who could vote for members of a \nquasi-State agency. In contrast to such State action, Congress has \ngiven wide latitude and broad deference in dealing with America's \nindigenous people.\n  So Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Indian Affairs \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 4329 and \nthat the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; that the bill \nbe read a third time and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask \nunanimous consent that the request be modified and that the Lee \namendment to strike section 801 of this legislation be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so modify her request?\n  Ms. HIRONO. I object to the request for a modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. LEE. In that case, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S6734]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I want to express my appreciation to \nChairman Levin and Ranking Member Inhofe for their work on the defense \nauthorization bill being considered in the Senate this week. It is \nofficially titled the Carl Levin and Howard P. `Buck' McKeon National \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015. It couldn't be more \nappropriate.\n  This will be the 54th year in a row that Congress has passed the \nDefense Authorization. It has never been an easy task. Senator Levin \nhas had a great deal to do with that annual labor of love. He has \nserved as the highest ranking Democratic member on the committee since \nJanuary 1997, and he has served as its Chairman for eleven of the last \n14 years. Every year, he has kept the needs of our service members and \ntheir families front and center.\n  It isn't an easy job. The Committee provides congressional oversight \nfor more than half of all domestic discretionary spending . . . it \nanalyzes every program line by line . . . and in this case worked with \nMembers of both parties and both chambers to craft a consensus product. \nBut the result is that our service members who are on the front lines \nwill have what they need to protect our national security.\n  In that spirit, this bill sustains in responsible ways the active \nduty, National Guard, and reserve forces our nation relies on every \nday. Even in this tough fiscal environment, the bill authorizes a 1 \npercent pay raise for military personnel below the general officer \nlevel. It increases access to mental health care in a number of ways, \nincluding lifting the limits on inpatient mental health services, and \nrequiring annual person-to-person mental health assessments. Finally, \nit reauthorizes the family support programs our military families so \nrichly deserve.\n  The agreement also deals with a topic I have cared passionately about \nfor many years: tobacco. This is a serious subject. Smoking rates among \nservice members are 20 percent higher than the rest of America and the \nuse of chewing tobacco is 450 percent higher. Tobacco-related medical \ntreatment and lost work time costs the Pentagon $1.6 billion every. \nYet, military stores have been selling tobacco products at steep \ndiscounts for years. On paper the discount is 5 percent. But an \nindependent review found discounts as high as 25 percent because of lax \nenforcement and ill-defined community comparisons.\n  So I appreciate that this defense authorization carries a provision \nsimilar to one I authored earlier this year in the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee to end this harmful subsidy. This is a \ncommonsense reform that will protect the health of our Nation's troops. \nIt will literally save lives. I look forward to continuing to work with \nthe Department to tackle this culture of tobacco use head on.\n  This bill also contains several provisions to reform the way the \nmilitary prevents and responds to sexual assault in the military. The \nDepartment's most recent report outlines how pervasive and insidious \nthis problem continues to be. The prevalence of sexual assault has \ndecreased slightly, and we see more victims coming forward. But it \nremains one of the most complex and damaging threats to our armed \nservices today. More than 6 in 10 female service members continue to \nreport that they have been retaliated against for reporting the \nperpetrators of these criminal acts.\n  Congress has instituted many reforms, including Special Victims \nCounsels. This year's defense bill contains several additional policy \nchanges. But we must continue to hold the Department's leadership \naccountable for significant progress on this issue.\n  In addition to these national priorities, the Defense authorization \nbill includes several provisions that will strengthen military assets \nin Illinois. Rock Island Arsenal on the border of Illinois and Iowa is \na remarkable place. For example, at the height of the Iraq war, the \nArsenal was the single largest source of Humvee armor kits to protect \nour troops against IED blasts. Its factory is one of the few places in \nthe country where our military, on short notice, can quite literally \nturn raw metal into critical equipment for our troops.\n  The Armed Services Committee has worked with me each year to ensure \nthat the Arsenal can compete for workload and partner with the private \nsector. This year's bill builds on this history by updating the Civil \nWar-era Arsenal Act to ensure that the Army manages arsenals with \nwartime needs in mind.\n  The bill also extends the joint pilot program in North Chicago at the \nLovell Federal Health Care Facility. This is the first national effort \nto integrate health care across the Defense Department and the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs. It is the future of health care for \nservice members and veterans. The Lovell Health Care Facility is \nworking to advance integration of everything from electronic medical \nrecords to pharmacy programs.\n  Finally, the bill also authorizes $26 million for an Army Reserve \nCenter in Arlington Heights, IL, and $19.5 million for Family Housing \nat Rock Island, IL.\n  Chairman Levin and Senator Inhofe have brought to the floor a \nthoughtful and balanced bill for our men and women in uniform, and I \nurge members to support this compromise.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I want to take a few minutes today to \nspeak on the National Defense Authorization Act, the annual policy bill \nfor the Department of Defense. Let me start by noting that Senator Carl \nLevin, who is Chairman of the committee that put this agreement \ntogether, will be retiring after this year. This bill carries Senator \nLevin's name on it in what I think will be a fitting tribute to his \nlegacy here. I have appreciated his wisdom on so many issues over the \nyears, and I know I am in good company when I say to Senator Levin that \nhis leadership will be missed in the United States Senate.\n  Passing a defense authorization bill is one of Congress' most \nimportant annual tasks, and it has been for decades. I have supported \nsome of these bills throughout my time here and given the number of \nsecurity concerns facing this country--the continued presence of ISIL \nin Iraq and Syria, Russia's ongoing efforts to destabilize Ukraine, the \nEbola outbreak in West Africa--I hoped to be able to support this bill \nas well. Regrettably, however, I am forced to vote against this defense \nbill.\n  Most Americans may not know this, but the United States is still \nspending as much on defense as it spent at the height of the Cold War. \nThis bill before us today would authorize nearly $600 billion in total \ndefense spending--including more than $60 billion in war funding. That \nreally ought to raise more questions about how that money is being \nspent and whether the American people are getting their money's worth \nfor each dollar they spend on defense. But what I find most concerning \nis that my Senate colleagues and I are being asked to approve this \nmammoth bill without being given the opportunity to vote on any \nsubstantive amendments. I am sure that if Senators were given that \nchance, we could consider amendments regarding sexual assault in the \nmilitary or greater transparency within the intelligence community, for \nexample.\n  One issue in particular that would have benefitted from more debate \nis the Guantanamo Bay detention center. When the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee passed its version of this defense bill in June, it included \nprovisions allowing the Department of Defense to transfer detainees \nfrom Guantanamo Bay to the United States ``for detention, trial and \nincarceration.'' My position on the Guantanamo Bay detention center has \nlong been to shut it down and prosecute as many detainees as possible \nin the federal court system--where the United States has a strong \nrecord of winning convictions. I felt that the earlier Armed Services \nCommittee language would have made progress toward these goals, and I \nam disappointed that the agreement before us today maintains the \nprohibition on transferring any detainees to the United States to stand \ntrial.\n  I also want to take a few minutes to express my deep concerns about \nthe lands package included in this defense authorization agreement. \nThis package contains some laudable bills for our Nation's environment \nlike wilderness and new parks supported by many\n\n[[Page S6735]]\n\nmembers of Congress. This lands package also includes, however, a \nnumber of extraordinarily controversial provisions that will do serious \nand long-lasting environmental damage.\n  Take the provision that represents an unprecedented giveaway of \npublic lands to benefit a foreign corporation. It will destroy a \nrecreational oasis, disturb a sacred Indian site, and cast aside \nrecreational, environmental, and cultural concerns in favor of big \nmining and big money. Neither the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee nor the House of Representatives has approved that provision \nthis Congress, yet it is being jammed into this defense bill today \nwithout debate.\n  In addition several important pieces of legislation with bipartisan \nsupport were simply left out of this lands package. I am disappointed \nthat this package does not include legislation to modernize and \nincrease forest management on the Oregon and California Grant Lands, \nbetter known as the O Lands, for example. This lands package also \ndoes not include legislation that would resolve long-standing issues \nregarding water resources in the Klamath Basin.\n  Additionally, I am disappointed that the lands package does virtually \nnothing to help rural counties: it fails to renew the bipartisan Secure \nRural Schools program that funds critical services in more than 700 \ncounties in over forty States. The assistance it provides to fund the \nanother significant rural aid program known as Payments in Lieu of \nTaxes is not enough to fully fund the program in the absence of Secure \nRural Schools funding. These programs are lifelines for cash-strapped \nrural counties that struggle to fund basic law enforcement, \ninfrastructure improvements, and other public services.\n  Finally, I am extremely disappointed that the lands package did not \ninclude reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a \nprogram that opens up our Nation's public lands and wilderness areas \nfor recreation and enjoyment, while providing tremendous economic \nbenefits to rural communities.\n  This lands package is unbalanced. It does not reflect bipartisan \ncompromises reached in the committees of jurisdiction. Lastly, in the \ncrucial days, when decisions were being made about the public lands \nbills that did not make it into this package, most Senators were kept \nin the dark about issues of great importance to their constituents.\n  So, I return to the notion that Senators and the people they \nrepresent must be heard on legislation this consequential. It is \nunfortunate that after a full Congress of hard work, a number of good \nproposals will simply be left on the cutting room floor.\n  I want to repeat that this bill before us today authorizes more than \nhalf of the discretionary budget for the U.S. Government, almost $600 \nbillion in defense spending, including more than $60 billion in war \nfunding.\n  Because of that, I regret that I must oppose this defense \nauthorization bill.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, today I rise in support of the Fiscal \nYear 2015 National Defense Authorization Act.\n  First, let me express my sincere thanks to both Chairman Levin and \nRanking Member Inhofe for their hard work in putting together a \nbipartisan bill that addresses the needs of our military and contains \nprovisions that are important to Maine and to our national security.\n  This legislation fully funds both the vital DDG-1000 and DDG-51 \nPrograms. These ships must be part of the fleet to maintain the robust \nforward presence our Nation requires. The U.S. Navy protects trade \nroutes, projects power, acts as a stabilizing force, and assists when \ntragedy strikes. These missions are especially important in the \nincreasingly dangerous and unpredictable world in which we live.\n  When tensions flared in Syria, it was Navy destroyers that were \npositioned off the coast. Following the devastation of Typhoon Haiyan \nin the Philippines, two U.S. Navy destroyers were among the first ships \nto respond.\n  This bill also provides the resources necessary to help our allies \nand partners around the globe. When Hamas, a designated foreign \nterrorist organization, launched more than 3,000 rockets into Israel \nthis summer, it was the Iron Dome missile defense system--developed \nwith assistance from the United States--that saved countless civilian \nlives.\n  I am also pleased that this bill takes further steps to address the \nproblem of sexual assault in the military, which remains a significant \nchallenge facing the Department of Defense. While progress has been \nmade, we must remain focused on our goal of ensuring that the military \nhas a zero tolerance culture when it comes to sexual assault.\n  I first raised my concern about sexual assaults in the military with \nGen George Casey in 2004. To say his response was disappointing would \nbe an understatement. I am convinced that if the military had heeded \nthe concerns I raised then, this terrible problem would have been \naddressed much sooner, saving many individuals the trauma, pain, and \ninjustice they endured.\n  I am encouraged that as a result of an amendment I offered to the \nSenate version of this bill, DOD is already taking formal steps to \nmodify the rules of evidence to ensure confidentiality between the \nusers and the personnel manning its Safe Helpline and HelpRoom systems. \nThe bill includes a provision which mandates a study by DOD's Judicial \nProceedings Board on how best to effectuate the rule change.\n  I also support eliminating the so-called good soldier defense, which \nthis bill does. This defense has allowed the general military character \nof an individual to be used as evidence of their innocence.\n  To further support our men and women in uniform, this bill includes \nnecessary provisions to take care of our troops and rejects many of the \nadministration's proposed changes to compensation and benefits.\n  The bill wisely rejects the President's proposal to authorize a new \nbase realignment and closure round in 2015.\n  This is the right way to proceed because the GAO has found that the \nprevious BRAC round never produced the amount of savings that were \npromised when it was originally sold to Congress.\n  Finally, I would like to thank the chairman and ranking member for \nincluding in the bill a provision I authored that reauthorizes the \nauthority for Federal agencies to hire Federal retirees to come back to \nwork part time and still retain their annuitant status. This means that \nindividuals with years of accumulated experience in their jobs can help \ntrain and transition in their replacement or fill staffing gaps.\n  Let me close on a less optimistic note. As we look ahead to next \nyear, the specter of sequestration looms increasingly large. DOD has \nalready made significant reductions, and unless we act soon, the \neffects of these indiscriminate, senseless cuts will be devastating to \nour national security and defense industrial base.\n  Further cuts will compromise the size, readiness, and technical \nsuperiority of our military. I stand ready to work closely with all of \nmy colleagues in the next Congress on a sensible solution.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I speak today about an important \nprovision in the defense bill. As you know, the maritime and \nshipbuilding industries are significant contributors to the economy in \nLouisiana and are important to our national security. In Louisiana \nalone, these industries employ thousands of hard-working Americans. I \nam pleased that the managers of this bill were able to include section \n3502, dealing with floating drydocks that are owned or contracted for \npurchase by eligible United States shipyards or their affiliates prior \nto this bill's enactment. The term ``shipyard'' in section 3502 will \napply to any facility owned by an eligible company in the United States \nthat constructs or repairs commercial or government vessels, including, \nbut not limited to, facilities that undertake alterations, conversions, \ninstallations, cleaning, painting, or maintenance work to such vessels. \nThis provision will clear confusion regarding drydocks and will benefit \nAmerican shipbuilders. I commend the managers for including this \nprovision in the bill.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, it has come to my attention that a \nprovision of the Northern Cheyenne Lands Act, which was included in the \nrecently passed NDAA and public lands package, contains a ministerial \nerror. Section 3077(c)(1)(A) of the NDAA describes a\n\n[[Page S6736]]\n\nmineral estate transfer between the United States and a private \nlandowner. Both subparagraphs of that section should reference the same \nmap, titled ``Northern Cheyenne Land Act--Coal Tracts'' and dated April \n22, 2014. However, subparagraph (ii) as just passed contains an error \nby indicating a map with an incorrect title. Section 3077(c)(1)(A)(ii) \nshould therefore be read to reference the ``Northern Cheyenne Land \nAct--Coal Tracts'' map dated April 22, 2014, which is the same map \ncorrectly referenced in subparagraph (i) of the same section.\n  The committee report for the underlying Northern Cheyenne Lands Act \nbill, S. 2442, will also acknowledge and address this error. I hope \nthis drafting error does not delay the Department of the Interior's \nimplementation of these provisions, which is of great importance to the \nNorthern Cheyenne Tribe in Montana. This conveyance, once completed, \nwill correct a mistake made by the United States over a century ago, \nwhen the United States failed to convey this property to the Tribe as \noriginally directed by Congress.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I rise to address American military \ninvolvement in the Syrian civil war and our strategy for protecting \nAmerica and our interests in the region.\n  I would first like to say that I am adamantly opposed to extending \nauthority to provide funding to train and arm Syrian rebels. That \nauthority is provided in the defense authorization bill that we are \nconsidering today. I voted against it in committee, spoke against it on \nthe floor in September, and raise my objections to it now.\n  I do not know where the Syrian rebels' allegiances truly lie or if \nthey will remain our allies once the Syrian civil war comes to an end. \nWhat I do know is that once our military begins to train and equip \nSyrian rebels of uncertain provenance, we will have put ourselves on a \npath that leads inevitably to regime change and nation-building in \nSyria. Such a course defies the lessons of American-led Middle Eastern \nnation-building over the last twelve years. And I cannot in good \nconscience justify to the people of West Virginia why we should \ncontinue down this path.\n  Before we commit more of our country's blood and treasure, we should \nacknowledge that after more than a decade of war, trillions of taxpayer \ndollars spent, and over 7,000 American lives lost in that part of the \nworld, we have not established the pro-western representative \ndemocracies that were once envisioned. But that doesn't mean we can't \nprotect ourselves.\n  While I caution against repeating the mistake of Middle Eastern \nnation-building, I reiterate my strongest support for our military, \nintelligence, and law enforcement professionals who are today defending \nAmericans at home and abroad from the kind of vile atrocities \nperpetrated by ISIS. These professionals demonstrate every day that we \nhave the means to identify terrorists and prevent them from doing harm \nto America.\n  If I thought that sending military trainers and weapons into Syria \nwould further that end or would make Americans safer, I would support \ndoing so. I do not. I reiterate what every Member of this body \ncertainly believes, which is that we can and should take any necessary \naction to prevent a direct threat to the United States. But I firmly \nbelieve that protecting America does not require nation building in \nSyria.\n  Yet our military involvement in Syria and Iraq continues to grow, \nthough to what end no one is certain. Because Congress has not had a \nrobust public debate about our strategy in the Middle East, nor made \nhard decisions about what our military response should be.\n  We know that ISIS is a threat to Americans in the Middle East as well \nas to friendly nations and our allies there. But we have not debated \nwhether entering another war is in our national interest.\n  One of the reasons this debate has not yet happened is that the \nPresident has not submitted to Congress a request for authority to use \nmilitary force against ISIS. Instead, what is happening in Syria is \nbasically this: the White House is relying on a decade-old \ncongressional authorization that allows military force against al-Qaeda \nand is using that as its legal justification for attacking ISIS. Well, \nthe world is changing, and we ought to be adapting our policies with \nit.\n  My colleague Bob Menendez is pushing forward with an AUMF of his own. \nThis week the Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed out of \ncommittee an AUMF that gives the President authority to go to war with \nISIS, but which prohibits ground troops. This is a first step, and I \nlook forward to debating the AUMF on the floor of the Senate.\n  But we should be debating this military authorization in the context \nof the President's Middle East strategy, which we have not yet seen \nbecause I believe we have a moral duty to have a full debate before we \nsend any more Americans into harm's way.\n  Two important things are going on here. The first is that Congress is \nmoving closer to give legal authorization for the President to conduct \nstrikes against ISIS. The second is that the President is also pursuing \na scheme to arm and train Syrians, which will certainly lead to regime \nchange and nation building. It is therefore critically important that \nthe President tells us clearly and plainly not just what the objectives \nof the military mission are--to degrade and destroy ISIS--but how he \nplans on doing so without putting us back into an open-ended war.\n  I support, as all my colleagues do, any action that prevents attacks \non American property or persons. But before we commit more of our \nNation's blood and treasure to political reform and religious \nsettlement in the Middle East, we should consider the lessons of our \ndecade of war there.\n  History has taught us that militarily training and arming Syrian \nrebels of uncertain provenance will put the United States on a path \nthat leads inevitably to regime change and nation-building in Syria. \nSuch a course defies the lessons of the American-led military \noperations of the last twelve years.\n  For these reasons I am adamantly opposed to sending American troops \ninto Syria to further escalate a ground war that I do not believe is in \nthe best interest of America or the region.\n  I ask the President and my colleagues in the Senate to allow us to \ngive the American people the public debate they deserve, before we find \nourselves again in an open-ended war in the Middle East.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I wish to speak on a provision in the \nappropriations measure. I am pleased to see that this legislation \nincludes a provision in Division D-Energy and Water Development and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations Act of 2015, which addresses a concern \nraised by farmers and ranchers around the country.\n  Section 111 of the General Provisions relating to the Corps of \nEngineers Civil Works Program states that: ``None of the funds made \navailable by this Act may be used to require a permit for the discharge \nof dredged or fill material under the Federal Water Pollution Control \nAct for the activities identified in subparagraphs (A) and (C) of \nsection 404(f)(1) of the Act.''\n  In section 404(f)(1) of the Clean Water Act, Congress provided a \npermitting exemption for certain activities including normal farming, \nforestry, and ranching activities, upland soil and water conservation \npractices, and the construction and maintenance of farm or stock ponds \nor irrigation ditches and the maintenance of drainage ditches.\n  One would think that with this clear exemption, our farmers and \nranchers could go about their business without worrying about whether \nEPA or the Corps of Engineers would try to regulate plowing, seeding, \nand harvesting, or their farm ponds and ditches. Unfortunately, in \nrecent years EPA and the Corps of Engineers have been trying to \ncircumvent the 404(f)(1) permitting exemptions by interpreting the \nlimited ``recapture'' provision in section 404(f)(2) in such an \nexpansive way as to virtually swallow up the exemptions in 404(f)(1).\n  A farmer's field is not a water of the U.S. A farm pond is not a \nwater of the U.S. An irrigation ditch is not a water of the U.S. But, \nthere are overzealous regulators out there who disagree. We have seen \nthe Corps try to regulate a family farm when the farmer tried to change \nfrom a ditch irrigation system to a piped irrigation system to improve \nwater efficiency. The Corps argued that there would be runoff from the \nwork\n\n[[Page S6737]]\n\nand that runoff somehow made the work subject to permitting under \nsection 404.\n  Section 111 stops that regulatory overreach and preserves the \nprotections Congress has provided to ranchers and farmers by making it \nclear that the recapture provisions of section 404(f)(2) do not apply \nto normal farming, forestry, and ranching activities, upland soil and \nwater conservation practices, and the construction and maintenance of \nfarm or stock ponds or irrigation ditches and the maintenance of \ndrainage ditches.\n  Of course, the greatest abuse of the Clean Water Act is the Obama \nAdministration's proposed ``waters of the United States'' rule, and \nthis section does not alleviate the concerns that farmers, small \nbusinesses, and local communities have with the proposed rule. This \nsection will, however, ensure that the will of Congress to protect \nfarmers and ranchers from burdensome 404 permitting requirements is \ncarried out, and I will continue to do everything in my power to stop \nEPA from finalizing the proposed ``waters of the United States'' rule \nnext year.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, we are getting close to having votes on \namendments and final passage tonight, the most significant vote of the \nyear each year.\n  For 52 consecutive years, we have passed the National Defense \nAuthorization Act. In almost every year there has been a last-minute \nmisunderstanding as to how these different provisions might affect \nsomething that has nothing to do with the defense of America.\n  In this case, there was--and procedurally I have disagreed with it. I \nhave said several times that a land package was included on the bill. I \nhave felt that once we have gone through the process of what has been \nreferred to as the big four, we have ironed out the differences. There \nare a lot of things that I don't like, but there are more things that I \ndo like. I daresay to Chairman Levin, he is in the same situation.\n  I have to say one more time that this chairman has been so incredibly \nfair to everyone.\n  We have to keep in mind that we passed this bill. After working on it \nfor 4 months, we passed it to the floor from the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee on May 23. There are a lot of things on here that we had. Of \ncourse, it went over and the House then passed their bill. They passed \ntheir bill actually on May 22; we passed it out of committee on May 23. \nThe problem is, they were able to pass theirs on the floor; we were \nnot. It is something we should have done a long time ago, and I am \nhoping that we learned a lesson from last year to this year, and we are \nnot going to let this happen again.\n  So we have now before us a bill that does the necessary things in \nthis most difficult time. I think most people would agree there has not \nbeen a time in our history where we have had more opposition from \ndifferent parts of the world. I refer to the good old days of the Cold \nWar with two superpowers--we are one, and the Soviet Union was the \nother one--and they were predictable. Mutually assured destruction \nmeant something. If something happened, we could bomb them and they \nwould do the same to us, and it is now all over. That is not the way it \nis anymore.\n  We have forces out there from North Korea and Iraq, and all these \nthings are taking place at a time when--and I don't want to make people \nangry about what this President has done to the military, but we have \nvirtually disarmed America. Our generals now are facing the possibility \nof sequestration. So the most important bill is now even more than just \nmost important. It is a must-pass bill. It has to pass. If this doesn't \npass, there is no other time we can take it up. Should December 31 get \nhere, it would be an absolute disaster.\n  We right now have 1,779,343 enlisted personnel in the military. If we \ndidn't pass a reauthorization bill, they would lose their benefits on \nDecember 31. I have talked about the benefit of that. I think everyone \nunderstands it, and it would be redundant to repeat it. But we can't \nhave people making career decisions predicated on assumptions that they \nwould have hazard pay, the assumption if they are pilots that they \nwould have pilot pay; that critical skills like the SEALs would have \nbonuses, and then all of a sudden on December 31 we take them away.\n  We are not going to let that happen. We are going to pass this bill \ntoday. The concern I have is that any amendments on it would cause a \nproblem that I think would be insurmountable. It would have to go back. \nThey would have to recall the House and then come back, and timewise it \ncan't happen.\n  So this is the last train leaving town. We have to have this for the \nsake of our men and women in uniform. If there is time remaining after \nthe chairman makes his remarks, I will even comment on some specific \nparts of this bill in terms of how good this bill is and why it is \nnecessary to pass.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I first thank my friend from Oklahoma, my \npartner as well in the Armed Services Committee. I have enjoyed the \npresence of the Presiding Officer on our committee, and I think she \nknows how well that committee works together, and Senator Inhofe and I \nguess both sides--both parties have worked very closely together for \nour troops. That is what this is all about is pulling together for our \ntroops. They inspire us, they unify us, they protect us, and the least \nwe owe them is a Defense authorization bill.\n  We haven't missed in 52 years. This would be the 53rd straight year \nthat there would be a Defense authorization bill--coincidentally, the \nsame number of years I have been married. So this may be the gift to my \nwife for our anniversary if we are done with this bill, if we finish it \ntoday.\n  This bill takes provisions critical to our national security, to the \nwell-being of our men and women in uniform, to our retirees and their \nfamilies. If we fail to enact this bill, the Department of Defense's \nstatutory authority to pay combat pay, hardship duty pay, enlistment \nand reenlistment bonuses, incentive pays for critical specialties, \nassignment incentive pay, accession and retention bonuses for critical \nspecialties, will expire on December 31. We cannot let that happen.\n  After that date, the statutory authority to provide combat pay to our \ntroops in Afghanistan and Iraq will lapse. We cannot let that happen. \nWe would lose some of our most highly skilled men and women with \nspecialties that we vitally need. We cannot let that happen.\n  Not only would we be shortchanging our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and \nmarines, we would be denying our military services critical authorities \nthey need to recruit and retain high-quality servicemembers, and to \nachieve their force-shaping objectives as they draw down their end \nstrengths.\n  And there is more. If we fail to enact this bill, school districts \nall over the United States that rely on supplemental impact aid to help \nthem educate military children would no longer receive that money. If \nwe fail to enact this bill, the Department of Defense will not be able \nto begin construction on important new military construction projects \nin the coming year. That would mean our troops don't get the barracks, \nthe ranges, the hospitals, the laboratories, and the other support \nfacilities they need to support operational requirements, conduct \ntraining, and to maintain their equipment.\n  It would mean that military family housing will not receive needed \nupgrades, and that schools to educate the children of our \nservicemembers will not be built or modernized.\n  If we fail to enact this bill, we will not enact provisions that \nstrengthen survivor benefits for disabled children of servicemembers \nand retirees. We would not then enact provisions addressing the \nemployment of military spouses, job placement of veterans. That is an \nissue which the Presiding Officer knows an awful lot about, because she \nhas been so directly involved in that and so many other issues.\n  We would then not be enacting provisions relative to military hazing, \nmilitary suicides, post-traumatic stress disorder, and mental health \nproblems in the military.\n  If we do not enact this bill, we would then enact none of the 20 \nprovisions in this bill addressing the scourge of sexual assault in the \nmilitary. We will not eliminate the good soldier defense which is \neliminated in this bill, as it\n\n[[Page S6738]]\n\nshould be. We would not give victims of sexual assault a voice in \nwhether their case is prosecuted in military or civilian courts. They \nshould have that voice. We would not give survivors of sexual assault \nthe right to challenge court-martial rulings that violate their rights \nand to challenge them in the Court of Criminal Appeals. They should \nhave that right.\n  If we don't pass this bill, we would not be strengthening the \npsychotherapist-patient privilege.\n  So this bill includes critical authorities for the Department of \nDefense. It provides essential support to our men and women in uniform, \nmilitary retirees, and their families.\n  If either of the motions we are going to be voting on is adopted, \nthis bill then will not pass and not become law, because it would then \nin one instance be open to amendments, and that could be endless \nbecause there are so many amendments that people would like to offer. I \nhave gone into the reasons why we are in a position where that simply \nis not practical or possible.\n  We are asking our colleagues to allow this bill to come to a final \npassage today and become the National Defense Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 2015.\n  Again, with thanks to all of our colleagues on the Armed Services \nCommittee, thanks to my partner Senator Inhofe who has worked so \nclosely, he and his staff, with myself and our staff.\n  I hope this would have an overwhelming vote and that we would not \nadopt any motion which would lead then to our not adopting this \ncritically needed bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, it is just about time for the vote. I \nwant to mention something which hasn't been mentioned.\n  We have two really great Americans, one serving in the House and one \nserving in the Senate. We have been talking about Chairman Levin and \nhow fair and open he has been. I think there is not a person of the 100 \nMembers of the Senate who doesn't agree with that.\n  At the same time, we have Buck McKeon over in the House of \nRepresentatives. He is the chairman of the House committee that Carl \nLevin is the chair of over here. He also is retiring, and he has served \nfor quite some time--not as long as Senator Levin.\n  Against their objections, we have named this bill the Carl Levin-Buck \nMcKeon bill, so I want to make sure everyone recognizes that proper \ntribute has been made to the long hours and years and the hard work \nthey have contributed.\n  This guy over here to my left has been through 16 of these. He has \nbeen working about 36 years, and I want to say he is deserving of that \nrecognition.\n  I also want to mention two other people. One is the guy sitting next \nto me to my right, John Bonsell; the other is Pete Levine, sitting next \nto the chairman. Their job is to make us look good and make all this a \nreality, because it is a very complicated thing. It is a 24-hour-a-day \nwork project. So I thank them for their effort. I know we are just \ntalking about amendments right now and we will have a chance to maybe \nexpand later on, but I think it needs to be said, and it needs to be \nsaid more than once.\n  I yield the floor. The hour is here.\n\n\n                        Vote on Motion to Refer\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nrefer the House message on H.R. 3979 to the Committee on Armed Services \nwith instructions.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, before asking for the yeas and nays, I \nwant to thank my friend again, Senator Inhofe, for mentioning our \nstaff. John Peter has done such good work with all of our staffs. We \nput the names of our staffs in the Record a day or two ago and they \ndeserve that and a lot more.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Walsh).

Under the previous order, H. \nCon. Res. 121 and H. Con. Res. 123 are considered and agreed to en bloc \nand the motions to reconsider are considered made and laid upon the \ntable en bloc.\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I wish to take a moment to speak on \nsomething that I think there is an overwhelming bipartisan desire to \nachieve, and that is to finish tonight. There is no good reason not to.\n  We are working to clear an agreement on our side to process the CR/\nomnibus, the extenders bill, and TRIA tonight--tonight\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 5771.\n\n  As for right now, I can tell you we are prepared to go forward on the \nextenders bill. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be \ndetermined by the majority leader, after consultation with the \nRepublican leader, the Senate proceed to consideration of H.R. 5771, \nthe Tax Increase Prevention Act; that there be up to 1 hour of debate \nequally divided between the two leaders or their designees prior to the \nvote on passage of the bill; further, that the vote on passage be \nsubject to a 60-vote affirmative threshold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, we have had bipartisan \nconversations about having a more than 1-year extension of the tax \nextenders, bipartisan conversations about moving to a 2-year bill or \nmaybe doing what we did in the Senate and passing the extend bill.\n  So I respect my friend, who is trying to get us out of here as \nquickly as possible, but we have to have a path forward to make sure we \nunderstand what is happening with the extenders.\n  The Senator mentioned TRIA. We also have some problems with that. So \nI believe we need a path forward on the omnibus and a way forward on \nthe nominations before we start dealing with whether there should be a \n2-year extension or a 1-year extension and what amendments, if any, we \nwould have on TRIA, so I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would briefly make the point that we are very close \nto being cleared on this side to finish. I want everybody to understand \nthat it is possible to finish tonight. Very shortly, we will be able to \nannounce that there are no impediments toward getting to that goal on \nour side of the aisle.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. We have the omnibus we have to do, we have to do the tax \nextenders, we have to do TRIA, and we have some nominations that we \nhave an obligation to the American people to do, so we are not going to \nfinish tonight. I think we could finish the omnibus tonight, but we are \nnot finishing tonight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/12/senate-section/article/S6739-2", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6739-S6740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n    \n\n     NOMINATION OF MARK GILBERT TO BE AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND \nPLENIPOTENTIARY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO NEW ZEALAND, AND TO \n SERVE CONCURRENTLY AND WITHOUT ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION AS AMBASSADOR \n EXTRAORDINARY AND PLENIPOTENTIARY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO \n                     THE INDEPENDENT STATE OF SAMOA\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n    \n\n   NOMINATION OF ROBERT C.

I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum required \nunder rule XXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we now are waiting for a vote to occur. \nUnder the rules, this will occur 2 days from now, 1 hour after we come \ninto session. So I would hope we can work something out to get this \ndone tonight. Remember, midnight on Saturday the government is out of \nmoney.\n  I hope that cooler heads would prevail and we can move forward and \nget this done. There is just no sense in our waiting around. This bill \nhas been talked about for days now. It has been very good work to get \nit where we are.\n  The two managers of this bill, the distinguished Senator from \nMaryland and, of course, the senior Senator from Alabama, have worked \nhard to get this bill done. I hope we can move forward on this as \nquickly as possible. There is no reason we have to wait until Sunday to \ndo this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I just wish to underscore the point that \nit is urgent we take up this Omnibus appropriations bill; that we do \nthis in order to have a budget for our country and that we don't \nthreaten another government shutdown--we know how damaging that is to \nthis country; and that we don't have another continuing resolution.\n  Another continuing resolution provides uncertainty to our agencies. \nThey can't do the critical work they need to do. It establishes last \nyear's priorities rather than trying to establish the priorities for \nthis year and represents a failure of the Congress.\n  So I start by first thanking and congratulating my colleague from \nMaryland, Senator Mikulski, for her incredible leadership through this \nprocess, working with Senator Shelby and their counterparts in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  This is not easy. We have sharply different views in this Congress, \nand we have seen over and over again gridlock where we are unable to \nmake decisions. I congratulate Senator Mikulski for bringing the \nnegotiations of the omnibus to a successful conclusion. When we look at \nthe work she did in the appropriations part of this Omnibus \nappropriations bill, I am very proud, and I think we all should be very \nproud and very supportive of the work she has done.\n  As I pointed out earlier, if we don't pass an Omnibus appropriations \nbill, we are either going to have a government shutdown or we are going \nto resort to a short-term continuing resolution. In either case, it is \nvery damaging to our country and to our economy.\n  The Omnibus appropriations bill we have before us allows us to set \ncertain priorities. I know Senator Mikulski has gone through many of \nthose priorities. I just wish to outline a few: the fact that we give \nadditional resources for missing and exploited children; the fact that \nwe provide law enforcement with rape kits to help in law enforcement \nagainst those who have perpetrated violence against women; the fact \nthat we provide an additional $5 billion-plus to fight the Ebola crisis \nglobally. This has a direct impact on the world economy, on world \nhealth, and directly affects the United States; the appropriations for \nour Department of Defense to be able to combat the extremist ISIL in \nits fear that it has invoked not just in that region but globally.\n  This Omnibus appropriations bill provides the resources in order to \ncarry out these important responsibilities of government. The \nalternative is a continuing resolution, at best. How do we fight a war \non a continuing resolution? How do we fight Ebola on a continuing \nresolution? We will not have the ability to be able to do it.\n  I thank Senator Mikulski. She has provided funds in here for our Farm \nService Agencies, which is particularly important to keep open the 250 \nthreatened closures of farm services offices. I mention that because in \nMaryland these offices are very important to our agricultural \ncommunity. Maryland farmers in their conservation efforts to help us on \nthe Chesapeake Bay work in conjunction with the service agencies. The \nclosing of these agencies would be devastating.\n\n[[Page S6742]]\n\n  The omnibus provides a modest pay adjustment for our Federal \nworkforce, our Federal workforce which has been asked to do more with \nless people--less people, more responsibilities. They are on the front \nlines of public service. This omnibus recognizes their service by \ngiving them a modest adjustment to their pay.\n  The transportation program, which is critically important for \neconomic growth--I can go over the differences here if we don't get the \nomnibus. For example, the funds for our transit projects--I know in \nMaryland there is $100 billion here for the Purple Line in Prince \nGeorge's County and Montgomery County. For those who travel in this \nregion, we know firsthand the gridlock problems on our roads. The only \ngood thing about being here tonight is that I don't have to fight the \ntraffic going home to Baltimore. We need the transit funding, and thank \nyou, Senator Mikulski, for providing that. If we have a continuing \nresolution, we lose it. The funds for Baltimore--lost, if we don't have \nthe omnibus appropriations bill.\n  There are funds for dredging of the Baltimore Harbor. I particularly \nappreciate the Appropriations Committee continuing the commitment we \nmade in 2008, the legislation that I authored for the full funding of \nthe Federal contributions to the WMATA system.\n  The funds that are here for our contract air traffic control towers. \nYou know, not too long ago there was a threat of a shutdown. We were \ngoing to have to close the contract offices that worked the air traffic \ncontrol towers in our small airports, including in Maryland. Well, we \nare protected by the omnibus so that will not occur. Go to a continuing \nresolution, and there is no such protection.\n  The Appalachian Regional Commission gets a bump-up in this \nappropriations bill, for good reason. The work they do is critically \nimportant to the rural part of Maryland, the western part. They need \nthat. If you go to a continuing resolution and those initiatives are \ngone, we don't get that.\n  We can go on and on and on. There is $1.4 billion of additional money \nfor community health centers--community health centers. Thank you. In \nMaryland we have used those funds to expand community health centers, \nto expand prenatal care, increasing infant survival in our State. We \nhave used it for community mental health services, we have used it for \npediatric dental services, and in the omnibus bill we will be able to \ncontinue to make that progress. If we don't get the omnibus, all bets \nare off. On a continuing resolution we cannot move forward in those \nprograms.\n  I would thank you on behalf of the veterans of this country. What you \nhave done requiring advanced funding is that you have protected our \nveterans and the benefits that we promised them regardless of the \nproblems we have had getting our appropriations bills done. It is the \nright thing to do. They fought to preserve the liberties of our \ncountry, so they should at least know we are going to live up to the \ncommitments we made to protect our veterans.\n  I also appreciate that in this omnibus you have extended the TAA's \nbenefits that help our workers in transition who otherwise would not \nhave jobs due to the international trade issues. My colleague Senator \nBrown has been very instrumental in this. We extend that through fiscal \nyear 2015.\n  Military construction. Military construction is critically important. \nWe have gone through a BRAC process. We have gone through ways in which \nwe have consolidated our military, but we also have to modernize our \nfacilities and the military construction budgets would come to a \nstandstill if we don't have a budget in Maryland, and we will have \nprojects that move forward in Havre de Grace, Annapolis, Indian Head, \nPax River, and Andrews. All of that is very important.\n  Money has been provided in this omnibus to help in regard to the \nproblems of Central America. We saw what happened on our borders. I \nthink we all agree we want children to be safe. It must be a horrible \nchoice for a parent to put their child on a transit to come to the \nUnited States because of what is happening in their Central American \ncountry. We begin on this omnibus bill to say, hey, let's try to work \nfor safer conditions in Central America which will give us more \nstability in regard to what is happening on our own borders. That makes \nsense. That is in there.\n  I also thank Senator Mikulski for an initiative I requested that \ndeals with Holocaust survivors. For the first time we have a direct \nappropriation to help Holocaust survivors. These are individuals who \nhave a great fear of ending up in an institution. You can understand \nwhy. So access to fundamental services in the community is particularly \nimportant. This omnibus is sensitive to make sure that we provide that. \nAgain, if we don't have the omnibus, that initiative is gone.\n  You are protecting our Pell grant recipients so they can continue to \nreceive their Pell grants at current levels. All of this is so \nimportant in the omnibus if we don't get it.\n  There are some things in this omnibus I don't like at all. As I said \nearlier, this is a compromise. I know that we have seen the bills come \nover from the House of Representatives. We have seen the \nantienvironmental, antifinancial consumer protection bills. So many \nbills have come over. And we know there were efforts made on numerous \nof these policy riders to the appropriations to the omnibus bill. \nUnfortunately, some got on, and I certainly understand the political \nprocess. I am not naive to understand that we could win on every issue; \nbut I feel compelled to point out the policy riders that are on this \nomnibus bill that I hope we will work together to remove the harmful \nimpacts that they could possibly have on policy in this country.\n  On the environmental front, there is a policy rider that restricts \nEPA's authority to deal with tackle and ammunition as it relates to \nlead content. Our policy should be based to allow EPA, based upon best \nscience for how they protect public health. I think that is compromised \nby that rider.\n  There is a rider that could compromise how the agriculture community \nworks on our clean water bills. All stakeholders have to be in together \nto deal with clean water. We do that with the Chesapeake Bay in \nMaryland. I think that rider could have some very negative impact. We \nhave heard a lot of talk about the sage grouse which is a species that \ncould become endangered. The Environmental Protection Agency should be \nable to do what is right in establishing the right conservation \nefforts, but instead there were restrictions placed on EPA, and I \nregret that. I hope we can work around that.\n  The definition of fill in mining regulations could open up more \nmountaintop removal for coal mining, the most obscene way to obtain \ncoal, to blow up mountains and pollute streams. There are better ways. \nWe shouldn't put these arbitrary restrictions on the Environmental \nProtection Agency.\n  There is a provision here you have heard a lot of comment on the \nfloor on dealing with financial consumer protection which would repeal \nthe Dodd-Frank provision where banks had to push out some of the \nderivative trading into separate accounts so they weren't subject to \nthe FDIC, the government insurance program. That provision could be \nused for risky trading and could result in government bailout. That is \nbad. Let's work to make sure that doesn't happen. Let's work together \nto restore that type of protection in our financial services.\n  The IMF doesn't receive funds over this omnibus bill. I think that is \na mistake. I think our responsibilities internationally require us to \ncooperate in that.\n  There are provisions in here that interfere with the District of \nColumbia home rule. That won't be the first time we have done that, and \nI regret that. So it is not unusual to see those provisions in an \nappropriations bill. It still doesn't make it right. It is not right.\n  There are some missed opportunities here. I am sorry we are not \nparticipating in the Green Climate Fund. This is an international \neffort to deal with the realities of climate change. The United States \nneeds to be a leader. We are missing an opportunity by not \nparticipating in the Green Climate Fund.\n  I regret that this is an omnibus appropriations bill for all agencies \nexcept one: Homeland Security. That is wrong. Our Homeland Security \nneeds the protection of a budget, not a continuing resolution. We may \nhave very different views on what we should do on immigration policy, \nbut that shouldn't stop us from allowing those\n\n[[Page S6743]]\n\nwho serve in Homeland Security to have the confidence that we will \nsupport their budget for a year, and that they can go forward with an \ninitiative. I regret that. That is a missed opportunity that is in the \nomnibus bill.\n  Lastly, let me mention the two extraneous issues that made their way \ninto the omnibus appropriations bill. That was a mystery, I think, to \nSenator Mikulski and others who worked so hard in negotiating back and \nforth in good faith only to find that the Rules Committee in the House \nof Representatives added two extraneous provisions to an omnibus \nappropriations bill. The process is wrong. They shouldn't do that. That \nis an abuse of power. They are also, by the way, wrong on the policy.\n  One, it is a very serious issue, how to deal with multi-employer \nplans. I have been working on pension issues ever since I came to the \nCongress. We have a problem with the multi-employer plans, there is no \nquestion about that. But we should have a bill on the floor of the \nSenate and debate that. We shouldn't be passing a bill that could very \nwell have some very stark consequences on individuals who are currently \nretired. That could very easily happen under this provision.\n\n  The second, which adds new categories of giving in our political \nsystem to political party conventions and to the building funds, and to \nrecount, we don't need more money in politics in this country and we \nshouldn't be taking up that bill on an omnibus appropriations bill.\n  Let me conclude my remarks as I began. To me, this is an easy \ndecision to make. It is an easy decision because the public does not \nwant to see more gridlock in Washington. They know the House of \nRepresentatives has gone home. They know that our leaders have \nnegotiated an omnibus budget for the next fiscal year, and they are \nsaying at long last could we at least get this done, or are we going to \nhave another threatened shutdown? Are we going to put the government on \nautopilot for a 3-month period?\n  I think we have a responsibility to see issues to conclusion, and on \nthe appropriation issues that are in this bill, you should be very \nproud to support the work of Senator Mikulski and the entire group \nbehind the negotiations of this omnibus bill, Senator Shelby and \nothers. We should support that and recognize that what we need to do \nnext year--I know my colleague from Maryland has been the champion of \nthis. I heard her speak so eloquently in our caucus about this and on \nthe floor of the Senate, but what we need to do is get a budget done in \nregular order so the appropriators know what their budget limits are \nand they can work on the individual appropriation bills. We can bring \nthem to the floor, we can debate them, have amendment votes, and then \nwe won't be as frustrated as we are tonight, in the eleventh hour \ndealing with issues for the very first time that we see on the omnibus \nappropriations bill.\n  I know Senator Mikulski has been the great champion of saying let's \nget back to regular order. She did that in her committee. We are not \nsurprised. We saw the work of her committee. It was done very openly. \nWe had a chance for input, and that is why a lot of what is in this \nomnibus appropriations bill represents the work of each Member of this \nbody. But we can do this in a more open and transparent way by \nconsidering individual appropriation bills on the floor of the Senate, \nreconciling those differences at the House, and really doing the \npeople's business and not just confront ourselves with another omnibus \nappropriations bill.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the good work that has been done \nand I hope we can approve the omnibus appropriations bill this evening \nwell in advance of the hour of midnight, which will be here sooner than \nwe think, in order to avoid a government shutdown and let the people of \nthis Nation know we are doing our very best.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise to speak on the consolidated \nand further continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2015.\n  Every year we have a particular responsibility that is mandated by \nthe Constitution, which is that the Congress of the United States shall \npass an annual revenue bill to fund the government. The power of the \npurse is vested in the Congress. It is not vested in the executive \nbranch. Our subcommittee on appropriations is a constitutionally \nmandated committee. The reason for that is, if one reads the Federalist \nPapers, it says that if the leader of a country controls the purse, \nthey tend to be kings. But if the executive branch has to share power \nwith the legislative branch controlling the purse, you have checks and \nbalances.\n  Tonight is the night we talk about what is in our annual bill. It had \nbeen the hope of myself and my vice chairman, Senator Shelby, that we \ncould file something here called regular order, where the 12 \nsubcommittees in Appropriations would have brought up one bill at a \ntime. For a variety of reasons--mostly deep partisan politics--we were \nnot able to bring up 12 individual bills, and I regret that.\n  As a new party takes over, I hope we listen to the message of the \nvoters--end gridlock, end deadlock, end the partisanship that is \ncrippling our country. One way to correct that is to return to regular \norder. I look forward to continuing to work with both sides of the \naisle to do that.\n  Tonight we are where we are. We are bringing the consolidated bill to \nthe Senate floor which represents the work of 12 subcommittees: \nDefense, Interior, Labor, Education, Health, Foreign Operations, the \nState Department, and Homeland Security will be on a continuing \nresolution. I could call all their names. We will be looking at a $1 \ntrillion expenditure, which is the discretionary funding of the United \nStates of America; $550 billion of that is in defense--DOD only. The \nremaining amount is in domestic agencies which is also considered the \nState Department.\n  We need to pass this bill tonight so we can show that there is no \ngovernment shutdown. The funding for the Government of the United \nStates of America expires at midnight. We want to be sure there is no \ngovernment shutdown, but we also don't want to be on a continuing \nresolution. A continuing resolution simply says take what you have done \nin 2014 and put it on autopilot.\n  If we pass the continuing appropriations, which I hope we do, the \ngovernment will be able to show that we have exercised thought and set \nnational priorities and worked on this. I hope today we will be able to \ndo our job.\n  The House passed the bill on Thursday night by a vote of 219 to 206. \nWe will now take up that bill.\n  It is remarkable in today's era of slam-down politics, that those of \nus who have been working on this committee have been able to set aside \nour differences, work across the aisle, and work across the dome to \nfind a way to compromise without capitulation on principles. The \nAmerican people said they wanted us to do that, and that is the job we \nhave done.\n  My wonderful colleague from Maryland, Senator Ben Cardin, explained a \ngood part of the bill. We are so close and we think so much alike, we \ncould have given each other's speech. He kind of gave my speech.\n  I will reiterate what is in this bill. This agreement provides for \nour national security. It ensures readiness for our troops. It funds \ntraining for the troops, as well as our maintenance facilities, so that \nour military assets, such as aircraft carriers and ships, are ready to \ngo and our soldiers receive the training they need.\n  Military leaders say readiness is our top priority, and the bill will \nprovide $162.5 billion for readiness.\n  It also includes important funds for our National Guard and Reserve \nso our units are ready for the job we ask them to do, and we have \nincluded $200 million more for our national. We also included a 1-\npercent pay raise--a 1-percent COLA, cost of living for the Defense \nDepartment's 3 million employees.\n  We worked very hard on a variety of issues, one of which of course \nhas been the way we serve our veterans. One of our greatest \naccomplishments is this bill is what we do for them.\n  Veterans service organizations came to me and many of the members \nthis evening and said: We not only need funding to implement the \nreforms that were passed by the Congress, but we also want you to do it \nfor this year and a year in advance. We said: We don't do\n\n[[Page S6744]]\n\nthat. And they said: You have to do that because we are concerned that \noften with the dysfunction and delay as a strategy in Washington, it \ncreates chaos for veterans and their survivors. Guess what. We were \nable to do it.\n\n  For the first time ever, we provide funding for this year and 1 year \nin advance. It means that no matter what happens to the government, \nveterans can count on their disability check, their pension check, a \ncheck to help fund the GI bill, and their health care will be paid for. \nWe also deal with the incredible problem of veterans backlog, and we \nput in the money to able to do that. For the VA backlog process, over \n$2.5 billion, adding another $40 million to do that.\n  I have been horrified--in my own home State of Maryland--that the \nclaims backlog at one point took more than 125 days. We are doing our \nreform.\n  I also wish to talk about compelling human needs. We know that one of \nthe most able Members of the Senate, Senator Tom Harkin, is retiring. \nBut during the years he has served, he has never let up in championing \nthe little guy and the little gal to make sure we had access to health \ncare, access to education, and truly looking out for our constituents. \nI am so proud that--working with him--we were able to fund the child \ncare development block grant, which passed the Senate overwhelmingly, \nby adding over $75 million. That means they will able to ensure that \nthousands more children will be able to qualify for daycare, and it \nwill be safe and affordable.\n  I wish to talk about college affordability as well--a great passion \nof Senator Harkin, myself, and I know many Members of the Senate. We \nincreased the maximum Pell grant by $100, we reformed the Pell grants \nto give students a chance to be able to go to college and get their \nGED. This has been a tremendous problem for many single mothers and \nthey would drop out.\n  They now know they have to earn, and they are ready to learn. But in \norder to be eligible to go to community college, they had to have their \nGED, and they are now able to do both. It also restores the community \ncolleges' efforts to be able to fund scholarships from their own \nendowments.\n  I will take a moment to speak about jobs. We need to create jobs in \nthe United States of America, and what we did when we focused in on \njobs was to fund the infrastructure. Guess what. We put in money in the \nFederal checkbook for the highway trust fund and the harbor maintenance \nfund so our harbors could be dredged, our roads and bridges would be \nsafe, and also included more money for dam safety.\n  In my own home State, we funded the Metro and made a big downpayment \non the Purple and Red Lines. These are jobs to improve our \ninfrastructure and are absolutely crucial.\n  I know there are others who wish to speak, and I am going to show \nthat we looked at trying to fund jobs and infrastructure. I will talk \nabout what we did in the commerce committee and how we came up with a \nway to end the backlog on patents in the area of intellectual \ninfrastructure. There were over 400,000 patents pending. We wanted to \nmake sure in this America, that if you invent something, you get to \nprotect your idea so you can move it into the marketplace.\n  We also funded these regional innovation centers in manufacturing. We \npromoted 3D manufacturing and made it local. In many of our States \nwhere we lost it, we had major advances. I will talk more about it, but \nI see my colleague, Senator Udall, is on the floor. I will yield the \ntime and allow him to speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I thank Chairwoman Mikulski and the \nPresiding Officer.\n  I will say a few words about Chairwoman Mikulski.\n  First of all, I am honored to serve on the Appropriations Committee. \nFor the last couple of years I served as the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Financial Services and General Government, and with her \nguidance and work, it has been a truly fulfilling task.\n  I thank Senator Mikulski for the last 2 years since she has taken \nover and putting us on track in terms of having a good, solid \nappropriations process, where we make every attempt to get the \nappropriations bills through the Senate and in place at the beginning \nof the budget year. That could make a real difference, as she has \nindicated, for veterans, for jobs, and for all of the agencies that are \nfunded throughout government, and particularly in my State where we \nhave two premier national laboratories--Los Alamos and Sandia National \nLaboratories. We have three Air Force bases, national parks, and \nnational monuments. There is so much that is a part of this \nappropriations bill that is very important to my State.\n  We have a lot of work to do today, and I will speak for a few minutes \non some of the issues that are important to my State and our country.\n  First, I will start out on a positive note. The Senate just recently \npassed the Defense authorization bill. That bill is critical to our \nNation's security and for our troops at home and abroad who deserve our \nsupport and respect.\n  In addition, this year it also includes landmark conservation \nmeasures to protect some of the most beloved landscapes in New Mexico. \nThese are measures we have worked on for many years--since Senator \nBingaman was in office--and they are the result of many years of dogged \nhard work by a diverse group of sportsmen, conservationists, local \nbusinesspeople, and others.\n  With this bill, we are designating Columbine Hondo Wilderness, giving \npermanent congressional protection to this special area. We are \nincreasing public access to the Valles Caldera by transferring \nmanagement to the National Park Service. This will ensure financial \nstability for one of the best places in New Mexico for hiking, hunting, \nand fishing.\n  We are dedicating a historical Manhattan Project a national park that \nwill include Los Alamos, NM, where Americans can learn about and \nremember our complicated Cold War history.\n  This bill protects the special and important places, increases \ntourism, and creates jobs. We also renewed a BLM pilot program to \nimprove the permitting process for the oil and gas industry. This is \ncritical to energy development in New Mexico and other Western States.\n  It ensures that BLM has the resources to do all parts of its job--\nmanaging land for conservation, grazing, and permitting for oil and gas \ndevelopment.\n  I thank my colleague Senator Heinrich, who serves on the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, for being a strong partner in getting \nthese measures passed.\n  Now the Senate has another important duty pending before us--passing \nan appropriations bill to fund the Federal Government, including many \nvital programs in my home State of New Mexico. We have not had regular \nspending bills in recent years, and here we are at the eleventh hour \nwith an omnibus bill at the last minute.\n  The fact that we have a bill is due, in great part, to the leadership \nof Chairwoman Mikulski, and I am glad to be part of her team on the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  The alternative to this bill is a short-term CR or a couple of short-\nterm CRs for the whole year. I think that is an unacceptable way to do \nbusiness, and it would cost jobs and hurt our economy in New Mexico. \nNew Mexico's labs and bases need certainty in their critical jobs to \nkeep our Nation safe. Communities in my home State rely on funding \nthrough the Payments in Lieu of Taxes Program to provide basic \nservices, such as schools and public safety.\n  I know Chairwoman Mikulski understands the PILT Program, has worked \nhard to make sure that PILT is funded in this bill, and it is greatly \nappreciated in the rural parts of the West.\n  Let me say again that continuing resolutions are disruptive. They are \ninefficient. They lock in place programs that prevent us from \nevaluating what is working and what isn't and keep us from rooting out \nwasteful spending. But trying to put this omnibus bill at the end of \nthe year is far from ideal.\n  There was a time not long ago when having to pass an omnibus bill was \na sign that work had broken down. Today it is the best possible option. \nI am extremely happy to have it. Again, I credit our chairwoman with \nfighting hard to get us to this point. It has not been easy. But the \nAmerican people deserve better than this broken process.\n\n[[Page S6745]]\n\nThey deserve a Congress that works, that is open and deliberate, not \nlast-minute deals and gimmicks for special interests. Our duty is to \nthe American people, not Wall Street billionaires and bankers.\n  I will continue to do all I can as a member of the Appropriations \nCommittee to get back to the regular order. We cannot keep getting in \njust under the wire.\n  In that respect, our colleagues in the House have to stop sending \nover all of these riders. We had more than 100 riders sent over from \nthe House. As Chairwoman Mikulski knows, this isn't the way to \nlegislate on an appropriations bill. We are not supposed to be putting \nriders in there. So they sent more than 100 of these over from the \nHouse of Representatives. It is disruptive. Senator Mikulski took them \noff and was able to work through them and get a decent, good final \nproduct. I am going to continue to do all I can to make sure we get \nback to the regular order.\n  Now I wish to speak about why this bill is important and why it is \nimportant to pass this omnibus bill.\n  First of all, this bill is critical to my State of New Mexico. New \nMexico has two fine national laboratories--Sandia and Los Alamos; three \nAir Force bases; White Sands testing range; and a number of other \nFederal institutions, national parks, and national monuments. They are \nall funded, and when they are funded on a regular basis at the \nbeginning of a fiscal year, it is a much better situation for everyone.\n  For PILT funds, which our counties depend on for schools, roads, law \nenforcement, and anything they feel is important in their county, they \ncan rely on these PILT funds.\n  At this point my State is in severe drought. We have water projects \nsuch as the Navajo Gallup project that can't keep waiting. There is \nmoney in this bill to keep that project going. Communities can't just \nput their needs on hold because Congress is broken. Navajo communities \nin New Mexico still need clean water. In fact, every day we delay, \ntheir situation gets worse. That is true of so many projects that are \nfunded by the Federal Government. Communities and businesses have to \nplan, and they need certainty. The needs don't go away. So let's get \nthis done.\n  Finally, I wish to speak a little bit about the authorization, of \ncourse, that we just produced out of the Foreign Relations Committee. I \nurge Congress to address another important issue--this issue of the \nauthorization of force. We need to update the authorization of force \nfor our military in light of our changing involvement in a variety of \nMiddle Eastern conflicts--most notably, ISIS. If we leave without doing \nthis, we are failing the American people, our troops, and shirking our \nconstitutional duty.\n  ISIS is a brutal terrorist group, and it must be stopped. We must \ncontinue to work with our allies, including those in the region, to use \nstrategic force to stop ISIS. I am proud of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee for recognizing our essential duty in defining the \nparameters of this fight. This is the first step, but our Constitution \nrequires the full Congress to authorize war. This is a matter that \ndeserves debate. It should not be taken lightly. The last 13 years of \nconflict in Afghanistan and in Iraq illustrate this--why it is so \nimportant to be thoughtful and deliberate about war.\n  I urge my colleagues to stay until the work is done and we give the \nAUMF consideration by the full Senate. This is not easy work, but this \nis not a normal situation. ISIS is a rapidly growing terrorist group \nrecruiting young people from the West. It spans two countries, with \nvery expansive ambitions.\n  We must defeat ISIS, but at the same time we cannot allow another \nopen-ended war. That will yet again strain communities in my State and \nacross the country and put us in a situation we cannot pay for.\n  Since July I have received over 1,100 letters and hundreds of phone \ncalls from my constituents. They are clear, and I want to be equally \nclear: Congress should rise to its constitutional oversight of the \nNation's war powers. This is a solemn responsibility, one I have taken \nvery seriously throughout my time in Congress. I voted for the 2001 \nauthorization for the war in Afghanistan. I voted against the 2002 \nauthorization for war in Iraq.\n  I believe the new AUMF is strong in that it prohibits ground \noperations except in limited circumstances. Those circumstances, such \nas rescuing servicemembers or U.S. citizens, are specified in the text \nof the resolution. It also repeals the 2002 Iraq AUMF and sets a 3-year \ntimeline for the 2001 AUMF, which is currently supporting military \nengagements around the world that we never intended when we originally \npassed them. But I would still caution that we must be watchful so that \nthis engagement doesn't vastly change in scope without the approval of \nCongress or the support from our constituents.\n  I fought to provide Congress with an even stronger role. I proposed \nan amendment to limit authorization to 1 year. I also cosponsored a \nproposal with Senator Paul to require a new authorization with Congress \nif U.S. forces were to be deployed outside of Iraq and Syria. We need \nthis authorization to pass now, as the conflict has been ongoing for \nmonths, but we also must continue to be watchful. Costs should not just \nbe charged to a credit card. Let's make sure we have a real \nconversation on how the generation that has decided to go to war will \npay for it.\n  Again, I urge Congress to honor its responsibility to stay and finish \nthis critical duty.\n  Just to wrap up, I once again want to say to my chairwoman Senator \nMikulski that she has taken on a very difficult task in terms of \nlooking at what was sent to us by the House of Representatives--more \nthan 100 riders on all sorts of things, trying to dismantle the \nAffordable Care Act, trying to tackle and get into the IRS and diminish \nits ability to carry out its responsibilities, and on and on. The \nSenator from Maryland has worked through these amendments diligently \nand come up with a good product. This is much better than struggling \nthrough continuing resolutions 2, 3 months at a time and then coming \nback again. This gives certainty to government, gives certainty to \nbusinesses, and it shows that we are trying to react responsibly to the \nsituation that is before us.\n  Again, I applaud Senator Mikulski. It is a real honor to work with \nher on the Appropriations Committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am delighted to be on the floor this \nevening to take, first of all, a minute to thank my good friend and \nmentor Chairwoman Mikulski for her tremendous work on the product that \nis before us tonight. We want to get something done when we come here. \nIn order to get anything done in Congress, we have to be willing to \ncompromise. We have to fight hard for our principles and what we \nbelieve in. But at the end of the day it is a give-and-take. It is \nnever easy, and no one never ends up with a bill they have written on \ntheir own.\n  Chairwoman Mikulski deserves so much credit for what is in this bill \nthat puts our country on a better track. Putting jobs and economic \ngrowth first is a principle she always speaks to, and she fought for \nthem in this bill.\n  She fought off so many policies and riders that were thrown at her. I \nknow because I have spoken with her time and time again as she has \ntried to say: What can I absolutely draw a line in the sand on, and \nwhat can I put in here in order to make sure I am doing what is right \nfor my country? It is not easy to do that.\n  She fought off many riders that all of us on this side of the aisle \nwould have found extremely difficult to ever vote for. She took those \nout.\n  She maintained the budget levels Chairman Ryan and I agreed on last \nyear. That was very hard to do. She is trying to put together a bill to \nfund our government across the board, from defense, to agriculture, to \ntransportation, to so many areas that people take for granted every day \nuntil our government shuts down. Then they remember how much they rely \non our national parks or our research and our investment or the \nprotection that is so important in our Homeland Security bills. She \nworked hard under very strict requirements that we all supported in \nanother compromise a year ago and maintained that in this bill.\n  Critically, her work on this bill avoids another government shutdown.\n\n[[Page S6746]]\n\nRunning this place by crisis we know doesn't work. It hurts our \neconomy. It hurts our families. Certainly, it hurts the stature of the \nSenate.\n  So her work to put this together and have this bill before us tonight \nis truly a remarkable accomplishment and really is proof of the \nstateswoman she is. I commend her for that.\n  I am especially grateful that she put so much into this legislation \nthat really helps our everyday, average, middle-class families who are \nstruggling so hard in this country and really lays down a strong \nfoundation for long-term and broad-based economic growth. She did not \nforget that principle at all in what she fought for, and that is \nembedded within the legislation.\n  There are, of course, provisions in this bill that any one of us can \npull out and oppose, and there are certainly some provisions with which \nI do not agree. I am really disheartened that the House Republicans put \nWall Street interests ahead of middle-class families and demanded a \nprovision in this bill. I am very concerned that some of the provisions \ncould increase health care premiums for our families and our \nbusinesses. And I strongly oppose the policy change that was slipped \ninto the bill that could lead to a reduction in pensions for many of \nour retirees. I share the concerns of many of us on this side that that \nis in this legislation.\n  This is a compromise piece of legislation, and we had to swallow and \nthe other side had to swallow. Why? It is because at the end of the \nday, we do not want to run our country in continuing resolutions, in \nthis economic upturn, in crisis management every 30 days or 60 days for \nthe next 2 years. That is why we had to look to the greater good of \nthis bill, and I am very pleased with some really significant pieces of \nlegislation in this bill.\n  I worked very hard with my good friend and colleague on the other \nside of the aisle, Senator Collins, who is my partner on the \nTransportation, Housing and Urban Development Subcommittee. Senator \nCollins and I worked very hard to find a compromise that makes \nsignificant investments in our transportation infrastructure to help \nour commuters and our families and our businesses and our economy.\n  I want my colleagues on this side of the aisle to know that the \ninvestments in this bill that are in Amtrak, in public transit, in air \ntraffic control modernization, and in airport improvements are very \ncritical for all of our communities. I am going to vote yes for those \ntonight. The bill makes it possible for the FAA to keep sufficient \nnumbers of air traffic controllers and inspectors on the job. This is a \nkey safety issue that I will be supporting in this bill. And our bill \nputs to work new, targeted investments to help the Department of \nTransportation to do everything possible to keep our communities safe \nas the number of oil shipments by rail continue to increase in the \ncountry.\n  I am especially proud of our part of this legislation that continues \nto support a very successful TIGER program, and so many Members have \ncome to me and said they really appreciated that in this bill because \nit allows investments in critical pieces of transportation \ninfrastructure in their home States that helps create jobs and boosts \ntheir regional economy. I know this has been important in my State. I \nknow the demand is very high. We were not able to have the number we \nliked, we did have to reduce it, but it remains in this bill as a very \nstrong investment in our communities, and I would be proud to be \nsupporting that in this bill.\n  On the housing side of our bill, we maintain the housing assistance \nfor low-income families that is so important today that they have the \nsupport while they get back on their feet.\n  To not pass this bill tonight means we put a lot of people who are \nstruggling today at risk in their communities to not have the home that \nis so important to their family's stability.\n  I am especially proud we are going to continue funding the HUD-VASH \nProgram. It is a program so many Members have told me is important to \nthem and takes the important steps of expanding HUD-VASH to Native \nAmericans who are at risk of homelessness living on reservations. We \nincreased the number of public housing units that can be part of the \npublic assistance demonstration that allows public housing authorities \nto leverage private capital and to make capital improvements to more \nthan 100,000 additional units of affordable housing. We worked hard to \nmake sure this bill continues to support public housing and economic \ndevelopment projects in communities across the country through the CDBG \nProgram. I will say that virtually every Member of the Senate has said \nwe need to maintain the CDBG Program on how important it is. There are \nlocal communities to make decisions about the local communities, and \nthe funding is absolutely critical. This isn't just about spending. Our \nlegislation contains a number of reforms that are going to improve \ngovernment and save taxpayer dollars. Let me repeat that. We are voting \nto save taxpayer dollars because we approved the process for \nadministering emergency preparedness grants, and we make sure property \nowners are held accountable if they fail to take care of housing funded \nwith taxpayer resources.\n  We included a provision that supports efforts to improve the \ncoordination between domestic violence service and housing systems to \nmake sure our domestic violence survivors are getting the care and \nsupport they deserve. I know much has been made of the provisions that \npeople don't like, and I share that angst.\n  But I think it is so important that we, as adults, stand up to the \nresponsibility we have, as the Senate and as Congress, to pass a \nfunding bill through the next year that makes sure we don't have \ngridlock and dysfunction running this economy again.\n  The alternative to a bipartisan compromise spending bill is just \nanother short-term continuing resolution and another short-term \ncontinuing resolution. We cannot run this government by crisis or \nshort-term resolutions. That is an irresponsible autopilot approach and \nwould cut off our ability as Senators to make decisions about how our \ngovernment operates.\n  I again want to thank my colleague and my mentor, the amazing Senator \nfrom Maryland, the chairwoman of this committee, Barbara Mikulski, for \nthe work she has done and for the drive she has. She never lost sight \nof what her goal is, despite some very difficult negotiations, and I \nwant to remind all of us that tonight hopefully we will be voting on a \ncompromise.\n  I know personally that in this country what everybody says to me \nconstantly is: We are tired of the partisan bickering. We want you to \ncompromise. That is what this is. We want our country to work again. \nThat is what this bill does. I urge our colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the spending bill \nbefore us. I rise in opposition to the cynical substance of the \nlegislation. I rise in opposition to the un-Republican and undemocratic \nprocess by which a small collection of political and economic insiders \ncrafted it to benefit each other at everyone else's expense.\n  Finally, I rise in particular opposition to the signals that this so-\ncalled CRomnibus sends, the signal it sends to political insiders on \nboth ends of Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, the signal it sends to \nspecial interest cronies on Wall Street and K street, and the signal it \nsends to working families struggling on Main Streets across this \ncountry who have been waiting for a decade for someone in this city to \nstart putting them first.\n  Those problems with this bill--each one alone enough to merit \nopposition--do not even speak to its greatest weakness, its failure to \ncorrect the President's lawless Executive amnesty. Since last night \nwhen it was taken up in the House of Representatives, supporters of the \nCRomnibus have couched their support in the language of compromise: \n``This isn't a perfect bill,'' they say.\n  But on the contrary, it is perfect. As a representation of everything \nwrong with Washington, DC, as an example of exactly the kind of unfair, \nunrepresentative legislating that triggered successive electoral waves \nof bipartisan condemnation in 2006, 2008, 2010, and again in 2014--the \nCRomnibus is perfect.\n  Members of my party do not have the luxury of blaming this latest \nfailure on the outgoing Senate majority. No. This one is on us.\n\n[[Page S6747]]\n\n  Americans just last month thought they went to the polls and voted \nfor change to stop this kind of thing: unread, 1,000-plus page bills \nwritten in secret, filled with hidden favors for special interests \nwhile funding the lawlessness of an out-of-control President.\n\n  Americans looking for that change will not find it in this bill. \nRather, they will find what the discarded revolutionaries of ``Animal \nFarm'' found at the end of George Orwell's classic:\n\n       The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man \n     to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was \n     impossible to say which was which.\n\n  Americans across our country are facing a new and unnatural kind of \nsqueeze, an opportunity deficit that is warping our free enterprise \neconomy and our voluntary civil society. This opportunity deficit is \nnot simply the result of globalization or technology or free trade. No. \nIt is the result of politicians creating a welfare system that traps \npoor families in poverty--sometimes for generations at a time--and \nlocks lower skilled workers out of potential jobs, an education system \nthat traps poor kids in bad schools and college students into a \nlifetime of debt, a health care system that locks the poor in second-\nclass care and erases what few wage gains the middle-class families \never see, a tax system that unfairly discourages work, saving, \ninvestment, marriage, and children.\n  Government policy unfairly protects the privileges of those who have \nalready climbed the ladder of success, while putting that ladder out of \nthe reach of those who have not yet grasped its very bottom rungs.\n  On Wall Street, corporate profits continue to soar. In Washington the \ninfluence economy booms and booms on. Almost everywhere else, take-home \npay is flat. Jobs remain scarce. Small businesses are struggling to \ngrow, while new businesses are struggling even to get off the ground.\n  More and more today in America, the people who work hard and play by \nthe rules are being forced to subsidize political and economic elites \nwho don't. It is not big business or big special interests who created \nthis toxic environment. All they can do is ask. Only government--big \ngovernment--can rig the system. Only government can carve out a \nregulatory exception for certain big banks while intensifying its \nregulatory squeeze on smaller banks or tweak accounting rules to line \nthe pockets of certain big insurance companies or create new taxpayer \nsubsidies for certain industries and cynically present all of the above \nas unamendable--take it or leave it, take it or shut down the \ngovernment propositions, as this bill does.\n  We wonder why the American people distrust their government, distrust \nthis government. We wonder why the principled grassroots of both \npolitical parties--conservatives and progressives--are up in arms \nagainst their Washington establishments over this bill. The American \npeople do not trust Congress because, as we are proving once again \ntoday, Congress is not trustworthy.\n  Yet as rotten as the CRomnibus before us is, I want to state for the \nrecord that this week leaves me with nothing but optimism about the \nprospects we have for real reform and revival in the coming years.\n  The miserable process we witnessed this week represents the last \ngasping throes of a discredited Washington status quo. Ten years ago \nthis bill would not have been controversial. Five years ago an easy \nmajority would have been purchased with earmarks. This week, with the \nfull weight of both party's leaderships, it barely made it over the \nfinish line. Change comes slowly, as we know, and it comes most slowly \nto those institutions that make the rules, but change is coming. The \nera of passing 1,600-page bills, written in secret, via a process that \nincludes lobbyists but excludes the American people is coming to an \nend. The era of big government rigging the rules for special interests \nwhile leaving everyone else behind is coming to an end. A new era is \ncoming in which Washington will once again be forced to work for the \nAmerican people instead of the other way around. To those Americans who \nhave watched with dismay what Congress did--and did not do--this week, \nwho made their voices heard by flooding both sides of the aisle with \nphone calls and emails, my message is simple. Take heart. It may not \nlook like it today, but you are winning. America is winning.\n  The beltway establishments of both parties are exhausted, out of \nideas, and running out of time. Next year a new unified Congress has an \nopportunity, a real open opportunity, to reshape the national debate, \nto challenge Washington's failing status quo and its failed champion in \nthe Oval Office.\n  We can finally begin the hard, overdue work of rescuing our economy \nfrom the grips of government dysfunction and political privilege, of \nrescuing our health care system from ObamaCare, of reviving our \neducation system and modernizing our transportation system, of ending \nspecial interest manipulation of our tax system and reforming \nregulations to level the playing field for small and new businesses, of \nfixing our broken immigration system.\n  Next year, just next month, we can begin to craft a new reform \nagenda, to increase access to and opportunity within America's middle \nclass, an agenda that grows the economy and increases take-home pay, an \nagenda that restores mobility and opportunity to working families and \ncommunities while putting political and corporate elites back to work \nfor everyone else. We can look to our own House of Congress to reform \nthe way Congress conducts the people's business, the way we budget and \nspend the people's money, so embarrassments such as this CRomnibus \nmight become relics of the past. We can do this. We must do this and we \nwill.\n  For too long the working families of and aspiring to America's middle \nclass have been fighting an all-too-lonely battle to keep up and to get \nahead. For too long, Washington has been an obstacle, even an opponent, \nin that fight. That fight will remain uphill, but the first time in a \nlong time there is hope. There is a real chance that fight may get a \nlittle less steep, and it might get a little less lonely. Help is on \nthe way.\n  I know it is hard to see right now. It is hard to see it in \nWashington, and it must be even harder to see out in the country, but \nchange is coming. A new Congress is on the way, with new ideas and a \nnew renewed reform sense of purpose.\n  Temporary setbacks such as this bill should not discourage us, and \nthey will not deter us, for the only way to keep winning is to keep \nfighting. Washington may still be broken, but America is ready to fix \nit, no matter how long it takes and no matter how much Washington \nresists it. Our opportunity to finally begin that work is almost here. \nWe just need to know where to look for it, for:\n\n     . . . not by eastern windows only\n     When daylight comes, comes in the light;\n     In front the sun climbs slow, how slowly!\n     But westward, look, the land is bright!\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Connecticut. I realize when presiding he cannot respond. But I \njust want to say what a pleasure it is, as a fellow New Englander, to \nserve with him in the Senate. Sometimes you feel like you are on a \ngraveyard shift on a Friday night presiding over the Senate. But I must \ntell him, after decades here, it is extremely important. To have \nsomeone of his integrity, his ability, his competence, and his \nexperience presiding over the Senate should make every Senator, both \nRepublican and Democratic, proud.\n  After late night theatrics in the House yesterday, I hope the Senate \nwill soon vote on the fiscal year 2015 omnibus appropriations bill. I \nsupport this comprehensive spending package.\n  Chairwoman Mikulski has done an outstanding job. She has been a giant \nof the appropriations process. She should be congratulated for her \nperseverance in getting us to this point.\n  I spoke yesterday about the funds included in the bill for the State \nDepartment and foreign operations. I commended members of my staff, \nSenator Graham's staff, and the editorial and printing staff who worked \nso hard on that.\n  We included important funding for the environment, for AIDS \nprevention and treatment, for United Nations peacekeeping, and for \nemergency funding for Ebola. This bill protects U.S. security, \nhumanitarian, and economic interests around the world.\n\n[[Page S6748]]\n\n  But it also funds many of the domestic priorities that face budget \ncuts, that the people of our States depend upon, from law enforcement \nto transportation, health care, and protecting our national parks. This \nCongress and a past Congress, in what I believe was a terrible mistake, \nvoted to spend $1 to $2 trillion for the war in Iraq that we should \nnever have been involved in. As a result, we did not have the funds for \nour police, health care, national parks, or to fix our decaying bridges \nand roads in America.\n  I think most Americans think we should take care of those things. \nThis omnibus spending bill does that. It includes critical investments \nin our rivers and lakes, including an increase in funding for one very \nnear and dear to my heart--Lake Champlain. That is done through the \nEPA's geographic program.\n  Lake Champlain is a great treasure to this country. It is the largest \nbody of fresh water outside of the Great Lakes. It borders Vermont, New \nYork, and Canada in the Province of Quebec. Some parts of it are \nhundreds of feet deep. It is special to me as a Vermonter, and because \nmy wife Marcelle and I first met on the shores of Lake Champlain.\n  I want to thank Senator Jack Reed, the chairman of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies, for \nhis assistance in protecting the funding for all of the geographic \nprograms receiving funding in this bill--not just Lake Champlain but \nall of them.\n  We fund critical investments that address the heroin crisis. Some may \nthink of rural States as being some kind of an enclave that are immune \nfrom what happens in the rest of the country. Well, those of us who \nlive in rural America know differently. The heroin crisis has had a \ndevastating impact on communities in small, rural States like Vermont.\n  It does not make any difference if they are a red State or blue \nState; they have been hurt. With Senator Mikulski's support, I was \npleased to include funding for anti-heroin task forces, to provide \nFederal assistance to law enforcement efforts to investigate and combat \nthe distribution of heroin. Ensuring our local agencies have the tools \nthey need is just one portion of our effort to deal with this crisis.\n  But it is also unacceptable that Americans face a waiting list when \nseeking help to recover from their addictions. This legislation \nprovides crucial funding to expand treatment services for those with \nheroin dependence.\n  The omnibus makes important investments in our students by providing \nfunding to increase access to a college education through the Pell \nGrant Program. It increases funding for the TRIO Program, which helps \nlow-income first-generation students get a college education. They are \nthe future of this country.\n  The bill provides $30.3 billion for the National Institutes of \nHealth--that is a treasure in this country--and funding for the \ndevelopment of a vaccine against Ebola. Can anyone be against that?\n  It raises the cap in the Crime Victims Fund to a historic $2.3 \nbillion. It means more money for victims assistance grants at the State \nand local levels. This is a program I have supported from my early days \nin the Senate. I compliment the Presiding Officer who always also \nvoted, in the Judiciary Committee, to help victims of crimes. Like me, \nhe knows from his own past experience as a prosecutor that we have \nmoney to go after those who break the law, but we also have to help the \npeople who are the victims of crime.\n  The compromise package invests in housing for veterans and seniors. \nIt supports grants to help schools purchase critical equipment for \ntheir school lunch programs. It provides funding for a new food safety \noutreach program, helping the Food and Drug Administration work with \nfarmers and small businesses to understand complex new food safety \nlaws.\n  The bill protects our Nation's forests through a strong investment in \nthe Forest Legacy Program. Coming from a State that values its forests \nI know how important this is. The list goes on.\n  So obviously, as I have praised the chair of the committee, Senator \nMikulski and what she has done, I do intend to support this \nappropriations bill. She knows that I am disappointed with some last-\nminute negotiations that forced the inclusion of several controversial \nriders. It would have been a lot worse if she had not stood her ground. \nThey had nothing to do with funding the operations of the Federal \nGovernment. She knew those provisions forced us into a choice between \nshutting down the government or enacting this omnibus bill.\n\n  There is no doubt Congress has to do something to address vulnerable \npension plans. We all agree on that. The 11th-hour provision that we \nwere forced to accept by the Republicans in the House of \nRepresentatives to reduce hard-earned benefits for retirees is \nshameful. For decades these retirees have worked hard. They have \ncontributed to pension plans. They assumed those benefits would be \nthere when they needed them the most.\n  Now the game is being changed. I cannot help but wonder how the \nRepublicans in the House who are responsible for this provision would \nreact if it affected their pensions?\n  This legislation includes a particularly offensive rider that rolls \nback an important provision of the Dodd-Frank Act that protects \ntaxpayers from another Wall Street bailout.\n  We know that elections have consequences. I worry this is the start \nof a pattern we can expect to see over the next 2 years of protecting \nthe rich on Wall Street at the expense of hard-working Americans on \nMain Street. Frankly, like Senator Mikulski, I stand with the hard-\nworking people on Main Street. They are the people I feel comfortable \nwith. Those are the people I know. When I walk down the streets of \nMontpelier or Burlington or Brattleboro, those are the people who call \nme by my first name. Those are the people paying the bills. Those are \nthe people representing businesses like the one my mother and father \nran, the Leahy Press.\n  I am also dismayed that this spending package includes another body \nblow to what little remains of campaign finance law. By increasing the \namount of money wealthy donors can contribute to political parties, we \nfurther roll back long-held campaign finance limitations that protected \nthe voice of every voter at the ballot box--not just those who paid to \nhave their voices heard.\n  It is unfortunate that pressure groups and special interests \nprevailed in making this happen. It is also unfortunate that when we \nhad a chance in this Senate to do something, to restore part of what \nhas been called McCain-Feingold, after Citizens United, we failed by \none vote. Every Democrat in this Senate voted to restore many of the \nprovisions of McCain-Feingold. Every single Republican voted to gut \nMcCain-Feingold. It was gutted by a one-vote margin.\n  Finally, while I am pleased this omnibus bill will fund most of our \ngovernment through fiscal year 2015, I am disappointed that programs \nand agencies funded through the Department of Homeland Security will \nonly be funded through February 2015. Yet, for months--for nearly 18 \nmonths--House Republican leaders refused to bring to a vote the \nbipartisan Senate-passed immigration reform bill.\n  We had hundreds of hours of markups, hearings, and a debate on this \nfloor. Two-thirds of Senate Republicans and Democrats joined together \nto pass the immigration bill that came out of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. It is political hypocrisy on the other side when they say: \nOh, look what President Obama is doing on immigration. We have to stop \nhim. They had the chance to pass a bill that would have trumped \nwhatever the President might do. They refused to even vote on it \nbecause they were afraid that it would pass.\n  They wanted to talk about it. They wanted to talk about immigration. \nThey want to talk about what they wanted to do, but they never wanted \nto vote one way or the other. We stood up here in the Senate, Democrats \nand Republicans together, and we passed an immigration bill. They \nrefused to even vote on it so they could talk about what is wrong with \nimmigration. It is political hypocrisy at its worst. The bill would \nhave passed, and we would not be where we are today.\n  No bill is perfect, especially one of this size. There are certainly \nprovisions in here that I wish were not, as I have said. But this bill \nmoves us away\n\n[[Page S6749]]\n\nfrom governing by autopilot and takes off the table the threat in 1, 2 \nor 3 months of yet another government shutdown. If we fail to pass this \nbill, under Republican majorities in the House and Senate next year it \nwill only get worse.\n  Senator Mikulski and Chairman Rogers in the House have kept us from a \ngovernment shutdown. It is easy to criticize, but waiting until next \nyear is not an option. This bill provides essential funding for this \ncountry, for programs the American people depend on. And I would say \nfrom a parochial point of view, it will do a great deal to help \nVermont.\n  Any Senator opposing this bill because of the riders it includes \nshould remember that a continuing resolution or omnibus spending bill \nnext year will contain many more, and some far worse.\n  Chairwoman Mikulski has done a heroic job in getting us to this \npoint. I hope we can do as well next year.\n  I know Senator Cochran of Mississippi, one of the closest friends I \nhave had in this body since coming to the Senate, and the incoming \nAppropriations Committee chairman, agrees that we should return to the \nregular order of debating and passing individual appropriations bill.\n  We will be well off with Senator Cochran and Senator Mikulski. These \nare the people who know the difference between rhetoric and reality. \nThey are legislators. They believe in solving problems. The American \npeople do too. They are tired of partisanship, drama, and the harmful \nconsequences of shutting down the government.\n  Is this bill everything I wanted? No. Is it everything the chairwoman \nwould like? No. Is it everything that any one of us would like? No. But \nit is a lot better than shutting down the government, or leaving it to \nthe next Congress. I will support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I note the Senator from Massachusetts wishes to speak \nand I will yield to her.\n  But before the Senator from Vermont leaves, first I thank him for his \nleadership in chairing the Subcommittee on the State Department and \nForeign Operations.\n  What he has done is make sure that we continue to be able to conduct \npublic diplomacy, to ensure money for embassy security.\n  There are many here who pound their chests and call for \ninvestigations, but he actually puts money in the Federal checkbook, \nmeets with the State Department and the embassy security people so that \nif you work for the U.S. Government, and you are in the embassies, at \nleast you will have the security you need.\n  The other is his work on foreign operations, making sure the poor, \ndispossessed, and the marginalized of the world have the assistance of \nthe United States as a partner--whether it is curing malaria, fighting \nAIDS in Africa, fighting Ebola.\n  Also at the same time I remember the great honor and how touched I \nwas to visit Madagascar with him when we looked at the children who \nwere the victims of land mines. This man has done heroic work, not only \nto prevent the ghastly consequences of the land mines, but to make sure \nthat the children who have been injured by this ghastly weapon had the \nmeans to recover their limbs and in that way their livelihood. Really, \nwe owe you a debt of gratitude and it is an honor to serve with you.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank my dear friend from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. I thank the Senator from Maryland and the senior Senator \nof Vermont. They both show extraordinary leadership and we learn from \nthem every day.\n  I am back on the floor to talk about a dangerous provision slapped in \na must-pass spending bill at the last minute solely to benefit Wall \nStreet. This provision would repeal a rule called prohibition against \nFederal Government bailouts of swaps entities.\n  On Wednesday I came to the floor and talked to the Senate Democrats \nto ask them to strip this provision out of the omnibus bill and to \nprotect taxpayers.\n  On Thursday I came to the floor to talk to Republicans. Republicans \nsaid they don't like bailouts either, so I asked them to vote the way \nthey talk. If they don't like bailouts, then they could take out this \nprovision that puts taxpayers right back on the hook for bailing out \nbig banks.\n  Today I come to the floor to talk about not Democrats or Republicans, \nbut to talk about a third group that also wields tremendous power in \nWashington--Citigroup.\n  In recent years many Wall Street institutions have exerted \nextraordinary influence in Washington's corridors of power, but \nCitigroup has risen above the others. Its grip over economic \npolicymaking in the executive branch is unprecedented.\n  Consider just a few examples. Three of the last four Treasury \nSecretaries under Democratic Presidents have had close Citigroup ties. \nThe fourth was offered the CEO position at Citigroup but turned it \ndown.\n  The vice chair of the Federal Reserve system is a Citigroup alum.\n  The Under Secretary for International Affairs at Treasury is a \nCitigroup alum.\n  The U.S. Trade Representative and the person nominated to be his \ndeputy, who is currently an assistant secretary of Treasury, are \nCitigroup alums.\n  A recent chairman of the National Economic Council at the White House \nwas a Citigroup alum.\n  Another recent chairman of the Office of Management and Budget went \nto Citigroup immediately after leaving the White House.\n  And another recent chairman of the Office of Management and Budget is \nalso a Citigroup alum--but I am double-counting because he is now \nSecretary of the Treasury.\n  That is a lot of powerful people all from one bank, but they aren't \nthe only way that Citigroup exercises power. Over the years, the \ncompany has spent millions of dollars on lobbying Congress and funding \nthe political campaigns of its friends in the House and Senate.\n  Citigroup has also spent millions trying to influence the political \nprocess in ways that are far more subtle and hidden from public view. \nLast year, I wrote Citigroup and other big banks asking them to \ndisclose the amount of shareholder money they have been diverting to \nthink tanks to influence public policy.\n  Citigroup's response to my letter? Stonewalling. A year has gone by \nand Citigroup didn't even acknowledge receiving my letter.\n  Citigroup has a lot of money. It spends a lot of money, and it uses \nthat money to grow and consolidate power--and it pays off.\n  Consider a couple of facts.\n  Fact 1: During the financial crisis, when all the support through \nTARP, FDIC, and the Fed is added up, Citi received nearly half a \ntrillion dollars in bank loans. That is half a trillion with a t. That \nis almost $140 billion more than the next biggest bank received.\n  Fact 2: During Dodd-Frank, there was an amendment introduced by my \ncolleagues Senator Brown and Senator Kaufman that would have broken up \nCitigroup and the other largest banks. That amendment had bipartisan \nsupport and it might have passed, but it ran into powerful opposition \nfrom an alliance between Wall Streeters on Wall Street and Wall \nStreeters who held powerful government jobs. They teamed up and they \nblocked the move to break up the banks, and now Citi is larger than \never.\n  The role that senior officials from the Treasury Department played in \nkilling the amendment wasn't subtle. A senior Treasury official \nacknowledged it at the time in a background interview with ``New York'' \nmagazine and said:\n\n       If we'd been for it, it probably would have happened. But \n     we weren't, so it didn't.\n\n  That is power.\n  Democrats don't like Wall Street bailouts. Republicans don't like \nWall Street bailouts. The American people are disgusted by Wall Street \nbailouts. Yet here we are, 5 years after Dodd-Frank, with Congress on \nthe verge of ramming through a provision that would do nothing for the \nmiddle class, do nothing for community banks, do nothing but raise the \nrisk that taxpayers will have to bail out the biggest banks once again.\n  There is a lot of talk lately about how Dodd-Frank isn't perfect. \nThere is\n\n[[Page S6750]]\n\na lot of talk coming from Citigroup about how Dodd-Frank isn't perfect.\n  So let me say this to anyone who is listening at Citi. I agree with \nyou, Dodd-Frank isn't perfect. It should have broken you into pieces.\n  If this Congress is going to open Dodd-Frank in the months ahead, \nthen let's open it to get tougher, not to create more bailout \nopportunities. If we are going to open Dodd-Frank, let's open it up so \nthat once and for all we end too big to fail--and I mean really end it, \nnot just say that we did. Instead of passing laws that create new \nbailout opportunities for too-big-to-fail banks, let's pass Brown-\nKaufman. Let's pass the 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act, a bill I have \nsponsored with John McCain, Angus King, and Maria Cantwell. Let's pass \nsomething, anything, that would help break up these giant banks.\n  A century ago, Teddy Roosevelt was America's trust buster. He went \nafter the giant trusts and monopolies in this country. A lot of people \ntalk about how those trusts deserve to be broken up because they have \ntoo much economic power. But Teddy Roosevelt said we should break them \nup because they had too much political power. Teddy Roosevelt said \nbreak them up because all that concentrated power threatens the very \nfoundations of our democratic system.\n  Now we are watching as Congress passes yet another provision that was \nwritten by lobbyists for the biggest recipient of bailout money in the \nhistory of this country, and it is attached to a bill that needs to \npass or else the entire Federal Government will grind to a halt. Think \nabout that kind of power. If a financial institution has become so big \nand so powerful that it can hold the entire country hostage, that alone \nis reason enough to break them up.\n  Enough is enough. Enough is enough with Wall Street insiders getting \nkey position after key position and the kind of cronyism that we have \nseen in the executive branch.\n  Enough is enough--with Citigroup passing eleventh hour deregulatory \nprovisions that nobody takes ownership over, but everybody will come to \nregret.\n  Enough is enough.\n  Washington already works very well for the billionaires, the big \ncorporations, the lawyers, and the lobbyists, but what about the \nfamilies who lost their homes or their jobs or their retirement savings \nthe last time Citi bet big on derivatives and lost? What about the \nfamilies who are living paycheck to paycheck and saw their tax dollars \ngo to bail out Citi only 6 years ago?\n  We were sent to the Senate to fight for those families. And it is \ntime, it is past time, for Washington to start working for them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I will be supporting their bill. I will gladly support \nthe bill. I am not pleased with every aspect of it, but let me respond \nto my good friend from Massachusetts.\n  You are tired, you are frustrated, you are upset about a provision in \nthe bill that you don't like and think the country is going down the \nwrong road. You have every right to be upset. You have every right to \nvote no and to argue to bring the bill down.\n  Do you know what a lot of people on our side are tired of? The \nPresident changing the law whenever he would like. Taking ObamaCare and \nchanging it unilaterally to fit the political needs of the President \nand his party, by Executive action, turning the ObamaCare statute \nupside down.\n  Do you know what people on my side are tired of? A President who \nfeels like he is more of a King than a President. Unilaterally reaching \nout and conferring legal status on 4 million to 5 million people \nwithout coming to the Congress because he is frustrated.\n  I have been working on immigration since 2006. I will put my \nfrustration up against yours, Mr. President, but democracy is \ndemocracy. You can be frustrated all you like, but there are rules to \nplay by that keep us all safe.\n  So there are people on my side who want me to bring this bill down \nbecause they have had enough. They have had enough of President Obama \ngoing it on his own, taking the laws that we pass, ignoring some, \nrewriting others, and the Executive action is the straw that broke the \ncamel's back. It is one thing to defer prosecution on people in terms \nof your discretion, it is another thing to reach out to 4 to 5 million \npeople and say: You now have a legal status, without going through the \nCongress. That should scare every Democrat, Republican, Libertarian, \nand vegetarian.\n  So people on my side--and we will hear from some of them, saying that \nthis is an outrage and we should shut the government down and defund \nall the parts of the government that would be used to implement this \nillegal executive amnesty. I understand where they are coming from, and \nI understood a year ago when people in my party said ObamaCare is bad \nfor the country, we need to stop it, and I am willing to shut the \nentire government down or at least that part of the government that \ndepends on funding of ObamaCare, because I am upset with this law. I \nhave been on the side of listening to this on my side and understanding \nthe frustrations but always rejecting that temptation because we do \nhave a country to run.\n\n  As much as I am upset about the Executive action, I am not going to \nheed the call of not passing this bill because I am mad because within \nthis bill we have money to fight ISIL, and God knows we need to fight \nthem. In this bill we have money to contain and fight Ebola, and God \nknows we need to do that. In this bill we have infrastructure \nimprovements that God knows are long overdue.\n  So to my good friend from Massachusetts, there is something in here \nyou don't like? Welcome to democracy. You have absolutely the same \nright as people over here on my side to blow up the whole place, but I \nhope most of us will listen to your concerns and not follow your lead.\n  And listen to what the Senator from Massachusetts said when the shoe \nwas on the other foot, when people on my side were willing to take it \nall down because they were mad. I was one of a handful who said no. I \nwould like to repeal and replace ObamaCare, but I don't believe \ndefunding the government is going to make the President repeal his \nsignature issue, and we don't have enough votes to override a veto. It \ntakes a long time to say that, and the people I was responding to were \nmad and emotional because they thought they were wronged. I understood \nthey were mad. I understood they were emotional. But I thought I had a \nduty beyond just worrying about me.\n  If you follow the lead of the Senator from Massachusetts and bring \nthis bill down and do a CR--which is the worst possible way to run the \ngovernment--I will tell you what will come your way. It is what came \nour way. People are not going to believe you are mature enough to run \nthe place. Seventy percent of the Democrats in the House voted against \nthis bill, and three out of four Republicans voted to get it over \nhere--a level of maturity and judgment I haven't seen in my party in \nquite a while. Speaker Boehner and your team: Well done.\n  To the Democrats, I am sure on MSNBC and on the liberal version of \ntalk radio you are a hero and you will have your moment with that \ncrowd. I can promise you this: There are people on our side who are \nhaving their moment on other channels. But almost one-third of the \nDemocratic Party resisted that temptation, and I know how they feel. \nSome of them will get a primary. I had six primary opponents. I am glad \nI did not follow the lead of people who were trying to get me to shut \ndown the government because I felt I was wronged. That is not the way \nto run a country.\n  So here is what the Senator said: For this rightwing minority, \nhostage taking is all they have left--a last gasp for those who can not \ncope with the realities of our democracy. The time has come for those \nlegislators who cannot cope with the reality of our democracy to get \nout of the way.\n  Those were good words then, and you should read them now and apply \nthem to yourself.\n  What you are offering, there are plenty of people on our side who \nwould serve it up too. What you are offering is to take one part of a \ncomplicated bill and try to convince people throughout the country that \nsome horrible wrong is being done and the rest of us who want to get on \nwith governing are the problem.\n\n[[Page S6751]]\n\n  My advice: Don't follow her lead. She is the problem. There are \npeople on my side who are the problem.\n  We will address the Executive amnesty action in a responsible way \nnext year, attack it on every front, but we will not deny our troops \nthe money they need to fight the war to protect us all. We will not \ndeny those who are working to contain Ebola and doing heroic things the \nmoney they need to protect us all. We will not deny the infrastructure \nimprovements that have long been overdue.\n  So to my Democratic colleagues, welcome to my world. It may seem \ntempting to go the road of least resistance, but you will regret it. It \nhurt our party, and it will hurt yours. If you do what is best for the \ncountry, over time it will work out for you.\n  To my colleagues on this side, remember last year? Did we learn \nanything? I hope so. I will make a prediction. To the voices on my side \nthat say ``Burn it down, blow it up, start all over again'' because \nthey are mad at President Obama's Executive amnesty and the voices \ncoming from the Democratic side, mainly through the Senator from \nMassachusetts, saying ``Blow it up because we have done something for \nWall Street we shouldn't have done,'' I think most of us will put this \nin context. Most of us will understand there are things in this bill we \ndon't like, but we do have an overriding duty to our country to govern.\n  I hope that next year we can do our appropriations process in the \nnormal course of business, that we don't find ourselves in these \nmesses. But all I can say about democracy is that it is messy, it is \nemotional, it requires give and take, it requires some people not to \nfollow the hottest person in the room, and there will always be \nsomebody running hot.\n  And something else about democracy: As bad as it is, I can't think of \na better idea. I have seen the other way of doing business in the \nMideast and throughout the world. I certainly don't want any part of \nthat.\n  So tonight, tomorrow, or whenever that day comes--and to my \nDemocratic colleagues who have put this bill together with my \nRepublican colleagues on appropriations, I applaud you. I will vote for \nyour effort and for the product you created, knowing it is not perfect. \nTo the people on my side who want us to tear this down because you are \nmad at President Obama, that is not the way to do business. To the \npeople on the other side who want to have the same result for a \ndifferent reason, don't follow their lead.\n\n\n                     Tributes to Departing Senators\n\n  Mr. President, I will now speak very briefly about my retiring \ncolleagues and then turn it over to the Senator from Florida. I promise \nI will be brief.\n  Everybody will face retirement, voluntarily or involuntarily. There \nwill be a last vote to cast and a last speech to make. Only God knows \nwhen that day comes because we are all just one car wreck away from \nending our careers.\n  To the retiring Members, I have had the pleasure of serving with you, \nand I know you all. You did what you thought was best for our country \nand your State, and what more could anyone ask? My good friend Mark \nPryor, who tried to find common ground at a time when it is hard to \nfind. Mary Landrieu, who is--Mary would drill under the Capitol if she \nthought it would help American energy independence. We have good \nfriends on the other side, and I will miss you, and I wish you well. \nBut I would like very briefly to speak about four.\n\n\n                            Saxby Chambliss\n\n  Saxby Chambliss and Julianne and the Chambliss family have become my \nfamily. If you are lucky in politics, you will make a few friends. I \nhave been very lucky, and I have made lifelong friends with the \nChambliss family, not just Saxby.\n  Saxby represents the best in being a Senator. He looks the part, and \nhe acts the part. And I would say to the people of Georgia that he \nworked very hard on your behalf. He protected our country against \nterrorism. He helped the farmer. He did everything he knew how to do to \nserve the people of Georgia, and I will miss my friend.\n\n\n                              Mike Johanns\n\n  Mike Johanns--he introduced me to Bono. I said: Who is Bono? I don't \nfollow that music that much, but I actually did know Bono.\n  Mike introduced me to Africa. He was the Secretary of Agriculture for \nthe Bush administration, and he had a passion for the developing world, \nparticularly Africa. And through Mike I got to know The One Foundation \nand the Gates Foundation. Through Mike and Stephanie I have been to \nAfrica many times, and you represent the best in our country. You are \nabsolutely wonderful people. You will be missed. And my way to repay \nyou is to stay involved in the developing world.\n\n\n                               Tom Coburn\n\n  To Tom Coburn, when I grow up, I want to be like Tom. I don't see \nthat happening anytime soon, me growing up. Tom Coburn has been at this \nfor 20 years. We came in together. He was one of the first people I met \nin the freshman class of 1995--the 1994 Contract with America class. He \nwas full of ideas and determination from the first day I met him until \nthe very last day he leaves.\n  I cannot tell you, Tom, how proud I am to call you my friend. You and \nCarolyn have become dear friends, and you, my friend, have changed this \nbody for the better. You had an awesome staff, and you will be missed, \nbut what you contributed to the Senate will last long after I am gone, \nand we will all be the better.\n\n\n                               Carl Levin\n\n  The last person is Carl Levin. If I had to describe to somebody from \na foreign country what a good Senator was like, I would pick Carl. Carl \nunderstands the details of the government--very studious. He was the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee and ran it very evenhandedly. \nHe had a disposition that I don't know how he held on to in these \nfractious times, but he was a gentleman.\n  I can promise you, working with Carl Levin, we both resisted the \ntemptation to go down some very dangerous roads on this detainee \ncontentious issue. All I can tell the men and women in uniform and the \npeople of Michigan is that you never had a better friend.\n  To all of you, Godspeed. I wish you nothing but the best.\n  I am fortunate enough to go into my third term. To my colleagues, as \nwe go into the next Congress, let's try to do better. I know we can. \nAnd if we do, all boats will rise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, one of the great things about America is \nthat two Senators with different outlooks, from different States, can \ncome to the same conclusion, as we have on this legislation.\n  What the Senator from South Carolina has just said is not only my \nhope and my prayer, but I hope it will be the hope of the whole of the \nSenate as we embark on the Nation's business next year. And let's see \nif we can get along. Let's see if we can work together in a civil way. \nLet's see if we can find that elusive consensus that has been so \nelusive in the course of these past very contentious and highly \npartisan and highly ideological years. Let's see if we can get it done.\n  There is a lot to be done. I am going to have the privilege of \nserving with the new chairman of the Commerce Committee, John Thune of \nSouth Dakota. I will be the ranking Democrat on that committee. John \nand I have already started having personal and private conversations \nabout working together and getting things done, and I am looking \nforward to it.\n  So in the words of the Senator from South Carolina--of which he is \nvery sincere--I want to echo those words, and I am not only sincere, I \nam very determined. Now, we will see if it works, but this we know: The \npeople of this country want it to work, and they want us to work \ntogether. They are tired of this nonsense they see.\n  So we come here late on a Friday night and we have in front of us our \nresponsibility to spend taxpayer money, hopefully wisely and \nresponsibly. It is one of our chief duties.\n\n  So the appropriations bill is in front of us. I will vote for it. \nThere are a lot of good things in it. Previous speakers have mentioned \nthose things.\n  We have to be prepared to take on the Nation's enemies, those whom we \nidentify and those whom we don't identify. They are all lurking out \nthere in many different ways.\n  We have to help the health of this country by continuing to try to \ngive the appropriate amounts to institutions such as the National \nInstitutes of\n\n[[Page S6752]]\n\nHealth. There was a time a few years ago that they were being cut. That \ndidn't make sense. The head of NIH, Dr. Francis Collins, came to us and \nsaid: I have to stop dead in the tracks 700 research grants going out \nthe door to universities and hospitals across this country, research \ngrants for trying to find cures for diseases.\n  That doesn't make sense. So we are beginning to correct that in this \nbill, and this bill across the spectrum of government will be able to \nfund the needs of government. But we have before us what is nothing \nmore than a blatantly partisan attempt to undermine the legislative \nprocess and ram through a number of provisions that have no business \nbeing in there.\n  We can hear the note of sadness in my voice that in the process of \nmaking legislative sausage, some odiferous ingredients got in the \nsausage because tucked into this spending bill is a provision to once \nagain bail out big banks and undo some of the reforms we made after the \nfinancial crisis of 2008.\n  Have we forgotten that just 6 years ago our economy was on the verge \nof collapse? Do we remember when the Republican Secretary of the \nTreasury got on his knees in front of the congressional leadership and \nbegged them to pass the Troubled Assets Relief Program to try to buoy \nup the financial institutions so that the entire country would not go \ninto a financial death spiral? Have we forgotten the lessons we learned \nfrom that crisis? Have we forgotten what happens when we allow banks to \nmake extremely risky bets and tell them that if they win they can keep \nthe profits, but if they lose the U.S. Government will bail them out?\n  In this case, this bill would undo part of the financial reforms that \nsay the government isn't going to cover or subsidize the banks' so-\ncalled credit default swaps. This is no way to legislate.\n  There is also a provision in here that would let truckdrivers drive \neven longer hours without having to stop to rest overnight. Eliminating \nthis rule--this rule that simply requires truckdrivers to stop for some \nrest once in a while--is a direct threat to public safety. It endangers \nmotorists on America's highways.\n  What we have seen is that what happens when truckdrivers make a \nmistake because of the lack of sleep, that lack of sleep increases \nrisk. We enacted these rest requirements to protect folks, to make \ntraveling on our highways just a bit safer. They are common sense. But \nthis safety provision is reversed in a spending bill, of all places.\n  I intend to raise this issue in the commerce committee next year and \nhope to have the support--and I know I will--of the Senator who is now \npresiding in the Senate.\n  It doesn't stop there. Look what they are trying to do to health \ncare. There is a provision in here that would gut part of the new \nhealth care law that helps to keep insurance premiums stable. Why would \nwe want to make people pay more for health care? Do you want to score \nsome political points with your base? Do you want to do it on the backs \nof millions of hard-working Americans who are already struggling to \nmake ends meet? Well, the American people deserve better. If we want to \nchange policy, let's have an open and honest debate on the issues, not \nsome backroom deals tucked into a spending bill.\n  But we are down to the moment of truth, and it is either this \nspending bill--which in large part is very good. The alternative is \nuncertainty and a stop-start kind of appropriations process that will \ndo no one any good.\n  It is essential for there to be financial fiscal certainty in the \nfunding of the government for the remainder of this fiscal year. So I \nam going to vote for the bill.\n  As I conclude, I, too, want to say a word about the Senators who are \nretiring, and I will make this very short.\n  I am glad the chairman of the Appropriations Committee is coming back \nto the floor, and I will happily yield to her very wise stewardship. \nHaving already spoken about the extraordinary measures, I would just \nmention one thing while she is here. I have told this to her privately.\n  Today I spoke to former Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas. Kay \nBailey and I had the privilege of being in the right place at the right \ntime when this Nation's human space program was at a crossroads. There \nwas no direction. There was uncertainty and debate in the \nadministration as to what direction it would take, and the task fell to \nSenator Hutchison and me to try to give that direction with passage of \nthe NASA Authorization Act of 2010.\n  That act has served as the template for the direction of NASA. It \nneeds to be updated with other authorization bills because that was 4 \nyears ago. Yet there are Senators in this Senate who have prevented us, \nwhen there is no other objection, from getting unanimous consent to \npass the NASA authorization update.\n  But there is a safety valve, and the safety valve is the Senator from \nMaryland and the Senator from Alabama, as they have taken the template \nof the 2010 NASA authorization bill and fleshed it out and put flesh on \nthe bones of the structure each year, including this bill.\n  I will speak at length at another time about our colleagues who are \nall such personal friends of mine who are departing: Senator Hagan; \nSenator Pryor--one of my best friends in the Senate, someone with whom \nI have met in private prayer sessions each week we were in session; \nSenator Begich; Senator Udall; and that mighty fighting force known as \nLandrieu of Louisiana as well.\n  Some of our other retiring Senators I have had the privilege of \nspeaking to at the time they gave their farewell speeches on the floor. \nI look forward to further comments.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to give an update. The leadership \non both sides of the aisle is negotiating the time and method by which \nwe will continue to proceed with this bill, the omnibus spending bill \nfor fiscal year 2015. But what I have been happy about is that people \nhave actually come to the floor to make presentations on the substance \nof the bill, both pro and con and sometimes in the same speech. I think \nthat has been both enlightening and informative. I thank all of my \ncolleagues, including the Presiding Officer, for coming.\n  I would like to make a comment about my Subcommittee on Financial \nServices and General Government. This is a subcommittee that has been \nchaired by the very able Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Tom Udall. He has \ndone an outstanding job.\n  Much is being discussed about Dodd-Frank and Wall Street bailouts. \nAre we throwing our soul into the fires of greed? I can appreciate the \npassion and the concern because I, too, remember, as the Presiding \nOfficer said, that grim day when the leadership in the Bush \nAdministration kept telling us that fundamentally we are OK, \nfundamentally we are OK. Well, there was nothing fundamental about our \nAmerican values being thrown under the bus, and more than that, really \nwe were very concerned that the entire economy of the United States \nAmerica could be at risk.\n  Now, I come from a family who are Roosevelt Democrats. My dear father \nand mother opened a small neighborhood grocery store the year they were \nmarried in Baltimore. That year was 1935. It was the height of the \ndepression, and this young couple--second generation immigrants--opened \na business. Years later when I had the opportunity to have \nconversations with my father about the decisions made, what he did and \nwhy, I said: Dad, why did you open a business in the middle of the \ndepression? We lived in a neighborhood where there were all these \nworking class people, men who--it was at that time primarily men--\nworked at General Motors, worked at Bethlehem Steel, making steel or at \nleast hoping they would have jobs to make steel. The shipyards--we were \na blue-collar manufacturing town, and all those jobs were at risk with \nhigh unemployment and the travesty of the Great Depression.\n  So I said: Dad, why did you do it? How could you have the verve to do \nit? He said: I did it because I believed in\n\n[[Page S6753]]\n\nRoosevelt. I believed Roosevelt was going to lead us forward, and \nRoosevelt was doing things with the banks where if you put a dollar in \nyou could get a dollar back out--the famous FDIC. Roosevelt was leading \nthe way, and I believed in Roosevelt, and Roosevelt believed in me. \nThey believed then that a President believed in them. I went for it.\n  Well, that wonderful grocery store was open to lots of people in good \ntimes and bad. When there were good times, we were there. When there \nwere rough times in the community, my father dealt on credit. When my \nfather passed away from the ravages of Alzheimer's, over 700 people \ncame to his funeral. They all had a story for my two great sisters and \nme.\n  So we are Roosevelt people. We do believe in the public institutions \nand the safeguards that were created so many years ago to protect the \nlittle guy and the little gal against gouging.\n  I believe in this bill. By and large and far from perfect we have \ncontinued to do this.\n  This bill does protect the public and consumers by focusing on five \npriority areas. It protects investors from fraud and manipulation of \nfinancial markets. I will elaborate on that. It safeguards the \nfinancial system from abuse and illegal practices, such as money \nlaundering and deciphering complex Tax Code provisions so taxpayers can \naccurately file returns. It promotes a fair, safe, and robust \nmarketplace by preventing fraud and enforcing against it and other \nunfair business practices. It works with small business by making sure \nthat our agencies that are in charge of enforcing the rules to protect \nagainst abuse are funded.\n  Let's go to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Without \nenforcement, you could have every law on the books, you could have \nevery good intention on the books, you can say that we are going to \nstop it, but unless you fund the Securities and Exchange Commission and \nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and unless you also make sure \nthat the now Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is protected against \nbeing defunded, you don't have a law.\n  So what did we do? We actually worked on a bipartisan basis. It took \na little shove from some of us Democrats, but both sides of the aisle \nwant to look out for the little guy. So, guess what. This legislation \nthat is being so scrutinized needs also to take a look at the fact that \nit includes $1.5 billion so that the Securities and Exchange Commission \ncan actually do its job. This funding level is $150 million more than \nit was in fiscal 2014. This will help protect investors, promote \ncapital formation, and maintain fair, honest, and efficient stocks and \nsecurities. We funded the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n  Then there is the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Farmers and \nbusinesses use the futures market to manage risk as well as pensions \nand endowments. They rely on the CFTC to properly monitor markets to \nguard against fraud, manipulation, and systemic risk. They work to \nbring more transparency and accountability into the futures and into \nthat derivative market that everybody has been talking about for \nseveral days. So I don't want the derivative market to go wild. This is \nnot the wild West. So we made sure we put money in the Federal \ncheckbook so that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the CFTC, \nwould have the money it needs for enforcement. The funding level is \nactually $35 million more than in fiscal year 2014. It is more money \nthan 2014 to make sure the needed staffing and sophisticated \ntechnologies are in place to foster open competitive and financially \nsound futures and the swap markets.\n  A lot has been said about that swap market, right? We are worried \nabout it, too. We are absolutely worried about derivatives. We are \nworried about the exploitation and manipulation of derivatives. But you \ncan have section 716, whatever that number is--and I am not \ntrivializing it; people worked very hard to create that legislation--\nbut unless you fund the enforcement agency, what does it mean?\n  Now, for whatever we did or didn't do, we actually put money in to \nkeep these agencies functioning. I am really proud of that. I am \nabsolutely proud of that.\n  A lot has been said about backroom deals and secret negotiations: Why \ncan't we do this out in the open? Guess what. Every single rider that \nwe faced--98 riders that came over for us to deal with in our \nconference report--all passed the House of Representatives. They all \npassed the House of Representatives. They had mark-ups in full \ncommittee. They had debate on the floor. They passed them.\n  The so-called 716 problem that has everyone concerned--and it has me \nconcerned--passed the House of Representatives. They supported it by \npassing it 292 to 122. There was nothing secret about it when they \npassed it in the House. Seventy Democrats voted for it. It was dumped \nin our lap. It was also dumped in our lap with several other riders in \nthat area, but we had a total of 98. So when people say in middle of \nthe night, every rider that came over that was so controversial had \ncome over from the House--very few came from the Senate, very few--and \nwe had to deal with them.\n  In the financial services subcommittee alone, where Mr. Udall was the \nsubcommittee chairman, we had six of these--six. They were tough. But \nyou know what. We were able to deal with them. There was a whole rider \nto make the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau weaker by taking away \nits mandatory funding. We stopped the weakening of the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau that the wonderful Senator from \nMassachusetts had stood up for. We protected it. We protected the \nagency, and we protected its money.\n  Also there was this whole attempt on a rider from the House to stop \nthe IRS from implementing the Affordable Care Act. We were able to deal \nwith that and eliminate that. Then there was the SEC. There was an \nattempt to make sure that legislation would have affected the investors \nby making sure we prevented the securities exchange with the fiduciary \nstandard of care for brokers. We also prevented the Treasury from a \nrider that would have stopped the Treasury from designating certain \ninsurance companies as too big to fail. So it was not like we were \nasleep at the switch here. It is not like we were all sitting around \nsaying, oh, Wall Street, our dear friends--these were hard fights.\n  So, what did we do? This is the Appropriations Committee. We would \nhave preferred to do an individual bill, open a debate. But guess what. \nIt wasn't meant to be. We had to fund it. We had to deal with all 11 \ncommittees and with Homeland Security on a continuing resolution, and \nwe worked, we debated, we argued, we fought. We won some, and we lost \nsome. One we did lose. This is the subject of great controversy and \ndebate here. But I want everybody to know it was one out of six. It is \na big one, but it is one out of six. And I want everyone to know we \nadded 11 percent more for the Securities and Exchange Commission to do \ntheir job in enforcement. We added 15 percent more to the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission to do their job. Every one of those poison \npill riders to shrink the effectiveness of Dodd-Frank was voted on in \nthe House and came over, just like the controversial one on gutting \nsection 716. I will repeat: That passed the House 292 to 122, with 70 \nDemocrats voting for it. That doesn't make it right. That doesn't make \nit right, but it is not like we invented it. It is not like we brought \nthis up in a secret backroom deal.\n  So I want everybody to know, when they look at what we did in the \nfinancial services, we did what I think my father would have wanted me \nto do: Make sure that these institutions that were created to enforce \nthe law against fraud and gouging investors, taking advantage of the \ntaxpayers--I think we have done our job by making sure they were funded \nadequately to do the enforcement job we asked them to do. Second, out \nof six riders that would have really limited or handicapped the \nenforcement to protect investors or to implement other laws such as the \nAffordable Care Act, we were able to achieve, I think, some significant \nvictories.\n  So, I want the record to show this. Are we a quiet committee? Yes. \nDid we work? Oh, yes, we did work. You know the secret meetings \neverybody likes to talk about over the next several days, do you know \nwhen they occurred? They occurred this summer when we were trying to \nget the bill ready to come to\n\n[[Page S6754]]\n\nthe floor and we were stopped in September, when everybody worked on \nweekends, when we went out at Thanksgiving, when both that Senate \nRepublican staff and the Senate Democratic staff worked through the \nweekend. So while everybody else was having a good time eating pumpkin \npie, they worked all the way up to Thursday night and were back on the \njob Friday so we would not have a government shutdown and so the \ngovernment would not be on autopilot.\n  If you don't like what we did and the way we did it, then let me and \nSenator Cochran--for whom I have so much respect--get back to regular \norder. I need everybody who is cranky about this--and I don't dispute \nthe validity of their concerns because I share them myself, but I have \nwon some, I lost some, but I sure fought for them all--and don't like \nthe process, then why did they stand for this process? I wanted to \nbring up individual bills. The vice chairman--the gentleman from \nAlabama, Senator Shelby--wanted to bring up individual bills. We were \nbringing them up.\n  We held 60 hearings in 60 days on these topics so that we could have \nregular order and the Senate could consider them one at a time. So for \neveryone who is concerned, I am ready for a new process. I have been \ntrying to do this for a couple of years now. Now we will be under \nSenator Cochran's watch, and I will talk more about the process later.\n  I know there are other Senators waiting to talk, but I would like to \nsay a word to Senator Cochran. I have been informed that his beloved \nand dear wife of so many years, Rose, has passed away. I personally \nwant to express my condolences, and I want to do it for several \nreasons: one, just as a Member of the Senate, we should be concerned \nabout one another and what other Members are going through.\n  I also wish to express my gratitude to Rose herself. When I came to \nthe Senate--now many years ago--there were only two women in the \nSenate, Senator Nancy Kassebaum, a wonderful Republican Senator from \nKansas, and myself. When I came, I was welcomed in the Senate. As the \nDemocratic woman, I often said although I was by myself, I was never \nalone. I had Senator Paul Sarbanes, Senator Ted Kennedy, and Senator \nBob Byrd, who helped me learn the ropes of the Appropriations Committee \nthat I now chair.\n  I also had some other special help from the women of the Senate--the \nspouses of the Senate. There were only Senator Nancy and myself in \nthose days, but the spouses of the guys in the Senate really reached \nout to me, and the Southern women were particularly gracious to help me \nlearn the ropes--even learn about the building and how to maneuver here \nin so many ways.\n  Senator Howell Heflin's wife, Mike; Sam Nunn's wife, Colleen; and \nthen there was Rose. She was vivacious, charming, fun, and savvy. We \noften took trips together. Thad and I were on the NATO Committee, and \nit was always Rose who said, come on, Barb, come with us. Not only did \nshe make sure I was included, she made sure that I was welcomed.\n  It was the sense of hospitality that made me think, my gosh, what a \nwonderful institution. We are not Democrats or Republicans, we are \nworking together. The Senators were working together, the spouses were \nwelcoming. It was not so much a club as it was a family. I wish we \ncould get back to that.\n  Rose died from Alzheimer's. I spoke earlier about my father. My \nfather died from Alzheimer's, so I know what Senator Cochran went \nthrough. Even when an illness is so ravaging, so cruel, where you hope \nthat death is either anticipated, or part of your heart even hopes for \nit, when it comes, you just can't believe it.\n  I know he is going through his own grief, but I want him to know that \nin his grief. I not only want to express my condolences, but I want to \nexpress my gratitude to Rose, who made me feel so welcome and made me \nfeel like the Senate was a family. I hope we can get back and honor her \nmemory and act more that way.\n  Mr. President, as chairwoman of the Commerce, Justice, Science, CJS, \nAppropriations Subcommittee to discuss funding in the 2015 omnibus \nbill, I am pleased to have worked with Senator Shelby on this bill. He \nis a true partner.\n  The CJS bill totals $50.1 billion in discretionary spending. That is \n$1.5 billion below the 2014 level of $51.5 billion. Our bill focuses on \ntwo priorities: jobs and the Economy and keeping communities safe. We \nused those priorities to guide all our funding decisions, from Federal \nlaw enforcement to space exploration.\n  The bill provides $8.5 billion for the Department of Commerce, which \nis $286 million more than 2014 level of $8.4 billion. The Commerce \nDepartment keeps America open for business--helping businesses to keep \nthe jobs they have, and helping entire industries to create new jobs. \nThe department works with business to promote business. Protecting \npatents, promoting trade, and providing economic development projects \nin every state.\n  The bill includes strong support for manufacturing. The National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology is funded at $864 million, \ncreating the standards that drive new technologies and new industries \nand make household products safer and more reliable. The Omnibus also \nincludes the ``Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act'', \nwhich creates public-private partnerships that revitalize U.S. \nmanufacturing in areas such as nanotechnology, photonics, \nmicroelectronics.\n  The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is funded at $3.4 billion in \nthis bill, which is $434 million more than last year's level of $3 \nbillion. This funding means the USPTO will hire 1,000 new patent \nexaminers, reducing the patent backlog, resulting in shorter wait times \nfor companies seeking patents and sending new ideas out to markets. \nUSPTO protects American ideas.\n  The Economic Development Administration is funded at $250 million, \nproviding funding for local projects like, water infrastructure for new \nhospitals which support thousands of local workers. Funding for EDA \nalso provides grants for projects, such as those through the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance for Firms, that promote infrastructure and \ninnovation, setting our small businesses up for success. Every $1 \nissued in EDA grants leverages $10 in local investment and creates jobs \nin our home States, not in DC.\n  Commerce Department also promotes American goods and services around \nthe world, supporting more than 11 million jobs in the U.S. I support \nPresident's pivot to Asia, but I believe that if we can put guns in \nSoutheast Asia, we can put Commercial Service Officers there too to \ncreate new markets for American products and create American jobs. So \nthis bill puts more Commercial Service Officers on the front lines \ngetting products from American small businesses into the hands of \nbuyers around the world, including markets like Asia and Africa where \nit's difficult for new companies to do business.\n  Commerce doesn't just promote American business, it also protects \ncommunities. The National Weather Service warns Americans to get out of \nthe way when hurricanes, tornadoes and other severe storms threaten our \ncommunities. Accurate weather information is important to every mom \ntrying to get a kid to school, every school superintendent trying to \ndecide whether to close school, and every state emergency coordinator \ntrying to decide when to deploy snow plows. Deploy too early and \ncommunities waste money. Deploy too late and roads and highways become \ncommuting catastrophes.\n  However, reliable weather data doesn't come from an App. That is why \nour CJS bill includes more than $3 billion for keeping flagship weather \nsatellites on-track and on-budget, and keeps our weather forecasting \noffices fully staffed and ready to make sure it gives citizens the \nweather predictions they need.\n  The Omnibus provides $28 billion for the Justice Department. That is \n$393 million more than 2014 level of $27.7 billion, and $156 million \nmore than the President's request. The Justice Department's mission is \nto keep America safe from crime and terrorism, to protect communities \nand families, and to administer justice fairly. The bill funds key law \nenforcement and prosecution agencies including: FBI; Drug Enforcement \nAdministration; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; \nU.S. Marshals Service and the U.S. Attorneys.\n\n[[Page S6755]]\n\n  We can't have strong, vibrant communities unless they are safe. I \nhave heard from Senators from every state about the rise of heroin. \nHeroin is relatively inexpensive--$10 a hit. It is readily available \nand highly addictive. The Department of Health and Human Services \nreported that heroin use rose 79 percent nationwide between 2007 and \n2012. We need to take action now so the bill funds several programs \nthat tackle the heroin problem.\n  That is why the bill funds a new anti-heroin task forces with $7 \nmillion of grants for State and local law enforcement to investigate \ndistribution of heroin in an effort to keep these drug dealers off of \nour streets. The bill also funds residential drug treatment with $10 \nmillion so that when drug offenders are released from jail, they don't \nrelapse. Finally, the bill provides $11 million for Prescription Drug \nMonitoring that helps States monitor and prevent those who ``doctor \nshop'', getting real time info to police and doctors to prevent \noverdoses and showing where overdoses are occurring so police can see \npatters and stop drug rings.\n  I am proud to include $430 million in this Omnibus for Violence \nAgainst Women Act programs. This is a record funding level for VAWA \ngrants to prevent and prosecute rape, and help women escape their \nabusers.\n  Too many women are being doubly assaulted, first by a predator, then \nby a broken system that fails to test DNA evidence. A Justice \nDepartment investigation found 400,000 rape test kits sitting on \nshelves and in police lockers. This bill tries to break the back of the \nbacklog by funding proven grants to test DNA in crime labs, such as \n$125 million for programs like Debbie Smith DNA Grants, and $41 million \nfor new grants to test rape kit in police storage. These new grants \nwill not only test kits but also reform the system so rape victims \naren't victimized twice.\n  The bill also triples funding for the Crime Victims Fund to $2.36 \nbillion, which will go to help victims of violent crime. This is an \nincrease of $1.5 billion over the fiscal year 2014 level of $745 \nmillion. States can help more victims pay their medical bills and get \ncounseling and legal assistance\n  The Science portion of the CJS bill supports jobs and the economy by \ndriving innovation. The bill provides $25 billion for science agencies: \nNASA and the National Science Foundation. This funding for innovation, \nresearch and discoveries creates American ideas, American products, and \nAmerican jobs in the private sector.\n  The National Science Foundation is funded at $7.3 billion in this \nbill, $172 million more than the 2014 level. NSF will be able to fund \n290 more competitive grants in 2015, supporting 4,100 more technicians, \nscientists, and students. NSF research and education programs provide \nscholarships to the next generation of Cyber warriors, bridge and \nbuilding engineers, and chemistry laboratory technicians. STEM \neducation builds jobs and builds an opportunity ladder for students.\n  NASA is funded at $18 billion. This will provide for a balanced space \nagency with reliable space transportation, cutting-edge aeronautics, \nand strong Space science. This funding directly supports NASA's high \ntech workforce at Goddard Space Flight Center, Wallops Flight Facility \nand other NASA facilities around the country: machinists grinding \nprecision parts for spacecraft exploring the galaxy; computer operators \ncompiling data used to make forecasts or understand the big bang; \nengineers designing rockets that expand our reach to other planets; and \nscientists rewriting the textbooks and inspiring our next generation of \nexplorers.\n  NASA funding also supports NASA's Turbo Contractors who build rockets \nand satellites and design computer systems, providing jobs.\n  The Omnibus is not just a spending bill, it is also a reform bill. \nAppropriators are shrewd stewards of federal funds, getting value for \nevery taxpayer. The CJS Subcommittee puts a premium on oversight, \ninviting Inspectors Genera to testify at every hearing. The CJS bill \nincludes robust funding for IGs who help us root out waste, fraud, \nabuse, and mismanagement. IGs give us good ideas for how to save money \nin areas like addressing growth in the prison population and improving \nmanagement of the Census. CJS has dealt with its share of techno-\nboondogles, such as 2010 Census handhelds, satellite costs, and IT \nsystems that never worked. To prevent techno-boondoggles, the bill \nincludes early warning systems when costs begin to escalate, audits of \ngrants and contracts, specific IG and GAO oversight of costly items \nlike the 2020 Census, weather satellites, the James Webb Space \nTelescope, the patent backlog, and Crime Victim Fund spending.\n  This Omnibus is a good bill, with balanced spending. It protects \ncommunity safety, keeping the thin blue line from getting thinner and \nmaking our weather forecasts better. The bill invests in jobs and the \neconomy, generating new ideas through research and discoveries and \ncreating markets for more American products throughout the world.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the omnibus.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Donnelly). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise to speak tonight in support of the \nomnibus appropriations package that Senator Mikulski, the Chair of our \nAppropriations Committee, has spoken at great length about, and that \nSenator Cochran has also dedicated so much of his time and effort and \nenergy to, and that so many Members of this Chamber have contributed \nto. There are questions on the minds of my constituents from the home \nState of Delaware and questions on the minds of colleagues of mine who \nhave spoken earlier this evening about this very large package--this \n$1.014 trillion spending bill--appropriations package.\n  There have been questions raised about some specific provisions--an \nissue here about pensions, an issue there about Dodd-Frank and swaps, \nan issue about an environmental concern. There are a few issues that \nhave Members--particularly of my caucus--who are very concerned. I have \nmessages coming in to me in my office from social media and email \nsaying: Why on Earth would you support this? My Senator, Chris Coons \nfrom Delaware, why would you support this?\n  We are going into the holiday season and I want us to take a few \nminutes and look at what is actually in this package, to unwrap it a \nlittle bit and to better understand why on Earth I would stand on this \nfloor and speak in favor of this package.\n  You have heard of the hard work of our Appropriations Committee \nChair. What you don't know is the tireless and determined and dedicated \nwork of all of the Appropriations Committee members and staff who, \nacross 12 different subcommittees, held more than 60 different hearings \nto hammer out provision after provision, department after department, \nand it is difficult sometimes to know what that means. Let me put this \nin some context.\n  First, in terms of bad avoided and good invested. In terms of bad \navoided, the version of this that came over from the House--11 full \nappropriations bills out of 12 that had within it all sorts of \nprovisions. We call them riders because they are provisions that ride \non top of the underlying appropriations bill.\n  You have heard about some of these riders that have been defeated and \nbeaten back. It is not one or two or three. They cover all the same \nareas where concerns have been raised by colleagues in my caucus--the \nenvironment, protections for organized labor and labor concerns, \nprotections for the safety of our communities related to firearms, \nprotections for the safety and soundness and transparency of our \nfinancial system through preserving the Dodd-Frank act, preserving a \nwoman's right to choose and protecting the implementation of the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  Dozens and dozens of riders came over in the bill from the House, \nwhich our committee Chair and her dedicated staff worked tirelessly to \nremove from this bill, and you have heard about some of them in the \nspeech just concluded by Chair Mikulski.\n  There was everything from fish and wildlife rules to fiduciary \nrulemaking, from issues around union elections to concerns about the \nstrength and ability of the ATF to keep our community safe, \nstrengthening and supporting the CFPB and SEC and their ability to \nenforce Dodd-Frank or ensuring a woman's right to choose. The actions \nof our committee Chair ensure that these dozens and dozens of bad--from \nour perspective--riders were removed from the bill.\n\n[[Page S6756]]\n\n  Now we stand here on the verge of the end of the authority of the \ngovernment to continue to function, and we have a package in front of \nus, and we have two choices. The choices are simple and clear. If we do \nnot pass this omnibus, we will continue government by crisis, \ngovernment by continuing resolution, government by chip shot down the \nlane, and we will fund the government for a temporary 3-month \nextension, and then this entire package will be put back together, not \nby a Democratic Senate and a Republican House, but by Republicans on \nboth sides of this Capitol. We won't have one or two or three riders \nfrom the perspective of my caucus to be concerned about, we will have \ndozens and dozens. All of this that has been removed and taken out of \nthe package by the hard work of our committee Chair and her staff will \nbe right back in the mix.\n  If we turn away from enacting this package, we will do two things: We \nwill fail to give the certainty and clarity and predictability to our \ngovernment agencies and entities that they will have authorization and \nfunding through next September, and we will face a package toxic--far \nmore difficult for us to accept. It will have dozens and dozens of \nproblems riddled throughout it, and frankly, everyone in my caucus, I \nexpect, will vote against it and perhaps the President will even veto \nit. We cannot let the perfect or the ideal be the enemy of the good.\n  I will take a few minutes and talk about what there is in this \npackage that is good because you only heard speeches tonight that have \nhighlighted concerns and focused in on the three or four provisions \nthat cause great alarm or concern to all of us who are on my side of \nthe aisle. I don't think there has been quite as much exposition as \nthere should be about what there is in this package that I hope to \nunwrap for you that is actually good.\n  Why would I be standing here, as the Senator from Delaware, defending \nthis hard-crafted, hard-wrought, hard-won package if it were not full \nof things that are important for the working families of Delaware, for \nour community and our country, and that didn't advance our core values?\n  Well, I will take a few minutes and touch on a couple of things that \nI think bear your consideration.\n  Infrastructure. The bridges, the roads, the rails, the ports that \nfrom the very founding of our Nation have been the work of the Federal \nGovernment and that are woefully behind to the point where we are not \ncompetitive globally and where we could put people to work right away \nby infusing more responsible investment and upgrading our \ninfrastructure.\n  As far as rebuilding American infrastructure, this package includes \n$54 billion for transportation and housing programs that communities \nand States such as Delaware care deeply about. It is $1.8 billion more \nthan what passed in the House package.\n  This covers things from the TIGER grants program that encourages and \nincentivizes and leverages cutting-edge investments in infrastructure \nto funding for Amtrak. For the east coast of the United States, Amtrak \nis such a vital means of transportation. It also includes funds for \nharbor maintenance and dredging, which are so vital to our maritime \nindustries. This is just one of dozens of areas we could talk about \nthis evening.\n  It will put Americans back to work, it will make our country more \ncompetitive, and it will give us more resources in these areas than we \nwould ever get from renegotiating this package from the ground up.\n  Second, there was an unfortunate story about my hometown of \nWilmington in the past week that drew real alarms about the murder rate \nand violent crime rate. This is a pressing issue in my hometown of \nWilmington. There is real concern because we have a record murder rate \nand a record gun violence rate in my town.\n  This omnibus package includes financial resources that will help \ncommunities large and small all over this country keep themselves safe \nwith these sorts of targeted and wise Federal investments in State and \nlocal law enforcement that we have come to rely on and that we need. \nThere is something called the Byrne Justice Assistance grant. When I \nwas a county executive, my county police department relied on that \ncritical program. There is $2.3 billion, which is $55 million more than \nlast year, for the Byrne Justice Assistance grants and will affect \nStates and localities all over the country.\n  Something that I fought hard for on this floor and I care about--the \nbulletproof vest program that has saved the lives of law enforcement \nofficers in the small towns of Delaware and in our biggest cities. That \ngrant made it possible to fund for state-of-the-art vests that are \ncorrect and appropriate and current and save officers' lives.\n  There is a regional information system called RISK that provides \ncurrent intelligence and data so that law enforcement can be more \neffective regionally.\n  There is the implementation of Violence Against Women Act programs--\nall of these are at least sustained or increased over previous years \nand make the sort of investments that are vital for our communities and \ntheir safety.\n  There is $1.1 billion in this omnibus package to help the ATF, FBI, \nand DOJ fight gun violence, and that matters to my hometown. That \nmatters to the families who wonder whether what we are doing here is \nrelevant to them. To turn back from this omnibus and turn away from \nthose investments in keeping our community safe, I think is unwise.\n  There is more money for criminal enforcement by the ATF to fund straw \ngun purchases and their investigation and their prosecution, to fund \nkeeping guns away from traffickers and criminals, to improve interstate \nbackground checks, to train law enforcement for the responsible \ncarrying out of their public responsibility, to intervene and stop \nactive shooter situations in schools or in public facilities, and, \nlast, the sort of resources we need for the victims of crime.\n\n  There is $2.3 billion in this omnibus for helping the victims of \nviolent crime and their families to get access to badly needed \nservices. I could go on, but in the area of law enforcement and \ncriminal justice, there are investments that matter to me and that \nmatter to my hometown as we work together to fight violent crime.\n  Let me lastly take on two other areas. No. 1, I am on the Foreign \nRelations Committee. I am concerned that if we turn away from this \npackage, the vital investment in our central ally, Israel, and in the \nIron Dome program, which has been shown to keep Israel safe, will not \nbe made; and the multibillion dollar investment in fighting the scourge \nof Ebola in West Africa, at this moment when the tide is turning and we \nhave a chance to heal three nations and contain this plague, which \notherwise may get out, get loose, and become a global pandemic, will \nnot be made. We need to make these investments. To not do so now is to \nput our children's future at risk. Imagine if we could go back in time \nto where HIV/AIDS was just beginning to spread around the globe and for \na modest investment, with an international effort, we could have \ncontained it to just two or three countries, instead of the hundreds--\nthe thousands of communities across dozens of countries that have \nsuffered through HIV/AIDS now for nearly 25 years. If we fail to invest \nin turning the tide in the fight against Ebola now, we put at risk the \nfuture public safety of not just a continent, but the world.\n  We also have to be mindful of what this omnibus makes possible for \nour health and our safety and our future. Entities most Americans don't \nthink about or haven't heard of that perform basic science research or \nadvanced research, from the National Science Foundation to the National \nInstitutes of Health--institutions that are doing cutting-edge, world-\nclass science and developing the cures and the treatments for \neverything from Alzheimer's to cancer--we continue to sustain and \nsupport investment with billions of dollars in these areas in this \nbill. Again, to walk away from this package means to wrap back up and \nput away the potential for enormous progress.\n  There is $172 million more for basic science research programs in \nthis bill over last year. It raises up to $7.3 billion the level of NSF \nfunding. That may sound abstract and disconnected from our lives at \nhome, but in my State of Delaware, that funds education, training, and \nresearch at the University of Delaware, Delaware State University, and \nin public schools\n\n[[Page S6757]]\n\nacross our State. At a time when we need science education and when we \nneed the outcomes, the fruits of our labors and research more than \never, I think that is vital funding.\n  Last, there is an area that I have spoken about on this floor many \ntimes in this Congress and that I am passionate about because it is how \nI came up. I spent years in the manufacturing sector. As a young man \nworking in the private sector for a family manufacturing business, I \nsaw its power to create good, high-wage, high-skill jobs. Manufacturing \nis an area where most of the research and development in this country \nthat is privately funded is done, and manufacturing is an area that \nmany mistakenly think we have lost our edge in and can never regain. \nBut the truth is quite different. Over the last 3 years, we have grown \nmore than 750,000 new manufacturing jobs in this economy, and those are \ngreat jobs--jobs people can raise their families on, jobs that provide \na renewed growth back to the middle class. If we fail to invest in the \nthings that will make manufacturing grow in this country, we miss a \nvital opportunity.\n  There is an entity called the Manufacturing Extension Partnership. In \nthe scope of all of this, it is a tiny little program. But for the \ndozens of small and medium manufacturers in Delaware that I have \nvisited and that the Delaware Manufacturing Extension Partnership has \nhelped, it makes an amazing difference. It helps them understand how to \ncompete internationally. It helps them with upgrading the skills of \ntheir workforce. It helps them with deciding what capital equipment to \nbuy.\n  I have stood on manufacturing floors from Bridgeville to Lewes, from \nDover to Claymont, and heard stories of companies transformed by this \npowerful investment of Federal services--a public-private partnership \nthat really, genuinely makes a difference.\n  Lastly, in this provision of the bill, there isn't just renewed \nfunding for the National Institutes of Standards and Technology, or \nNIST--a provision that includes the Manufacturing Extension Partnership \nand the Advanced Manufacturing Technology Program--there is also \nrenewed opportunity for the funding and sustainment of manufacturing \nhubs, a strategy that our competitor, Germany, has used very well and \nvery wisely to have doubled their GDP in manufacturing--a strategy that \nthis administration has led on and that we hope to emulate, and where I \nthink the investments made in this bill are wise and lay the foundation \nfor middle-class job growth and prosperity.\n  There are a dozen other areas I could speak to this evening, where \nthroughout this bill the investments made have been cut in some areas \nthat needed to be reduced and increased in others that are wise for our \nStates and our communities.\n  Some from my home State, watching the speeches on this floor earlier \nthis evening, have contacted me and said, Why on Earth would you vote \nfor a bill with this or this or this provision that concerns me? It is \na fair question. I hope in these few minutes I have helped my people \nhear that our choice is not between a perfect bill from the perspective \nof Democrats in the Senate or the country and a terrible bill, but a \nchoice between a great bill and no bill at all--a choice between \nreturning to regular order and ending what has been a nearly 4-year \npattern of government by crisis, by short-term extension, by chip shot, \nand by near default, and instead respect and honor the very hard work \nof the dozen subcommittees of this great Appropriations Committee, and \nmove forward a package that strengthens our country, that honors our \nveterans, that invests in our future, that lifts manufacturing, that \nmakes us safer and healthier, and that does the job of bringing America \ninto the future.\n  That is why I will be voting for this package, and that is why I hope \nall of my colleagues will consider doing the same.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will not be voting for the bill.\n  I am frustrated that we have gone through now 8 years of domination \nby the majority leader in the Senate, denying votes on even simple \namendments as part of the entire funding of the discretionary accounts \nof the United States of America. There is over $1 trillion in spending, \nnot one amendment, refusing to bring up the bills individually as they \nshould have been, refusing to pass the bill by September 30 when the \nfiscal year ends, and appropriations should be done before that date to \nfund the next fiscal year.\n  So what do we do? Well, they didn't want to vote because an election \nwas coming up. They didn't want to vote the previous year when an \nelection was coming up, I guess 18 months later, so there is always \nsome excuse. But the fundamental thing that has occurred in this Senate \nis the majority leader, through the device of filling the tree, places \nhimself in control, places himself in a position to block amendments to \nany bill. That is what he has done, to a degree that has never before \nbeen done in the U.S. Senate.\n  Chairman Mikulski says she looks forward to getting on a better path \nnext year under Republican leadership, so we will have a more regular \nprocess. Maybe the Republicans will allow the minority Democratic Party \nnext time to have rights that have been denied us for all of these \nyears. This is a fact. People can spin it any way they want to. I have \nbeen here for 18 years, and I know what is happening. We have \ndemolished the collegiality in the Senate. It has caused the kind of \nfrustration and tension that has resulted in these failures to pass \nbills.\n  So what do they do? They cobble the entire funding of the United \nStates together in one omnibus bill, bring it up at the last minute, \nand say, If you don't agree to vote it out without getting any \namendments, we will accuse you of shutting the government down. We will \naccuse you of shutting the government down. It is all your fault. For \nsome reason, our friends in the media seem to think that is true. And \nif anybody has the gumption to stand up and object to this abusive \nprocess, they are shutting the government down. What planet are we on? \nDon't we know what really has happened?\n  So I have an amendment and I wanted to offer it to this bill. It \nwould simply say that Congress is going to fund the United States \ngovernment; we are going to fund the entire discretionary account in \nthis country, but we are not going to provide money to allow the \nPresident of the United States to execute an unlawful, illegal amnesty. \nHe has already established a building across the river in Crystal City, \nand they have ads out to hire 1,000 people, salaries up to $150,000. \nAnd they are going to process people who are here unlawfully, give them \na photo ID, a Social Security number, and a work authorization, and \nallow them to participate in Social Security and Medicare. They will \nallow them, if their incomes are low--and statistics tell us their \nincomes are lower--they are entitled to child tax credits of $1,000 per \nchild and they are entitled to the earned income tax credit. Combined, \naccording to the recent article by David Frum in ``The Atlantic'', that \nis almost $5,000 if you are a working person with a family of four \nearning up to $40,000 a year--you will be entitled to a direct check. A \ntax credit is not a tax deduction. It is a direct check from the \nTreasury for an average of nearly $5,000. It is a stunning situation \nthat should not be happening.\n  So I just wanted to have an amendment that funds the government, \nallows the country to go forward, but just say to the President: Mr. \nPresident, we don't authorize any funding for this project. It can \neasily be done. It has been done hundreds of times. In fact, that is \nwhy Guantanamo prison in Guantanamo, Cuba, where the terrorists are \nbeing held--that is why it has not been closed, because Congress has \ntold the President, who wants to close it, we are not going to allow \nyou to spend a dime to close that prison. It has been successful. \nBecause Presidents can't spend money not authorized by Congress, not \nappropriated by Congress. He cannot spend that money. It is wrong. It \nis actually a criminal offense to spend money. The Antideficiency Act \nsays that anyone who pretends to represent the U.S. Government and \nspends money not appropriated by the Congress of the United States--not \nauthorized by the Congress to be spent--violates a law, because the \nCongress has the power of the purse.\n  We don't have to fund everything the President asks for. We don't \nhave to\n\n[[Page S6758]]\n\nfund programs we think are bad, that are unworthy of funding. What is \nCongress for? Otherwise, it is a rubberstamp that cannot make an \nindependent judgment. We absolutely have a duty, a responsibility to \nnot fund a program that violates the law, violates the Constitution; to \nallow the President to eviscerate and fail to enforce huge chunks of \nour immigration law and, at the same time, allow him to create an \nentirely new scheme of immigration law.\n  So the President's Executive amnesty say: I am not going to enforce \nthe law with regard to 5 million people. And not only that, the law \nsays if a person is here unlawfully, they can't work; and the law says \nif a person is a businessperson, they can't hire somebody who is here \nunlawfully--I am not going to enforce that, either. In fact, I am going \nto go even further. I am going to get an office in Crystal City and I \nam going to bring in 1,000 people and we are going to give the people \nwho are here unlawfully, as defined by the American people through \ntheir Congress--I am going to give them a certificate, a photo ID that \nsays they are here lawfully. And I am going to say despite the fact \nthat a person is not supposed to work here if they are here unlawfully, \nI am going to give them the right to work. And, by the way, they are \nnot entitled to Social Security or Medicare, and I am going to give \nthat to them, too. By the way, when they filed their tax return using \nthat Social Security number, if their income falls in this range--up to \n$40,000--they can get a tax credit and a child tax credit. And for \npeople making, say--a typical family making $40,000 and with 2 children \nwill not owe any income tax.\n  They are not going to owe any income tax. What they are going to do \nis file their return and wait for their $5,000 check from Uncle Sam. At \nthis time I am on the Budget Committee, ranking Republican, and I can \ntell you: we are going broke. The last thing we need to do is put \nSocial Security and Medicare in a worse condition. The last thing we \nneed the country to do is for our Treasury Department to be sending out \nbillions of dollars in tax credits to people who have come to the \ncountry unlawfully. We have to borrow money. Do we not know?\n  We borrow money every day in huge amounts to keep this government \nafloat, and all this is going to do is add more. I am not happy about \nit. I don't think the American people are happy about it. Poll after \npoll, election after election--in November people said they were going \nto come to Washington and do better. People who have been complicit in \nthis kind of activity are not going to be here next year, many of them.\n  I think Congress needs to listen to the American people. What is \nwrong with what they are telling us? What is wrong with them saying we \nwant a lawful system of immigration? We don't care what Big Business \nwants. We don't care what the special activist groups want. We want a \nlawful system of immigration that is fairly applied and we can be proud \nof and that serves our interests; that helps my child, my husband, and \nme have a job. We would like to see wages rise. We expect the people in \nCongress to look after us, not people who violate our laws.\n  Let me share some further thoughts that I believe are important. A \nlot of people are ignoring this. They don't want to hear about it. They \ndon't believe it. They have taken the view they are going to dismiss \nit. I want my colleagues to be aware of this, and I intend to continue \nto press this issue:\n  The U.S. Department of Commerce informs us that ``today's typical 18- \nto 34-year-old earns about $2,000 less per year, (adjusted for \ninflation), than their counterpart in 1980.''\n  It is a painful and a sharp decline for young Americans.\n  What has happened to the labor markets since 1980? Data from the U.S. \nCensus Bureau offers this insight:\n\n       From 1930 to 1950, the foreign-born population of the \n     United States declined from 14.2 million to 10.3 million . . \n     . [but] Since 1970, the foreign-born population of the United \n     States has increased rapidly due to large-scale immigration.\n\n  Let me just stop here and say America has been generous in this \nimmigration policy. We have the largest number of people entering our \ncountry on a lawful immigrant status than any country in the world by \nfar.\n  What I want us to do is to understand that we need to ask ourselves \nhow many people the United States can absorb without damaging the wages \nand job prospects of unemployed, underemployed Americans.\n  The U.S. Census Bureau statistics report that in 1980, the foreign-\nborn population stood at 14.1 million. But from 1980 through 2013, the \nimmigrant population tripled from 14 million to more than 41 million. \nThe large increase in the size of the immigrant population is the \ndirect product of policies in Washington, creating both an expanded \nlawful system and an expanded unlawful system.\n  Legal immigration during the 1980s averaged around 600,000 people a \nyear. But since 1990 through today, it has averaged about 1 million \nannually--meaning the annual rate almost doubled. The sustained large-\nscale flow of legal immigration--overwhelmingly, this group are lower-\nwage and lower-skilled--has placed a substantial downward pressure on \nwages.\n  I don't think there is any doubt about that. Some try to ignore it \nand talk around it, but I think the facts are clear. We have right now \na very slack labor market with more jobseekers than jobs. The White \nHouse has itself estimated that there are three unemployed Americans \ntoday for each one job opening. We don't have a shortage of workers. We \nhave a shortage of jobs. The Economic Policy Institute estimates that \nin the construction industry there are seven unemployed persons for \neach available job opening.\n  This is huge. Some in the construction industry said they need more \nforeign workers, even as these statistics shows large numbers of \nunemployed American construction workers.\n  This large-scale immigration flow, paired with the forces of \nglobalization and automation and robotics, has made it ever more \ndifficult for American workers to earn a wage that can actually support \na family.\n  Consider this report just published in The New York Times.\n\n       Working, in America, is in decline. The share of prime-age \n     men--those 25 to 54 years old--who are not working has more \n     than tripled since the late 1960s, to 16 percent. More \n     recently, since the turn of the century, the share of women \n     without paying jobs has been rising, too. The United States, \n     which had one of the highest employment rates among developed \n     nations as recently as 2000, has fallen toward the bottom of \n     the list.\n\n  Continuing the quote from the New York Times--\n\n       At the same time, it has become harder for men to find \n     higher-paying jobs. Foreign competition and technological \n     advances have eliminated many of the jobs in which high \n     school graduates . . . once could earn $40 an hour, or more.\n\n  That is what the New York Times is telling us. It is not just a \nrecent development. It is a development of some years. Since the end of \nthe 1960s--the timeframe identified by the article, during this period \nwe have seen this decline in employment--the share of the U.S. \npopulation that is foreign born increased from less than 5 percent to \nmore than 13 percent. As a total number, the size of the foreign-born \npopulation has quadrupled over the last four decades.\n  Due to current Washington policy, these figures are only going to \nrise. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service estimates that the \nforeign-born population could reach as high as 58 million within a \ndecade based on recent trends.\n  Again, let's be frank and talk honestly. Prime Minister David Cameron \nof the United Kingdom recently said it is not wrong to talk about this. \nOur Nation needs to talk about the wages of its people, the financial \nstatus of its people, and it is all right and proper to ask the \nquestion of whether immigration can impact that in an adverse way.\n  I just want to say I am not being anti-immigrant. There are many good \npeople who want to come be a part of America. I am not denying that. \nWhat I am saying is that we are hurting, not helping, those who come to \nAmerica when we bring in more people than there are jobs. We also don't \nhave jobs for those who are American-born. Now we are bringing in \nmillions more. We need to ask ourselves honestly: Is this a good policy \nfor the Republic which we are supposed to serve? Only an adjustment in \npolicy, I suggest, will change this trajectory--just as policy\n\n[[Page S6759]]\n\nhas changed early in the 20th century to allow labor markets to be \ntightened and wages go up. This is an issue that affects all residents, \nour foreign born who are here wanting to work and the U.S. born. Among \nthose most affected by the size of these large immigrant flows are the \nnew immigrants themselves who want to get a good job that pays a good \nsalary.\n  By continuing to admit these large numbers over such a sustained \nperiod of time, many immigrants themselves are unable to find jobs. For \ninstance, less than half of the immigrants who entered California since \n2010 are participating in the labor force. They are not finding jobs. \nThere are not enough jobs for them. Half the entire number of \nimmigrants who entered California since 2010 are not working. In Los \nAngeles, where 4 in 10 residents are immigrants, one-third of those who \nrecently arrived are living in poverty.\n  We have an obligation to those whom we lawfully admit not to create a \ncircumstance where, by admitting continuing to admit many more, we are \ndiminishing their job prospects. A sound immigration policy must serve \nthe needs of people who are lawfully here and who are native-born. That \nhas to be the primary focus of what we are doing. This discussion has \nto be had. We can't ignore this. We can't make like we can absorb an \nunlimited number of workers; we don't have jobs for the workers we \nhave.\n  Immigrants and native-born workers are also competing with a large \nflow of temporary guest workers. Temporary guest workers are brought \ninto the United States from abroad for the explicit purpose of taking a \njob, not on a path to green card and citizenship. They come just to \nwork for a limited period of time. Each year the United States admits \nroughly 700,000 guest workers. They fill jobs that otherwise might go \nto people here. Of those 700,000 guest workers, roughly about 10 \npercent are in agricultural work. A lot of people think the guest \nworkers are working on a farm somewhere. That is not so. Only about 10 \npercent are. Ninety percent take jobs in almost every industry in \nAmerica, from good-paying construction jobs to coveted positions at \ntechnology firms in Silicon Valley.\n  The pressures on the middle-class are great. We have a large flow of \npermanent immigration and temporary workers. The elimination of many \ngood-paying jobs at factories and plants due to advances in robotics, \nthe shedding of manufacturing jobs due to overseas competition, a \nsluggish and overregulated economy that is growing too slow to keep \npace with the population growth and the high costs of energy, health \ncare, income and household goods. Policymakers in Washington need to be \nreducing the burdens on working families, not making their lives more \ndifficult--but that is exactly what we have been doing.\n  Professor George Borjas--an top expert on these matters who has \nworked on them for decades--estimates that high immigration flows from \n1980 to 2000 reduced the wages of lower skilled American workers by 7.4 \npercent--about $260 per month--as a direct result of the size and flow \nof immigration from 1980 to 2000. I don't think it is defensible for \ncolleagues to say it will help wages to bring in more people. That's \nwhy the Congressional Budget office said the Senate immigration bill, \nrejected by the House, would have reduced wages for the next dozen \nyears.\n  Professor Borjas estimates a current net loss of $402 billion for \nAmerican workers who compete with foreign labor.\n  Mr. President, $402 billion. Furthermore, as documented for the \nCenter for Immigration Studies, relying exclusively on government data, \nall net employment gains among the working-age since the year 2000 have \ngone to immigrant workers--net gains.\n  This remarkable trend occurred even as the number of working-age \nnative-born Americans increased by nearly 17 million. So the 17 million \nis a dramatic figure. There is not a decline in native workers, as some \nbusinesses try to say. Oh, we have a demographic decline. We have to \ndeal with it. The figures show we are still growing in the working-\nages, a nearly 17 million increase in the age group since 2000.\n  Here are a few more statistics. There are not temporary trends but \nprolonged trends. Nearly one in four Americans in their prime working \nyears--25 to 54--is not working. This includes 10 million American men \nand 18 million American women.\n  Real, median weekly earnings are lower today than in the year 2000. \nMedian family income is down $4,000 since November of 2007. Our wages \nand earnings for families have declined dramatically--$4,000 is almost \n350 a month.\n  So it is in this context that we must consider the economic fallout \nfrom the President's unconstitutional Executive amnesty.\n  In plain violation of law and the express will of the American \npeople, the President has ordered 5 million work permits to be issued \nto those illegally here. Those illegal workers will now be able to \ncompete for any job in America. They can now compete for jobs with the \npower company, the county commission, city hall, working at \nconstruction companies--good-paying jobs for which they are not now \neligible to compete.\n  The President's order will give illegal immigrants unfettered access \nto compete for any job in America. If they are not hired at city hall \nbecause the mayor thinks he should not hire someone who entered the \ncountry illegally, they can file a lawsuit and demand to be hired. They \nhave been given lawful status ordered by the President of the Unite \nStates, an ID card with a Social Security number and a worker \nauthorization. They will be participating in Social Security and \nMedicare, weakening those programs which are already in deep financial \ntrouble.\n  So this illegal amnesty is part of a broader immigration vision from \nthe President, legislation he endlessly champions, a bill written \nbehind closed doors with billionaire activists and open-borders \nenthusiasts and immigration lobbyists. This legislation surges \nimmigration levels every year. That is his vision.\n  After four decades of record immigration, the President's bill, \nsupported unanimously by Senate Democrats, stopped in the Republican \nHouse, tripled the issuance of permanent residency cards over 10 years. \nIn the next 10 years, had that bill passed, it would have tripled the \nnumber of people given permanent legal status in America.\n  The Center For Immigration Studies explains that this legislation \nwould, in a mere 6 years from today, increase the percentage of the \nU.S. population born abroad to a level never before reached in American \nhistory. And by 2033 nearly one in six residents, under this plan, \nwould be foreign-born. This is a dramatic and historic change in our \nimmigration policy. Unsurprisingly, the nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office projected that the results of such legislation would be \nlower wages, higher unemployment, and reduced per capita GNP.\n  All of this begs a simple question: Who is looking out for Americans? \nWho is looking out for their interests, fighting to help them get a \nbetter job and better pay, or working to help their communities climb \nout of poverty? Who is looking out for their interests?\n  The immigration debate in our Nation's Capital is always centered, it \nseems to me, on the needs of illegal immigrants, foreign workers, or \nlarge employers. Is it not time, after decades of open immigration, \nthat we focus on what we can do to help Americans? Is not time to focus \non how we can grow their wages and improve their job prospects?\n  We have seen declining wages and higher unemployment. Is it not the \nsensible and rational thing to just slow down a little bit, allow wages \nto begin to rise some, assimilation to occur more effectively, and help \nthose who are already here today, including foreign immigrants who have \ncome to America, who are struggling to rise into the middle class? Will \nthis not help them be more successful, more prosperous, and flourish \nbetter in America?\n  The American people have begged and pleaded for a lawful system of \nimmigration that serves the national interest--not special interests. \nBut the politicians have refused, refused, refused. This summer alone \nthe White House met 20 times, it was reported, with business \nexecutives, amnesty lobbyists, and immigration activists to craft their \nexecutive orders legalize people who are here unlawfully. They have \nbeen meeting for years with those\n\n[[Page S6760]]\n\ngroups. They have spent $1.5 billion, according to one independent \ngroup, to promote their rejected amnesty legislation since 2007. But \nyou know who was not invited into that room? You were not invited into \nthat room. You, the American citizen, were not there. Do you not get a \nsay in these secret meetings?\n  We just had a meeting 2 days ago with sheriffs from all over America. \nThey said: Do not allow this unlawful amnesty to occur. They weren't \ninvited to these secret meetings either.\n  So the super-elites in Washington and on Wall Street dream of a world \nwithout borders, a paradise, I guess, where little things like law and \nrules and national boundaries are not a problem. Do not get in the way \nof their wild chimera, their vision.\n  The only challenge these great global citizens face are these pesky \npeople called the voters who cling to the old-fashioned idea of a \nnation as a home and a border as something real and worth protecting. \nThese elites, you see, know better.\n  If you are worried about your jobs or wages; if you are concerned \nthat the pace of immigration into your community is too fast and too \nlarge; if you feel as though your needs are not being considered, well, \nyou are just a nativist, you see. You are selfish.\n  So when an election happens and the people rebel against this open-\nborders agenda, there is really one thing for these wise elites to do: \nThey just impose their own law.\n  How Congress answers this challenge will shape the future of this \nRepublic. Will we defend and protect the people who sent us here, their \nlaws duly passed, their Constitution, and their communities, or do we \nonce again abandon them, give them lip service but no real action? I \npose that question to the body.\n  I suggest there is no purpose to our being here if it is not to serve \nand protect and defend the loyal people who sent us here on their \nbehalf.\n  It is time for us to get busy.\n  I am deeply disappointed that the majority leader is blocking an \namendment that would deal with this matter. In the Senate, a Senator \nfrom any State should be able to have an amendment that deals with the \ncrises of our time. We are being blocked once again. It denies \naccountability. It is wrong. It is improper. The American people are \ntired of it. And those who facilitate this conduct in the future will \nhear that message clearly from the American people.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murphy). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           The American Dream\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to speak on \nthe floor tonight. People watching at home--to the extent there is \nanyone watching at home tonight--but to those who have gathered here \nand are still in the gallery watching the Senate, the Senate is \ndebating a budget. It is a massive budget. It is the largest in the \nworld in terms of any entity--I was about to say any government but of \nany entity on the planet.\n  As of right now, if that budget is not passed I believe by tomorrow \nnight, the Federal Government will not have authority to keep operating \nbeyond the bare minimum. That is what the debate is about that you are \nwatching. We will see what is going to happen over the next few hours \nin terms of ultimately getting a vote and what the leaders of the \nrespective parties have agreed on.\n  But what I wanted to talk about is related to the budget but goes \nmuch deeper than that; that is, the state of America and the state of \nour economy.\n  Last night I had the opportunity to come here and speak a little bit \nabout foreign relations and an international situation we were facing. \nBut I wanted to speak for a moment because that is what the budget is \nabout--it is about our domestic affairs. I think the budget is a \nreflection of that.\n  You have heard a lot of different speeches here tonight--to the \nextent you are watching--about different things that are happening in \nour country. The Senator from Alabama spoke a moment ago about \nimmigration, but in talking about immigration, he talked about the \nconstraints that are upon the middle class. Before that, we have seen \nothers speak about issues. So at the end of the day, as we talk about \nthe budget, increasingly the debate is through the lens of those \nfactors that people are facing in their daily lives throughout this \ncountry.\n  I always tell the story of my parents because, for me, it puts a \ndifferent framework to my vision of this country. My parents were very \npoor. They grew up in another country. My father lost his mother when \nhe was 9 years old. He had to go to work literally the next day. He \nwould work for the next 70 years in Havana, Cuba.\n  My mother was one of seven girls who remembers that she never went \nhungry, but she is pretty sure her parents did so that their children \nwould have enough to eat. She was raised by her father, my grandfather, \nwho was disabled as a young man. He had polio and struggled his whole \nlife to provide for his girls.\n  They came to America in 1956 in search of a better life. They came \nhere with nothing more than the dream of a better life and the hope of \na better life. They did not know anyone. They barely had any money. \nThey barely had any formal education. They arrived in this country in \n1956. They never made a lot of money here. My father ended up settling \ninto a job as a bartender, at a hotel primarily. My mother was a \ncashier. She was a stock clerk at Kmart. She worked as a maid at a \ncasino in Las Vegas. My parents never became rich, but my parents \nachieved the American dream because the American dream is never about \nhow much money you make.\n  The American dream has always been about achieving happiness as you \ndefine it. And while they weren't rich, my parents were able to afford \nand own a home in a safe neighborhood--a neighborhood safe enough that \nthey would allow us, my sister and me, to walk to school when we lived \nin Las Vegas.\n  My parents were able to retire with dignity. My parents--just a \ngeneration removed from poverty and a lack of any formal education--\nlived to see all four of their children go to college and have a life \nmuch better than their own. They fully lived the American dream.\n  It is the American dream that has been possible because this Nation \nwas founded on the powerful idea that all people are created equal and \nthat all people deserve an equal opportunity to achieve happiness as \nthey define it.\n  That American dream isn't just a talking point. It defines us as a \nnation and as a people. It makes us different, special, and, in my \nopinion, better than any other nation that has ever existed.\n  But today something that troubles us is that American dream seems to \nbe eroding in the minds of way too many people, and we understand why. \nThere are people, when they open the newspaper every day and they \nread--today is a perfect example. The Dow Jones closed over 300 points. \nWall Street is setting record profits.\n  They keep reading about how the economy is rebounding and \nunemployment is down, but they don't feel any of this. They are working \nas hard as they ever have, but their paychecks haven't gone up in more \nthan a decade. In the meantime, everything in life costs more.\n  Think about that. You are working hard, making less than ever \nrelative to how much things cost, and you are frustrated to read that \nall these other people seem to be doing so great. Everybody keeps \ntelling you about how the economy is doing fantastically, and meanwhile \nyou are being squeezed in your own life. You can't get a pay raise, \nthere is nothing you can do about it, and everything costs more: your \nrent payment, your health care, your children's education. This squeeze \nis real and the middle class is feeling it.\n  We ask ourselves, but why is this happening? This is not just because \nof a downturn. We had a very serious financial crisis in this country. \nWe had a very serious downturn.\n  But what I describe to you is not just a feature of that, because if \nthis were just a cyclical downturn, it would go up, down, and back up \nagain.\n  We have had a very dramatic change in the structure of our economy. \nOur\n\n[[Page S6761]]\n\npolicies have not reacted to that, have not changed with those \nstructural changes that have happened in our economy.\n  Even in this debate about the budget, you will see evidence of that. \nI didn't come to the floor to be critical of people who worked on it, I \nknow they have worked hard, but our policies do not reflect these \nstructural changes. They are very real.\n  In the 20th century, practically anybody who wanted a job in America \ncould find one. There were plenty of blue-collar jobs for people such \nas my parents and there seemed to be plenty of white-collar jobs for \npeople such as their children. But in the 21st century many of those \njobs are gone. They have been sent overseas or they have been replaced \nbecause of technology or innovation. New jobs have been created, but \nthey require skills that too many of our people still don't have.\n  In the 20th century, ours was a national economy. Your clients and \nyour competitors were halfway across town, maybe halfway across the \ncountry.\n  In the 21st century, we operate in a global economy where your \ncustomers, your clients, your investors, your competitors, and your \npartners are just as likely to be halfway around the world as they are \nhalfway down the street. That has made a dramatic structural change to \nour economy.\n  Last but not least, everything costs more. In the 20th century a \nbartender and a maid could afford to own a home, own a car, take a \nvacation once a year with their kids. If my parents tried to do today \nwhat they did in 1956, they couldn't. Those jobs just don't pay enough \nand all those things I just described cost so much more money.\n  We have to respond to these structural changes. We have to turn the \npage on these old ideas and, quite frankly, on the leaders who have \nthose old ideas. We cannot continue to confront 21st century challenges \nwith 20th century strategies.\n  We need new leaders, and we need new ideas that respond to these deep \nstructural changes. For 4 straight years that I have been talking about \nthis in the Senate, the progress in that regard unfortunately has been \nslower.\n  I didn't come here today to be overly partisan, but I know in 2008 a \nlot of people thought that our current President would be that kind of \nnew leader, but that is not what we have gotten. They thought he would \nbe that kind of new leader because he talked about being a champion for \nthe middle class. He talked about a modern agenda of hope and change.\n  But that is not what we have received. Instead of focusing on working \nfamilies, he focused on things such as the liberal dream of government-\nrun health care.\n  He focused on radical environmental policies instead of focusing on \nthe middle class.\n  Instead of modern ideas, what we got was just old-fashioned big \ngovernment and crony corporatism. A startling example of it is how the \ninsurance companies have gamed ObamaCare.\n  Imagine for a moment if you were in a business and the government \ncame in with a law that said: We are going to make the people buy the \nproduct that you sell. We are going to give them the money to buy the \nproduct that you sell. By the way, if you lose money selling the \nproducts, we are going to bail you out with taxpayer dollars.\n\n  That is what big insurance companies were able to get out of \nObamaCare. People are required to buy insurance, they get a subsidy to \nbuy that insurance, and if they lose that money, they get a bailout \nwith taxpayer dollars. That is outrageous, and it is not surprising \nthat the stock prices of big insurance companies have doubled since \nObamaCare passed.\n  Meanwhile, working Americans are paying more, higher deductibles, \nhigher copayments, higher premiums, and they are getting less coverage. \nThat is an example of corporatism.\n  Despite all this rhetoric that they are fighting on behalf of the \nmiddle class, the past few years have been a bonanza for big business, \na bonanza for people who can hire the lawyers and the lobbyists to \nnavigate the complexities of government.\n  So it is very simple. If you can hire an army of lawyers and \nlobbyists in Washington, DC, you get your priorities and bills like the \none that is before us today, or others, for that matter. But if you are \ntrying to start a business out of the spare bedroom of your home, if \nyou are a small businessperson who works 7 days a week, 16 hours a day \njust to stay afloat, you can't hire the best law firm in Washington, \nDC, to navigate those regulations. And you sure can't afford to hire a \nlobbying firm to come here to write those laws to your advantage.\n  In fact, I would go farther and say that big government is a \ncompetitive advantage for big businesses, because they know that the \nbigger and more complicated the rules are, the harder it is for someone \nnew to come along and compete with them for that same business.\n  We have seen that time and again. I saw it during my time as a State \nofficial, as the speaker of the State house in Florida, and I see it in \nWashington, DC.\n  This is corporatism and both parties are guilty of it.\n  That is why it shouldn't surprise us that under the past 6 years of \nthis presidency, 95 percent of the income gains in this country have \ngone to the top 1 percent of earners and 93 percent of Americans have \nseen virtually no income growth in the past 6 years. Yet we continue to \nsee an effort to push policies from this administration that keeps us \non the same course. Here is the course that we are on--radical \nenvironmental groups are going to get their way, their policies, and \ntheir Executive orders written. Meanwhile, people who work at \nfactories, people who are dependent on energy jobs, they get nothing.\n  Public employee unions that are well represented and spend a lot of \nmoney influencing government, they get all the rules they want from the \nNLRB and the government. They get their help.\n  Do you know who doesn't? The UPS truckers, the plumbers, the \npipefitters, the electricians, and the construction workers. All these \nelites who are going around begging for more government spending, they \nare going to get their way in this bill from this administration--and \nmiddle-class Americans who are working as hard as they ever had, they \nget stuck with the tax bill to pay for it.\n  We can't keep doing this. If we keep doing this, we are going to lose \nthe American dream. We are going to lose what makes us different, and \nwe are going to lose what makes us special.\n  But I believe with all my heart that if we can turn the page on these \npolicies, not only can we save the American dream but we can have \nanother American century. To do that, there are three key things we \nhave to do, and I wish more of this was reflected in the bill before \nus.\n  The first thing we need is we need better jobs. Jobs that don't just \npay more--and that is important, but jobs that provide enough \nflexibility as well so that you do have time if you need to take time \noff to go take your kids to a field trip or a doctor's appointment.\n  Do you know how many Americans out there can't take their kids to a \ndental appointment because that requires them to take 2 hours off of \nwork? Do you know how many Americans don't have the flexibility to be \nable to watch their son or their daughter at the Christmas pageant this \nyear in school because their job doesn't have flexibility?\n  These better jobs that I am talking about are jobs that pay more but \nultimately provide the flexibility so you have the time to be a better \nspouse, a member of your community, and a better parent--and jobs that \nwon't disappear with the next advancement in technology, jobs that give \nyou an opportunity for promotion and upward mobility. These are the \nkinds of jobs we need.\n  In order to have those jobs in America in the 21st century, we need \nto become globally competitive. We are engaged in a global competition \nwith the rest of the world for these jobs. It is the economic olympics \nevery single day.\n  We can win that competition. We can win it if we had a Tax Code that \nno longer made America one of the most expensive places in the world to \ncreate those jobs. We could win it if we reformed our regulatory code \nso that we are no longer such a burdensome place to create those jobs. \nWe could win it if we got our national debt under control, which scares \npeople from creating those jobs here because they believe we\n\n[[Page S6762]]\n\nare headed for a debt crisis in the future.\n  We can win that competition if we fully utilize our energy resources \nin a safe and responsible way. We have already seen the benefits of \nAmerican energy exploration, the jobs it creates, not only in energy \nbut in manufacturing.\n  You have already seen the benefits of American energy production in \nthe falling price of gasoline at the pump, and that has real-world \nimplications. Being from Florida, we expect that many more people are \ngoing to take the drive to Disney World this winter because getting \nthere is a lot cheaper than it was a year ago. Ticket price is another \nmatter, but getting there is a lot cheaper than it was before. This has \nreal implications.\n  The other thing is we can win that competition, but we have to keep \nour edge on innovation. We are the world's greatest innovators. We \ncan't lose that edge. By the way, winning that global competition \nrequires us to be globally engaged.\n  We must remain involved in global affairs. Strong American leadership \non this planet is a factor in allowing the world to have the prosperity \nand the stability it needs for a rising middle class--people who can \nafford to buy the things we sell, the products we offer, the services \nwe offer. We will benefit from that.\n  But creating more of those jobs is not enough. The second thing we \nhave to do is to make sure people have the skills for those new jobs \nbecause these new jobs in the 21st century are going to require a \nhigher level of skill than ever before. The problem is we have an \narchaic 20th century education model.\n  We tell kids in high school that the only way you will ever be \nsuccessful is you all have to get a 4-year degree. There is nothing \nwrong with getting a 4-year degree, but it is wrong to tell children \nand students in this country that is the only way to get ahead when we \nknow in the 21st century there are going to be millions of quality \nmiddle-skilled, quality-paying jobs that require more than high school \nbut less than 4 years of college.\n  We have a system that does nothing, absolutely nothing, about that. \nWe don't offer nearly enough vocational problems in high school.\n  Why have we stigmatized jobs where people work with their hands, when \nwe know that we need airplane mechanics, electricians, plumbers, and \npipefitters? We need high-tech welders and people who know how to do \n21st century welding and machinists for 21st century factories and \nmanufacturing.\n  We can teach these people skills while they are still in high school \nso they can graduate ready to go to work. We also need more \napprenticeship programs, and that is something we can partner with \nlabor unions so we can train and retrain Americans in these higher \nskilled jobs. We also need to help people who have to work full time.\n  Imagine for a moment a single mother raising two kids on her own and \nshe is a receptionist at a law firm. She is never going to get a \nsignificant raise working as a receptionist. The only way she is ever \ngoing to get ahead is if she can become a paralegal. But to become a \nparalegal, she has to go to school. How is she going to go to school \nunder this current system?\n  She wakes up at 6 o'clock in the morning, makes her kids breakfast, \ndrops them off at school, drives to work, works 8 or 9 hours, rushes to \nthe daycare center or the afterschool program before it closes, picks \nthem up and brings them home. She is already tired, but she is not \ndone. She has to make them dinner and make sure they finish their \nhomework.\n  By 11 o'clock she hits that bed and she is exhausted. When is she \ngoing to go to school--4 o'clock in the morning?\n  We need to have an education system that is flexible enough so that \nshe can acquire the skills to become a paralegal while she works full \ntime and she raises that family, allowing her to package learning from \nonline courses and work experience.\n  If someone is a receptionist at a law firm and has worked there for 8 \nor 9 years, there are some skills they have picked up working there \nthat should count for credit hours, instead of forcing you to sit \nthrough a 2-year program so the college they are going to can make the \nmoney off of them. We need to create programs so that people like her \ncan acquire those skills for 21st century jobs.\n  We also need to create alternatives to traditional college. It \ndoesn't matter where you acquire the learning. You should be able to \npackage all of your learning. Take, for example, someone who has worked \n10 years, served in the military, has extensive experience at \nvolunteering, has taken a number of courses at a community college, and \nwants to get a degree in something. We should be able to package all of \nthat lifelong learning, all of those sources of learning, into the \nequivalent of a degree program.\n  Do you know how many Americans out there are sitting on 30 or 40 \ncredit hours from a community college? But having 30 hours of college \ncredit is the same as having zero because you don't get any degree \ncertificate for it. So the private sector looks at you and says: We are \nglad you went to class, but where is your degree or your associate's \ndegree?\n\n  I wish we had a more concerted effort in helping people who are \nhalfway there to get all the way there by using things such as online \ncoursework and giving them credit for life and work experience.\n  We need to think outside the box on these issues because if we don't \nempower people with these skills, they won't be able to take advantage \nof the opportunities of the 21st century. This is what a 21st-century \neducational system looks like.\n  I would make one more point when talking about schools. The most \nimportant school a child will ever attend is their home. We cannot \nignore the fact that the breakdown of American families is having a \ndramatic impact on our economy and the quality of life of our people. \nThere is a reality here about this. A growing number of children are \nborn into single-parent homes or are born into broken families. We have \nto help them because we know that, statistically speaking, children \nbeing raised in broken families and single-parent homes with low \nincomes will struggle to succeed. They will not have an equal \nopportunity unless someone does something to help them out.\n  We can help. We can help by helping their parents acquire the skills \nthey need for better jobs, such as the single mother I talked about \nearlier, but also by giving their parents the opportunity to send them \nto the school of their choice. It is immoral, it is un-American that \nthe only people in this country who cannot choose where their children \ngo to school are poor people. It is outrageous. Rich people can send \ntheir kids to any school they want, and that is their right. The middle \nclass will move to a better neighborhood or struggle to put together \njust enough money to put their kids into a better school. But if you \nare poor and the school in your neighborhood is a dangerous school and \nyou are not learning, there is nothing you can do. That is outrageous. \nThe answer to that is, well, improve that school. I agree. But in the 5 \nyears it takes to improve that school, that child has gone from first \ngrade to sixth grade, and you are never getting those years back. Every \nparent in America--especially low-income parents--deserves the \nopportunity to put their children in the school of their choice.\n  There are other ways we can help families. Primarily that is our \nresponsibility as individuals and communities. But we should have a \npromarriage Tax Code, a promarriage government program. We shouldn't \nhave marriage penalties. We shouldn't tell people ``If you get married \nyour taxes are going to go up'' or ``If you get married you will lose \nMedicare, Medicaid.'' We have to get rid of those things. We have to \nremove those marriage penalties in our Tax Code and in our programs.\n  By the way, we should also protect our faith communities. They are an \nimportant part of instilling values because you can have all the \ndiplomas on the wall you want, but if you don't have the values of hard \nwork and discipline and self-control and respect for others and respect \nfor the dignity of the life of all people, you will struggle to \nsucceed. No one is born with those values; those values have to be \ntaught by strong families in a strong home, and they have to be \nreinforced by strong communities. One of the pillars of a strong \ncommunity is our faith community, whatever faith you choose.\n\n[[Page S6763]]\n\nThat is why protecting religious liberty is so important.\n  Last but not least, restoring the American dream isn't just about \nbetter jobs and better training and better skills; it is also about \ndealing with the cost of living. That is why I think in the coming year \nwe desperately need a profamily Tax Code. Instead of all these \nloopholes that are designed to help big business or the cronies of the \npeople who serve here in Washington, we need a profamily Tax Code. For \nexample, let's increase the child tax credit because it costs money to \nraise children in the 21st century and these working families are \nstruggling to provide for their children. Let's have a profamily Tax \nCode like the one Senator Lee of Utah and I have proposed. Let's \nincrease the child tax credit.\n  We also have to deal with the cost of higher education. It is \ncompletely out of control. Do you know who is getting destroyed by \nthat? The middle class.\n  I had the honor of teaching a course at Florida International \nUniversity. There are many working-class students there. And here is \ntheir frustration, and they are right: Their parents make too much \nmoney for financial aid, but they do not make enough money to be able \nto afford the school. So do you know what they do? They take out loans \nin the tens of thousands of dollars.\n  I know about this firsthand because when I was sworn into the Senate \nhere 4 years ago, I owed over $100,000 in student loans. My parents \ncould never afford to pay for my school. I was blessed to be able to \nreceive Pell grants and other assistance, but I still had to use loans.\n\n  When we first got married, it was our single largest expenditure. I \nused to joke with my wife: You didn't just get married to me; you got \nmarried to Sallie Mae. Every month Sallie sent us a $1,300 or $1,400 \nbill.\n  There are tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of young people \nacross America who are stuck with big loan debt and degrees that don't \nlead to jobs. I hope we will tackle that this year, and there are a \ncouple of proposals that I think will help. The first is we should make \nincome-based repayment the repayment method for everyone unless you opt \nout of it.\n  Second, I think people deserve the right to know before they take out \na loan how much they can expect to make. Before you take out a loan to \npay the tuition of the school, that school should be required to tell \nyou: This is how much people who graduate from our school make when \nthey graduate with this degree. So you can decide whether it is worth \nborrowing $100,000 to be a Greek philosophy major because the market \nfor Greek philosophers is very tight these days.\n  Last but not least, I think we need alternatives to traditional \nstudent loans. One of the things I have proposed is something called \nthe student investment plan, which allows people to invest in your \nfuture. Basically, it is a venture fund in you. Someone will come \nforward and say: We will give you the money to go to college. In \nexchange, you will pay us back 1 or 2 percent of your income for your \nfirst 10 years.\n  They are investing in you. It is a student investment plan. It is not \nfor everyone. It is not a panacea, but it is an alternative to student \nloans.\n  One of the things that would help, by the way, that would be an \nalternative to student loans, is what I mentioned earlier--if you were \nable to package learning and turn self-directed learning into the \nequivalent of a degree.\n  There are other big items contributing to the cost of living. Health \ncare I don't need to tell you about. How many people out there today, \nparticularly in the middle class, are starting to find out they have \nhigher deductibles, higher copayments, higher premiums, and are getting \nless coverage than they used to have. This is not a myth. It is not a \nrumor. This is happening to millions of people. We get the calls, and \nso do you in your office about all these things.\n  One last point on the cost of living is dealing with poverty. Our \nantipoverty programs don't work. There are antipoverty programs in this \nCromnibus--a term, by the way, none of us have ever used before. I \ndon't know who makes these things up. But anyway, there are antipoverty \nprograms in this bill. Our antipoverty programs alleviate poverty, but \nthey don't cure it.\n  Imagine if you broke your arm and you went to the hospital and they \nsaid: Here is a lifetime supply of pain killers. I am not saying you \nshouldn't help people with the pain from the broken arm, but you have \nto fix that broken arm.\n  Our programs don't fix poverty. They do not cure poverty. We need \nprograms that will cure poverty. That is why I believe we need what is \ncalled the flex fund, where we take all of our existing antipoverty \ndollars--I am not saying cut it; I am saying take our existing \nantipoverty dollars and put them in a flex fund and allow States and \nlocal communities to design specific plans that work in their \ncommunities.\n  I can tell you that in the State of Florida, urban poverty and rural \npoverty have different elements to them. A program that might work very \nwell in the inner city of Miami doesn't work at all with the rural \npoverty in South Dade. We should allow States and local communities to \ndesign programs that help cure poverty.\n  The ultimate cure for poverty is a good job. That means everyone who \nis on these assistance programs should either be in school acquiring \nthe skills they need for a better job or they should be working, \nimproving their skills through experience.\n  Let me just say this about that, and I have talked about one of the \naspects of the reforms we want--a wage enhancement. If the only job you \ncan find pays $8 or $9 an hour but you need $15 an hour to provide for \nyourself, I would rather come up with government money and make up the \ndifference through a wage enhancement than give you $9 or $10 an hour \nor the equivalent of $7 or $8 an hour in a welfare check. Because while \nyou are working, you are gaining experience, and we are also helping \nsupplement your paycheck so you can pay your bills.\n  That condition isn't forever. It can't become a way of life. But if \nyou have been unemployed for 5 or 6 years and you show up somewhere to \nget a job and they ask you what you have been doing for the last 6 \nyears and you say you haven't been doing anything, your chances of \ngetting that job have just diminished dramatically. It is not good for \npeople to be unemployed long term in terms of their long-term job \nprospects. That is why I have talked about a wage enhancement program \nas well.\n  I think if we do all these things I have talked about--make ourselves \na globally competitive economy so the jobs are created here, give our \npeople 21st-century skills, help people deal with the cost of living--I \nthink we have every reason in the world to be optimistic about our \nfuture.\n  I will close by saying that I think sometimes we get confused here \nabout how we measure the greatness of our country or the progress we \nare making. We look to facts and figures, such as the unemployment \nrate, and we look at the GDP of the country, and these are important \nfigures. We shouldn't ignore them. But let me tell you how I measure \nthe progress of this country.\n  I mentioned earlier that my father was a bartender. At many of the \nevents I have been involved in through public service over the years, I \ngive a speech somewhere, and there is a bartender standing behind a bar \nin the back of the room. Almost every time I see that, it reminds me of \nmy father, who stood for so many years behind a bar. He was happy for \nthe work he had, but that is not the life he wanted for us. He wanted \nsomething more for us. My father stood behind that bar all those years \nso that one day I could have the chance to stand here on the floor of \nthe United States Senate and talk about things like the American dream. \nThat journey from behind that bar to where I am standing here tonight \nis the American dream. That is the American dream.\n\n  A few years ago someone heard me give that speech in New York City, \nand after I was done speaking the employees there came up to me and \nhanded me this name tag. It said ``Rubio, Banquet Bartender.'' It was \none of the most touching gifts I ever got from anyone, but it was also \na reminder that whether we remain a special nation will be determined \nby whether people today can do what my parents did; by whether people \ntoday can still make that journey my father made from behind that bar \nto where I stand today. Can the single mother provide her children\n\n[[Page S6764]]\n\nthe life she always wanted but never had? Can that worker at that hotel \nopen doors for their children that were closed for him? That is how we \nwill know we are still special. If they can, then this new century is \nalso going to be an American century.\n  We do have real challenges, but we also have real opportunities. And \nthere is no time in history that I would rather be in than right here, \nright now. I believe technology will allow us to collaborate and reach \nmore people than ever before. I believe innovation will solve problems \nwe once thought were insurmountable. I believe a rising global middle \nclass will provide more prosperity to more people everywhere than we \nhave ever seen. That is what I believe the 21st century can be about.\n  I believe you and I live on the eve of another American century. All \nwe have to do now is to reach for it and grab it. All we have to do now \nis do what our parents did for us--whatever it took to leave for their \nchildren a better life and a better future. If we do that, then we will \nleave behind for our children what every generation of Americans before \nus has left behind: the single greatest nation in the history of all \nmankind.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, anyone watching Congress right now would \nhave little reason to think that an historic election occurred only a \nfew weeks ago.\n  Washington, DC, sadly, continues to remain deaf to the American \npeople. Washington, DC, continues to refuse to listen to the American \npeople.\n  Even though millions of voters rose up just 1 month ago to protest \nhow President Obama and the Senate Democrats were running Washington, \nbusiness as usual is continuing inside the marble halls of the \nCongress. What is happening here?\n  Last night we saw chaos in the U.S. House of Representatives as they \nwere there until late in the night, voting on a bill that the vast \nmajority of the Members had never even sat down to read. Yet somehow, \nat the last minute, just in the nick of time, with an arm twisted here \nand a nudge there, it passed the House. Now it is here in the Senate.\n  Before the Senate today is a $1.1 trillion bill full of Christmas \npresents for the lobbyists and special interests here in Washington. I \nknow it is Christmastime, but it is not our job to be playing Santa to \nK Street.\n  This bill is not designed to help working Americans. It is designed \nto pay off all the promises made to lobbyists who funded campaigns over \nthe past year. It is designed to make sure that a whole lot of folks \ncan fly home and ensure that more campaign dollars will be coming in \nthe coming weeks.\n  Before the Senate is a bill that continues to fund the train wreck \nthat is ObamaCare, and does nothing to provide relief to the millions \nof men and women who are hurting, who are suffering, who lost their \njobs, who lost their health care because of this disaster.\n  And before the Senate is a bill that does nothing--absolutely \nnothing--to stop President Obama's illegal and unconstitutional \namnesty. That is why I rise to speak here today.\n  The President's Executive amnesty is lawless and unconstitutional. To \nbe clear, the dispute over Executive amnesty is not a dispute between \nPresident Obama and Republicans in Congress. It is a dispute between \nPresident Obama and the American people.\n  In this last election President Obama said something that was \nabsolutely correct. He said his policies were on the ballot all across \nthis country. The President was right. This election was a referendum \non amnesty.\n  I spent roughly 2 months on the road campaigning for Senate \ncandidates all over the country, one after the other, in race after \nrace. Front and center was: If you elect Republicans, we will stop \nPresident Obama's amnesty.\n  The American people's verdict on that referendum was not ambiguous. \nOver and over again voters in States across this country decided not to \nsend back the incumbent Democrats, but to elect a new Republican.\n  I recall 2 years ago when the Presiding Officer and I were freshmen. \nThere were nine Democratic freshmen that year and just three \nRepublicans. Today there are 12 Republican freshmen--12 new Senators, a \nquarter of the Republican conference--elected as the result of a \nreferendum on amnesty. The people have spoken loudly. Yet, sadly, \nPresident Obama has reacted to the voters in a way that, frankly, is \nunprecedented in American history.\n  Previous Presidents, particularly second-term Presidents, have been \nrepudiated by the voters, and there is a way Presidents typically \nresponded: They react with humility. They react acknowledging the \nAmerican people, trying to course correct. Sadly, President Obama \ndidn't do that.\n  Instead, he came out angry and defiant. He came out and declared to \nthe American people: It doesn't matter, in his view, what the American \npeople say. And it doesn't matter, in his view, what the Congress, \nelected by the American people, says. He is instead going to \nunilaterally decree amnesty for some 5 million people who are here \nillegally.\n  We are going to have a vote in time on this omnibus bill. But \ncritical in that vote should be a vote on President Obama's illegal \namnesty.\n  We should consider the constitutionality of his actions. Every \nSenator in this body should be put on record whether he or she believes \nit is constitutional for a President to disregard--to ignore--Federal \nimmigration laws, and grant blanket amnesty to millions in defiance of \nboth the laws on the books and the voters.\n  This President believes he can unilaterally alter laws he disagrees \nwith. There is a form of governance where one man or one woman can make \nthe laws, can change the laws, can enforce the laws. It is called a \nmonarchy. There are countries on Earth right now that have monarchies \nthat vest the legislative and executive power in one person.\n  I would note Americans historically are not unfamiliar with monarchy. \nWe fought a bloody revolution to free ourselves from a tyrannical \nmonarch. And when our Framers drafted our Constitution, it was \ndesigned, as Thomas Jefferson put it, to serve as chains to bind the \nmischief of government.\n  The danger we are facing here right now is profound insofar as it \nconcerns amnesty, and is even greater as it concerns the checks and \nbalances in our government and the protection of individual liberty. \nBecause a President who can set aside the law, who can pick and choose \nwhich law to follow and which law to ignore, is no longer a President. \nThat should concern all 100 Senators here.\n  If President Obama can decide I don't agree with the immigration \nlaws, so I will not enforce them, I will unilaterally change them--I \npromise you there is going to come another President--another President \nwith different policy views. And the next time it may not be \nimmigration laws that he or she is changing, it may be tax laws or \nenvironmental laws or labor laws.\n  I fervently believe we need tax reform, labor reform, and \nenvironmental reform, but there is a proper way to do it. The proper \nway to do it is this body debating and making legislative changes to \nthe laws, not one President by dicta setting aside the law. A \nPresidential temper tantrum is not an acceptable means of discourse.\n  One of the characteristics of a monarch is he or she need not \ncompromise. The President has justified this illegal amnesty by saying \nhe told Congress what he wanted, and Congress refused to give it to \nhim. Well, the relationship in our constitutional Republic between the \nPresident and the Congress is not the relationship between a parent and \na child. The President does not get to demand of Congress: Here is the \npolicy I want. Either give me what I want, or I will decree it to be so \nand ignore the law. That is the President's bargaining position.\n  The President wants to reform immigration. And let me be clear: We \nneed commonsense immigration reform. I support commonsense immigration \nreform. But the way it works in our constitutional system is if you \nwant to change the laws, you have to work with the other branches. And \nthat means you have to compromise. It means the President doesn't get \neverything he wants. And this is a President who is barely willing even \nto talk to Congress, much less to compromise on anything.\n  As Alexander Hamilton explained in Federalist 69: A monarch decrees, \ndictates, and rules through fiat--which is\n\n[[Page S6765]]\n\nwhat President Obama is attempting to do right now.\n  When the President embraces the tactics of a monarch, it becomes \nincumbent on Congress to wield the constitutional power this body has \nas the elected people's representatives to stop it.\n  The Congress representing the voice of the people who just spoke \nresoundingly in an election should use every constitutional tool \navailable to prevent the President from subverting the rule of law.\n  When the President usurps the legislative powers and defies the \nlimits of his authority, it becomes all the more imperative for \nCongress to act. And Congress should use those powers given to it by \nthe Constitution to counter a lawless executive branch, or this body \nwill lose its authority. If the President will not respect the people, \nCongress must.\n  Second, let me ask a question. Why are we here today in a lameduck? \nWhy is there a session of Congress the second week of December with so \nmany Members voting who the American people just said they no longer \nwant to be represented by? Why are there so many Members getting ready \nto land at cushy law firms and lobby jobs in industry and trade \nassociations? All of our colleagues, a whole bunch of them, we are \ngoing to see them again--except they will have more expensive suits, \nmore finely tailored, and come with an army of lobbyist aides with \nthem.\n  Both the House and the Senate are filled with people who won't be \nhere next year. And that is not of accident, because these bodies are \nvoting to fund a $1 trillion spending bill, and those Members who were \ndefeated or retiring aren't accountable to anybody. They won't have to \nanswer for this.\n  But it is even worse. I mention this omnibus is a payoff to K Street. \nThat is where a lot of these retiring Members are going to go. So what \na perfect way to start your job is to ensure that you come with goodies \nfor the rich and powerful.\n  Look, the American people are disgusted by the way Washington works. \nWashington under the Obama administration takes care of the rich and \npowerful, those who walk the corridors of power, and ordinary working \nmen and women are left in the dark.\n  People who have been hurt the most under the Obama economy have been \nthe most vulnerable among us. They have been young people, they have \nbeen Hispanics, they have been African Americans, they have been single \nmoms. And yet, I am sorry to say, in this current Senate there are very \nfew advocates for the people who are really hurting.\n  Let me give one example. One of the elements of this bill is the so-\ncalled expatriate health insurance plan fix that this omnibus exempts \nfrom ObamaCare.\n  Now what is this about? Well, American insurance companies that sell \ninsurance policies to expatriates--Americans living abroad--are subject \nto all of the oppressive mandates of ObamaCare. All of the mandated \ncoverage mandating things--like maternity care for women who are no \nlonger in childbearing years--all sorts of mandates that drive up the \ncosts. And they are also subject to the crushing impunity taxes.\n  So what has happened? Insurance companies have come to Congress and \nsaid: It is not fair. It is hurting our business, it is hurting our \njobs. It is amazing. Get enough lobbyists together, and suddenly you \nget bipartisan agreement.\n  This provision has Republicans and Democrats together saying we \nshould carve a special exemption for the big insurance companies.\n  There are a lot of things about this body that they don't teach in \ncivics class. There are a lot of things in this body that would horrify \nthe typical junior high or high school student learning about how \ngovernment operates.\n  One of them is something called the hotline. An awful lot of \nlegislation gets passed on the hotline. That is, someone introduces \nlegislation, sends around an email and says, unless you object, this \nwill be treated as automatically passed. All sorts of items get done on \nthe hotline without this body ever debating it, ever considering \namendments, ever taking it to the floor.\n  Well, this ex-patriot insurance amendment was hotlined. Senators, \nboth Democrats and Republicans, want to shoot it through in the lame \nduck in the quiet of night. Now listen, I think there are some good \narguments on its merits for this ex-patriot bill. It is not \nunreasonable to recognize that ObamaCare is costing jobs, and it is \nhurting. But I will tell you the way a hotline works is any single \nSenator can object. So I objected. Let me tell you why. I said listen, \nthis may make sense, but we shouldn't do it with no amendments, no \ndebate, in the dark of the night. We should do this on the floor of the \nSenate, with a debate and with amendments. In particular, I want to \ntake the opportunity to ask my friends and colleagues who are \nDemocrats, who are supporting this exemption, if you think these \nprovisions of ObamaCare are so onerous, so damaging, are killing so \nmany jobs, why won't you provide an exemption for the people that live \nin your State? If it is right that these are harmful, why discriminate \nagainst the people living in your State? I want to take it up on the \nfloor in a context where you could offer amendments to say, listen, it \nis all fine to take care of the big insurance companies, but how about \nsomebody stand up for single moms--single moms who are in vast numbers \nbeing forced into part-time work, forced to work 28, 29 hours a week \nbecause in ObamaCare the threshold that kicks in is 30 hours a week? \nHow about somebody stand up for the average working men and women.\n  But I will tell you what. The single moms, the African-American \nteenagers, the legal immigrants--they don't have fancy lobbyists. There \nis no provision in the past several months that I have been more \nheavily lobbied over than this ex-patriot bill. I had an insurance \ncompany CEO on the phone with me. I had Senators on the phone and \nlobbyists on the phone all saying, look, take care of this provision. I \nresponded very reasonably. I said look, we could take it up in just a \ncouple of weeks. In January, with a new Congress, we could take this \nup, we can debate it, we can consider it. But if we are going to be \nmaking exemptions for ObamaCare, how about if we not start with the \nrichest and most powerful corporations? How about instead we start with \nworking men and women, put working men and women first because they are \nthe ones paying the biggest price. Yet I am sorry to tell you this is a \ngreat illustration of how Washington works. When it couldn't get \nhotlined in its own bill, what happened? It magically appeared on the \nomnibus, tacked on at the last minute because they knew it would go \njust right through Congress in the dark of night--how profoundly \ncorrupt.\n  Listen, if you are a Fortune 100 company, you should feel thrilled \nbecause you can marshal armies of lobbyists to get special carve-outs \nfor you. But if you are a steelworker out of work, if you are a single \nmom, if you are a Hispanic teenager trying to get her first job to \nstart climbing the economic ladder and moving towards the American \ndream, you know what; you don't have a high-paid lobbyist, and \nunfortunately, this Senate is not listening to you.\n  We need to change that. We need to change that. Another provision of \nthis omnibus is a special carve-out for Blue Cross Blue Shield. Blue \nCross Blue Shield is a very fine company. Blue Cross Blue Shield spent \nmore than $15 million on lobbyists this year. Now it is all fine and \ndandy that Blue Cross Blue Shield gets a carve-out. What about working \nmen and women? Under the Harry Reid Senate, do you know how many bills \nwe have debated on the floor to provide meaningful relief to the \nmillions of Americans who have lost their jobs, lost their health care, \nhave been forced into part-time work, who face skyrocketing insurance \npremiums and lost their doctors? Zero, not a single one, because \nworking men and women don't have $15 million to hire fancy lobbyists. \nAnd the corrupt culture of Washington listens to the lobbyists and not \nthe people.\n  Let me be clear on this. This is a bipartisan bill. Harry Reid, the \nDemocratic Senate, has shut this institution down and has ceased \nworking for working Americans. But Republicans share in that sin, share \nin that embrace of corporate welfare. Enough with the corporate \nwelfare. God bless big companies that provide jobs. We don't need to be \nproviding corporate welfare. How\n\n[[Page S6766]]\n\nabout instead we have fundamental economic reform that brings back \ngrowth, that helps small companies start and grow and create jobs. How \nabout we stop playing favorites and picking winners and losers, and \ninstead how about Washington listening to the American people?\n\n  Another provision in this bill--another bit of corporate welfare--is \nBrand USA, a travel promotion company. That is one of the current \nmajority leader's pet projects because it helps promote casinos in his \nhome State. Last I checked, casinos were very profitable endeavors that \ndidn't need the taxpayers helping them out, didn't need the Congress \nserving your hard-earned dollars and handing it out to promote casinos.\n  Another example is the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. It is \nalso reauthorized in this bill. Most people haven't heard about it, but \nlet me tell you what it does. Over the past few years, OPIC has \napproved a $20 million loan to help luxury cars be built in Eastern \nEurope. Coincidentally, the man who owns the company is a donor to \nPresident Obama and Vice-President Biden. OPIC has also backed hundreds \nof millions of dollars for solar farms in South Africa. It has also \nhelped finance the Ritz Carlton in Istanbul. It has backed $150 million \nin insurance for Citibank to open branches in Pakistan, Jordan, and \nEgypt. How is it that one of the largest banks in the world cannot get \nits own insurance? Why should taxpayers take on that risk? They \nshouldn't.\n  Also spread throughout this bill are all kinds of provisions \nmandating what kind of vehicles the U.S. Government may buy for use, \nlimits on how much the car can weigh, rules on how it must be powered, \nwhere the corporation is based and put together. They all together work \nto give U.S. corporations that produce expensive electric cars an \nadvantage. Instead of saving the taxpayer money, this bill is pushing \nthe government to purchase Chevy Volts and Teslas, instead of other \nmore affordable cars.\n  Yet another problem in the lameduck was seen in a bill we considered \nearlier today, the National Defense Authorization Act. The NDAA had a \nlot of good provisions in it. I serve on the Armed Services Committee. \nI introduced amendments that were accepted and included in the bill, \nincluding one that is near and dear to my heart, a provision that \nfinally, finally, finally, allows the 14 innocent souls who were \nmurdered by Nidal Hassan of Fort Hood to be eligible for the Purple \nHeart. It has been far too long that this administration has declared \nthat terrorist attack to be workplace violence. That was a good \nprovision. There are other good provisions in that bill. Yet in the \nlast minute, a giant chunk of legislation got added to the Defense \nauthorization that had nothing to do with defense. Instead it was a \ngiant land grab. Once again it was bipartisan--Democrats and \nRepublicans coming together and saying, let's have the Federal \nGovernment seize a bunch of land. So the Defense authorization bill \nadded 250,000 acres of new wilderness designation.\n  The Defense authorization bill resulted in 400,000 acres being \nwithdrawn from productive use. It added three new wild and scenic river \ndesignations, three new studies for additional designations. Some of \nthese provisions may have been sound on their own, but there was a \nreason they weren't brought up on their own. There is a reason they \nweren't debated on the floor of the Senate--because they couldn't \nwithstand the scrutiny. So instead, the way corrupt Washington works, \nthey were stuck on to a Defense authorization that was deemed must-\npass, and suddenly the Federal Government takes roughly one-half \nmillion acres of land out of productive use, out of use by the \ncitizenry.\n  You know that is disrespectful to the men and women in the military. \nIt is a disservice. We shouldn't be using the Defense authorization as \na tool for congressional pork.\n  I will make an additional point about President Obama's amnesty. In \nall likelihood, in a matter of hours or a matter of days, the Senate is \ngoing to pass this massive pork-filled mess of a bill, a $1 trillion-\nplus amnesty that is paying off lobbyists throughout this land.\n  Yet leadership from both parties--Republican leadership in both the \nHouse and Senate have promised this bill is designed for Congress to \nstand up to President Obama's illegal amnesty. They have said \nrepeatedly that in just a few weeks help is on the way. In just a few \nweeks Republicans will be the majority in this body and in just a few \nweeks we will have a new majority leader.\n  The new majority leader, my friend the senior Senator from Kentucky \nhas said:\n\n       If President Obama acts in defiance of the people and \n     imposes his will on the country, Congress will act. We're \n     considering a variety of options. But make no mistake. When \n     the newly elected representatives of the American people take \n     their seats, they will act.\n\n  I take the soon-to-be majority leader at his word.\n  The Speaker of the House has said: ``Come January, we'll have a \nRepublican House and a Republican Senate, and we'll be in a stronger \nposition to take action.'' The Speaker went on to say that the current \nplan is ``the most practical way to fight the President's action.''\n  Again, I take him at his word. When the Republican leaders promise \nthis bill is all designed so that come January and February--just a few \nweeks from now--we will see both Houses stand together and make clear \nthat when the continuing resolution expires for the Department of \nHomeland Security, this body will not appropriate money to DHS to carry \nout President Obama's illegal and unconstitutional executive action, I \ntake them at their word, because the alternative would be that elected \nleaders are saying something to the American people they don't believe \nand they don't intend to follow through with. And I very much hope that \nis not the case.\n  Indeed, I am reminded of Reagan's famous admonition: Trust but \nverify.\n  So I take them at their word, but I would note that a whole lot of \ncitizens across this country feel a little bit like Charlie Brown with \nLucy and the football. Where in fight after fight, leadership in \nCongress says: We will fight next time. Not this time--no, no, no--the \nwise thing to do is fight in a month, fight in 2 months, fight in 3 \nmonths--not now. It always seems to be when the month or 2 months or 3 \nmonths happens, the same statement is made: No, no, no--not January, \nmaybe March. No, no, no--not that. How about June? No, no, no. How \nabout September?\n  There has been a time when Charlie Brown has kicked the football and \nfallen on his rear end one too many times. So when our leaders in both \nChambers say as a commitment, we will fight, and we will stop President \nObama's illegal amnesty, I take them at their word. But I am confident \nthat the American people will hold them to their word. The American \npeople may not be quite so trusting, as am I, because they have seen \nfar too many Members of Congress say one thing and do another.\n  We will learn soon enough if those statements are genuine and \nsincere. We will learn in just a few weeks if leadership intends to \nfollow through on the promises they have made over and over again.\n  I would note that over the course of this election, Republican \nMembers of the House, Republican Members of the Senate campaigned all \nover this country and they said two things repeatedly. They said No. 1, \nif you elect us we are going to do everything humanly possible to stop \nthe train wreck that is ObamaCare, and they said, No. 2, if you elect \nus, if you give us a Republican majority in the Senate, we will stop \nPresident Obama's illegal action.\n  All over the country, that is what Republican candidates said, and it \nis the reason they told the American people to elect a Republican \nmajority.\n  My admonition to my friends--especially to the newly elected \nRepublicans--is very simple: Do what you said. Simply do what you said.\n  Virtually every Republican on this side of the Chamber told the men \nand women in his or her State: If you elect us, we will stop President \nObama's amnesty.\n  We must do what we said because it is profoundly unfair. This amnesty \nis unfair to millions of legal immigrants who followed the rules and \nwaited years in line yet see those who came illegally being rewarded \nnonetheless by the Obama administration. This Executive amnesty is \nprofoundly unfair to\n\n[[Page S6767]]\n\nthe 92 million Americans who are not working right now and to all the \nworking men and women struggling to just put food on the table to feed \ntheir kids. This Executive amnesty is profoundly unfair, especially to \nthe African-American community, which is facing historic unemployment.\n  If Congress acquiesces and does not stand up and assert the \nprerogative of this institution to legislate, to pass laws, and prevent \nthe President from ignoring the laws on the books, then we will have \nceded our authority not just on immigration but across the field.\n  It is incumbent on all of us to defend the Constitution, and it is my \nhope that the Senators who take an oath to uphold the Constitution will \nhonor that oath more than party allegiances.\n  I will note that in recent weeks no fewer than a dozen Democratic \nSenators have publicly criticized President Obama's illegal Executive \namnesty. I welcome that criticism. It is nice to see that sort of \ncandor coming from Democratic Senators, but, as my wife is fond of \ntelling me, talk is cheap. If those dozen Democratic Senators who \ncriticized President Obama's Executive amnesty as illegal and \nunconstitutional mean what they say, then the only responsible action \nis to use our legislative authority to stop it.\n  I hope my Democratic colleagues will put partisan politics aside--\neven those who may agree with President Obama's amnesty--and say that \nthe way to change the immigration laws is to work with Congress and \ncompromise. You may not get everything you want, but we have a system \nof checks and balances.\n  It is striking--in many ways the simplest and best explanation of \nwhat the President has done came from ``Saturday Night Live.'' The week \nafter the President's illegal amnesty, ``Saturday Night Live'' reprised \nthe classic ``Schoolhouse Rock--How a Bill Becomes a Law.'' They had a \ngiant dancing, singing bill come out and say: ``First I go to the \nHouse, then I go to the Senate, and if I'm lucky, the President will \nsign me and I become a law.'' Then on ``Saturday Night Live,'' \nPresident Obama walked out onto the steps of the Capitol and pushed the \nbill down the steps of the Capitol. He pushed the bill down the steps \nof the Capitol four separate times, and then out walked an Executive \norder smoking a cigarette, as it so happens, and it simply said: ``I'm \nan Executive order. I pretty much just happen.''\n  Do you know what? ``Saturday Night Live'' is exactly right. The \nPresident is ignoring the basic checks and balances of our Constitution \nand trying instead to decree the law. That is unconstitutional, and a \nportion of this bill that has been sent over from the House of \nRepresentatives funds the Department of Homeland Security to carry out \nthat unconstitutional action.\n  Therefore, Madam President, I am now offering and raising a \nconstitutional point of order against division L of this bill on the \ngrounds that it violates the following provisions of the Constitution: \nthe separation of powers embodied in the vesting clauses of Article I, \nSection 1 and Article II, Section 1; the enumerated powers of Congress \nstated in Article I, Section 8; and the requirement that the President \ntake care that the laws be faithfully executed, as stated in Article \nII, Section 3.\n  It is incumbent on this body to resolve those constitutional \nquestions and to honor and protect the constitutional authority of the \nUnited States Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). Is the Senator raising the point \nof order at this time?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At this time, a motion to refer is pending \nbarring other actions on the measure.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate everyone's patience. You have all been \nwaiting.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 5 p.m., Monday, December 15, the \nSenate proceed to vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to \nconcur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 83; that \nif cloture is invoked, there be 30 minutes postcloture debate time \nremaining on the motion to concur.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, reserving the right to object. The American \npeople have grave concerns with the President's decision to take action \nunilaterally with regard to Executive amnesty. This is an action that \nis rather unprecedented and rather unsupported by law, notwithstanding \nthe President's insistence to the contrary. It is an issue that is of \nconcern to a great many people.\n  Right now we are being asked to punt all of our activity until Monday \nat 5 p.m. I don't see any reason to do this. I don't see any reason why \nthe Senate should suspend its operations while the American people are \nwaiting for us to act. I don't see any reason why we should wait until \nMonday at 5 p.m. I certainly don't see any reason why we should agree \nto move forward then and not have any assurance that we would at least \nhave an opportunity to vote on an amendment that would impose a \nspending limitation on the President's ability to implement his \nExecutive amnesty action.\n  I would respectfully request that the majority leader modify his \nrequest and that he modify his request to assure us that we would \nreceive a vote on a spending limitation amendment that we could have in \nconnection with the CR/omnibus when we reconvene.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I am unable to do that.\n  Mr. LEE. In that case, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/12/senate-section/article/S6767-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          FOIA IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am deeply disappointed that last night \nthe House failed to pass the FOIA Improvement Act. This bipartisan bill \nwas reported unanimously by the Senate Judiciary Committee last month, \nand it was the product of months of hard work by Senator Cornyn and me. \nOur bill is supported by more than 70 public interest groups that \nadvocate for government transparency, and it passed out of the Senate \nunanimously. I would think that Members of the House Republican \nleadership, who have spent so much time on oversight of the Obama \nadministration, would support the goal of making government more \naccountable and transparent, but instead of supporting this bill, they \nhave chosen secrecy over sunlight.\n  The FOIA Improvement Act would codify what the President laid out in \nhis historic Executive order in 2009 by requiring Federal agencies to \nadopt a ``presumption of openness'' when considering the release of \ngovernment information under FOIA. This bill would require agencies to \nfind a foreseeable harm if they want to withhold information from the \npublic. Prioritizing the people's interest in what their government is \ndoing, our bill will reduce the overuse of exemptions to withhold \ninformation. Federal agencies have been required to apply this standard \nsince 2009. They also used this same standard during President \nClinton's terms in office. It was only during President George W. \nBush's term of secrecy that this standard was rolled back. It appears \nthe House leadership wants to return to that era. It should not matter \nwho is in the White House, information about what their government is \ndoing belongs to the people.\n  In a political climate as divided as this, I had hoped that we could \ncome together in favor of something as fundamental to our democracy as \nthe public's right to know, that government transparency and openness \nwould not just be the standard applied to the Obama administration but \nwhat is applied to every future administration. The FOIA Improvement \nAct would have done just that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/12/senate-section/article/S6767-2", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6767-S6768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS TO ADDRESS CYBER BULLYING\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I want to take a moment to share with the \nSenate one successful story coming out of Vermont.\n\n[[Page S6768]]\n\n  In this digital age, our children have the opportunity to \ncommunicate, to collaborate, and to connect at all times over their \ncell phones, tablets, social media pages and blogs. But with this \nlimitless connectivity also comes a responsibility to make use of these \ntechnologies maturely and respectfully. In Vermont, students and their \nschool community have boldly fought back against cyber bullying. I want \nto praise their efforts and call the Senate's attention to their \nachievement.\n  Cyber bullying has become one of the most troubling threats to the \nsafety and security of our children in this time of unprecedented \ndigital access. Last week, students at Rutland High School were \ntargeted online, as negative posts on an anonymous school news app were \ndiscovered. Together, students and school leaders gathered to address \nthis negativity and to recommit themselves to building a more positive \nschool environment. These students organized a ``Positive Post-It'' \nevent to change the climate and then called on one another to delete \nthe application.\n  Rutland High students went further still and banded together to issue \na petition to persuade Apple to take down the app so that other \nstudents would not be victimized by anonymous posts. After the \ngathering, Rutland High School principal Bill Olsen said on Monday \n``kids left school on that day feeling very good about how they could \nhelp each other overcome such adversity.'' Governor Peter Shumlin has \nalso touted their accomplishment.\n  According to the 2013 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey, more \nthan 15 percent of high school students were electronically bullied in \nthe past year. Rutland High School has gained international attention, \nas a wonderful example of how students have acted bravely to stand up \nagainst this trend and to hold one another accountable for a safe \nschool space. Other States are following this trend as well. In \nMichigan, school leaders have also recently spoken out against the use \nof apps that promote anonymous, negative online behavior. The petition \nto remove the app has been successful, and Apple has since removed it \nfrom its online store.\n  The leadership that these students have displayed is admirable, \nheroic, and an example to others. In recognition of their efforts, I \nask unanimous consent to have an article from The Rutland Herald \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Rutland Herald, Dec. 6, 2014]\n\n                 RHS Rallies Against Controversial App\n\n                          (By Erin Mansfield)\n\n       Students and faculty at Rutland High School organized this \n     week against a controversial iPhone app they say is being \n     used to bully students via their cellphones.\n       Principal Bill Olsen said Friday he found out about the \n     After School app Wednesday morning, when many students ended \n     up crying in their guidance counselors' offices because of \n     the things other students wrote about them on the Internet.\n       An app, short for application, is a computer program often \n     used on smartphones and mobile devices that can access the \n     Internet. After School, according to the iTunes Store, works \n     as a virtual bulletin board for posting ``funny, anonymous \n     school news for confessions and compliments.''\n       But Olsen said most of the things being posted are harming \n     students' self-esteem at school, so the administration \n     immediately sent out a letter to parents and began asking \n     student leaders to speak out against the app.\n       Catherine DiPalma, a senior, said anyone can download the \n     app for free through iTunes. Students log in using a Facebook \n     account, confirm the school they attend, and begin posting \n     anonymously.\n       A cheerleader, DiPalma said she and about 25 other students \n     involved in clubs or sports teams went on the school's video \n     announcements Thursday morning to ask their peers to delete \n     the app from their phones and support the kids who had their \n     feelings hurt.\n       ``Nobody wants to walk down the hall and see their friends \n     crying,'' she said. ``Even if you're not friends with \n     someone, we said `stand up.' ''\n       Olsen and the student leaders then asked kids to respond by \n     writing positive messages on colorful Post-It notes and \n     sticking them on windows in many of the school's hallways.\n       Some of the messages on the windows Friday were directed \n     specifically to cheer up kids who had been criticized on the \n     app, and some were compliments for their favorite teachers. \n     Others told their peers to ``please go gay for me'' and \n     ``nice butt.''\n       ``I thought it was awesome,'' said Logan Boyle, another \n     senior who spoke with the group on the morning announcements.\n       ``I think it's cool that you can walk down the hall and see \n     all the awesome things people say rather than all the nasty \n     things people say,'' she said.\n       ``A lot of us had the app, and we were just reading it,'' \n     she said. ``We told everyone that just by having the app and \n     reading it, you're giving power to the people who are saying \n     the mean things.''\n       Kate Herling, a RHS guidance counselor who advises a \n     student group against cyber bullying, said bringing student \n     leaders into their advocacy was effective.\n       ``Kids were supporting one another,'' Herling said. ``Now \n     we walk down the hall and see people smiling because maybe \n     they found their name.''\n       She said, ``I felt that everyone kind of came together to \n     really stop this and make a positive thing about such a nasty \n     thing that really happened.''\n       Olsen said he and Superintendent Mary Moran have sent out \n     letters to get the state's Agency of Education and the \n     Vermont Superintendents Association to organize around the \n     issue.\n       They said they want local schools to gather together and \n     pressure the app's creator to delete the software, and get \n     Apple to take down the app from the iTunes Store. As of \n     Friday, the store labeled the app for ``frequent/intense \n     mature/suggestive themes,'' and for ages 17 and up.\n       Rebecca Holcombe, the state's secretary of education, said \n     Rutland City Public Schools ``is quite rightly going after \n     it.'' She said the Agency of Education just received the \n     district's letter and will address the concern next week.\n       ``There is free speech,'' Holcombe said. ``There's also \n     bullying, and bullying is not protected speech in school. \n     Parents send us their children as a public trust, and one of \n     those things is protecting them from bullying and \n     harassment.''\n       ``We do honestly find it extremely troubling, and we do \n     think it shows extremely poor judgment on the part of the \n     company,'' she said.\n       A Michigan student's petition against the app says \n     Massachusetts-based Ambient Corporation is the developer of \n     After School. But a company representative said Friday they \n     have nothing to do with the app.\n       The iTunes Store says ONE, Inc. holds the copyright, but \n     that company was unable to be reached for comment.\n       The After School app website says: ``We believe in free \n     speech and the ability for people to express themselves. If \n     you find the majority of the content too offensive, consider \n     using your phone to instead look at cat pictures or browse a \n     less cutting-edge social network like Facebook.''\n       Olsen pointed to news articles from Michigan and Minnesota, \n     where he said schools are warning parents about the effects \n     of the After School app on their children and encouraging \n     them to remove it from their smartphones.\n       ``Apps like this and companies that make them really should \n     be held accountable,'' Olsen said. ``The kids set an example \n     for the adults (on Thursday). We should do the same thing and \n     try to fight this.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/12/senate-section/article/S6768-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6768-S6769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             NET NEUTRALITY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the principle of ``net neutrality'' to \nprotect an open Internet has found its way into the public \nconsciousness like few other regulatory issues that I have seen in my \ntime in the Senate. Over 3.5 million Americans have submitted comments \nto the Federal Communications Commission, FCC, during its consideration \nof replacement net neutrality rules this year. The reason for this \nrecord-setting level of public engagement is simple: The net neutrality \ndebate is fundamentally about how we want the Internet to operate. \nMillions of Americans have made their voices heard because they want an \nopen and free Internet that works for everyone, not simply those with \ndeep pockets. I could not agree more.\n  An Internet that is split into the haves and have-nots is \nunacceptable. That is why the FCC should enact clear and enforceable \nrules to prevent ``paid prioritization'' agreements that would allow \nsome content providers to outbid smaller competitors to gain fast-lane \nservice to customers online. At the same time, the country's leading \nbroadband providers should unequivocally commit that they will not \nengage in this type of detrimental deal. We need meaningful pledges \nfrom our Nation's broadband providers that they share the American \npublic's commitment to an Internet that remains open and equally \naccessible to all.\n  In October, I wrote to the major Internet service providers, ISPs--\nComcast, Time Warner Cable, Charter, Verizon, and AT them to \nmake exactly that commitment. They all maintained that they do not \ncurrently plan to engage in paid prioritization--an assertion I \nwelcome. What they did not do was answer my call for a firm commitment \nthat they will never engage in that behavior in\n\n[[Page S6769]]\n\nthe absence of clear rules prohibiting such deals.\n  This is disappointing. As Comcast noted in its letter, voluntary \ncommitments from individual companies would not serve as a substitute \nfor rules applicable to all broadband providers. Such pledges would, \nhowever, send a strong signal to the American people that broadband \nproviders share their commitment to an open and equal Internet. It is \nunfortunate that these companies were unwilling to make that \ncommitment--presumably because they know that if fast lanes are allowed \nin the future, market forces may drive them and other ISPs to consider \nsuch deals to maximize profits at the expense of competition online. \nThis ``race to the bottom'' scenario is exactly why we need clear rules \nin place prohibiting such agreements. I appreciate that Comcast went \nfurther than the other ISPs by expressing support for my legislation \nwith Representative Doris Matsui of California, which would require the \nFCC to ban paid prioritization agreements so that all ISPs are subject \nto such a rule.\n  The concern over a pay-to-play Internet that advantages the largest \ncorporations over smaller players is very real. I was disappointed that \nsome Internet service providers in their responses brushed aside these \nconcerns dismissively. It is not ``demagoguery,'' as Verizon suggested \nin its response, when small business owners like Cabot Orton of the \nVermont Country Store say that they simply want to see an Internet that \ncontinues to treat all businesses equally. It is not a ``phantasm'' \nwhen independent content creators like actress Ruth Livier acknowledge \nthat they would not have been able to start their Web sites if they had \nto pay for priority access to reach viewers online or compete against \nplayers who did. These are real concerns, shared by millions of \nAmericans. Their voices should not be casually and callously dismissed \nbecause they cannot afford to pay lobbyists to advocate on their behalf \nat the FCC.\n  The FCC is continuing its important work to craft new open Internet \nrules. For months, I have been clear that I will not support any rules \nthat do not ban Internet fast lanes. I have spent much of this year \nlistening to Vermonters and others to hear firsthand about how a pay-\nto-play world would harm the Internet ecosystem.\n  The responses to my letter highlight one element that unites all of \nthose involved in the net neutrality debate--the need for certainty. \nBroadband providers understandably want to know the rules by which \ntheir actions will be governed, and consumers want certainty that their \nInternet service will continue to provide them unfettered access to \nlawful content online. Recently, some broadband providers like AT \nhave threatened to stop investing in further innovation and deployment \nof broadband in the name of uncertainty. Of course, they could decide \nto provide certainty on issues like paid prioritization at any time \nregardless of the FCC's actions by making the pledge to consumers I \nhave called on them to make.\n  I will continue my call for broadband providers to listen to their \ncustomers and pledge to never engage in paid prioritization. While they \ndid not do so in response to my letters, it is never too late for them \nto make that commitment to the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/12/senate-section/article/S6769-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JIM FRANSEN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, there is no shortage of attorneys here in \nWashington, DC, but some of the most talented lawyers work in the \nOffice of Legislative Counsel here in the Senate. Drafting legislation \nis often a complicated exercise. It takes years under the mentorship \nand tutelage of others to grasp the difficult process of drafting \ncomplicated bills. At the end of this Congress, after nearly 40 years \nof service, legislative counsel Jim Fransen will retire. His family's \ngain will be the Senate's loss.\n  Jim first joined the Office of Legislative Counsel in 1975--the same \nyear Vermonters elected me to the Senate. He served as an assistant \ncounsel and a senior counsel, rising to become the finance and tax team \nleader. For the last 15 years, he has served as legislative counsel. He \nis the second longest serving legislative counsel, and his career has \nseen many accomplishments.\n  Jim has been one of the key drafters of Federal tax legislation since \njoining the office in 1975. He has had a hand in drafting such \nmonumental bills as the Tax Reform Acts of 1976 and 1986, the Economic \nRecovery Act of 1981, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and the \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. He helped to draft the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997 and the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and he \nwas a key drafter of the most sweeping health reform legislation in \ngenerations, the Affordable Care Act.\n  Through Republican and Democratic administrations, Republican and \nDemocratic Senate majorities, Jim has been a true public servant. I \nknow in his retirement, he will enjoy spending time with his family: \nhis wife Margaret, his three daughters and his two grandsons. Wherever \nhis retirement travels may take him, Marcelle and I wish him the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/12/senate-section/article/S6769-2", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BRIAN SEARLES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, one of Vermont's most dedicated public \nemployees, Brian Searles, is retiring after 45 years of service to both \nState and local government. As a police chief, city manager, airport \ndirector, and two tenures as the Vermont secretary of transportation, \nBrian is a model of commitment both to his work and to his State.\n  For the past 4 years Brian and his team at the Vermont Agency of \nTransportation have overseen vast improvements in the State's \ninfrastructure. In 2008 nearly 20 percent of Vermont's bridges were \nstructurally deficient. By 2013 that number was reduced to just 8 \npercent. Additionally, in 2008, 36 percent of Vermont's pavement was \nrated in ``very poor'' condition, but through his work and the support \nof Governor Shumlin, Brian and his team were able to improve that \nnumber to 21 percent. Brian has also remained committed to supporting \nVermont's rail infrastructure, spending the time necessary to apply for \nand win Federal grants. This necessary funding allowed Vermont to \nrealize the final stages of completing the Western Rail Corridor \nproject designed to connect Rutland to Burlington, as well as upgrade \ntrack to complete high speed rail service between Saint Albans and \nMontreal. The success of these projects could not have happened without \nBrian's leadership.\n  Brian and I have tackled many projects together, always working to \naccomplish big goals for Vermont's transportation and infrastructure \nneeds. In August of 2011, Tropical Storm Irene hit the State, wiping \nout 500 miles of roadway and forcing 33 bridges to close in Vermont's \nworst natural disaster in recent history. Brian helped to bring our \nrural devastation to a national stage by testifying before the Senate's \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works and then led his team to \nsuccessful rebuilding efforts. For this, Vermonters will always be \ngrateful.\n  About a year ago, Brian approached Governor Shumlin with a \nresignation letter in his pocket. Looking at the wealth of knowledge \nand historic improvements in the agency's work during Brian's tenure, \nthe Governor prevailed upon him to remain at the helm until the end of \nthe Governor's second term. Brian accepted the call, finished the year, \nand is now leaving the Vermont Agency of Transportation as a well-\nrespected arm of Vermont's State government.\n  Marcelle and I join all Vermonters in thanking Brian for his years of \nservice to the State and wish him and his family the very best as they \nbegin a new chapter of their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/12/senate-section/article/S6769-3", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6769-S6770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING MARY POWELL\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, Vermont is a national leader in \nsustainable energy. Green Mountain Power, with its CEO and President \nMary Powell at the helm, is the perfect example of the progress our \nState has made and should serve as an example for the rest of the \nNation.\n  Mary was recently named the 2014 Power-Gen Woman of the Year. Mary is \na leader and trailblazer in the power industry. She took the reins of \nGreen Mountain Power, GMP, in 2008 and has transformed it into \nVermont's ``energy company of the future.'' Mary is truly committed to \nthe idea that energy can spur socioeconomic change for\n\n[[Page S6770]]\n\nVermonters and strives to help people save money and move toward more \nrenewable sources. Under her leadership, GMP has launched successful \ninitiatives to improve the company's quality of service, through \nproviding low carbon, low cost, and reliable power to Vermonters.\n  Recently, Mary led Green Mountain Power in becoming the first utility \nin the world to receive B corporation certification. B corporations use \nthe power of business to solve social and environmental problems. Mary \nwants Green Mountain Power to not only be the best utility in the world \nbut the best for the world.\n  Mary is among the very few women who have achieved this level of \nsuccess in the utility industry. I am grateful for the work she has \ndone for the State of Vermont. She is redefining success in the energy \nindustry, and I congratulate her on receiving the 2014 Power-Gen Woman \nof the Year Award.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Burlington Free Press article ``Mary \nPowell Named Woman of the Year'' recognizing Mary for her achievements \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, Dec. 10, 2014]\n\n                  Mary Powell Named Woman of the Year\n\n\n    Power generation industry group cites her advancements, outreach\n\n       The leader of Vermont's largest utility was named woman of \n     the year at her industry's largest trade show this week.\n       Mary Powell, president and CEO of Green Mountain Power in \n     Colchester, was named Power-Gen 2014 Woman of the Year. \n     Powell was selected because of how she has advanced the power \n     generation industry and for her community involvement.\n       Powell received the award at the 2014 Power-Gen Woman of \n     the Year Awards Dinner Monday in Florida as part of Power-Gen \n     International, the largest trade show in the world for the \n     power generation industry. She is scheduled to give the \n     keynote address today during the Women in Power Luncheon.\n       In a statement, Powell called the award an ``incredible \n     honor.''\n       ``Energy can be transformational in moving customers and \n     society to a more secure and environmentally sound future, \n     and we are determined to lead the way,'' Powell said. ``GMP \n     is partnering with customers to accelerate the pace of change \n     as Vermont's energy company of the future.''\n       Jennifer Runyon, chairwoman of the Women in Power \n     Committee, called Powell a ``trailblazer.''\n       ``We hope that our award will inspire young women to not \n     only consider careers in the power industry, but also show \n     them that dedication and hard work can lead to brilliant \n     results,'' Runyon said in a statement.\n       David Crane, president and CEO of NRG, a large utility with \n     headquarters in Princeton, New Jersey, and Houston, said in a \n     statement that Powell ``starts with the heretical notion of \n     giving the modern-day energy consumer what they want--which \n     is affordable, convenient, clean and storm-resistant energy--\n     and then uses her native intelligence, charm and drive to \n     make sure it happens.''\n       GMP said it is collaborating with NRG to make Vermont a \n     ``leader'' in sustainable energy.

Madam President, I rise today to honor the work of my \nfriend George M. Marcus, an accomplished businessman and \nphilanthropist.\n  Born in Euboea, Greece, George Marcus and his family immigrated to \nthe San Francisco Bay area in 1945. George was raised in California and \nattended college at San Francisco State University. After graduating \nwith an economics degree in 1965, George began working in real estate. \nAlways with an emphasis on client satisfaction, analysis, and \nevaluation, he founded Marcus & Millichap Real Estate Investment \nServices in 1971. His business acumen and willingness to innovate have \nspawned a variety of subsidiaries that have expanded his company to \ninclude 35 states.\n  George's successes are not limited to the real estate industry. A \nnoted entrepreneur, Mr. Marcus has been called ``a modern day Midas \nwith an uncanny ability to create successful companies'' by one news \noutlet. Indeed, his ventures range from SummerHill Homes, a bay area \nhomebuilder, to a partnership in two enormously popular Greek \nrestaurants: Evvia Estiatorio in Palo Alto and Kokkari Estiatorio in \ndowntown San Francisco.\n  Mr. Marcus' legacy extends far beyond shareholders and profits into \nthe heart of his own community. He has served on the California State \nUniversities Foundation Board of Governors and the Board of Regents of \nthe University of California. On the board he worked to preserve the \nfinancial viability of higher education for residents. He has also \nsupported San Francisco's de Young Museum since its foundation and \nestablished San Francisco State University's International Center for \nthe Arts.\n  Remembering his heritage, George has contributed generously to the \nGreek-American community and its institutions. In 2008, he was \ninstrumental in organizing the National Hellenic Society to provide \nresources to promote Hellenic ideals. For his numerous services, he has \nbeen awarded the AXION Award, the Ellis Island Medal of Honor, the \nElios Cultural Achievement Award, the Patriarch Athenagoras I \nHumanities Award, and the Aristeio Award of the American Hellenic \nCouncil of California.\n  This past month George was honored by the Greek Orthodox Metropolis \nof San Francisco with the Theofanis Economidis Award for his work on \nbehalf of the Greek Orthodox Church in the United States. I \ncongratulate George on this much-deserved recognition.\n  But for all of the awards and accolades from the private and public \nsectors, George Marcus' greatest accomplishment is his family. George \nand his wife Judy are the proud parents of four children--Mary Jane, \nJohn, Demetra, and Alexandria.\n  In 2011, George gave the commencement address at San Francisco State \nUniversity. In his remarks he quoted Aristotle, urging the graduates to \nremember that ``excellence is a habit. . . . For your success in \nwhatever you pursue, you must take to heart and be the best you can . . \n. and don't forget to give back.'' George Marcus has made excellence \nhis habit at home, in his community and in the corporate world. He has \nachieved unparalleled success in nearly every walk of life. Yet he has \nnever forgotten to give back. He has never stopped being the best he \ncan.\n  Today, I, along with the Senate, congratulate him on his well-\ndeserved award from the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of San Francisco, but \nmore importantly, we thank George Marcus for all he has done for the \npeople of this nation.\n  On a personal note, George Marcus has been my friend for three \ndecades. It is a friendship I will always cherish.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/12/senate-section/article/S6770-2", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6770-S6771]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        REGARDING THE EXCISE TAX LEVIED ON LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I rise to discuss an amendment regarding \nnatural gas that was adopted earlier this year by the Senate Finance \nCommittee and was included in the Senate-passed highway bill. I wish it \nwere included in one of the year-end measures this body is passing in \nthe next few days. This is a bipartisan proposal that passed the Senate \noverwhelmingly and deserves to be enacted before we conclude this \nCongress.\n  The measure--a bill we worked on with Senator Burr from North \nCarolina--would equalize the tax treatment of liquefied natural gas, \nLNG, and diesel fuel. The federal highway excise tax on both diesel and \nLNG is set at 24.3 cents per gallon. However, because LNG contains less \nenergy per gallon than diesel fuel, on an energy equivalent basis, LNG \neffectively pays 170 percent of the diesel tax rate. The current \nhighway excise tax treatment of LNG is a disincentive to investment in \nnew LNG trucks and fueling stations, and should be corrected to \nencourage capital investments and help diversify transportation fuel \nchoices.\n  LNG is a transportation fuel used for large trucks and some marine \nand rail vessels. The fuel has attracted the attention of fleet \noperators due to its low cost at the pump and reduced environmental \nimpact. LNG produces significantly lower levels of toxic emissions than \ndiesel fuel, including lower levels of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide \nand sulfur dioxide. Using LNG instead of\n\n[[Page S6771]]\n\ndiesel fuel also reduces pollution from so-called ``black carbon,'' \nalso known as soot. Black carbon is a major contributor to climate \nchange, second only to carbon dioxide in the amount of heat it traps in \nthe atmosphere once emitted.\n  This amendment would change the highway excise tax and the Inland \nWaterways Financing rate on LNG so that the tax is imposed on the \nenergy content of a diesel gallon, known as a diesel gallon equivalent, \nrather than strictly on a per-gallon basis. LNG has huge potential as a \ncheaper, cleaner, domestic energy source and we need to ensure our tax \nsystem is not putting it at a disadvantage.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I rise as a cosponsor of the amendment \nfrom the Senator from Colorado. This amendment would correct a mistake \nand level the transportation fuel tax playing field by taxing LNG on an \nenergy equivalent basis rather than a volumetric basis.\n  It would also put this cleaner and cheaper source of energy on an \neven playing field with diesel fuel. It would help a new industry get \noff the ground and become commercially viable simply by leveling the \nplaying field.\n  When Congress first established the transportation fuel tax on LNG, \nit was not yet a fuel that had entered the commercial marketplace. \nThere were no LNG trucks on the road. There was no one to educate us on \nthe technical or marketing differences of these two fuels. Now that the \nLNG market is emerging, however, this unfortunate drafting error has \nshown its real world consequences.\n  The current tax system can result in thousands of dollars of \nadditional tax for those who choose to utilize LNG. For example, if a \ndiesel truck travels 100,000 miles at 5 miles per gallon it consumes \n20,000 gallons of diesel fuel, however, an identical LNG truck would \nrequire 34,000 gallons of LNG to travel the same distance. Both trucks \nwould consume the same amount of energy, measured in BTUs, but the \ncurrent tax system would result in the LNG truck paying an additional \n$3,402 in taxes because of the 14,000 more gallons of liquid fuel \nconsumed.\n  In addition, although we do not yet have any marine vessels operating \nin the U.S. on LNG, this too is an emerging market with great \npotential. High horsepower manufacturers are still developing the \nengines that will be needed to power vessels on LNG and we do not yet \nhave a marine fuel sales infrastructure, but some ship owners are \nplanning ship conversions or new orders that will allow them to utilize \ncleaner and cheaper natural gas fuel. We should not be raising a new \nobstacle for the marine industry by perpetuating this differential tax \ntreatment on marine diesel fuel. Furthermore, there should be no \nscoring penalty from CBO or Joint Tax when we eventually get around to \nfixing the tax treatment of LNG versus diesel.\n  This is a commonsense proposal that allows diesel fuel and LNG to \ncompete in the market fairly, opening doors for companies interested in \nswitching to this environmentally friendly domestic energy source. We \nreally need to find a way to fix this issue so that we can realize the \neconomic and environmental benefits of the increased use of domestic \nnatural gas.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I support the amendment from the Senators \nfrom Colorado and North Carolina and I especially want to thank Senator \nBennet for his leadership on this issue. I was proud to help them by \nincluding it in the highway legislation mentioned by the Senator from \nColorado and I regret that the measure is not included in any of the \nbills we are considering as we wind down this Congress. I would like to \ncommit to working with my colleagues to find an appropriate vehicle for \nmoving this proposal early next year.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I was a cosponsor of this amendment to \nthe highway bill in the Finance Committee and understand the importance \nof equalizing the tax rate between LNG and propane and diesel fuel. \nUnfortunately, we cannot add this amendment that I support to this \ntime-sensitive legislation. Senator Burr and Senator Bennet, I hope to \nfind an opportunity to include this important provision regarding LNG \nand propane in legislation next year. This inequitable treatment of LNG \nand propane deserves a better fate than what exists under current law. \nI especially want to thank Senator Burr for his tireless efforts on \nthis issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/12/senate-section/article/S6771-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6771-S6772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SUPPORT OF DIVISION M OF THE CONSOLIDATED AND FURTHER CONTINUING \nAPPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2015, THE EXPATRIATE HEALTH COVERAGE CLARIFICATION \n                                  ACT\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with my colleague, Senator Coons.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, along with my colleague Senator Coons, I \nrise today in support of Division M of the Consolidated and Further \nContinuing Appropriations Act, 2015, the Expatriate Health Coverage \nClarification Act. I would also like to clarify the intent of this \nbipartisan and technical bill, which was necessary to clearly explain \nhow the Affordable Care Act, ACA, should apply to U.S.-issued \nexpatriate health insurance plans and to ensure that U.S. health \ninsurers who provide expatriate health insurance plans encounter the \nsame legal requirements and expectations as foreign expatriate health \ninsurers.\n  Expatriate health insurance plans are high-quality and comprehensive \nhealth insurance plans intended for a globally mobile, highly skilled \nand sought-after workforce. Expatriate workers can be found in diverse \nindustries and sectors, including corporations such as airlines and oil \nand gas exploration companies, nonprofit organizations, foreign aid \ngroups, and contractors in conflict zones supporting or protecting U.S. \ntroops and citizens. Expatriate workers often travel between multiple \ncountries several times within 1 year or live in foreign countries for \nprolonged periods of time. These expatriate workers and their families \ntypically require and depend on comprehensive health care services and \nother supporting services in multiple countries in the course of one \nyear. U.S.-issued expatriate plans cover fewer than 500,000 \nindividuals, which primarily include Americans working overseas.\n  My understanding and intent is that the Expatriate Health Coverage \nClarification Act should make only limited and technical modifications \nto the ACA that apply to U.S. health insurers providing health \ninsurance coverage to ``qualified expatriates'' as defined by this \nlegislation. These modifications are necessary to ensure that U.S. \ninsurance companies offering expatriate health plans can remain \ncompetitive in the global marketplace for these plans, alongside \nforeign insurers who are not subject to the same ACA requirements. This \nlegislation should not affect current labor or immigration laws or \nregulations. I have worked hand-in-hand with Senators Coons, Toomey, \nRubio, Harkin, Wyden, Alexander, Hatch, and a bipartisan group of our \nHouse colleagues to ensure that the Expatriate Health Coverage \nClarification Act is narrowly written to respect, and leave \nundisturbed, our existing immigration laws and regulations.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, As Senator Carper noted, the Expatriate \nHealth Coverage Clarification Act should not reduce the Affordable Care \nAct's health insurance coverage protections based on U.S. workers' \nimmigration status, including those employed with nonimmigrant work \nvisas. We intend that the definition of ``qualified expatriate'' be \nclosely adhered to in the implementation of this legislation by the \nadministration, the health insurance companies that seek to offer \nexpatriate health plans, and the employers who utilize these plans on \nbehalf of their workers who are transferred or assigned both within or \noutside the United States.\n  It is my expectation that expatriate health plan enrollment should \nremain relatively constant, accounting for the normal ebbs and flows of \nthe demand of and supply for expatriate workers. The provisions of this \nbill apply to the two Federal laws that it seeks to modify--the \nAffordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation \nAct. It is not Congress's intent to affect other Federal law. As \nSenator Carper stated, the legislation would not change existing \nimmigration law or regulations--including those that\n\n[[Page S6772]]\n\ngovern benefit equivalency between nonimmigrant visa holders and their \nU.S. counterparts. It is also not Congress's intent to impact or \ndiminish in any way an employee's rights under title VII of the Civil \nRights Act or any other antidiscrimination protections or to preempt \nany relevant State law governing employees' rights.\n  The Expatriate Health Coverage Clarification Act is a bipartisan, \ntechnical clarification of health insurance law, intended to place U.S. \nexpatriate health insurers on equal footing with their foreign \ncounterparts.

VIVEK MURTHY\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I urge the Senate to schedule an \nimmediate vote on the nomination of Dr. Vivek Murthy to serve as the \nnext Surgeon General of the United States. One year ago, President \nObama nominated Dr. Murthy to serve as our next Surgeon General. Ten \nmonths ago, Dr. Murthy's nomination was approved by the Senate Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions, HELP, Committee. Since then, his \nnomination has stalled. I, along with many of my colleagues, have \nwritten to Senate leadership, requesting an immediate floor vote. Yet--\nhere we are--still no vote.\n  The Surgeon General serves as ``America's Doctor.'' He ensures \nAmericans are receiving the very best scientific information available \nin order to improve their health and reduce risk of injury or illness. \nThe Surgeon General also oversees the U.S. Public Health Service \nCommissioned Corps, a group of 7,000 men and women who are uniformed \npublic health professionals working throughout the federal government \nto protect, promote, and advance our Nation's health. Finally, the \nSurgeon General is responsible for chairing the National Prevention \nCouncil.\n  The urgent need to have a Surgeon General in place and at-the-ready \nis never more evident than when we are confronted with a public health \ncrisis, as we are now. Over the past many months, our global community \nhas struggled to respond to the Ebola epidemic plaguing West Africa and \nthreatening communities nationwide. The United States has been rightly \nfocused on dealing with the epidemic at its epicenter in West Africa, \nprotecting our ports of entry, and protecting America's public health. \nYet, our response has been hindered because we do not have a confirmed \nU.S. Surgeon General in place.\n  Households across our nation were flooded with misinformation and \nconfusion when Ebola was first diagnosed in the United States. If Dr. \nMurthy had been in place as Surgeon General, he would have been \nresponsible for increasing public understanding about Ebola; providing \naccurate, important, and timely medical information; and helping to \nease fears. As ``America's Doctor'' he would have provided an \nadditional trusted voice that could have communicated with the public \nand helped address their concerns. Instead, ``America's Doctor'' was \nsitting on the sidelines awaiting a Senate vote on his nomination.\n  Like so many of us, Dr. Murthy is the son of immigrant parents. He \ncompleted his early education in Miami, FL, and attended college at \nHarvard University where he received a bachelor's degree in biochemical \nsciences. He went on to receive an MD from the Yale School of Medicine \nand an MBA in Health Care Management from the Yale School of \nManagement. He completed his residency in Internal Medicine at Brigham \nand Woman's Hospital.\n  As a physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Dr. Murthy has cared \nfor patients with a range of illnesses from diabetes and cardiovascular \ndisease to cancer and infections. As a researcher, he has worked on \nvaccine development and he has studied the inclusion of women and \nminorities in clinical trials. As a teacher at Harvard Medical School, \nhe knows what issues face our next generation of doctors. As a public \nhealth educator, Dr. Murthy created HIV/AIDS education programs for \nthousands of young people through an organization he cofounded. He \nbuilt a rural community health partnership in India to train young \nwomen to be health care educators and leaders. As an organizational \nleader, Dr. Murthy cofounded a national medical organization, Doctors \nfor America, to improve communication between physicians, patients, and \npolicy makers. Finally, as a leader in prevention, he served on the \nAdvisory Group to the National Prevention Council and helped develop \nthe nation's first National Prevention Strategy. I think it is pretty \nclear that Dr. Murthy has the background and the boots on the ground \nexpertise to serve as our Nation's 19th Surgeon General.\n  Doubts about his ability to serve as Surgeon General are not the \nproblem holding up his nomination. I fear that policy matters outside \nthe scope of this position are actually to blame. I hope that my \ncolleagues do not let public policy debates unrelated to the position \nin which he would serve stall his nomination any longer.\n  Dr. Murthy's nomination has received widespread support from local, \nState, and national public health organizations including the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics, American Cancer Society, American Diabetes \nAssociation, American Heart Association, and American Public Health \nAssociation.\n  It is time to confirm Dr. Murthy as our Nation's 19th Surgeon \nGeneral. It is time to take ``America's Doctor'' off the sidelines and \nput him into the game. Thank you.\n\n[[Page S6773]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/12/senate-section/article/S6773-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6773-S6774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n     ENACTMENT OF THE HARRIET TUBMAN NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARKS ACT\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I wish to celebrate the long awaited \nenactment of the Harriet Tubman National Historical Parks Act, a bill \nto establish the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National \nHistorical Park on the Eastern Shore of Maryland and the Harriet Tubman \nNational Historical Park in Auburn, NY. This is an effort that I have \nworked closely with Senators Mikulski, Schumer and Gillibrand as well \nas Secretary Clinton, when she represented New York in this body, and \nmark the culmination of the legislative work on this effort started by \nmy predecessor, Senator Sarbanes when he passed legislation \ncommissioning the National Service to conduct a Special Resource Study \non Harriet Tubman. We all share a deep appreciation for how important \nestablishing these parks is to preserving the legacy of this remarkable \nhistorical figure in American History but also to how important these \nparks will be to the communities where they will be located.\n  In my career, I have spoken on the Senate Floor, at events in \nMaryland, in meetings with constituents and with my colleagues about \nHarriet Tubman's legacy. While I hope each opportunity I have taken to \ndiscuss the life of this remarkable woman helps raise awareness about \nher importance to the history of our great nation, my ultimate goal has \nalways been to properly commemorate her life and her work by \nestablishing the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National \nHistorical Park on the Eastern Shore of Maryland and, to establish the \nHarriet Tubman National Historical Park in Auburn, NY.\n  For the last 7 years I have championed the legislation that was \nenacted today as part of the National Defense Authorization Act.\n  I also greatly appreciate the support this legislation received in \nthe Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the Senate as a \nwhole. In both this Congress and the 112 Congress, the Harriet Tubman \nNational Historical Parks Act was reported out of committee with \nbipartisan support including the support of Chairwoman Landrieu and \nRanking Member Murkowski. I am incredibly grateful for the work of the \nChair and Ranking Member, and their staffs, to maintain progress on the \nbill which has led to its passage today.\n  The establishment of the Harriet Tubman Historical Parks has been \nyears in the making and is long overdue. The mission of the National \nPark Service has evolved over time from not only preserving natural \nwonders across the U.S. for recreational purposes but also \ncommemorating unique places of significance to historical events and \nextraordinary Americans that have shaped our nation.\n  The woman, who is known to us as Harriet Tubman, was born in \napproximately 1822 in Dorchester County, MD, and given the name \nAraminta, Minty, Ross. She spent nearly 30 years of her life in slavery \non Maryland's Eastern Shore. She worked on a number of different \nplantations on Maryland's Eastern Shore and as a teenager was trained \nto be a seamstress. As an adult she took the first name Harriet, and \nwhen she was 25 years-old married John Tubman.\n  In her late twenties, Harriet Tubman escaped from slavery in 1849. \nShe fled in the dead of night, navigating the maze of tidal streams and \nwetlands that, to this day, comprise the Eastern Shore's landscape. She \ndid so alone, demonstrating courage, strength and fortitude that became \nher hallmarks. Not satisfied with attaining her own freedom, she \nreturned repeatedly for more than 10 years to the places of her \nenslavement in Dorchester and Caroline counties where, under the most \nadverse conditions, she led away many family members and other slaves \nto freedom in the Northeastern United States. She helped develop a \ncomplex network of safe houses and recruited abolitionist sympathizers \nresiding along secret routes connecting the Southern slave states and \nNorthern Free States. No one knows exactly how many people she led to \nfreedom or the number of trips between the North and South she led, but \nthe legend of her work was an inspiration to the multitude of slaves \nseeking freedom and to abolitionists fighting to end slavery. Tubman \nbecame known as ``the Moses of her people'' by African-Americans and \nwhite abolitionists alike. Tubman once proudly told Frederick Douglass \nthat in all of her journeys she ``never lost a single passenger.'' She \nwas so effective that in 1856 there was a $40,000 reward offered for \nher capture in the South. She is the most famous and most important \nconductor of the network of resistance known as the Underground \nRailroad.\n  During the Civil War, Tubman served the Union forces as a spy, a \nscout and a nurse. She served in Virginia, Florida, and South Carolina. \nShe is credited with leading slaves from those slave states to freedom \nduring those years as well.\n  Following the Civil War, and the emancipation of all black slaves, \nTubman settled in Auburn, NY. There she was active in the women's \nsuffrage movement, and she also established one of the first \nincorporated African-American homes for aged to care for the elderly. \nIn 1903 she bequeathed the Tubman Home to the African Methodist \nEpiscopal Zion Church in Auburn where it stands to this day. Harriet \nTubman died in Auburn in 1913 and she is buried in the Fort Hill \nCemetery. Fortunately many of the structures and landmarks in New York \nremain intact and in relatively good condition.\n  Only recently has the Park Service begun establishing units dedicated \nto the lives of African-Americans. Places like Booker T. Washington \nNational Monument on the campus of the Tuskegee University in Alabama, \nthe George Washington Carver National Monument in Missouri, The Buffalo \nSoldiers at Guadalupe Mountains National Park, the National Historical \nTrail commemorating the March for Voting Rights from Selma to \nMontgomery Alabama, and most recently the Martin Luther King Jr. \nmemorial on the National Mall are all important monuments and places of \nhistorical significance that help tell the story of the African-\nAmerican experience.\n  As the National Park Service continues its important work to \nrecognize and preserve African-American history by providing greater \npublic access and information about the places and people that have \nshaped the African-American experience, there are very few units \ndedicated to the lives of African-American women, and there are no \nNational Historical Parks commemorating African-American women.\n  I cannot think of a more fitting hero than Harriet Tubman to be the \nfirst African-American woman to be memorialized with National \nHistorical Parks that tell both her personal story and her lifelong \nfight for justice and freedom starting with her fight against the cruel \ninstitution of slavery and work of the Underground Railroad she led to \nher work in the women's suffrage movement.\n  I am grateful for the support of my colleagues. These parks will \nhopefully pave the way for the Park Service to develop more National \nHistorical Parks commemorating the lives of many other important \nAfrican-American women in our history.\n  The vision for the Tubman National Historical Parks is to preserve \nthe places significant to the life of Harriet Tubman and tell her story \nthrough interpretative activities and continue to discover aspects of \nher life and the experience of passage along the Underground Railroad \nthrough archaeological research and discovery.\n  The buildings and structures in Maryland have mostly disappeared. \nSlaves were forced to live in primitive buildings even though many \nslaves were skilled tradesmen who constructed the substantial homes of \ntheir owners. Not surprisingly, few of the structures associated with \nthe early years of Tubman's life remain standing today. The landscape \nof the Eastern Shore of Maryland, however, is still evocative of the \ntime that Tubman lived there. Farm fields and loblolly pine forests dot \nthe lowland landscape, which is also notable for its extensive network \nof tidal rivers and wetlands that Tubman, and the people she guided to \nfreedom, under the cover of night. In particular, a number of \nproperties including the homestead of Ben Ross, her father, Stewart's \nCanal, where he worked, the Brodess Farm, where she worked as a slave, \nand others are within the master plan boundaries of the Blackwater \nNational Wildlife Refuge.\n\n[[Page S6774]]\n\n  Similarly, Poplar Neck, the plantation from which she escaped to \nfreedom, is still largely intact in Caroline County. The properties in \nTalbot County, immediately across the Choptank River from the \nplantation, are currently protected by various conservation easements. \nWere she alive today, Tubman would recognize much of the landscape that \nshe knew intimately as she secretly led black men, women and children \nto freedom.\n  There has never been any doubt that Tubman led an extraordinary life. \nHer contributions to American history are surpassed by few. Determining \nthe most appropriate way to recognize that life and her contributions, \nhowever, has been exceedingly difficult. The National Park Service \ndetermined that designating a Historical Park that would include two \ngeographically separate units would be an appropriate tribute to the \nlife of this extraordinary American. The New York unit would include \nthe tightly clustered Tubman buildings in the town of Auburn. The \nMaryland portion would include large sections of landscapes that are \nevocative of Tubman's time and are historically relevant.\n  Harriet Tubman was a true American patriot. She was someone for whom \nliberty and freedom were not just concepts but values she fought \ntirelessly for. She lived those principles and so selflessly helped \nothers attain freedom. In doing so, she has earned a Nation's respect \nand honor.\n  Harriet Tubman is one of many great Americans that we honor and \ncelebrate every February during Black History Month. In schools across \nthe country, American History curriculums teach our children about \nTubman's courage, conviction, her fight for freedom and her \ncontributions to the greatness of our Nation during a contentious time \nin U.S. history. Now it is time to add to Tubman's legacy by preserving \nand commemorating the places evocative of Harriet Tubman's \nextraordinary life.\n  Every year, millions of school children, as well as millions of \nadults, visit our National Historical Parks gain the experience and \nknowledge about our Nation's history that simply cannot be found in \nhistory books or on the Internet. Our Nation's strength and character \ncomes from the actions of the Americans who came before us and the \nsignificant events that shaped our Nation. The National Park Service is \nengaged in the important work of preserving the places where American \nhistory was made and providing a tangible experience for current and \nfuture generations to experience and understand. It is one thing to \nlearn about Harriet Tubman from a book, and it is yet a completely \ndifferent and fulfilling experience to explore, see, listen to and feel \nthe places where she worked as a slave, where she escaped from and \nwhere she lived out her life as a free American.\n  The National Park Service is uniquely suited to honor and preserve \nthese places of historical significance and I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in preserving and growing the legacy of Harriet Tubman by \nestablishing the Harriet Tubman National Historical Parks in her honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/12/senate-section/article/S6774-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  BROWNS CANYON NATIONAL MONUMENT BILL\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I submit this statement for \nthe Record to clarify several provisions in my Browns Canyon national \nmonument and wilderness bill, S. 1794. I have asked President Obama to \nuse this bill as the model for a designation of 22,000 acres of Browns \nCanyon as a national monument under the Antiquities Act because it \ncontains many specific provisions that were developed in careful \nconsultation with the community.\n  I introduced my bill over a year ago after 18 months of working side-\nby-side with Chaffee County residents and other stakeholders. I held \npublic listening sessions, received thousands of written comments, and \nmy staff and I conducted over 50 meetings. The resulting bill was \nemblematic of how public lands bills should be done: from the bottom up \nand based on what the community wants.\n  Browns Canyon is a unique natural resource. Hundreds of thousands of \nvisitors come to Browns Canyon year after year to raft or kayak the \ncanyon's exciting whitewater rapids or to fish the Gold Medal trout \nwaters of the Arkansas River. But there is a lot more to this landscape \nthan just the river. The rugged and remote lands to the east feature \nquiet canyons and rock formations, outstanding habitat for bighorn \nsheep and elk, and sweeping views of the Collegiate Peaks and Arkansas \nValley.\n  Protecting Browns Canyon has a wide base of support, including more \nthan 200 local businesses and sportsmen who welcome the area's Gold \nMedal trout waters and big game hunting opportunities. Both the town of \nBuena Vista and the city of Salida passed resolutions of support, and a \nmajority of the Chaffee County commissioners support the proposal with \nits carefully crafted conditions. The Denver Post and local Salida \nMountain Mail have editorialized in favor of an Executive action. \nIndeed, I hosted a public meeting in Salida last weekend--attended by \nsenior State and Federal officials, including U.S. Senator Michael \nBennet, U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell and Bureau of Land \nManagement Deputy Director Steve Ellis--to gauge public support for \nprotecting this nationally significant landmark. The more than 500 \nattendees at the standing-room-only meeting overwhelmingly endorsed the \nidea, noting how a national monument designation would boost the local \neconomy, support Main Street businesses and help protect Colorado's \nspecial way of life.\n  The intent of my Browns Canyon national monument bill is to preserve \nthis special place just as it is now--for us and future generations. \nTherefore, I submit this statement to clarify the intent behind several \nkey passages related to the role of the State of Colorado, water \nrights, and livestock grazing.\n  First, I want to recognize the model partnership between the Bureau \nof Land Management and the State of Colorado that has been in place \nsince 1989 to manage the 148 miles of the Arkansas River corridor. This \npartnership is known as the Arkansas Headwaters Recreation Area, AHRA, \nand includes Browns Canyon. The intent is that the Browns Canyon \nNational Monument will have no impact on this partnership. However, it \nis also the intent that the Federal agencies will closely consult with \nthe State of Colorado on the development of a comprehensive management \nplan for the national monument, and that the State could be a \ncosignatory to the plan. The State of Colorado has interests beyond \njust the AHRA because it will manage the wildlife in the National \nMonument and has a stake in maintaining the economic viability of \nassociated industries, such as outdoor recreation and agriculture.\n  Second, the intent is that the Browns Canyon National Monument shall \nnot have any impact on the existing water rights of any party. It is \nalso the intent that the national monument will not have any effect on \nhow river flows are managed and administered, such as the current \nVoluntary Flow Management Program in place for the Arkansas River.\n  Finally, as I have stated previously before the National Parks \nSubcommittee, it is critical that local ranchers maintain flexibility \nto run livestock in the national monument and transfer their grazing \nallotments to future generations. To address this, I included \nlegislative language that all existing laws continue to apply just as \nthey did before the monument was designated. Colorado's farms and \nranches are an important part of my State's economy and identity--and \nproduce food and fiber for the world. In particular, cattlemen and \nwomen play a critical role in the economy, culture, and heritage of the \nArkansas River Valley. Therefore, Browns Canyon National Monument must \nsupport that industry and educate visitors about its role.\n  Browns Canyon National Monument is an idea whose time has come, and I \nam proud to have led this most recent effort in a 20-year campaign to \nprotect this spectacular and nationally significant resource.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/12/senate-section/article/S6774-2", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6774-S6776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FAREWELL TO THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, it is humbling to stand here \nto speak one final time with my colleagues as a United States Senator.\n  As a lifelong mountain climber, I have learned far more from the \nmountains I did not summit, than those I did. Every climb, I have \nfound, offers a\n\n[[Page S6775]]\n\nchance to look back and reflect, and standing here today gives me a \nunique opportunity to appreciate just how far we have come.\n  For the past 18 years, my most rewarding challenge has been \nexercising the power lent to me by the people of Colorado to fight on \ntheir behalf, first in the State House and then in the U.S. Congress. \nThroughout my career in public service--my 6 years in the U.S. Senate \nbeing but one chapter--I have always been guided by the rugged \nindependence, strength and cooperative spirit that defines who we are \nas Coloradans and as Westerners.\n  That spirit helped me craft solutions to long-standing problems in my \nhome State of Colorado. From my very first week in the U.S. Senate, I \nworked at resolving the decades-long impasse between southern Colorado \nranchers and the U.S. Army, which uses the land surrounding Pinon \nCanyon to train soldiers for deployment into war zones. After 5 years \nof listening and lots of hard work, we reached a deal that protects the \nproperty rights of landowners while ensuring our troops are prepared to \ndefend our Nation. It was a teamwork-oriented approach that reflected \nColorado's best problem-solving traditions.\n  I have said for years that Coloradans pull together come hell or high \nwater. Little did I know that this saying would prove itself to be true \nduring my time in the U.S. Senate, from wildfires that left thousands \nhomeless to a biblical flood in 2013 that swept over much of the Front \nRange. Despite the partisan Federal Government shutdown of 2013, we \ndelivered more than $770 million in emergency flood support and \nmarshalled nearly $2.5 billion in additional Federal assistance so that \nColorado could rebuild better and stronger than before. This disaster \nrelief work includes conservation easements and watershed protection \nfunds to ward off future floods and a series of next-generation air \ntankers to help us fight fires for decades to come. This is in addition \nto the more immediate support needed to rebuild roads, bridges, and the \ninfrastructure that our communities depend on.\n  Our uniquely Western perspective holds that compromise is not \ncapitulation, and that we are stronger when every member of the \ncommunity has a seat at the table--not just the privileged. This is a \ncause that my family has championed for generations and it is a creed \nthat should continue to drive all Coloradans who answer the call to \nserve.\n  At this point in our politics, Americans are rightly impatient with \nthe willful, partisan gridlock and dysfunction in Washington. Yet, in \nColorado, we know that by working together we have been able to keep \nour State moving forward and do our part to overcome Washington \nsilliness for the good of the Nation.\n  But even as we keep our eyes on the horizon and the work we still \nhave to do, it is also important that we protect our special way of \nlife--and safeguard our land, water and air for future generations. I \nstrongly believe that we do not inherit the earth from our parents--we \nborrow it from our children. That is why I have championed efforts to \npreserve our public lands and the special places and natural wonders \nthat define Colorado. Those efforts include creating new wilderness \nareas around James Peak, ensuring that future generations can \nexperience the beauty of the Great Sand Dunes and Chimney Rock, and \nturning Rocky Flats--a former nuclear weapons facility--into a wildlife \nrefuge. I will continue working hard to protect Brown's Canyon, which I \nhope to see designated as a national monument in the days ahead.\n  Protecting these special places along with our clean air and water is \njust part of the larger fight to confront the challenges and \nopportunities posed by climate change. Colorado has long led the \nNation's pursuit of a balanced, forward-thinking energy strategy. Much \nof the progress Colorado has made came after I fought alongside \nRepublican Speaker of the Colorado House Lola Spradley in 2004 to pass \nour State's first renewable electricity standard. This was the Nation's \nfirst democratically-passed renewable energy policy, and one which has \nactually been strengthened and added to since it was created. Since \nthen, Colorado's renewable electricity standard has increased from its \nstart at 10 percent to the 30 percent it is today. It has become a \nmodel for the Nation in how to create good-paying clean energy jobs \nwhile fighting the causes of climate change.\n  I built on this effort in the U.S. Senate by successfully pushing to \nextend the Production Tax Credit for wind energy. This has been a \nyears-long, bipartisan effort that I am proud to have led alongside \nSenator Grassley from Iowa. From coming to the floor more than two-\ndozen times to explain the importance of wind State-by-State and to \ndemand an extension in 2012, to fighting to extend the wind tax credit \nagain this year, I have never given up on Colorado's thriving wind-\nenergy industry and the more than 5,000 jobs it supports across the \nState. This is the sort of common-sense, bipartisan policy that helps \nhardworking American families today but is also part of implementing a \nclean energy future for generations to come.\n  As a Nation, over the past few years, we have persevered through \ndifficult times to continue building toward a more perfect union. When \nour country was faced with the possibility of another Great Depression, \nwe took decisive action--avoiding financial collapse, supporting 6 \nstraight years of job growth in private industry, and making smart \ninvestments in everything from repairing our crumbling roads to re-\ninvigorating Denver's historic Union Station. That is something to be \nproud of. There's a lot more to be done--but it is important to pause \nand note the successful milestones we have already reached on the road \nto recovery.\n  Despite a flawed roll-out, the Nation's healthcare law has increased \naccess to quality health coverage for more than 400,000 Coloradans, \nhelped families lower expenses and plan their future with free \ncontraceptive care, and kept costs down for the first time in decades. \nThis is helping to keep families out of bankruptcy and making sure that \nall Americans--not just the wealthiest among us--receive the care they \nand their families deserve.\n  Thomas Jefferson once said that a true patriot loves her country not \njust for what it is . . . but for what it can be. I think a country \nwhere every family can rest easy knowing that they will never be left \nin the cold again when it comes to accessing health care is a cause \nworth fighting for, and I could not be more grateful to those who have \nfought alongside me to make that a reality. At the same time, we must \nalso continue to monitor closely its implementation to ensure we \nidentify and correct any unexpected and uneven impacts on Coloradans \nand Americans.\n  While protecting Americans from the abuses of an out-of-control \nhealthcare system is an achievement we should all celebrate, I have \nbeen equally as passionate about upholding the Bill of Rights and \nprotecting our freedom and right to equality. We still have a ways to \ngo, but I am proud to have followed in the footsteps of so many great \nleaders, including many in my own family, who fought to make sure \nAmerica lives up to the values enshrined in our Constitution.\n  Many of you may recall that my father, Mo, helped to integrate the \nUniversity of Arizona, when it was beset by racial divisions. My \ngrandfather, Levi, issued a famous court decision that recognized \nNative Americans' constitutionally protected right to vote in our \nelections. My uncle Stewart challenged discrimination in our Nation's \ncapital when he confronted the Washington football team to demand they \nallow black athletes to play alongside white athletes. It has been \nthese examples among so many others that inspired me to take action \nwhen I felt we were not living up to our constitutional ideals.\n  That includes leading the successful fight to repeal the military's \ndiscriminatory ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy that had so shamefully \nkept gay and lesbian Americans from openly serving their country in the \nArmed Forces. It includes passing landmark hate crimes prevention \nlegislation and a law to make it easier for women to fight wage \ndiscrimination.\n  While there is much work left to be done to protect our \nconstitutional rights, I am proud to have led the effort to reconcile \nthe enormous power of our Nation's intelligence agencies with the \nbedrock principles of our democracy. We have proven that the choice\n\n[[Page S6776]]\n\nbetween ensuring our security and protecting our privacy is a false \nchoice, and that we can keep faith with our Nation's founding \nprinciples while also safeguarding our communities. So when the CIA \ntortured people in the name of the Americans it was supposed to serve, \nwe were strong enough as a Nation to admit our mistakes and commit to \nlearning from this dark period in our Nation's history. That is why I \nled the fight on the Intelligence Committee to declassify the findings \nof our landmark report on the CIA's Detention and Interrogation \nProgram, to make sure that future presidents and intelligence community \nleaders do not violate the principles that make America so exceptional.\n  These are all important accomplishments--but I would be remiss if I \ndid not acknowledge that true leadership is a team sport. I have been \nfortunate to be surrounded by many people whose insights, counsel and \ncontributions have made me a stronger and more effective advocate for \nColorado. In particular, I want to point out that former Colorado U.S. \nSenator Gary Hart has been a key, trusted advisor and a dear friend \nthroughout my 18 years of public service. I want to thank my Chief of \nStaff, Michael Sozan, who has guided my Senate office with a steady \nhand for the last 6 years . . . and my State Director, Jen Rokala, who \nI have had the pleasure of working with over the past 15 years as we \nserved the people of Colorado. I also want to thank Joe Britton, my \nDeputy Chief of Staff; Jake Swanton, my Legislative Director; John \nFossum, my administrative director; and Mike Saccone, my Communications \nDirector, for ably guiding me and my office.\n  Even before coming to the Senate, I had the pleasure of working with \nmany dedicated people who put everything on the line to better serve \nColorado. I want to thank Alan Salazar, my former Chief of Staff, along \nwith Laura Davis, Lisa Carpenter, Stan Sloss, Doug Young, Cookab \nHashemi, and Tara Trujillo for their guidance, patience, and good \nhumor. I also want to thank two staffers who have been with me from the \nstart: Jennifer Barrett, one of my most trusted advisers, and Carter \nEllison, my constituent services director. The list of talented and \ndriven people who have worked with me over the years is too long to \nread but their commitment to serving Colorado and our Nation fills me \nwith awe. I will miss my team greatly.\n  It also has been my honor to serve as a member of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee for the last 6 years--and on the House Armed \nServices Committee before that. During that time, I had the privilege \nof working on behalf of the tremendous men and women who defend our \nNation. I have witnessed their great courage, professionalism and \ncommitment in performing dangerous missions in Iraq, Afghanistan, \nDjibouti and other places around the world. I have been humbled by the \nindomitable spirit of our wounded warriors recovering at Walter Reed, \nBethesda and in Colorado. I have mourned our fallen. Their sacrifice, \nand the loss that is borne by their families and a grateful Nation, is \nnever far from my mind. To all those who have served, and to all their \nloved ones, I offer my deepest thanks and my never ending gratitude.\n  When I first came to the U.S. Senate, I told my colleagues that we \nwere not elected to solve Democratic or Republican problems, but to \nfind uniquely American solutions to our toughest challenges. Just like \nmountain climbers who are all on the same rope, we know that we are all \nin this together--and that we are only truly successful when we all \nsucceed together.\n  The great writer Wallace Stegner challenged us to build communities \nto match our scenery. In a narrow sense, that means that we should \nstrive to make our society as beautiful and thriving as the natural \nlandscape that surrounds us. But in a broader sense, it also means that \nour communities should bring out the best in us, and that we should \nnever stop building on the uniquely independent yet cooperative spirit \nthat makes Colorado great.\n  That is the spirit that has guided me throughout my time in public \nservice, and it is the spirit that will continue to guide me as I find \nnew ways to keep Colorado and our country moving forward.\n  It has been the greatest privilege of my life to be a United States \nSenator from Colorado and I will be forever grateful for having had the \nchallenge and the opportunity to serve our great country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/12/senate-section/article/S6776-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6776-S6781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTES TO DEPARTING SENATORS\n\n\n                            Saxby Chambliss\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today to honor my good friend \nSenator Saxby Chambliss on the occasion of his retirement. For 20 \nyears, he has served his fellow Georgians in Congress with honor and \ndistinction. He will be sorely missed.\n  A preacher's son, Saxby was born in Warrenton, NC. He graduated from \nthe University of Georgia and the University of Tennessee College of \nLaw. As a lawyer in south Georgia, he built a successful law practice \nrepresenting the farmers that are the lifeblood of his state.\n  He put his expertise on farm issues to good use here in Congress and \nbecame a key player in negotiations for each of the farm bills \nconsidered during his tenure. And just 2 years after he was elected to \nthe Senate, he assumed the chairmanship of the Agriculture, Nutrition, \nand Forestry Committee, the fastest any new Senator has risen to chair \na standing committee since 1947.\n  Saxby and I served together for many years on the Select Committee on \nIntelligence, where I came to appreciate his wisdom, his sound \njudgment, and his unyielding commitment to keeping this nation safe. He \nhas been an enormously effective vice chairman over the past 4 years. \nAnd even as his tenure here draws to a close, he has once again \ndemonstrated his superb leadership in setting the record straight on \nthe Intelligence Committee's investigation of the CIA's detention and \ninterrogation program.\n  Above all else, Saxby is a proud husband, father of two, and \ngrandfather of six. I know that his lovely wife Julianne and the rest \nof his family are eager to spend more time together in the coming \nyears.\n  Mr. President, Saxby and the entire Chambliss family should know that \nhis colleagues, his fellow Georgians, and his fellow Americans are \ntruly grateful for Saxby's service and his family's sacrifices. I wish \nthem all the best.\n\n\n                               Tom Coburn\n\n  Madam President, I also pay tribute to my friend Tom Coburn as he \nprepares to leave the Senate. For 10 years, Tom has served the people \nof Oklahoma as their junior Senator. He is a man of principle and \nfierce determination. He has shown himself willing time and again to \nstand up to special interests and to fight for what he believes in. He \nwill be missed.\n  Senator Coburn was born in Casper, Wyoming, in 1948 and was raised in \nMuskogee, OK. His father Orin was a prominent optician and the founder \nof Coburn Optical Industries. Tom attended college at Oklahoma State \nUniversity, where he graduated with a degree in accounting. From 1970 \nto 1978 he was a manufacturing manager at his family's company. After a \nbout with cancer, Tom returned to school to become a physician, \ngraduating in 1983 from the University of Oklahoma Medical School. \nFollowing his residency, Tom moved back to Muskogee to practice family \nmedicine and obstetrics. He has personally delivered more than 4,000 \nbabies.\n  Senator Coburn began his career in public service in 1994, when he \nwas elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from Oklahoma. He \nserved in the House for 6 years, then went back to Muskogee to resume \nhis medical practice. Three years later, in 2004, Tom was elected to \nthe U.S. Senate to fill the seat being vacated by retiring Senator Don \nNickles. Here in the Senate he has served with distinction on a number \nof important committees, including the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Government Affairs, of which he is the Ranking Member.\n  Since first arriving in Congress, Senator Coburn has been a strong \nproponent of fiscal restraint. His efforts to fight deficit spending, \npork barrel projects, and earmarks earned him the nickname ``Dr. No.'' \nI have always thought this nickname was a compliment to Tom. It shows \nhe is willing to stand up against powerful interests in defense of his \nprinciples, and that he takes seriously the problems of unnecessary \nspending and long-term debt.\n\n[[Page S6777]]\n\nPassing a balanced budget amendment has been a priority of mine for \nmany years, and I have been glad to count Tom as a strong ally in that \neffort.\n  I have also been fortunate to work with Senator Coburn on a number of \nother issues during his time in the Senate. Earlier this year, Tom and \nI, along with Senator Richard Burr, introduced the Patient CARE Act, a \nmarket-based alternative to Obamacare. Tom and I have also worked \ntogether to fight waste and corruption at the Department of Health and \nHuman Services and to reinvigorate the States' roles in meeting \ntransportation, safety, and other needs.\n  Madam President, Senator Coburn is an honorable and steadfast man. He \nhas served his country well. I wish him, his wife Carolyn, and their \nfamily the very best.\n\n\n                              Mike Johanns\n\n  Madam President, as well I honor my colleague and friend Mike \nJohanns. For many years, Senator Johanns has worked tirelessly for the \npeople of Nebraska, first at the local level, then at the state level \nas Governor, and most recently as senior Senator from Nebraska. Mike is \na kind and thoughtful man, and I have been grateful to serve with him \nthese past 6 years.\n  Senator Johanns was born and raised in Osage, IA, where he grew up \nworking on his family's farm. After high school, he attended Saint \nMary's University of Minnesota and Creighton University School of Law. \nFollowing law school Mike clerked on the Nebraska Supreme Court and \nthen practiced law in Lincoln, NE, where he was a founding partner at \nthe firm Nelson, Johanns, Morris, Holdeman, and Titus.\n  In 1983, Senator Johanns was elected to the Lancaster County Board. \nFive years later he won election to the Lincoln City Council, and then, \n3 years after that, became Mayor of Lincoln. Mike followed his success \nin local politics with success in state politics. In 1998, he won his \nfirst term as Governor of Nebraska, and was reelected by a landslide 4 \nyears later.\n  Senator Johanns entered national politics in 2004 when President \nGeorge W. Bush asked him to serve as Secretary of Agriculture. Four \nyears later he won election to the U.S. Senate from Nebraska, where he \nhas served with distinction ever since.\n  When he retires later this month, Senator Johanns will have spent \nmore than 25 years as a public servant. I commend him for his service \nto the state of Nebraska and to the people of this Nation.\n  Although his tenure in the Senate was brief, Senator Johanns wasted \nno time. His previous experience as Secretary of Agriculture proved \nindispensable as a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture. To \nthis committee, he brought an expertise on farming issues unrivaled by \nother freshman senators. He also served actively on the Banking \nCommittee and was a member of the Senate's Gang of Eight during budget \nnegotiations in 2011. Throughout his service, Senator Johanns always \nhad the best interests of the Nation at heart.\n  Madam President, Senator Johanns is a good man who has served his \ncountry well. His retirement is well deserved. I wish him, his wife \nStephanie, and their children the best going forward.\n\n\n                            Jay Rockefeller\n\n  Madam President, in addition I pay tribute to my friend and colleague \nJay Rockefeller, who will soon retire from the Senate. I have known Jay \nfor many years. He is a man of principle who has dedicated his life to \nserving the citizens of West Virginia. He is a serious legislator and \nan honorable man. I will miss him.\n  Senator Rockefeller is a member of a prominent and distinguished \nAmerican family. He is the great-grandson of John D. Rockefeller, the \nfounder of Standard Oil. Jay was born in New York City and attended \nschool at Phillips Exeter Academy and Harvard College, from which he \nearned an A.B. After college Jay worked for the Peace Corps and the \nDepartment of Far Eastern Affairs. He then went to work for the \nVolunteers in Service to America (VISTA) program, during which time he \nmoved to West Virginia.\n  Senator Rockefeller began his political career in 1966, when he was \nelected to the West Virginia House of Delegates. Two years he later \nbecame the West Virginia Secretary of State. After a brief stint as \nPresident of West Virginia Wesleyan College, Jay returned to public \nservice in 1976, when he was elected Governor of West Virginia. \nFollowing two successful terms as Governor, he won election to the U.S. \nSenate in 1984, where he has served ever since.\n  Senator Rockefeller has held a number of important positions in the \nSenate, including Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence, where I was privileged to serve with him. This is a \ncrucially important committee that deals with some of the weightiest \nissues that come before Congress. Jay led the committee with equanimity \nand respect. His work helped keep our country safe.\n  Senator Rockefeller has also been an active legislator. I was honored \nto work with him on the creation of the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program, or SCHIP, which has made health insurance available \nto millions of children. Other issues Jay and I have worked on together \nover the years include tax reform, stem cell research, and protecting \nthe American flag. He and I did not always see eye to eye, but I always \nknew he did what he thought was right.\n  Mr. President, I am grateful to have been able to serve alongside \nSenator Rockefeller these past 30 years. He's a man of deep conviction, \nand a man utterly devoted to the people of his home state of West \nVirginia. I wish the very best for him, his wife Sharon, and their \nfamily as they enter the next chapter of their lives.\n\n\n                               Mark Pryor\n\n  Madam President, I also honor my friend Mark Pryor. For 12 years \nSenator Pryor has served the people of Arkansas in this body. He is \nindependent, open-minded, and hard-working. He will be missed.\n  Senator Pryor comes from a distinguished Arkansas political family. \nHis father, David Pryor, was Governor of and later Senator from \nArkansas. Mark was born in Fayetteville, AR, and attended college at \nthe University of Arkansas. He received a law degree from the \nUniversity of Arkansas School of Law and then spent several years in \nprivate practice.\n  In 1991, Senator Pryor was elected to the Arkansas House of \nRepresentatives. Eight years later he was elected Attorney General of \nArkansas. In 2002, Mark won election to the U.S. Senate from Arkansas, \nwinning the same seat his father once held.\n  In the Senate, Mark has distinguished himself through his \nindependence and his willingness to reach across party lines. Although \nMark and I have not always agreed, I have always known he has acted in \nwhat he firmly believes are the best interests of his State.\n  Senator Pryor has served on a number of important committees during \nhis time in the Senate, including the Appropriations Committee, the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation. I have been fortunate to work \nwith him on a number of important pieces of legislation, on topics \nranging from medical care to homeland security to victim restitution. \nHe has been a strong partner in these efforts, and I have been grateful \nto have him as an ally.\n  Senator Pryor is a decent and thoughtful man. He has served his State \nhonorably. I wish him and his family the very best.\n\n\n                               John Walsh\n\n  Madam President, finally I pay tribute to Senator John Walsh. I have \nknown John for only a brief time, but I know that he is a good man who \nhas served his country well.\n  Senator Walsh began his service to our country long before he came to \nthe Senate. He joined the Montana National Guard right after high \nschool-the start of an impressive military career. John served 8 years \nas an enlisted U.S. Army soldier before he was commissioned as a Second \nLieutenant in 1987. As an officer, he distinguished himself and quickly \nrose through the ranks.\n  Senator Walsh led the 163rd Infantry Battalion in Iraq, commanding \nmore than 700 Army National Guard soldiers in combat. He later received \nthe Bronze Star and the Combat Infantryman's badge for his service. In \n2008, Governor Brian Schweitzer appointed John the Adjutant General of \nMontana's National Guard. As Adjutant General,\n\n[[Page S6778]]\n\nJohn oversaw the command of thousands of troops. These soldiers and \ntheir families looked to him for leadership and strength, and he always \ndelivered.\n  Senator Walsh moved from military service to public office when he \nbecame Montana's Lieutenant Governor in 2013. Governor Steve Bullock \nappointed John to fill former Senator Max Baucus's seat in February \n2014, making John the first Iraq War veteran to serve as a Senator.\n  Though his time here in the Senate was brief, Senator Walsh was an \nactive member of the Committee on Rules and Administration; the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry; and the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation. He always treated me and our \nother colleagues with the utmost kindness and respect.\n  Senator Walsh is a good man who has dedicated his life to serving our \ncountry and keeping us safe. I wish him, his wife Janet, and their \nchildren the very best.\n\n\n                               TOM COBURN\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, at the close of each session of Congress \nit is our tradition to take a moment to express our appreciation and \nsay goodbye to those of our colleagues who will be retiring at the \nsession's close. It is always a bittersweet moment to reflect on the \nimportant contributions our friends have made as they worked so hard to \nrepresent their States and our Nation.\n  Such an individual is Tom Coburn and that is just one of the reasons \nwhy we will miss him. Tom always has and always will be a strong voice \nfor conservative values and principles. There are not many who can \nexpress their beliefs with the same kind of clarity and power he brings \nto the issues the Senate takes up for deliberations.\n  I will always believe that Tom has been so successful in his career \nas a political leader and a doctor because he began his life with one \nof the greatest of all advantages--he was born in Wyoming, in Casper. \nThat was not all. He graduated from Oklahoma State University with a \ndegree in accounting. As an accountant myself I was not surprised by \nthat. His love of accounting, his fondness for numbers and details, and \nhis Wyoming birth all help to explain his power of persuasion.\n  I am kidding about that but one thing that is true about his \nbackground is how his love of numbers and his understanding of budgets \nand accounting practices has helped him to understand the financial \nproblems we currently face as a nation and the importance of taking \naction to address them before they get so far out of hand we will be \njeopardizing the future of our children and our grandchildren.\n  That would have never happened on Tom's watch. Grandfathers are like \nthat. With one eye on the bottom line and the other on the future of \nour Nation, Tom has developed an amazing knack for finding ways to cut \nwaste and save money, time and effort. For Tom it is clear, if it is \nnot worth doing at all, it is not worth doing well.\n  His insight and his immediate grasp of the essence of so many \ncontroversial and complicated issues has made him a great asset on the \ncommittees on which he has served. His willingness to get involved and \nlead on some pretty difficult issues has enabled him to make a \ndifference that will be remembered around here for quite a while.\n  In our deliberations one of Tom's great weapons has been his mastery \nand understanding of the facts surrounding his positions on the issues \nwe have taken up in committee and on the floor. He is an excellent \nspeaker and when he talks we are all very attentive. The reason why is \nsimple. If you agree with him you want to know what his views are so \nyou will be able to strengthen your own arguments on the bill with some \nof his reflections and recommendations. If you disagree with him you \nwill still want to hear him speak so you will know what the toughest \narguments are you will be faced with during our deliberations.\n  No matter what side you are on, it is rare that anyone has ever \nquestioned his facts. They may not like them--but you can not avoid \nacknowledging them.\n  In addition, as a father, a grandfather and a physician, Tom has been \nan outspoken advocate on health and medical issues. During his career \nhe has worked to increase the access of seniors to the health care \nservices they need. He has also been active in efforts to try to \ncontrol health care costs and protect the right to life of the unborn.\n  He has such a strong kinship with the delegations of the West because \nTom has a strong and heartfelt understanding of the challenges of our \nurban communities. I have often said one of our great battles here in \nWashington is to help our colleagues get a deeper understanding of the \ndifference in life in the large eastern cities and the smaller rural \ncommunities of the West. It is a crucial difference that must be \nunderstood to get a better sense of what is needed to help both our \nrural and urban communities to grow and prosper.\n  In the next session I know we will miss him, his understanding of our \nconservative values and principles and his commitment to this \ngeneration and the next--and beyond. Tom knows that if future \ngenerations are to have it as good as we have we will all have to learn \nto get along with a little less.\n  Now Tom is closing that great chapter of his life that contains his \nservice in the House and the Senate. It has not been easy. The House \nand Senate are very different places in which to work--and make \nprogress but Tom has managed to do it--and he has the results to show \nfor his efforts.\n  Thank you, Tom, for all you have done to make our Nation a better \nplace to live. We are grateful for your service, for your vision for \nAmerica and most of all, your commitment to the future of Oklahoma and \nour Nation. Please keep in touch with us. I am going to keep your \nnumber on speed dial in my office so I'll have it when one of those \ndays comes along when I need a thoughtful word or two for a debate or a \ncommittee session. As the saying goes facts are tough and powerful \nthings and when it comes to those issues in which he truly believes so \nis Tom Coburn.\n\n\n                              TIM JOHNSON\n\n  Madam President, it is a tradition here in the Senate to take a \nmoment before the end of each session of Congress to express our \nappreciation for the service of those Members who will be retiring at \nthe end of the year. It is always a difficult time to lose some of our \nbest and brightest. One fellow Senator I know we will all miss is Tim \nJohnson.\n  Tim has had quite a remarkable career and legacy of service to South \nDakota of which he should be very proud. He came to the Senate to work \nfor the people of his State and he did such a good job they kept \nsending him back. It is been a mutual admiration society--the people of \nSouth Dakota and Tim.\n  Tim followed a proven path of success for his service in Congress by \nfirst serving in the South Dakota State Legislature. He had a knack for \ngetting things done there that it preceded him to serve in the House as \nSouth Dakota's at-large Representative. He quickly developed a \nreputation in the House as someone who had an abundance of good ideas. \nAs a freshman he had a list of bills he had dropped in that was longer \nthan any other freshman in the House. It was clear to everyone that Tim \nwas the kind of person who knew how to get results.\n  Tim and I were part of the same freshman class of the Senate. Over \nthe years I have enjoyed having a chance to come to know him. He has \nproved to be a good friend, a great ally and someone who was willing to \nwork with members on all sides to get things done for South Dakota and \nour Nation.\n  For me, it meant a great deal to have a Senator from a neighboring \nState who had an understanding of our agriculture industry. As I have \noften said, urban life is very different from rural life and it was \ngood to have someone to work with whose background made those issues \nand the need for action clear to him.\n  That is one of the reasons why Tim has such a strong understanding of \none of the key issues of the West--water. For many of us water is \nsomething that we take for granted. It is easy. You turn on the tap and \nyou can have as much as you want.\n  Unfortunately, for our rural communities, it is not that easy. Water \nis a precious commodity--down to the last drop. In fact, just about \neveryone from the West has heard the old adage, ``Whiskey is for \ndrinking, Water is for fighting!''\n\n[[Page S6779]]\n\n  It is a message that has stayed with Tim throughout his service in \nthe House and the Senate. It has been a priority for him to ensure that \ngood, clean water supplies are available to everyone in South Dakota \nand the West. That is why you will find his legislative record of \naccomplishments filled with his efforts to pass infrastructure projects \nto ensure our water supplies would be both reliable and available.\n  I could go on about his other accomplishments and our work together \non agriculture issues but I would be here for quite a long time and not \nbegin to make a dent in what he has been able to achieve during his \ncareer. Let me just say that the work Tim began in the State \nLegislature and continued when he came to Congress has helped to make \nSouth Dakota what it is today. I think by any standard he has done a \ngood job and made the people of his home State proud.\n  Through the years, Tim has had some health problems, but he never let \nthem stop him or slow him down in his work for South Dakota. Sometimes \nI think of him as a warrior--a quiet one--who is blessed with a spirit \nto work for the people of South Dakota that just can not be diminished.\n  When I think of Tim I will always think of him as someone who leads \nthe best way, by example. I have learned a lot from him over the years \nand I think we have made a difference together in our shared commitment \nto our Nation's agriculture industry. We have worked on a lot of bills \ntogether and by placing both our names on a bill we made it a \nbipartisan effort that I would like to think drew a lot of other \nMembers to our side to work with us.\n  Thank you, Tim, for your service, not only to South Dakota but to the \nWest and to all our Nation. You have a lot to look back on with the \nsatisfaction that comes from having done a job and done it well. Diana \njoins in sending our best wishes to you for your hard work and \ndetermined effort to address the problems and challenges of our Nation. \nThanks, too, for your friendship. Good luck on the next chapter of the \ngreat adventure of your life.\n\n\n                               Carl Levin\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I wanted to speak today about Senator \nCarl Levin and his years of service to the Senate and the people of \nMichigan. Senator Levin has served 36 years and is Michigan's longest \nserving senator.\n  John F. Kennedy once said that ``leadership and learning are \nindispensable to each other.'' Senator Levin's time here has been an \nillustration of that statement, and I have experienced this firsthand \never since I arrived in the Senate in 2007 and sought his guidance on \ndifficult issues like the war in Iraq. He is one of the best informed \nand knowledgeable members of the Senate.\n  Carl Levin has been a leader for years on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee and the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. Senator \nLevin has served as the Democratic leader of the Armed Services \ncommittee since 1997, a term that overlapped with several defining \nevents for U.S. national security, including the terrorist attacks on \nSeptember 11, 2001, the beginnings of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, \nthe operation against Osama bin Laden and the current conflict against \nthe terrorist group ISIS. Chairman Levin has guided our caucus through \nthe National Defense Authorization Act process every year, working to \nensure members have an opportunity to include their priority issues in \nthe bill. I am grateful for Senator Levin's support of my efforts to \nensure Afghan women and girls remain at the forefront of our \nAfghanistan policy through this transition period. One of Senator \nLevin's most important legacies will be his thoughtful and principled \nopposition to shifting attention away from the fight against al Qaeda \nin Afghanistan to Iraq. Our caucus will miss Carl Levin's steady hand \nguiding us through these important matters.\n  At the helm of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Senator \nLevin has led the charge against some of the worst abuse and corruption \noccurring in our country. Under Senator Levin's leadership the \nsubcommittee conducted an eighteen month investigation into the causes \nof the financial crisis that culminated in four hearings in April 2010. \nThe hearings brought forth information that helped craft the Wall \nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. He also led an \ninvestigation into abusive and unfair practices of the credit card \nindustry, which would lead to the Credit Card Accountability \nResponsibility and Disclosure Act, along with investigations into tax \nshelters, offshore tax havens and Federal contractor tax delinquency, \namong other issues. In 2012, the National Journal wrote that ``the \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations is one of the few institutions \nin Congress that's still working. Carl Levin is a big reason why.''\n  Carl Levin's legacy can be summed up in one word: integrity. His \ncommitment to our security and our servicemembers is incomparable. We \nwish him well as he returns to Michigan and moves on to new challenges \nand I thank him for his service.\n\n\n                               Tom Harkin\n\n  Madam President, I also wanted to speak about my colleague Tom Harkin \nwho will be retiring at the end of this Congress. I commend him for his \n40 years of service in Congress for the people of Iowa.\n  Senator Hubert Humphrey once said that the moral test of government \nshould be how it treats those in the dawn of life, our children; those \nin the twilight of life, our older citizens; and those in the shadows \nof life, people with disabilities, among others. Tom Harkin's work in \nthe House and Senate has been a testament to what Senator Humphrey \nsaid. Senator Harkin has never hesitated to stand up and fight for \nthose without power. He is also proud of the legacy of the Great \nSociety under President Lyndon Johnson and never shies away from \nreminding us of the work that was done then, or how much more we still \nhave to do.\n  When it comes to protecting and championing people with disabilities, \nthere is no equal to Tom Harkin. He helped write the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, ADA, of 1990 and the ADA Amendments Act of 2008. \nThese bills did for people with disabilities what the civil rights acts \nof the 1950s and 1960s did for African-Americans. He authored the \nTelevision Decoder Circuitry Act to create universal closed captioning \nand he expanded services for children with disabilities under the \nIndividuals with Disabilities in Education Act, IDEA. Under the \nWorkforce Investment Opportunity Act, he enhanced employment \nopportunities for young people with disabilities and under the \nAffordable Care Act he created the Community First Choice Option to \ngive states that offer services to people with disabilities outside of \nnursing homes extra federal funding.\n  Senator Harkin pushed the issue of prevention and the health and \nwellness of Americans long before those issues became national themes. \nSenator Harkin wrote the prevention title in the Affordable Care Act \nand introduced the first bill that allowed the Food and Drug \nAdministration, FDA, to regulate tobacco. He is also the reason the \nword ``Prevention'' is included in the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention's name. Child labor is another area where Tom was ahead of \nthe curve. The Clinton Administration's Executive Order, ``Prohibition \nof Acquisition of Products Produced by Forced and Indentured Child \nLabor,'' was backed by Senator Harkin and he helped obtain the adoption \nand Senate ratification of United Nations Convention 182, a treaty that \ncalled for the elimination of the worst forms of child labor.\n  On a personal note, I want to express my appreciation to Chairman \nHarkin and his staff on the HELP Committee for their help in getting \nthree bills I introduced this Congress passed into law--the Children's \nHospital GME Support Reauthorization Act, the Emergency Medical \nServices for Children Reauthorization Act and the Traumatic Brain \nInjury Reauthorization Act. Without the efforts of Chairman Harkin and \nhis team, these bills would not have moved forward.\n  The late Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, once said that \n``Politics is not just about power and money games, politics can be \nabout the improvement of people's lives, about lessening human \nsuffering in our world and bringing about more peace and more \njustice.'' Tom Harkin is a living example of those words. Our Nation \nand our world are better today because of his life of service.\n\n\n                            Jay Rockefeller\n\n  Madam President, as the 113 Congress comes to a close, the time has \ncome to\n\n[[Page S6780]]\n\nsay goodbye to several colleagues and friends who will leave at the end \nof this Congress. Today, I would like to pay tribute to our friend and \ncolleague, Jay Rockefeller. Senator Rockefeller has served the people \nof West Virginia for 50 years, the last thirty of them in the United \nStates Senate.\n  While Senator Rockefeller has accomplished many notable things in his \ndecades of service, you can really sum up much of what he did for our \ncountry in one word--kids. Nelson Mandela once said ``There can be no \nkeener revelation of a society's soul than the way in which it treats \nits children.'' Jay Rockefeller worked tirelessly to ensure that we \nnever lost sight of our children as we worked on issues large and \nsmall.\n  One key example of his advocacy is the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram or CHIP as it is better known. In the 1990s, members like Jay \nRockefeller came together and created CHIP to ensure low-income \nchildren of working parents had access to health care. When my father \nwas governor of Pennsylvania, he signed into law the CHIP program that \ninitially insured over 50,000 children across the state and served as a \nmodel for the national program. On a personal level, I thank Senator \nRockefeller for helping to expand this program to children around the \ncountry and I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure CHIP \nremains strong for children in the years ahead.\n  In 2009 health care reform was on the agenda again and Jay \nRockefeller played a key role in getting a number of important \nprovisions included. He pushed to expand Medicaid and to make sure \ninsurance companies actually spent the bulk of dollars on health care \nand not administrative costs. He also worked to ensure that information \nprovided to consumers buying insurance on the exchange could be \nunderstood by all, and, of course, he led the charge to protect CHIP \nkids and make sure they did not end up with the short end of the stick.\n  Senator Rockefeller's work extends far beyond health care and \nchildren. Coal miners and their families have had no better friend in \nthe Senate than Jay Rockefeller. He has tirelessly fought and won \nbattles to protect their health, safety and pensions while also \nprotecting and preserving Black Lung benefits for workers made sick by \ndoing their jobs. His advocacy in this body will be missed. Now it is \nup to the rest of us to carry the torch.\n  Senator Rockefeller is quoted as follows in the Charleston Daily Mail \nlast year:\n  ``Rockefeller said he knew all the Kennedys well but liked Bobby \nbest. `Because he struck me,' Rockefeller said. `He had a soul, and \nthere are a lot of photographs of him in West Virginia later when he \nran for president sitting on a slag heap, looking mournful, looking off \ninto the distance, thinking, `Why does this condition exist, what can I \ndo?' ''\n  Jay Rockefeller also has a soul and he has spent his life asking \nthose same questions and finding ways to make things better. We will \nmiss him in the Senate. We will miss his conscience and his voice, but \nwe will never forget his example. I thank him for his decades of \nservice and wish him well.\n\n\n                             Mary Landrieu\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Madam President, I honor my friend and colleague from \nLouisiana, Senator Mary Landrieu, who is departing the Senate at the \nend of this year. Her career in public service began 34 years ago when \nshe was elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives. During that \ntime and in her service in the United States Senate, she has proved \ntime and again that the people of Louisiana could not have asked for a \nbetter advocate and fighter on their behalf.\n  It is tough to describe someone like Senator Landrieu. Senator \nLandrieu is selfless, dedicated, tenacious, and resilient, but these \nare just words that, while accurate, fail to truly capture who this \nwoman is and what she stands for. It is only by looking at Senator \nLandrieu's significant accomplishments that someone can truly begin to \nunderstand the depths of her selflessness, dedication, and resiliency. \nDuring my time in the Senate, I have seen Mary embody these words like \nfew others in this body.\n  Senator Landrieu and I both come from large families. I know the \nimpact being one of seven children had on me growing up and I am sure \nSenator Landrieu can attest to how big of an impact being one of nine \nchildren had on her. During her time in public service, Senator \nLandrieu has worked hard to ensure that all children can benefit from \nhaving a family to call their own. Senator Landrieu has worked \nextensively with the Angels in Adoption program since its inception, \nand cochaired the Congressional Coalition on Adoption and the \nCongressional Foster Care Caucus. Senator Landrieu's work has changed \nthe lives of children across Louisiana, the country, and around the \nworld. Because of her work, there are countless children who are now \nable to feel the love and benefits of having a family.\n  In 2005, Louisiana was victim of one of the worst natural disasters \nto ever hit this country. Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans and \nLouisiana the likes of which this country has rarely seen. With one of \nthe country's great cities devastated and in ruins, it was Mary \nLandrieu who took the lead on recovery efforts. It was Mary Landrieu \nwho held FEMA's feet to the fire to better serve Louisianans. It was \nMary Landrieu who helped direct billions of dollars in recovery funds \nto the State. It was because of Mary Landrieu that the great State of \nLouisiana has bounced back strong as ever.\n  Senator Landrieu's leadership did not end with the recovery and \nrebuilding efforts. Following the passage of the Biggert-Waters Flood \nReform Act in 2012, Senator Landrieu was one of the first to recognize \nand sound the alarm on the impending problems homeowners would face \nwith unreasonably high flood insurance rates. Because of her early \nrecognition of these problems and her proactive approach to finding \nsolutions, Congress was able pass a bill preventing thousands of people \nacross the country from being forced to pay disastrously high flood \ninsurance premiums.\n  I have also had the privilege of working with Senator Landrieu on \nenergy issues. There is no better advocate in the Senate on energy than \nSenator Landrieu. I came here with the intent of learning everything \nthat I could from Senator Landrieu. My only regret is that there was no \nway to fully take in all of her knowledge in the brief time that I have \nbeen here. That is a testament to the incredible work that she has done \nover her career to advance a pragmatic energy policy for this country, \nwork that I hope to continue in the years ahead building upon the \nenergy legacy that Senator Landrieu will leave behind. A word you hear \noften when people describe Senator Landrieu is tenacious, and this was \nnever more apparent than on her work to advance the Keystone XL \nPipeline. Anyone who watched Senator Landrieu work that bill and work \nbehind the scenes to get the votes knows that she will fight to the \nvery last second for what she believes in and that the word ``can't'' \ndoesn't exist in her vocabulary. Senator Landrieu single-handedly \nforced this bill to the Senate floor and brought us closer than we have \nbeen in 6 years to approving this project once and for all. Senator \nLandrieu's pragmatic approach to this issue and willingness to embrace \nsolutions over politics stands as an example for the rest of the Senate \nto strive for.\n  Senator Landrieu always looked out for the energy interests of her \nState, while recognizing the need to provide and protect her gulf coast \ncommunities. She has pushed for increased LNG exports that would bring \nnew jobs and significant investment to her State. She also has been \ninstrumental in expanding oil exploration and production in the Gulf of \nMexico, but while doing so she has made sure that her coastal \ncommunities receive a bigger share of the royalties and revenue to \nmitigate any impacts from the development. Working for jobs and \neconomic development and protecting those most impacted by this \ndevelopment, that is a pretty good legacy to leave behind in Louisiana.\n  The Landrieu family name comes with a long history of public service \nin Louisiana. The Landrieus, known for their big personalities that are \neclipsed only by their accomplishments in office, can rest easy knowing \nthat Mary has more than lived up to the family name. The Senate, \nLouisiana, and the country, are better off because of the work Mary \nLandrieu has done in the\n\n[[Page S6781]]\n\nSenate. I know I am not alone in saying that we will miss having her \nhere. I also know I am not alone in saying that I am sure her work is \nnot done. I wish her luck in this next chapter of her life and look \nforward to seeing the tremendous work she will accomplish outside of \nthis Chamber.\n\n\n                               Mark Pryor\n\n  Madam President, I also wish to honor my colleague, Senator Mark \nPryor, who will be leaving the Senate at the end of this Congress. \nSenator Pryor has been a tireless champion for the people of Arkansas \nfor 12 years in this legislative body. However, his commitment and \ndedication to the State of Arkansas is reflected not only in his work \nhere, but in the public service he and his family have given for \ndecades.\n  As the son of the former Governor and U.S. Senator, Senator Mark \nPryor grew up in a family which embodied public service, instilling his \ninterest and desire to do the same in his career. After attending the \nUniversity of Arkansas and working in the private sector as an \nattorney, he turned his sights to public service. While serving as a \nmember of the Arkansas House of Representatives and then as attorney \ngeneral for the State of Arkansas, Senator Pryor honed his \nunderstanding of the needs of the State and developed strong \nconnections through its institutions which served him well throughout \nhis career. It was here that I first met Mark. He was serving as \nattorney general in Arkansas at the same time I was serving as attorney \ngeneral in North Dakota. I was immediately impressed with this young \npublic servant and grew to understand that he is intelligent and \nprincipled in how he approaches his life and career. In 2003, Senator \nPryor was elected U.S. Senator from Arkansas, reclaiming the seat his \nfather once held.\n  As a Senator, he served on various committees which allowed him to \nfight for the priorities of Arkansas, pass legislation and champion \ninitiatives which helped this Nation. During his tenure on the Armed \nServices Committee, Senator Pryor protected the interests of Arkansas \nservicemembers and their families. His work on the Appropriations and \nCommerce Committees created opportunities for growth in transportation, \nrural broadband, energy, and agriculture, all critical interests for \nArkansas. Leading these issues with bipartisan proposals and working \nclosely with his colleagues on marshalling these efforts Congress after \nCongress, Senator Pryor earned the respect of his colleagues for his \nquiet devotion and steadfast commitment.\n  Mark is a Senator who promotes common sense solutions--solutions that \nseek strong support and address some of the more important needs of \nthis Nation's citizenry. During my short time in the Senate, we served \ntogether on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and Small \nBusiness Committees. I very much enjoyed working with him and serving \ntogether for the benefit of others. I continue to find him to be a man \nof great honesty and integrity. This type of stewardship is to be \nadmired and appreciated by those inspired to serve on the local, State \nor Federal level.\n  I applaud my colleague for his years of tireless commitment in \ndefense of his home State, for his service in the Senate and this \nCountry. I wish the very best to him and his family in the years to \ncome.\n\n\n                              Mark Begich\n\n  Madam President, finally I pay tribute and recognize the \naccomplishments of a trusted ally and dear friend, Senator Mark Begich, \nwho will be leaving the Senate at the end of the term. Mark has been a \ntenacious and steadfast advocate for his constituents and the State of \nAlaska and a strong moderate voice during his years in the Senate.\n  I have had the honor and privilege to work with Senator Begich on \nboth the Indian Affairs and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittees. As someone who represents one of the most rural States in \nAmerica, he has an impressive understanding and compassion for the \nunique challenges rural communities face.\n  As a member of the Homeland Security Committee, he played a major \nrole in postal reform negotiations. He understood rural citizens rely \nmost on the Postal Service for critical deliveries of prescription \nmedicines, time sensitive bills, and other important communications. He \nknew that without a rural post office, many small, rural communities \nwould cease to exist.\n  During his tenure on the Indian Affairs Committee, he was dedicated \nto confronting and addressing the unpleasant truths about the Federal \nGovernment's treatment of Native people in our country. He understood \nthe threats facing subsistence rights, native languages, and rich \ncultural traditions, and fought to ensure they were given parity and \nrespect. Senator Begich also knew far too many Native women today \nexperience violence and sexual assault, particularly in remote areas, \nand so he fought for the tribal provisions in the reauthorization of \nthe Violence Against Woman Act--VAWA--and advanced his Safe Families \nand Villages Act to extend those protections to Native women in Alaska. \nHe has also been a fighter for American Indian and Alaska Native \nveterans and worked hard to increase their access to care at both \nIndian Health Service and Veteran Affairs facilities. His compassion \nfor indigenous issues extended to tribes in the lower 48 States and \nNative Hawaiians, and I know Native people across the country feel they \nhave lost a true champion with his departure.\n  Anyone who knows Senator Begich knows he is an intellectually curious \nand energetic person. He always approached issues from a solutions-\noriented mindset, which meant he was more tied to outcomes than to \nrhetoric, and the Senate was well-served by his presence. Senator \nBegich is also a devoted family man to his wife Deborah and young son \nJacob. I remind myself that our loss is their gain, as I am sure they \nare excited to have him home more. I truly enjoyed working alongside \nhim and look forward to when our paths cross again. I wish him \nincredible happiness and success in the next chapter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/12/senate-section/article/S6781-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO NANCY ERICKSON\n\n  Mr. THUNE.

Nancy began working for the Senate in 1989, when she accepted a \nposition working for Senator Daschle. In 2005, Nancy began serving as \nthe Democratic representative for the Senate's Sergeant at Arms. Then \nin 2007, Nancy became the 32nd person and the 6th woman to serve as \nSecretary of the Senate.

Madam President, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying \ntribute to the life and extraordinary accomplishments of former \nCongressman John Krebs, who recently passed away at the age of 87 in \nFresno, CA.\n  John was born on December 17, 1926, in Berlin, Germany. After Hitler \ncame to power, he escaped with his family to Tel Aviv. There, he became \na diamond cutter and joined the Haganah, a Jewish underground \norganization that supported independence from Britain and the \nestablishment of an independent Jewish state.\n  John moved to California in 1946 to attend the University of \nCalifornia at Berkeley and after graduating in 1950, he became a United \nStates citizen in 1952. Following two years in the U.S. Army, John \ngraduated from the University of California Hastings College of Law and \npracticed law for three decades.\n  Throughout his remarkable life, John Krebs sustained a strong \ncommitment to public service. He worked on numerous state and local \ncampaigns and was a respected Democratic activist and community leader \nbefore his 1970 election to the Fresno County Board of Supervisors, \nwhere he was a courageous and eloquent advocate for his constituents.\n  In 1974, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, where \nhe\n\n[[Page S6782]]\n\nsuccessfully championed a bill to permanently protect 25,000 acres of \nthe Sierra National Forest known as Kaiser Ridge, saving this beautiful \narea above Huntington Lake from logging. Then, in 1978, Congressman \nKrebs took on an even greater challenge: fighting for legislation to \ntransfer Mineral King Valley from the Sequoia National Forest to \nSequoia National Park, thereby blocking plans to build a ski resort \nthat would have destroyed this pristine alpine valley in the southern \nSierra Nevada. Facing significant opposition, this was the toughest \nfight of his political career--one that may have cost him his seat in \nCongress--but John was proud of what he accomplished in preserving this \nnatural treasure for future generations to enjoy.\n  Years later, I was honored to introduce legislation designating \n40,000 acres of land, including the Mineral King Valley, as the John \nKrebs Wilderness. President Obama signed it into law in 2009, and that \nsummer some 200 friends, family and admirers gathered in Mineral King \nValley to dedicate this worthy tribute to John's courage and vision.\n  On Friday, November 14, more than 250 of John's friends and family \njoined together at Temple Beth Israel in Fresno to share memories and \nhonor this remarkable man's amazing legacy. John Krebs's extraordinary \nlife was a uniquely American story, and he will be truly missed. I \nextend my deepest sympathies to his wife and partner of 58 years, \nHanna, children Daniel and Karen, and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/12/senate-section/article/S6782-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         VOICE OF AMERICA UKRAINIAN SERVICE'S 65TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, today I honor Voice of America's \nUkrainian Service as it celebrates its 65th anniversary this week. VOA \nhas distinguished itself among the very best news organizations in the \nworld. For over 65 years, from the dark days of Stalin's rule to the \nregime of Vladimir Putin, VOA has served as a beacon of truth for \nUkrainian citizens. Throughout the Cold War, VOA supported the struggle \nfor freedom and gave hope to citizens living under repressive rule in \nSoviet Ukraine. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, VOA was the \nfirst to pick up the call of independence and take advantage of new \nopportunities to speak freely to the Ukrainian people.\n  The organization's long history of comprehensive reporting and \nobjective, reliable coverage proved ever more important in November \n2013 when demonstrations broke out against then-President Yanukovych's \ndecision not to sign an association agreement with Europe. Through all \nof this, VOA provided live video streaming and multimedia reporting \nfrom the center of the EuroMaidan demonstrations and was one of the few \nnews outlets fully covering Russia's annexation of Crimea. In its \ncoverage, the world saw the spirit of the Ukrainian people and stood \nwith them in their struggle for democracy, human rights, and the values \nof the transatlantic community. Through its continued coverage today, \nthe world is now witness to Russia's aggression and invasion.\n  More recently, VOA has been a critical source of information for the \nUkrainian people as Russia continues to advance its propaganda campaign \nacross the region, spreading disinformation and undermining the efforts \nof Ukraine's EuroMaidan reformers. Putin's control of information is a \nkey part of his strategy to rebuild post-Soviet Russia through \naggression, and he uses disinformation as a tool to complement his \ntransnational military campaigns and subvert democratic growth and \ndevelopment in Ukraine and across Eastern Europe. At a time when \nPutin's propaganda machine is working to deny reality and distort \nperceptions, Ukrainians rely heavily on VOA's credibility and accuracy, \nand its message of freedom, hope and human dignity.\n  VOA's reporters have worked under difficult and at times dangerous \nconditions. Previous governments have attempted to manipulate the media \nthrough repression and intimidation, and journalists were often \narrested or detained. Today, journalists attempting to report on the \nconflict in eastern Ukraine are being harassed, intimidated, and \nphysically attacked, constantly under threat of Russian thuggery. But \nthis has not stopped the brave men and women working for VOA Ukrainian \nService. They have worked through trying times, but have always \nmaintained the integrity and professionalism to which all journalists \ncan aspire.\n  Over the last 65 years, VOA has delivered thoughtful, comprehensive, \nand honest reporting when the Ukrainian people needed it most. I thank \nall members of VOA Ukrainian Service, past and present, for their \ntireless efforts and congratulate the organization on its 65th \nanniversary. Thank you for the work you do in service to the people of \nUkraine and the shared values we hold dear. Together, and with the \ninformation you provide, we can achieve the democratic aspirations of \nour people and make the world a better, safer place for all citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/12/senate-section/article/S6782-2", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO ROBERT F. HEIL, JR.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I salute an unsung hero in our \ngovernment, Mr. Robert F. Heil, Jr. Bob, as he is known to his friends, \nis retiring as the budget director at the Health Resources Services \nAdministration after 42 years of service to the Federal Government.\n  To be honest, I don't know Bob Heil but I have heard about him and \nhis work for years. Bob isn't the guy who stands up and gives speeches, \nhe's the guy that quietly makes things happen. Whenever there was a \nproblem with one of the community health centers in my State, my staff \nwould say ``I'll call Bob'' and I knew it would get straightened out. \nBob would always call to let us know when something good might happen, \nand if something bad was coming, he would call with a solution before \nwe knew there was a problem. He's a man you can trust.\n  In a town where political winds blow, Bob has won universal praise \nfrom both sides of the aisle for years. That's because he always \nanswers the phone, if he knows the answer he gives it, and he treats \neveryone with the same respect--no matter who is in the White House or \nwho is in control of Congress.\n  As Bob moves into another phase of his life, I thank him for his \nyears of work expanding access to health care for the least fortunate \namong us. Hubert Humphrey once said, ``the moral test of government is \nhow that government treats those who are in the dawn of life, the \nchildren; those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; those who \nare in the shadows of life; the sick, the needy and the handicapped.''\n  By that measure, Bob has made our society and our government a much \nbetter one. Thank you Bob, on behalf of myself, my staff, and all those \nwho will never know who to thank.

Madam President, I wish to talk about a friend, a \nmentor, a public servant, a husband, father, and son of Ohio, Bob \nBennett, who passed away at his home in Cleveland last Saturday. I was \nsorry to miss the funeral service in Ohio today for Bob because we are \nstill in session, but I did want to pay tribute to him in a lasting way \nthrough the Congressional Record.\n  Bob was a lawyer and a CPA, a man who loved sailing and giving back \nto the people of Ohio through his many charitable works such as his \ntime serving on the Board of University Hospitals in Cleveland. He was \na legend in Ohio and a giant of Ohio politics. He became chairman of \nthe Ohio Republican Party in 1988 and remained actively involved in \npolitics until his death last week. He was one of the longest serving \nState chairs of either party, was viewed as a true professional, and \ngained the respect of political leaders in both parties.\n  He was certainly successful in the world of politics. When he was \nfirst elected chairman, there were no statewide Republican office \nholders in Ohio. He went to work with the passion, the dedication, the \ncommitment that would become his trademark. He was a happy warrior, \nbeloved by those in his party and respected by his political rivals. He \nhad a vision not only for what the Republican Party could become but \nfor what it could accomplish for the people of Ohio.\n  Within a decade, under his leadership, Republicans controlled all \nthree\n\n[[Page S6783]]\n\nbranches of State government, from the Governor's mansion, to the \nstatehouse, to the supreme court.\n  He never stopped working. The day before he died, he was on the phone \nwith me, talking about 2016, giving me advice. He never let his illness \nhold him back, and he never stopped accomplishing things for the Ohio \nGOP. No one was more responsible for bringing the 2016 Republican \nNational Convention to Cleveland than Bob Bennett. Like so many times \nbefore, he had a vision, and he made it happen. It will be his lasting \nlegacy, and I only wish he could be there to see yet another of his \ndreams become reality.\n  That is the public story of Bob Bennett's life, and what a story it \nis. But those of us who knew him, who worked with him, who were \ninspired by him, we know that what made Bob Bennett great goes far \nbeyond what he accomplished on the political stage. The number of \npeople who he helped with advice, with guidance, or even just a kind \nword--the number of people who loved Bob Bennett as a close friend--\ncould fill this Chamber.\n  It has been said that we can measure a man's life by the friends he \nmakes, by the other lives he touches, by the people whose own journey \non this Earth is made better because of him. By that measure, the \nmeasure that he would have cared about the most, Bob Bennett was a \ngreat man, indeed.\n  He will be missed, but he won't be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/12/senate-section/article/S6783-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO KEITH DETERS\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN.

Madam President, I rise today to congratulate the \nReed family for earning the distinction of 2014's Arkansas Farm Family \nof the year.\n  This honor reflects the dedication of Nathan and Kristin Reed to \nfarming and the importance they play in Arkansas's number one industry. \nNathan is a fourth-generation farmer. I know that he will pass along \nhis passion for farming to the couple's young children; 2-year-old \ntwins Stanley ``Eldon'' and Jane-Anne and 1-year-old Katherine.\n  The Reeds farm cotton, corn and soybeans on their Lee County farm \nwhere they emphasize conservation and sustainability. Using variable \nrate technology for applying fertilizer and irrigation wells and center \npivot systems run off electric power, they save energy. Nathan is also \nconstantly learning about different crops and crop rotating practices \nby experimenting on the farm.\n  The Reeds are not only committed to farming and producing safe \nsupplies of food and fiber to the world, but they are also committed to \ntheir community. Nathan serves on numerous boards and committees.\n  As a long-time friend of the Reed family I understand the importance \nof farming, agriculture and community involvement that Nathan's father \nStanley and his mother Charlene encouraged. Nathan is following in \ntheir footsteps. They were named the Lee County Farm Family of the Year \nin 1984.\n  The Arkansas Farm Bureau's program honors farm families across the \nState for their outstanding work both on their farms and in their \ncommunities. This recognition is a reflection of the contribution to \nagriculture at the community and State level and its implications for \nimproved farm practices and management. The Reeds are well-deserving of \nthis honor.\n  I congratulate Nathan, Kristin, Stanley, Jane-Anne and Katherine on \ntheir outstanding achievements in agriculture and ask my fellow \ncolleagues to join me in honoring them for this accomplishment.

Detective Davis's father, Michael \nDavis, Sr., was a Riverside County Sheriff's Deputy who also tragically \nlost his life in the line of duty. Detective Davis's aunt and uncle \nboth retired from the Placer County Sheriff's Department, and Detective \nDavis's wife, Jessica, and his brother, Sergeant Jason Davis, worked by \nhis side until Michael's life was so senselessly cut short on October \n24.\n  Following his graduation from the Butte College Law Enforcement \nAcademy, Detective Davis began his career in public safety as a Reserve \nDeputy for the Placer County Sheriff's Department in 1996. He later \njoined the Auburn Police Department as a Patrolman before returning to \nthe Sheriff's Department in 1999 as a Deputy. In 2005, he was promoted \nto become a Homicide Detective in the Crimes Against Persons Division.\n  At a memorial service on November 4, Placer County Sheriff Edward \nBonner recalled that Detective Davis approached his job with ``respect, \ntact, and empathy.'' Others remembered Michael Davis as a quick-witted \nfamily man who lived his life to the fullest, spending time with his \nloved ones at family gatherings, coaching Little League, rooting for \nhis beloved San Francisco 49ers and Los Angeles Dodgers, and riding \nmotorcycles with friends.\n\n[[Page S6784]]\n\n  On behalf of the people of California, whom Detective Davis served so \nbravely, I extend my gratitude and deepest sympathies to his wife, \nJessica; daughters Angelique and Samantha; stepchildren Ivey and \nChayse; mother Deborah; brother Jason; and grandparents Bob and Joan.\n  We are forever indebted to him for his courage and sacrifice, and he \nwill be deeply missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/12/senate-section/article/S6784-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING DANNY P.

Both his father's career as a \nfirefighter and his own experiences growing up in a high-crime \nneighborhood helped shape Danny Oliver's commitment to strengthening \nhis community through public service. After graduating from the \nSheriff's Academy at the top of his class, Danny joined the Sacramento \nCounty Sheriff's Department in 1999.\n  During his 15-year career with the Department, Deputy Oliver worked \nin the main jail, patrol, and most recently as a member of the Problem \nOriented Policing, P.O.P., team, working closely with the community to \nreduce crime and improve public safety. Deputy Oliver knew that this \njob came with great personal risk. He understood it required a unique \nability to gain the trust of local leaders and residents. As Deputy \nOliver's colleagues and family recall so admiringly, he excelled at it \nall--arriving to work an hour early, answering every email, and \nattending countless community meetings in the neighborhoods he worked \nso diligently to protect.\n  Deputy Oliver's partner in life was his loving wife of 25 years, \nSusan Oliver. While Danny attended the Sherriff's Academy, Susan worked \ntwo jobs to support their family so her husband could follow his dream. \nTogether they raised two beautiful daughters, Melissa and Jenny. The \nfamily enjoyed spending time together and traveling, making many happy \nmemories before Danny's life was so senselessly and tragically cut \nshort.\n  On behalf of the people of California, whom Deputy Oliver served so \nbravely, I extend my gratitude and deepest sympathies to Susan, \nMelissa, Jenny, and Danny's parents, Bill and Jeri Oliver.\n  We are forever indebted to him for his courage and sacrifice, and he \nwill be deeply missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/12/senate-section/article/S6784-2", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING MARTIN LITTON\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the memory of Martin Litton, a legendary conservationist and \ngreat outdoorsman who died on November 30 at the age of 97.\n  Clyde Martin Litton was born in Los Angeles on February 13, 1917. As \nan English major at UCLA, he met his future wife, Esther, and became a \nconservation activist--forming a student group that kept roads out of \nCalifornia's wildlands. After graduating in 1939, he worked as the \npublicist for an Arizona dude ranch and as a tour guide at the Los \nAngeles Times. When war broke out, he joined the Army Air Corps and \nbecame a glider pilot flying missions behind enemy lines. In gentler \ntimes, he piloted his own plane and loved taking environmental and \npolitical leaders for wild rides into the wild.\n  After the war, Martin returned to the Times as a freelance writer, \nfiling stories and photos from long backpacking trips with his wife and \nyoung family. He later worked at Sunset magazine, first as travel \neditor and later as senior editor.\n  In 1952, David Brower, the first executive director of the Sierra \nClub--which had hitherto been a hiking and outdoors group with little \ninvolvement in public policy--enlisted Litton to help him fight the \nBureau of Reclamation's plan to build two dams at Dinosaur National \nMonument, and the group successfully lobbied Congress to scuttle the \nplan by 1956. That battle helped transform the Sierra Club into the \npowerful national advocacy organization we know today, with Litton \nsupporting the Club's activism as a member of the national board from \n1964 to 1972.\n  Along with his good friend Brower, Litton is widely recognized as one \nof the founders of the modern environmental movement. Brower called \nMartin his ``environmental conscience'' because he never compromised \nhis principles as he led the conservation movement to some of its \ngreatest victories. With his eloquent writing, beautiful photographs, \nand fiery rhetoric, he inspired the efforts to keep dams out of the \nGrand Canyon, a ski resort out of the Sierras' pristine Mineral King \nValley, and logging out of the Giant Sequoia National Monument. He was \ninstrumental in the creation of Redwood National Park in 1968; 2 years \nlater, dissatisfied with the park's boundaries, he led the successful \nfight to protect an additional 48,000 acres.\n  A longtime oarsman and whitewater enthusiast, Litton also started a \ncompany in 1971 to take tourists through his beloved Grand Canyon in \nsmall wooden boats. He maintained an active role in Grand Canyon Dories \nand at 87 became the oldest person ever to pilot a boat through the \nCanyon.\n  A fierce and determined defender of our nation's wildlands, Martin \nLitton was a force of nature--and a force for the preservation of \nnature. On behalf of the people of California, who have benefitted so \nmuch from his life work, I send my deepest gratitude and condolences to \nhis beloved wife, Esther; children John, Donald, Kathleen, and Helen; \nfive grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. Martin's memory and \nlegacy will live on with everyone who loves America's priceless natural \nheritage, which he did so much to preserve and protect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/12/senate-section/article/S6784-3", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING LOWCOUNTRY STUDENTS\n\n Mr. SCOTT.

Madam President, today I wish to honor the heroic \nservice of Loren Duke Abdalla, a member of the Yankton Sioux Tribe and \nthe great grandson of the great Chief Running Bull. Corporal Abdalla, \nbetter known as ``Duke'', is a brave Marine who fought courageously in \nthe Pacific Theater of World War II, earning the Purple Heart.\n  Duke enlisted into the U.S. Marine Corps in October of 1943. After \nfinishing his basic training at the age of 18, he was sent to the \nisland of New Caledonia before being assigned to Pavuvu Island \nalongside the First Marine Division, 1st Regiment, 1st Battalion, A \nCompany, 1st Platoon. Shortly after his training on Pavuvu Island, \nDuke's regiment was given orders to invade the Island of Peleliu on \nSeptember 15, 1944.\n\n[[Page S6785]]\n\nHis regiment worked its way toward Bloody Nose Ridge, where they became \nsurrounded on three sides and suffered heavy casualties. Despite \npersistent enemy fire, receiving shrapnel wounds in both of his legs, \nand blasts blowing out both his ear drums, Duke fought hard through the \n6-day battle. In the end, Duke was one of only 29 survivors of his \nbattalion. He received the Purple Heart and was promoted to corporal \nfor his heroic efforts and leadership at Peleliu.\n  After recovering from his numerous injuries, Duke resumed Active Duty \nand rejoined his brothers in arms in the Battle of Okinawa. A Company, \n1st and 3rd platoons were tasked with advancing on enemy positions, and \nDuke was assigned 3rd squad leader of the 1st platoon. On May 5, 1945, \n2nd Squad Leader CPL John Brady was burned by a phosphorous grenade. \nUnder heavy fire, Duke threw CPL Brady over his shoulder and carried \nhim to safety. Duke then swiftly returned to the frontline and \nproceeded to engage a series of six enemy machine gun nests. Duke was \nthe only member of his 12-person team to reach the fourth nest, and he \ncontinued moving forward and removed the last two nests by himself. His \nactions permitted the First Marine Division to safely advance up the \nridge.\n  While many Americans were honored for their courageous actions that \nday and throughout the campaign, Duke's heroic actions have largely \ngone unrecognized. I stand here today and ask that Duke's selfless and \nbrave actions be acknowledged and not soon forgotten. Duke received an \nhonorable discharge from the United States Marine Corps on February 28, \n1947, ending a military career that undoubtedly factored into American \nsuccesses in the Pacific Theater.\n  Duke is most deserving of recognition for his exemplary bravery in \nthe face of great danger and for putting the concerns of others always \nbefore his own. His selfless acts saved the lives of his colleagues and \nhelped to secure American victory in that great war. Our Nation will \nalways be grateful for Duke's dedicated service, and as thankful \ncitizens, we must never take for granted the courage displayed by \nheroes like Corporal Loren Duke Abdalla.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/12/senate-section/article/S6785-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING BRET KNAPP\n\n Mr. UDALL of New Mexico.

His commitment to excellence was a \ndefining element of his career, and, even as we mourn his passing, we \nare grateful for his service.\n  Over the years, Mr. Knapp established an outstanding reputation for \nprogrammatic achievements, as well as for technical depth, honest and \nopen communication, and fostering a strong sense of partnership and \ncollaboration. He was the principal associate director for the weapons \nprogram at LANL, which plays a crucial role in supporting our country's \ndefense, energy, and environmental needs. He also served as acting \ndirector at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.\n  Among his many accomplishments at LANL, Bret Knapp integrated the \nplanning and execution of the stockpile stewardship program, which is a \ncritical mission for the Nation. He received the NNSA Defense Program \nIndividual Award for Excellence in 2000 and two NNSA Defense Program \nAwards for Excellence in 1998 and 1999.\n  Those are, of course, the public and well-deserved accolades of an \nexemplary career.

Res. 601\n\n       Whereas mutually beneficial cooperation between the \n     Governments of the People's Republic of China and the United \n     States in promoting science and technology has made \n     tremendous strides since the signing of the Agreement Between \n     the Government of the United States and the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China on Cooperation in Science and \n     Technology, done at Washington January 31, 1979, which was \n     the first inter-governmental agreement since the United \n     States and the People's Republic of China established \n     diplomatic relations in 1979;\n       Whereas the Governments of the People's Republic of China \n     and the United States have become active partners in \n     fostering research and innovation since the signing of the \n     Agreement Between the Government of the United States and the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China on Cooperation \n     in Science and Technology in 1979;\n       Whereas cooperation in science and technology since 1979 \n     has brought numerous benefits to both countries, including--\n       (1) shared information on issues such as climate \n     variability, seismic activity, and agricultural science;\n       (2) joint publication of scientific and technological \n     research; and\n       (3) exchange of technical assistance and best practices in \n     areas such as food and pharmaceutical safety and \n     environmental cleanup;\n       Whereas the continued promotion of science and technology \n     in both countries holds the potential to advance shared \n     interests, as well as the interests of United States partners \n     and allies in the region and globally, including in \n     mitigating the effects of climate change, securing the \n     availability of water, food and energy, and improving public \n     health, disease prevention, and pandemic response;\n       Whereas the government-to-government relationship conducted \n     under the Agreement Between the Government of the United \n     States and the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     on Cooperation in Science and Technology now consists of some \n     30 subordinate agency-to-agency protocols, including--\n       (1) cooperation between the Department of Energy and the \n     Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology to form the Clean \n     Energy Research Center to explore advances in clean vehicles, \n     advanced coal technology, and building energy efficiency;\n       (2) cooperation between the Department of Agriculture's \n     Agricultural Research Service and the Chinese Ministry of \n     Science and Technology on agricultural biotechnology, natural \n     resource management, food safety, and similar issues;\n       (3) cooperation between the National Institutes of Health \n     and the counterparts in China, including the Natural Science \n     Foundation of China and Chinese Ministry of Science and \n     Technology to conduct basic and clinical biomedical research;\n       (4) cooperation between the Environmental Protection Agency \n     and the counterparts in China, including the Chinese Ministry \n     of Science and Technology and the Chinese Ministry of \n     Environmental Protection to support joint environmental \n     research, and to exchange best practices on environmental \n     legislation and enforcement;\n       (5) exchange of personnel between the Chinese Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention and the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention to develop information exchange and \n     response mechanisms for influenza pandemics;\n       (6) collaboration between the Food and Drug Administration \n     and food and medical regulators in China to enhance the \n     safety of imported food and medical products from China \n     through better information sharing and access to production \n     facilities; and\n       (7) collaboration between the Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention and Peking University Health Center (former \n     Beijing Medical University) to study child health issues and \n     health hazards caused by environmental factors;\n       Whereas many educational institutions in the United States \n     and China have established partnerships to further science \n     and technology research, including--\n       (1) Northwestern University, based in Evanston, Illinois, \n     which has developed strategic partnerships in China, such as \n     the Wanxiang Fellows Program, which allows Northwestern \n     students to study emerging energy challenges and renewable \n     energy innovations in the United States and China; and\n       (2) University of California, Davis, based in Davis, \n     California, which has partnered with China's Northwest \n     Agricultural and Forestry University in Shaanxi province to \n     establish the Sino-U.S. Joint Research Center for Food Safety \n     to promote international collaborative research for food \n     safety in China and the United States;\n       Whereas the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has \n     signed 97 inter-institutional cooperative partnership \n     agreements with various institutions that are headquartered \n     in China in the fields of engineering, food sciences, and \n     transportation, including a high-speed rail research \n     partnership between the university's Railway Transportation \n     and Engineering Center and China's oldest and most recognized \n     railway engineering school, Southwest Jiaotong University;\n       Whereas, on December 5, 2014, China and the United States \n     will commemorate the 30th anniversary, and renew for another \n     ten years, the CHELBI partnership, which has created the \n     largest joint venture engineering consulting firm in China, \n     having undertaken over 600 bridge, road, and other projects \n     the designs of which meet World Bank and Asian Development \n     Bank standards, and has made significant progress in \n     engineering knowledge-sharing for road, bridge, and other \n     project design and construction between the United States and \n     China;\n       Whereas several United States Department of Energy national \n     laboratories have established partnerships with research \n     institutions in China to advance energy research, including--\n       (1) Argonne National Laboratory in Lemont, Illinois, which \n     has worked with the China Automotive Technology and Research \n     Center (CATARC) to promote energy-efficient vehicle \n     technologies and clean transportation fuels in China since \n     2003; and\n       (2) Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, \n     California, which has formed the China Energy Group to work \n     collaboratively with groups in China to understand the \n     dynamics of energy use, improve energy efficiency, reduce \n     emissions in China, strengthen Chinese capabilities in energy \n     efficiency, and enhance relationships on energy efficiency \n     among Chinese, United States, and international institutions;\n       Whereas, in 2013, the State of California and the Chinese \n     Ministry of Commerce signed a Memorandum of Understanding to \n     establish a working group to deepen cooperation in fields \n     such as biological pharmaceuticals, information technology, \n     agriculture, and energy;\n       Whereas the exchange of ideas in science and technology and \n     shared research conducted in China and the United States \n     holds the potential to increase United States exports of non-\n     sensitive commercial technologies to China;\n       Whereas the agreement reached in November 2014 between the \n     United States and the People's Republic of China to expand \n     the scope of goods covered by the Information Technology \n     Agreement will further deepen trade, investment, and mutual \n     cooperation in science and technology;\n       Whereas collaboration in science and technology since 1979 \n     has provided both countries with the technological foundation \n     to make ambitious pledges to reduce future emissions of \n     carbon dioxide; and\n       Whereas people-to-people exchanges conducted under the \n     Agreement Between the Government of the United States and the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China on Cooperation \n     in Science and Technology have fostered mutual understanding \n     of both countries and have led to joint research in science \n     and technology: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the cooperation in science and technology \n     between the Governments of the United States and the People's \n     Republic of China since 1979;\n       (2) emphasizes the importance of open markets, intellectual \n     property rights, and the free exchange of information to the \n     development of science and technology; and\n       (3) expresses continued support for the principles of the \n     Agreement Between the Government of the United States and the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China on Cooperation \n     in Science and Technology, done at Washington January 31, \n     1979, to which both countries remain committed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/12/senate-section/article/S6790-2", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6790-S6791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4100.

FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The terrorist organization known as the Islamic State \n     of Iraq and the Levant and various other names (in this \n     division referred to as ``ISIL'') poses a grave threat to the \n     people and territorial integrity of Iraq, Syria, regional \n     stability, and the national security interests of the United \n     States and its allies and partners.\n       (2) ISIL holds significant territory in Iraq and Syria and \n     has stated its intention to seize more territory and \n     demonstrated the capability to do so.\n       (3) ISIL leaders have stated that they intend to conduct \n     terrorist attacks internationally, including against the \n     United States, its citizens, and interests.\n       (4) ISIL has committed despicable acts of violence and mass \n     executions against Muslims, regardless of sect, who do not \n     subscribe to ISIL's depraved, violent, and oppressive \n     ideology.\n       (5) ISIL has threatened genocide and committed vicious acts \n     of violence against religious and ethnic minority groups, \n     including Iraqi Christians, Yezidi, and Turkmen populations.\n       (6) ISIL has targeted innocent women and girls with \n     horrific acts of violence, including abduction, enslavement, \n     torture, rape, and forced marriage.\n       (7) ISIL is responsible for the brutal murder of innocent \n     United States citizens, including James Foley, Steven \n     Sotloff, and Abdul-Rahman Peter Kassig.\n       (8) It is the policy of the United States to work with \n     regional and global allies and partners to degrade and defeat \n     ISIL, to cut off its funding, to stop the flow of foreign \n     fighters to its ranks, and to support local communities as \n     they reject ISIL.\n       (9) The announcement of the anti-ISIL Coalition on \n     September 5, 2014, during the NATO Summit in Wales, stated \n     that ISIL poses a serious threat and should be countered by a \n     broad international coalition.\n       (10) President Barack Obama articulated five lines of \n     effort in the campaign to counter ISIL, including supporting \n     regional military partners, stopping the flow of foreign \n     fighters, cutting off ISIL's access to financing, addressing \n     urgent humanitarian needs, and contesting ISIL's messaging.\n       (11) The United States Government calls on its allies and \n     partners in the Middle East and North Africa that have not \n     already done so to join and participate in the anti-ISIL \n     Coalition.\n       (12) The United States Government has successfully \n     conducted airstrikes in Iraq, in coordination with Iraqi and \n     Kurdish security forces, to prevent humanitarian \n     catastrophes, protect vulnerable minority populations, repel \n     ISIL from areas of strategic importance, and demonstrate \n     support to communities in western and northern Iraq being \n     terrorized by ISIL.\n       (13) The United States Government has successfully \n     conducted airstrikes in Syria, in coordination with local \n     actors on the ground who demonstrate commitment and \n     capability in countering ISIL, in order to target ISIL \n     training camps and munitions facilities, stop sources of ISIL \n     funding, protect vulnerable minority populations, and target \n     extremist groups intent on attacking the United States and \n     its allies.\n       (14) United States and Coalition airstrikes to date have \n     succeeded in halting ISIL's advance in Iraq and Syria.\n       (15) The President should to the greatest extent possible \n     act in concert or cooperation with the security forces of \n     other countries in the region to counter the grave threat to \n     regional stability and international security posed by ISIL.\n       (16) The anti-ISIL strategy requires effective local \n     security forces in Iraq and Syria, and empowered political \n     leaders committed to leading inclusive, representative \n     governments that enable citizens in both countries to achieve \n     their legitimate aspirations and to live in peace and \n     security.\n       (17) President Obama stated on November 5, 2014, his \n     commitment to working with Congress to pass an authorization \n     for the use of military force for the anti-ISIL military \n     campaign.\n\n     SEC. __03.

We are in the Senate and \nwe are going to have to rearrange our schedules for the weekend.\n  There being no objection, the Senate, at 10:53 p.m., adjourned until \nSaturday, December 13, 2014, at 12 noon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/12/senate-section/article/S6794-5", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CONFIRMATIONS\n\n  Executive nominations confirmed by the Senate December 12, 2014:\n\n\n                          DEPARTMENT OF STATE\n\n       AMY JANE HYATT, OF CALIFORNIA, A CAREER MEMBER OF THE \n     SENIOR FOREIGN SERVICE, CLASS OF MINISTER-COUNSELOR, TO BE \n     AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND PLENIPOTENTIARY OF THE UNITED \n     STATES OF AMERICA TO THE REPUBLIC OF PALAU.\n       ROBERT C.
