Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 459, S. \n2578, the Protect Women's Health From Corporate Interference Act.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 459, S. 2578, a bill to \n     ensure that employers cannot interfere in their employees' \n     birth control and other health care decisions.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the \nRepublican leader, if any, there will be a period of morning business \nuntil 6 p.m. this evening, with Senators permitted to speak therein for \nup to 10 minutes each. There will be no rollcall votes during today's \nsession of the Senate. The reason for that is last week we were able to \nget a few things done. We were able to do some things around here the \nway we used to do them.\n  I know my Republican colleagues lament how things used to be. Well, I \nwas there. I know how things used to be. One of the things we used to \ndo is we would work out pieces of legislation, as we did on terrorism \ninsurance. We have a number of people who worked hard on that: Chairman \nJohnson, Senator Schumer--he worked with Ranking Member Crapo--and they \ncame up with a way forward on an important piece of legislation. There \nwill be some amendments. We will finish that legislation this week--\nvery important, important to our country, important to our economy, \nimportant to the construction industry. So I was very happy to see that \ndone. So there are no votes tonight, and that is the reason for that.\n  There will be no rollcall votes during today's session, as I \nmentioned. The next rollcall votes will be tomorrow at noon. Those will \nbe two cloture votes on nominees to be members of the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission.\n\n\n                          Suing The President\n\n  Mr. President, the Republicans have made a decision on a lawsuit \nagainst President Obama. It is difficult to understand how they have \nbecome so desperate that now they are talking about: Our issue of the \nday is not the minimum wage. Our issue of the day is not that women and \nmen get the same amount of money for doing the same work. The issue of \nthe day is not the crippling debt that is staggering this country; that \nis, student loan debt. Extended unemployment benefits--that is nothing \nthey are focused on. I could go through a long list of what is \nimportant to the middle class that they simply are ignoring. So what \nare they doing to solve the problems of this country? Suing the \nPresident.\n  Mr. President, listen to what they are suing him about. They have \nbeen broadcasting for weeks their intention to sue the President, but \nthey just did not know why. That is what they said, not I. Now, after \nmisstep after misstep after misstep, they know why they are suing the \nPresident; they want to litigate ObamaCare.\n  The Acting President pro tempore has done a remarkably good job of \ncalling out Republican Senators when they come to the floor and make \nthese ridiculously false statements, and I appreciate that. I think \neverybody in the country, if they do not, should appreciate what the \njunior Senator from Connecticut has done.\n  House Republicans have identified President Obama's delayed \nenforcement of employer obligations in the\n\n[[Page S4444]]\n\nAffordable Care Act as the centerpiece of that frivolous lawsuit. This \nprovision, which affects companies with 50 or more full-time employees, \nensures that employers pay their fair share if their employees receive \nhealth subsidies. But listen to this: The irony, of course, is that \nthis specific provision, which is in the bill that became law, came \nabout as a result of the Republicans wanting to put it in the bill. \nSenator Grassley, Senator Enzi, and former Senator Snowe--this was \nsomething they worked on with Senator Baucus and other Members to come \nup with this bill. They placed it in the bill. It became law.\n  Even more absurd is the fact that Republicans in Congress have long \ntargeted this specific provision of comprehensive health reform. In \nfact, just after President Obama announced the delay of the employer \nprovision, House Republicans voted on legislation to do the exact same \nthing--delay the so-called mandate. So they are suing the President of \nthe United States because he did what they wanted him to do--delay the \nmandate.\n  Every word I have spoken I wrote down in my own handwriting. That is \nwhat they wanted to do. They wanted him to do this. He did it and they \nsued him for doing what they wanted him to do. They could have \napplauded him.\n  House Republicans are trying something worthy of daytime television's \n``The People's Court'' on one of those channels you do not watch very \nmuch. There are a lot of court channels, but this would be one where \nyou would really have to be desperate to watch. They would not put it \non a channel that made any common sense.\n  So, to sum it up, Republicans create an employer obligation provision \nin the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act becomes law. \nRepublicans vilify the employer provision they themselves authored. \nRepublicans demand that the employer provision in ObamaCare be delayed. \nPresident Obama agrees to delay the employer provision, and House \nRepublicans sue President Obama for delaying the employer provision. Is \nthis weird? Is this weird? I can answer my own question. Yes, it is \nweird.\n  This is the behavior we have come to expect from the Republican Party \nthat is determined to do one thing: undermine this President. No matter \nthe issue, even when they ask him to do it, they oppose him on it. They \nsue him this time.\n  We have seen this so often in the Senate. It is not just in the \nHouse. Last week the Republicans filibustered a bill on which there \nwere 26 Republican cosponsors. That is a new one. More than half of the \nRepublican Senators put their names on a bill and then turned around \nand voted against it.\n  With this provision in the health care law, House Republicans are \nignoring the fact that they gave President George W. Bush a pass for \ndoing the exact same thing--delaying a specific provision of a \ncongressionally passed health care law. Then President Bush, through \nExecutive order, waived Medicare Part D penalties for seniors enrolled \nafter the deadline. He did this by Executive order. Republican \nleadership in the House did not consider suing President Bush for his \nadministration's delay of health care law. So they chose now to do \nthis. Why? Because it is President Obama.\n\n  While Republicans accuse President Obama of Executive overreach, they \nneglect the fact that he has issued far fewer Executive orders than any \ntwo-term President in the last 50 years. President George W. Bush \nissued 291 Executive orders. President Clinton issued 364 Executive \norders. President Reagan is the record holder; he issued 381 Executive \norders. President Obama is not close to their records. He is 109 behind \nPresident Bush. He is 182 behind President Clinton. He is 199 behind \nPresident Reagan. What is the President's tally to date? As I have \nindicated, he is behind them all--an 8-year President. He has issued \nonly 182.\n  Republicans' disdain for President Obama and health care reform has \nprevented them from accepting the obvious: ObamaCare is proving more \nand more successful every day. It seems as if every week--sometimes \nevery other day--there is some new study or survey showing how good \nObamaCare is, how it is helping American families.\n  Mr. President, the Commonwealth Fund:\n\n       The uninsured rate for people ages 19 to 64 declined from \n     20 percent in the July-to-September 2013 period to 15 percent \n     in the April-to-June 2014 period. An estimated 9.5 million \n     fewer adults were uninsured.\n\n  That is big-time stuff.\n\n       Young men and women drove a large part of the decline: the \n     uninsured rate for 19-to-34-year-olds declined from 28 \n     percent to 18 percent--\n\n  Remember when everybody said young people will run from this. They \nare not running from this. They are running to it--\n\n       with an estimated 5.7 million fewer young adults uninsured.\n\n  That is so important. Because of the high cost of health care \npreviously, young people--many of them--would not do it. Mr. President, \n5.7 million more would not sign up for any kind of health insurance. \nAnd what happens? Young people do not realize they get very sick also. \nThey get into accidents also. Bad things happen to young people, as \nthey do to middle-aged and older people. And younger people are signing \nup for ObamaCare.\n\n       By June, 60 percent of adults with new coverage through the \n     marketplaces or Medicaid reported they had visited a doctor \n     or hospital or filled a prescription; of these, 62 percent \n     said they could not have accessed or afforded this care \n     previously.\n\n  That is stunning. It is no wonder--it is no wonder--we have fewer and \nfewer Republicans coming down here giving these speeches about how bad \nObamaCare is.\n  A Gallup survey: ``In U.S., Uninsured Rate Sinks to 13.4% in Second \nQuarter.'' This deals with millions of people.\n\n       The uninsured rate in the U.S. fell 2.2 percentage points. \n     . . .\n\n  When you have 300 million people, 2.2 percent is a lot of people.\n\n       The previous low point was 14.4% in the third quarter of \n     2008.\n\n  So it is well below that.\n  The RAND Corporation: ``Changes in Health Insurance Enrollment Since \n2013.''\n\n       . . . . overall, we estimate that 9.3 million more people \n     had health care coverage in March 2014, lowering the \n     uninsured rate from 20.5 percent to 15.8 percent.\n\n  Stunningly important numbers.\n  So the evidence--not the shrill statements made by my colleagues over \nhere bemoaning the fact of how terrible things are--all the evidence \nindicates that the Affordable Care Act is helping millions of \nAmericans. You can say anything you want, but facts are nasty things. \nThey are nasty to the point that they are factual. Do not believe all \nthese crazy statements when there is no basis for it. It is helping--\nthis ObamaCare--Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. It is helping \nresidents of blue States, red States, and purple States.\n  How about the State of Kentucky, the home State of our Republican \nleader? Well over 400,000 Kentuckians have signed up for coverage \nthrough the Affordable Care Act. That is not a State with the \npopulation of Illinois or New York or California or Texas; it is a \nsparsely populated State.\n  Four hundred thousand Kentuckians have signed up for coverage. Even \nRepublicans love it. The Commonwealth Fund that I referred to found \nthat 74 percent of newly insured Republicans are happy with their \nObamaCare health coverage, but instead of embracing the good that \nObamaCare has done and working with Democrats to address any necessary \nfixes, Republicans would rather file a foolish and meritless lawsuit.\n  Is there anyone who believes this lawsuit has some basis? It is a \nsham--an effort to appease the tea party radicals in the House of \nRepresentatives. One Yale law professor was questioned on why the \nlawsuit is receiving so much media attention. Here is what he said: ``I \nsee this every day now, being covered as if it's, as if it's somehow \nnot a joke.'' It is a joke.\n  Another law professor from Harvard said: ``The lawsuit will almost \ncertainly fail, and it should fail, for lack of any Congressional \nstanding.'' Imagine how many lawsuits there would be if House \nRepublicans could sue the President every time they disagreed with him \nabout something--or some future President--but there is no reasoning \nwith the radical Republicans in the House or the tea party-driven \nMembers of the Senate.\n  House Republicans would rather waste taxpayer dollars than accept the\n\n[[Page S4445]]\n\nfact that their constituents, their very own neighbors, are benefiting \nfrom health care reform.\n  This is a phony trial that will come up. It is a show trial. It is \nwhat Republicans want.\n  I guess that is what they want, but if that is truly what they want, \nthey should go talk to Judge Judy. I think she would throw this case \nout in half a second. The Congress is no place for inane, politically \nmotivated litigation. I think Judge Judy would agree.\n  It is expensive and wasteful. It is wasting taxpayers' hard-earned \nmoney on something that is without any merit. Enough is enough. The \nfight over ObamaCare should be long since ended. The law is here to \nstay and, more importantly, newly insured Americans, all who have \nsigned up, not only those who are newly insured but those who have \nsigned up who had insurance before, want the law to stay just where it \nis.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the nomination \nof Norman Bay. President Obama has nominated Mr. Bay to be a \ncommissioner of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC. The \nPresident has announced that if Mr. Bay is confirmed, his plan is to \nelevate Mr. Bay to the position of chairman of FERC. Over the past few \nmonths there has been much discussion about whether the President \nshould have nominated Mr. Bay to be chairman, and I think there is very \ngood reason to ask whether the President really should have nominated \nMr. Bay at all.\n  In my view Mr. Bay is not qualified to be a commissioner, let alone \nto be chairman of FERC. Mr. Bay has only 5 years of working experience \nin the energy sector--a total of 5 years. This is less time than the \nKeystone XL Pipeline has been pending with the Obama administration.\n  During the nomination hearing, I specifically asked Mr. Bay about his \nlack of experience. In response, he cited his summer internship at a \nDepartment of Energy research facility during college--a summer \ninternship during college. With all due respect, this man does not have \nthe background, the qualifications, and certainly not the experience to \ntake on this important role.\n  The President has nominated Mr. Bay to replace FERC's current \nchairman Cheryl LaFleur. In contrast to Mr. Bay, whom the President has \nnominated to replace Ms. LaFleur, Ms. LaFleur has over 25 years of \nexperience in the energy sector. That includes 4 years as a \ncommissioner of FERC and 7 months as the chairman of FERC. I don't \noften agree with Ms. LaFleur's policies, but you cannot deny that she \nis qualified to serve.\n  Mr. Bay's lack of experience is not the only reason I oppose his \nnomination. There are a number of outstanding factual disputes about \nMr. Bay's tenure as the FERC's enforcement director. For example, there \nare serious allegations that the enforcement staff, during the time Mr. \nBay has been in charge, has violated basic principles of due process. \nThese allegations include the withholding of exculpatory evidence from \nsubjects of FERC investigations.\n  In May the Energy Law Journal published an article by William \nScherman, who was a former general counsel of FERC and by two other \nattorneys familiar with this situation, and they write: ``There is a \nwide-spread view that the FERC enforcement process has become lop-sided \nand unfair.''\n  They said that:\n\n       One need only to observe the fact that Enforcement Staff \n     denies, in case after case, the existence of exculpatory or \n     exonerating materials . . . only to . . . produce a subset of \n     those materials too late in the process to be of use . . . in \n     raising defenses.\n\n  The authors explain that ``one of the fundamental principles of due \nprocess is that the government is not permitted to hide information \nfrom the accused that may aid in his or her defense.'' They say that \n``[FERC] Enforcement Staff routinely fails to produce exculpatory \ndocuments''--routinely fails to produce exculpatory documents.\n  During Mr. Bay's nominating hearing, I asked him about these \nallegations. At first he denied the allegations were true, but then he \nstated he was ``not aware of any instance in which Enforcement Staff \nhas failed to produce exculpatory materials.''\n  So I asked him to clarify his remarks. I asked him whether the \nallegations were true or not. He pled ignorance.\n  With all due respect, this answer is inexcusable. This is his staff \ndoing his work under his direction. He should know whether they \nwithheld the evidence from defendants.\n  There are not only questions about his commitment to due process, but \nthere are also questions about the President's nominee on whether he or \nanyone else at FERC suggested that an enforcement action be settled in \nreturn for approval of a merger. So there are questions about whether \nan enforcement action should be settled in return for approving a \nmerger.\n  The ranking member of the energy committee asked all about this \nduring the nomination hearing. The ranking member of the committee \nasked Mr. Bay about the connection between FERC's enforcement \nsettlement with Constellation Energy and FERC's approval of \nConstellation's merger with Exelon.\n  The ranking member noted that FERC settled with Constellation the day \nbefore--1 day before it approved a merger between Constellation and \nExelon. In fact, the enforcement settlement, which Mr. Bay himself \nsigned, specifically mentions the merger between these two. The ranking \nmember of the Energy Committee asked Mr. Bay whether he is concerned \nabout the appearance of a quid pro quo between the settlement agreement \none day and the merger approval the next. Mr. Bay admitted he would be \nconcerned.\n  The ranking member then asked if he or others suggested to FERC that \nConstellation should settle the enforcement action in order to get its \nmerger approved. In response he said that ``[t]o the best of [his] \nrecollection'' he didn't make such a suggestion and that he did not \nknow what others at FERC--including his own staff--may have suggested.\n  With all due respect to Mr. Bay, his answer is, at best, hard to \nbelieve.\n  At the time FERC's enforcement settlement with Constellation was the \nlargest enforcement settlement completed in the history of the agency. \nSo they make this settlement, it is the largest enforcement settlement \nin the agency's history, and the next day they allow a merger which has \ncreated one of the Nation's largest utilities. Are we really to believe \nthat Mr. Bay doesn't remember what he or others at FERC said to \nConstellation? Can we really believe that?\n  I believe the energy committee or some other independent entity \nshould get answers to these and other questions surrounding Mr. Bay's \nrecord before we decide--this Senate--to confirm and promote him.\n  I know that some Senate Democrats are nervous about voting for Mr. \nBay--and I believe rightfully so. These Senate Democrats have said they \nwill vote for Mr. Bay only because they believe a so-called deal was \ncut with President Obama. Specifically, they say the President will \nallow Ms. LaFleur to continue serving as chairman for 9 months after \nher confirmation.\n  The President hasn't put it in writing, hasn't really told all of the \nMembers that. And even if the President had, this is no way for the \nSenate to be able to enforce it. The truth is this is\n\n[[Page S4446]]\n\na gimmick, and it is a gimmick invented specifically by Senate \nDemocrats so they can once again avoid standing up to President Obama \nand the Senate majority leader.\n  Let's be clear about what President Obama is asking the Senate to do. \nThe President is asking the Senate to demote Cheryl LaFleur from being \nchairman--she is a highly qualified woman, a Democrat with over 25 \nyears of experience in energy and 4 years of experience as a \ncommissioner of FERC--in order to promote an unqualified man.\n  Why should the Senate do this?\n  The Senate majority leader put it this way in the Wall Street \nJournal. He said: I don't want her. ``I don't want her as chair.'' He \nsaid: ``She has done some stuff to do away with some of [Chairman] \nWellinghoff's stuff.'' This is the majority leader of the Senate: ``I \ndon't want her as chair.''\n  In short the President and the Senate majority leader want a rubber \nstamp. By all indications, they will get that with Mr. Bay.\n  On May 20, during his confirmation hearing, Mr. Bay admitted that he \nwasn't even following EPA regulations and their impact on electric \nreliability in this country. Two weeks later on June 4, in response to \nwritten questions, he stated the EPA's regulations are ``manageable.'' \nWell, either he is an exceptionally quick study or he doesn't take \nelectric reliability seriously.\n  FERC is an independent agency. It needs a highly qualified leader, a \nleader whose record is beyond reproach, a leader who will resist \npolitical interference from the White House and the majority leader, \nand Mr. Bay is not that individual.\n  For these reasons, I am voting against Mr. Bay and urge all Members \nto do the same.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a wonderful \nman, Stephen Savage, the chief of the Plaistow Police Department, who \npassed away on Friday after a 3-year battle with cancer. We are deeply \nsaddened by the loss of Chief Savage, a beloved member of the Plaistow \ncommunity, who dedicated his life to serving his fellow citizens.\n  For Steve, family came first. He was a devoted father, husband, and \nbrother. We hold his wife Kristin and their sons Billy and Michael in \nour hearts, and we will keep them in our prayers. We share in their \ngrief and we will be there to support and comfort them during the \ndifficult weeks ahead.\n  From a young age Steve was called to serve, and he answered that \ncall. After graduating from Stevens High School in Claremont, NH, in \n1965, he enlisted in the Air Force and served our country in Vietnam. \nHe obtained the rank of sergeant and earned several commendations for \nhis military service. Steve was a very patriotic person.\n  After returning from Vietnam, Steve went on to earn a degree in \ncriminal justice from Northeastern University. He joined the Newport, \nNH, police department in 1969. That was the beginning of an exceptional \ncareer in law enforcement which would span more than 40 years--\nincluding positions with the Drug Enforcement Administration and the \nBaltimore, MD, Police Department.\n  After coming home to his beloved State of New Hampshire in 1977, \nSteve was named chief of police in Haverhill, NH. He served as police \nchief in Haverhill until 1986, when he was appointed police chief in \nPlaistow, NH. Steve served as police chief in Plaistow for 28 years. He \nwas the longest serving police chief in Plaistow's history.\n  In Plaistow Steve was a friend to all and was a constant presence at \nthe local ballfield where he coached baseball and volunteered his time \nwith Friends of Plaistow Recreation.\n  In addition to all of his responsibilities as police chief, Steve was \na highly respected leader in our State's law enforcement community. He \nserved as past president of the New Hampshire Chiefs of Police \nAssociation, where I had the privilege of working with him when I was \nattorney general. He served as president of the Rockingham County \nChiefs of Police Association and as a member of many law enforcement \norganizations.\n  Steve was a great leader, and he was so well respected by all members \nof law enforcement throughout New Hampshire. His talent, dedication, \nand expertise helped set a gold standard of excellence for New \nHampshire law enforcement. In a fitting tribute just a few weeks ago, \nthe Plaistow Police Department named its tactical training center in \nSteve's honor, ensuring that his legacy will not be forgotten by the \npeople of Plaistow or the people of New Hampshire.\n  He touched so many lives during his distinguished career, and one of \nthem was mine. I had the privilege of getting to know Steve, Kristin, \nand his family when I served as attorney general for the State of New \nHampshire.\n  Steve was such a kind, compassionate person and devoted to serving \nothers. He was a man with a big heart. He had a vibrant personality \nthat would light up a room and a great sense of humor that never faded \ndespite his diagnosis. I was so proud to call Steve Savage my friend. I \nfeel fortunate to have known him, and I will treasure our friendship \nalways.\n  There is so much I admired about Steve Savage. He worked tirelessly \nto keep his community safe. When he was diagnosed with cancer 3 years \nago, he didn't let up. He just kept going, spending every moment he \ncould with his family while also continuing to lead the police \ndepartment and taking part in the community activities he enjoyed. In \nfact, in May he served as grand marshal for the Plaistow's Memorial Day \nparade.\n  Steve and his family--and particularly his wife Kristin--faced his \nillness with such inspiring courage. As we know, cancer hits so many \npeople. They found a way to turn what was a tragedy in their family \ninto a good cause to help others. The Savage family and the Pollard \nSchool worked together to organize the Run of the Savages, a 5K run to \nbenefit the Dana Farber Cancer Center and the Jimmy Fund.\n  Even in sickness Steve wanted to help others fighting the disease, a \nprofound reflection of his generous and caring spirit. I know the Run \nof the Savages will continue, and I will certainly run in it again. It \nis a reflection of how much the Savage family has given back to the \ncommunity and what an inspiration Steve's life can be for others facing \nthe horrible disease of cancer.\n  Steve was determined to live life to the fullest, and he did so right \nup to the very end. Our State lost a truly great public servant with \nthe passing of Steve Savage, New Hampshire's law enforcement community \nlost a brother, and so many of us lost a great friend.\n  The Savage family has lost a loving dad and our hearts ache for \nKristin, Billy, and Michael. We will continue to keep them in our \nprayers and stand with them during this difficult time. They are an \namazing family.\n  Steve went beyond the call of duty in everything he did as a father, \nas a police chief, and as a friend. And because of Steve, New Hampshire \nis a better place. I feel honored to have known him. His legacy will \nlive on through all of those lives he touched. We will forever honor \nhis memory, and we will continue to be there to support Kristin, Billy, \nand Michael. We are just thankful that someone such as Steve Savage \ncame to serve our State and has been a friend to so many of us.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time in the quorum call be charged \nequally to both sides of the aisle.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I wish to show us these innocent-looking \nsmall bottles with an eye dropper of three types of liquid. This is \nliquid nicotine. The eye droppers are used to put that into the \ncartridges for electronic cigarettes, otherwise known as e-cigarettes. \nThere are some versions that look the size of a cigarette that already \nhave the liquid nicotine contained in them, but there are many flavors \nthat are otherwise contained in these kinds of dispensers.\n  When our commerce committee had a hearing on e-cigarettes, I asked \nthe question: Are these childproof? The answer was: No.\n  I asked the question: If these are not childproof, is the \nconcentration of nicotine in these sufficient that it could harm a \nchild? The answer was: Yes.\n  As a matter of fact, there are varying degrees of concentration of \nliquid nicotine in these bottles, but some of them are as concentrated \nas 540 milligrams of liquid nicotine. If a small child got into these \nbottles, which are not childproof, and ingested this, that child would \neither be deathly ill or dead. If that child gets into it and it spills \non that child, it will be absorbed through the skin and likewise, \naccording to the concentration of the nicotine, the child will be very \nill.\n  Obviously, when we had the commerce committee hearing on e-\ncigarettes, I asked the question--once they said these are not \nchildproof--of the e-cigarette industry, which was represented at the \nwitness panel: Do you have any objection? They said: No.\n  So last Thursday a group of Senators filed a bill that will require \nthe Consumer Product Safety Commission to start and adopt a rule that \nwill cause these to be sold in childproof containers. This is a no-\nbrainer. This is common sense.\n  Why hasn't it been addressed before? It defies common sense because \nof the danger to children. Already, in this year 2014, between January \nand the end of May, there were almost 2,000 calls for liquid nicotine \npoisoning to the poison centers around the country--just in that 5-\nmonth period. We already have a recorded incident 1 year ago or so of \none child having been killed. This ought to be not only a no-brainer, \nit ought to fly through this Congress and get the CPSC to get on with \nregulating it administratively.\n  What is another reason? Well, look what this one is called, with a \npicture, Banana; this one is Naked Peach; this one is Juice E Juice. \nAppealing to kids? How about Banana Split or Cotton Candy or Kool-Laid \nGrape or Skittles or Sweet Tart or Gummi Bear or Fruity Loops or Rocket \nPop or Hawaiian Punch? That is what is going on.\n  There happens to be a part of government that is supposed to try to \nprotect the public from danger. This is obviously something that ought \nto be done.\n  There is a larger question, and that is the question of e-cigarettes. \nThat is not the subject of this legislation. With all due haste, the \nCPSC--and, oh, by the way, why the CPSC instead of the Food and Drug \nAdministration? Because the Consumer Product Safety Commission is \nvested with the authority to create container packaging and safety \npackaging. So if Tylenol is childproof in its packaging, if Drano is, \nif any other obvious item that you want to childproof is, then we best \nhave this done and done fast. The Consumer Product Safety Commission is \nthe way to do it.\n  I hope by the attention this received in the hearing 2 or 3 weeks \nago, plus the fact of a group of Senators now coming together and \nfiling this legislation, the CPSC isn't going to wait around until we \npass it, but it will get on with the problem.\n  There is a larger question. This is on an additional but related \nissue, and that is the advisability of e-cigarettes and the way they \nare being marketed.\n  As a matter of fact, on e-cigarettes there is some packaging where it \nlooks like a white cigarette. Guess what is happening. It is now like \nwe have seen this movie before. This is a rerun of what went on 20 \nyears ago when, finally, because of tobacco products, the advertising \non television and radio was banned by law because it was geared at \ngetting young people hooked on tobacco. There were very attractive \nyoung models who were shown smoking cigarettes, wonderfully beautiful \nbackgrounds on the television and the beautiful music on radio, and, \nindeed, there were advertisements with cartoons aimed at what? It came \nout in all of the tobacco wars that these were aimed at young people, \ngetting them hooked on tobacco so they would be lifelong tobacco \nsmokers and it would be tough to kick the habit. So a couple of decades \nago we went through that fight and we banned the television and radio \nadvertising of tobacco.\n  Well, guess what is happening now--beautiful and handsome models with \nthe e-cigarette, cartoons aimed at young people with e-cigarettes. So \nanother question this Senate should consider is banning the advertising \nthat is obviously directed at young people to try to get them hooked on \nthis nicotine product so that it is so hard for them to get off of the \nnicotine addiction over the course of time.\n  I can tell you that the commerce committee is going to stay on this, \nand the first thing we can do is give a little sweet talk to the CPSC \nto get moving on the regulatory process of a rule to require the \nchildproof packaging of this liquid nicotine. The next thing down the \nroad is to stop the advertising that is being aimed directly at young \npeople on the whole issue of electronic cigarettes.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I am just busting out with ideas I wish \nto discuss with the Senate. Since we don't have any other Senators \nstanding in line, I will share where I have been today and what is of \nurgency for the environmental community and particularly the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency in the Federal Government.\n  We have been spending hundreds of billions of dollars to restore the \nFlorida Everglades. This is a natural resource that is unique in all of \nthe world, and its environmental effects are felt far beyond Florida \nand the United States--indeed, on the entire planet. It is a source of \nwater that starts southwest of Orlando in a little creek called Shingle \nCreek and flows south through the Kissimmee chain of lakes, into the \nKissimmee River, into Lake Okeechobee, the big lake in southern \nFlorida. From there the water then flows further to the south in what \nis termed the River of Grass--the Florida Everglades. From there it \nmoves very slowly through all of that grass, and it eventually ends up \non the southern tip of the peninsula in Florida Bay by the Florida Keys \nor to the southwest of Florida, coming out through what is an area \nknown as the Shark River Slough into the Gulf of Mexico. It is a unique \nnatural resource.\n  I once had Senator Barbara Boxer, the chairman of the environment \ncommittee, down there.\n  We travel in the Everglades in an airboat since there is little depth \nto the water. Of course, it is all watered grass. You skim across the \ntop of the water in an airboat propelled by a big airplane propeller.\n  As we took Senator Boxer across this River of Grass, in the midst of \nwhat looked like a meadow in front of the airboat, suddenly she saw a \ndoe and her fawn going through the meadow. Only this time they were \nobviously not in a meadow; they were in water, and they were splashing \nin the water as they leapt away from the airboat.\n  It is a unique environmental, ecological treasure with so many \nendangered species there, and it is a discussion for another day, how \ninvasive species are upsetting the ecological balance, such as the \nimported Burmese python,\n\n[[Page S4448]]\n\nwhich can get up to 20 feet long. Indeed, one that was 18 feet 8 inches \nwas caught 6 months ago. Of course, they are at the top of the food \nchain. They attack alligators. The fur-bearing animals in the \nEverglades have diminished in population because they are being \nconsumed by these beasts that have a ravenous appetite. But that is a \nsubject for another day.\n  Hundreds of billions of dollars has been spent to restore it, \nrestoring it to correct a mistake of mankind over the course of the \nlast century when, after the huge hurricane in the 1920s that drowned \n2,000 people in the Lake Okeechobee area, the whole idea was flood \ncontrol: When it floods, get the water off the land. Send it to \ntidewater--the Atlantic in the east, the Gulf of Mexico in the west. \nBut that messed around with Mother Nature, and as a result the whole of \nthe Everglades started to dry up.\n  Fortunately, a lot of forward-thinking people--and I am merely a \nsteward who has come along at the right time, at the right place--have \ncontinued this effort--the Corps of Engineers, the EPA, so many of the \nagencies of government, Cabinet Secretaries, such as Ken Salazar at the \nDepartment of the Interior, the Department of Agriculture Secretary. It \ngoes on and on. The effort as a 50/50 partnership in funding this \nrestoration has been partnered by the State of Florida and the U.S. \nGovernment, and it continues.\n  Alas, there is now oil drilling in the Everglades. The subject of \ntoday's meeting in Fort Myers, FL, was to gather a very courageous \ncounty commission from Collier County, their chairman, and \nrepresentatives of the community, to come in to educate me on the \naspects of drilling and the recent brouhaha between the State \nenvironmental agency and the Texas wildcatter, the Dan A. Hughes \nCompany; they started fracking without the proper permits and without \nrevealing the mechanism and the material they were using to frack.\n  Of course, most people have heard of fracking, but we hear of it in \nterms of North Dakota or Oklahoma or Texas or Pennsylvania. But Florida \nis not built on that kind of substrate where they are going in and \nbreaking up that rock in the fracking to release oil and natural gas, \nwhich has now made us such a tremendous producer of both of those in \nthe United States. No, Florida is on a different type of substrate. It \nis built on a honeycomb of limestone that supports the surface by it \nbeing filled with freshwater. It is not those solid rocks where the \nfracking for oil and gas is being done and with the high jets with \nchemicals breaking up that rock to release the natural gas. No, this is \nporous limestone formed millions of years ago by the shelled critters \nthat ultimately fossilized. It is this honeycomb being supported by \nfreshwater that is the substructure of the State of Florida. So we \ndon't have any idea what this fracking is going to do not only to the \nquality of the water but also to the very support structure for the \nState.\n  Now, lo and behold, there are attempts for permits to drill in the \n250,000-acre Big Cypress Federal preserve, which is part of the \nEverglades but is adjacent to the Everglades National Park. Therefore, \nit is time for the EPA of the Federal Government to get involved. It is \ntime to question their authority in law as to what, after this kind of \ndrilling is done to inject all of that stuff that is left over \nback down into this substrate of freshwater--what is that going to do \nunder the Clean Water Act? What is it that could contaminate the source \nof drinking water? What is it going to do to the structure that upholds \nthe surface of the State of Florida? And very importantly, since it is \ncolocated right next to Everglades National Park and since it is a part \nof the area generally known as the Everglades, what is it going to do \nto the flora and fauna--in other words, all of that delicate ecosystem \nbalance of the critters and the plants? What is it going to do to the \nvery area that we are spending hundreds of billions of State taxpayer \nand Federal taxpayer money to restore? These are very legitimate \nquestions.\n\n  Years ago the Collier family was very generous. They gave, fee simple \nto the U.S. Government, what is today the Big Cypress preserve. They \nretained the mineral rights. It was clearly their right to do so, and \nit was very generous of them to donate the property.\n  We have a national park ranger manager who manages that preserve. Now \nwe have to look at what are the serious consequences of trying to \nconvert those mineral rights that were reserved into drilling. The most \nimmediate is that instead of seismic testing, another kind of vibration \ntesting is expected to be done with thousands of tests in the Big \nCypress Preserve. It is called thumping.\n  A vehicle comes in and apparently drops things onto the surface to \ncreate something--instead of seismic testing where an explosion is let \noff, to send down vibrations--and these triangulations, since they are \ndoing thousands of these, would determine if there is oil there. Thus, \nanother question that arises is, What is the environmental effect?\n  We definitely have a reason for the EPA, as an independent agency, \nfor the Department of the Interior, which has jurisdiction over things \nsuch as U.S. Fish & Wildlife, U.S. Park Service, to get involved in \nthis process and make some determinations, and if the answer is that \nthere is not sufficient authority in law, to address it so that we can \naddress it here as a matter of legislating law.\n  I wanted to make the Senate aware of this particular potential threat \nto the Florida Everglades.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I wish to ask my colleagues as well as myself to think \nabout how many times we have made pessimistic-sounding statements about \nAmerica's future. I want to remind my colleagues and myself about what \nI see as excessive pessimism about our great country, because as public \nfigures often what we say maybe has consequences--sometimes positive, \nsometimes negative. Our attitudes matter and the policies shaped by \nthose attitudes can have an enormous impact for better or for worse on \nthe lives of Americans.\n  President Ronald Reagan often expressed that America's best days were \nyet to come. Twenty-five years later I still believe in Reagan's \noptimism for America. In fact, President Reagan even ended his final \nletter to the American people: ``I know that for America there will \nalways be a bright dawn ahead.'' His agenda reflected that optimism and \nhis policies worked towards a freer, more prosperous America.\n  But it seems such optimism about America's future might be out of \nfashion these days. Instead of searching for a silver lining, many \npundits and politicians see nothing but clouds. For instance, after \ndecades of hearing about how we are about to run out of fossil fuel, \nmaking energy in the future much more expensive and scarce, improved \ntechnologies have unleashed enormous reserves of natural gas. This \nincrease in supply has driven down costs and caused electrical \ngeneration to switch from coal to natural gas. That in turn has led to \nsubstantial reductions in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. That seems to \nbe a silver lining.\n  Now there are clouds on the horizon. However, rather than to \ncelebrate the fact that the free market is achieving one of their long-\nheld goals, many environmentalists want to ban the technology that led \nto the shale gas revolution based on unscientific claims of potential \ngroundwater contamination. It seems that it would be a terrible shame \nto let all of that planning for scarcity of energy to go to waste. So I \nguess we better not take advantage of this Nation's resources.\n  On another matter, we hear a lot of hand-wringing about the decline \nin manufacturing jobs, but this is partly due to advances in \nmanufacturing process which seems to require fewer more-skilled and \ntherefore higher-paying jobs. The growth in American advanced \nmanufacturing will require job training to fill those higher-skilled, \nhigher-paying jobs, and of course we have community colleges throughout \nour country\n\n[[Page S4449]]\n\nthat are rising to that challenge. This is an opportunity to do \ninsource jobs that might otherwise be done overseas. That is good news \nfor American economic competitiveness and from the standpoint of \nwanting higher paying jobs for Americans. That seems to me to be a \nsilver lining.\n  Now the clouds: The decliners are so heavily invested in the story of \nthe decline of American manufacturing that it is easier to bemoan the \nlack of economically inefficient low-skilled jobs which are the \nhallmark not of Americans but of underdeveloped countries.\n  On another matter, the bursting of the economic bubble has forced \nAmericans to spend less and as a result to save more. ``Spend less, \nsave more'' seems to me to be good news. Now clouds are forming because \nwe have economic pundits saying that ``spend less, save more'' shows a \nlack of consumer confidence. You could look at it as a reality check in \nthe face of unsustainable credit card debt financing spending or is it \nour national goal to get people to go back to saving less in the future \nand spending more today? Live for today and forget about tomorrow. You \nwould think so, based upon what you hear in the news shows.\n  American entrepreneurs still produce a disproportionate share of the \nworld's major innovations. Still, we are cautioned by people who always \nsee clouds hanging over America, that America is not graduating enough \npeople with science and technology degrees and the best and brightest \nin developing countries may soon decide to stay at home to build their \ncompanies instead of coming to America.\n  Doomsayers have existed throughout our history. It seems to be a sign \nof sophistication and intellectual refinement to predict the inevitable \ndecline of your own society.\n  Using 20/20 hindsight, the eventual decline of all of history's great \ncivilizations somehow seems to be inevitable. So isn't it logical then \nto think our great Nation will decline as well? Perhaps the so-called \ngreat recession is a sign that America's best days are in fact already \nbehind us. Many people in the media and government seem so caught up in \nthis narrative they cannot see any other possibility but our decline. \nThis fever is starting to spread to the general public as polls show a \nrecord number of Americans who think the next generation will be less \nwell off than this generation. As a result there is a tremendous amount \nof energy being devoted to figuring out how to manage America's \ndecline. This is kind of a historical determinism and pessimism that is \nvery alien to the American character.\n\n  The rise of America as the most prosperous Nation on Earth was hardly \ninevitable 200 years ago. We owe our current level of prosperity to the \nentrepreneurial spirit and hard work of our forefathers and, yes, to \ntheir unbounded optimism in the future of this great country. An \nexcessive focus, then, on managing decline risks becoming a self-\nfulfilling prophecy.\n  For instance, there is a lot of concern about the decline of the \nmiddle class, but instead of talking about how to unharness the \nentrepreneurial spirit that made America an economic super power and \ngrew the great American middle class that we know, all the ideas from \nour friends across the aisle seem to focus on expanding dependency on \ngovernment and more government programs. While a succession of new EPA \nregulations rain down on businesses causing them to pull back from \nexpanding and hiring more people, the Democrats' solution is to keep \npeople on unemployment benefits for a long, long time. Expensive health \ncare reform mandates threaten to force small businesses to reduce the \nhours of employment and maybe not even hire more than 49 people, \nbecause when you get to 50 people there are other requirements in \nhealth care reform that kick in.\n  So what is the answer? Many people in this body would mandate that \nsmall business pay a much higher minimum wage. Minimum wage jobs ought \nto be seen as a stepping stone for low-skilled workers to begin \nclimbing the economic ladder. However, when the economic engine stalls, \nthe ladder of opportunity becomes harder to climb. It happens that more \nand more people get stuck trying to make ends meet with low wage jobs \nand no opportunity to get ahead. And it seems that people are concerned \nabout tackling this problem by putting more people on food stamps.\n  So you get back to the American dream. The American dream is about an \nopportunity to work hard and earn your own success in life. Proposals \nto expand the welfare state to the middle class assume the American \ndream is somehow dead and the best we can hope for is anemic economic \ngrowth with high levels of government dependency. That is a defeatist \nattitude that reflects a distinct lack of faith in our great country. \nThis is the old European model, which the experience of Greece showed \nto be unsustainable.\n  In fact, the poster child for an expensive European welfare state, \nSweden, has in fact taken a new route to cut taxes and reform \nentitlement programs--a lesson that we ought to be looking at in \nAmerica. But who would ever think that we would look to Sweden as an \nexample to teach us how to lower taxes and reform entitlement programs? \nIf we keep planning for decline, we will get it. But if we recover our \nfaith in America's potential and redirect our energy towards removing \nbarriers to economic growth and opportunity, America's best days are \nstill ahead of us.\n  That leads me to repeat what Ronald Reagan said 25 years ago in that \nletter to the American people: ``America's best days are still ahead of \nher.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/14/senate-section/article/S4449-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4449-S4450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SMARTER SENTENCING ACT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

So I come to the floor \ntoday to express my strong opposition to this bill and argue against \ntaking the Senate's time to consider it.\n  In the past I pointed out that this bill would put at risk our hard-\nwon national drop in crime. It would also reduce penalties for \nimporting and distributing heroin, a drug that is currently devastating \nour communities with an epidemic of addiction and a rising number of \ndeaths from overdoses. In part, for these reasons many law enforcement \nprofessionals have come out against this legislation. The National \nAssociation of Assistant U.S. Attorneys, Federal law enforcement \nofficers associations, and a long list of former high-level officials--\nin Republican and Democratic administrations alike--are all opposed to \nit. Indeed page A12 of this morning's New York Times contains an \narticle entitled: ``Second Thoughts on Lighter Sentences for Drug \nSmugglers.'' According to the New York Times, the sentencing changes \nthat the administration has already pushed for are ``raising questions \nof whether the pendulum has swung too far.'' ``Some prosecutors say \nthat couriers have little to no incentive to cooperate anymore.''\n  Border patrol officials grumble that they are working to catch \nsmugglers, only to have them face little punishment. And judges who \nonce denounced the harsh sentencing guidelines are now having second \nthoughts.\n  Today I point out another perhaps less understood effect of the bill \nwhich puts our national security at increased risk.\n  According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, terrorists are \nincreasingly funneling illegal drugs into America, raising large sums \nof money to fund their activities while simultaneously harming our \ncommunities. Undoubtedly, the Obama administration's unwillingness to \ncontrol our border--which we have seen recently--contributes to the \nproblem.\n  Derek Maltz, Director of the Special Operations Division at the Drug \nEnforcement Administration, called this a two-for-one deal for \nterrorists: ``Poison gets distributed in the West, and they make \nmillions in the process.''\n  According to a DEA spokesperson, ``Most people talk about the drug \nissue as a health issue, a parenting issue, an addiction issue. But the \ntruth is, it's really a national security issue.''\n  In 2006, Congress took specific action to address this issue. When it \nreauthorized the PATRIOT Act, Congress also\n\n[[Page S4450]]\n\nmade it a separate crime to manufacture or distribute illegal drugs to \nbenefit terrorists or terrorist organizations. The law is codified at \ntitle 21, section 960(a) of the U.S. Code. It is often called the \nnarcoterrorism law.\n  Just as important, Congress created mandatory minimum sentences \napplicable to narcoterrorism. Those sentences are set at ``not less \nthan twice the minimum punishment'' applicable to the underlying drug \ntrafficking offenses which are codified in title 21, section 841. \nHowever, the Smarter Sentencing Act would drastically cut the mandatory \nminimum sentences that apply to these underlying drug trafficking \noffenses. What this means is that by slashing in half the mandatory \nminimum sentences for the local drug dealer down the block, the Smarter \nSentencing Act also slashes in half the mandatory minimum sentences for \nmembers of the Taliban, Al Qaeda or Hezbollah who deal drugs to fund \ntheir acts of terrorism.\n  For example, terrorists who currently face a mandatory minimum \nsentence of 20 years in prison for narcoterrorism would instead face \nonly 10 years if the Smarter Sentencing Act were to become law. By \ncutting the mandatory minimum sentences for trafficking drugs to fund \nterrorism, the Smarter Sentencing Act weakens a very important tool \nthat can be used to gain the cooperation of narcoterrorists facing \nprosecution. This cooperation leads to more arrests, more drug \nseizures, more terrorists off the streets, and more intelligence that \ncould help prevent further attacks.\n  Indeed, law enforcement authorities have been supportive of the \nmandatory minimum sentences that apply to the narcoterrorism statute \nfor this very reason. For example, the Assistant Administrator for \nIntelligence at the Drug Enforcement Administration testified before \nCongress that ``the robust sentencing provisions in these statutes \nprovide incentives for defendants to cooperate with investigators, \npromoting success in investigations.''\n  The last thing we should do is weaken the leverage law enforcement \ncurrently has to win a terrorist defendant's cooperation, but that is \nwhat the Smarter Sentencing Act would in fact do.\n  Indeed, in opposing the bill, Federal prosecutors wrote that \n``mandatory minimums . . . help gain the cooperation of defendants in \nlower level roles in criminal organizations to pursue higher-level \ntargets.''\n  The same principle is true--and even more important--when our \nnational security is at stake. These threats to our safety and security \nare not theoretical, they are very real, and the narcoterrorism law is \nnot just a statute on the books, it is a tool that is actively used by \nprosecutors to protect our Nation.\n  For example, in 2008, Khan Mohammed, a member of the Taliban, was \nconvicted under the narcoterrorism law of distributing heroin and opium \nto finance attacks against American troops in Afghanistan.\n  Chillingly, Mohammed was just as concerned with killing American \ncivilians with drugs as he was with financing rocket attacks against \nour troops. The opium he agreed to sell was to be processed into heroin \nand imported into the United States. As a result, Mohammed was caught \non tape exclaiming ``Good, may God turn all the infidels into dead \ncorpses.''\n  He later expounded on his deadly intentions:\n\n       May God eliminate them right now, and we will eliminate \n     them too. Whether it is by opium or by shooting, this is our \n     common goal.\n\n  Similarly, the narcoterrorism law was used to prosecute Afghan heroin \nkingpin Haji Bagcho in 2012. He was also trafficking heroin to America \nand funneled the proceeds to the Taliban. The evidence at trial showed \nthat in 2006 his drug trafficking organization produced almost 20 \npercent of the world's opium and, similar to Mohammed, he targeted \nAmericans. He reportedly encouraged Afghan farmers to ``grow opium so \nwe can make heroin to kill the infidels.''\n  Perhaps it is little wonder, according to the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration, heroin overdoses resulting in death in the United \nStates increased 45 percent between 2006 and 2010.\n  It should go without saying that these are not individuals whose \nmandatory minimum sentences should be cut in half. But the authors of \nthe Smarter Sentencing Act apparently think otherwise because that is \nwhat the bill says or maybe they don't understand what they are doing. \nEither way, the American people should be extremely concerned about \nthis bill that unbelievably was reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  Some may assume that the Department of Justice has other tools to go \nafter defendants such as these, but the only other charges that \nMohammed and Bagcho faced were for unlawfully importing these illegal \ndrugs into the United States. Unbelievably, the Smarter Sentencing Act \ncuts the mandatory minimum sentences for that crime in half as well.\n  In addition to these two cases, the Department of Justice has brought \nprosecutions against other narcoterrorists. Many of these individuals \nwere linked to Hezbollah, one of the most notorious terrorist \norganizations in the world. In at least one instance associates of Al \nQaeda were also brought to justice for their role in drug trafficking \nschemes.\n  In many of these cases, the narcoterrorism law and the ban on \nimporting illegal drugs played a vital role in their prosecution. We \nshould not be weakening these laws at this critical time by cutting the \npenalties associated with those acts of crime. Of course, if possible, \nI would rather these terrorists be treated as enemy combatants and not \nbe subject to the civilian criminal justice system at all, but on those \noccasions when they are prosecuted in our criminal justice system, I \nwant authorities to have the strongest tools available to address the \nthreat these criminals pose.\n  According to the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, \nwho has brought many of these cases, ``there is a growing nexus between \ndrug trafficking and terrorism, a nexus that increasingly poses a clear \nand present danger to our national security. Combating this lethal \nthreat requires a bold and proactive approach.'' Cutting the mandatory \nminimum sentences for narcoterrorists is moving in precisely the \nopposite direction of what the U.S. attorney for the Southern District \nof New York said and I just quoted.\n  Trafficking in illegal drugs has long been understood to be a way \nthat these terrorist organizations raise funds, but it is now equally \nclear that this activity is also a way for them to target our fellow \ncitizens directly. In effect, drug trafficking is a method of waging \nwar against the United States. It is a way to terrorize our communities \nwith poison without firing a shot. It is a way to threaten the lives of \nAmericans just as surely as using a bomb, a gun or a hijacked plane.\n  Terrorists are wielding another tool in their efforts to destroy and \ndefeat our country. This is not the moment to weaken one of the tools \nwe have to actually stop them. This is no time to let down our \ndefenses. It is no time for the Senate to take up the misnamed Smarter \nSentencing Act.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, last month we saw five male Justices give \ntheir blessing to CEOs and corporations across America to go ahead and \ndeny legally required health care coverage for their employees. When \nthat news broke, I was outraged, and I know I was one of millions of \npeople across the country who were shocked and angry.\n  These women are looking to us. They are demanding a change. Today, as \nwomen across America took to social media for a Digital Day of Action, \ntheir message was delivered loudly and clearly when they echoed: ``My \npersonal health care choices are not my boss's business--period.''\n  It wasn't just women who were speaking out on social media today. In \nfact, we heard from several men who understood that if bosses can deny \nbirth control, they can deny vaccines or HIV treatments or any other \nbasic health care service for their employees or their dependents.\n  I heard from Konrad in my home State of Washington on Twitter today \nwho said he doesn't want his boss knowing what medications he is on, \nsuch as diabetes or heart medications. Konrad said, ``It is simply not \nmy boss's business.''\n  I also heard from my constituents when I was home this weekend. \nFriday I spoke directly with business owners and others who are hearing \nthe same thing. Women are tired of being targeted and are looking to \nCongress to right this wrong by the Supreme Court.\n  One such woman is a woman named Morgan Beach. Morgan joined me Friday \nat Oddfellows Cafe, which is a small Seattle business whose owners \nstood up and spoke out about their disgust as employers about this \nruling. Morgan is one of the 58 percent of women who use contraception \nfor reasons other than to prevent pregnancy. As she spoke about how the \nSupreme Court decision would impact women such as her, Morgan said: \n``The terrifying power this ruling gives to a small minority to make \nsweeping personal decisions . . . is frightening. The simple fact is, \nbirth control is not my boss's business!''\n\n  Morgan is right. It is not her boss's business.\n  We are going to be talking about this urgent issue at more length \ntomorrow morning, but I wanted to come to the floor this evening and \nshare what I heard from back home this weekend and throughout today. We \nhave legislation that is now slated for a vote later this week, and we \nare going to be talking about this today and tomorrow. I hope all of \nour colleagues are listening, because it is time for Congress to get to \nwork. Women and men are watching.\n  I am delighted to be joined today by my colleague from Colorado, \nSenator Udall, who is my partner in presenting this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a \nproposal Senator Patty Murray and I have introduced to restore a \nwoman's power to make personal health care decisions based on what is \nbest for her and her family, not according to her employer's personal \nbeliefs. The Protect Women's Health from Corporate Interference Act--or \nthe Not Your Boss's Business Act--aims to counteract the far-reaching \nconsequences of the U.S. Supreme Court's Hobby Lobby decision. That \nmisguided Court decision allows closely held corporations to now deny \ntheir employees coverage for contraceptives through their employees' \nhealth insurance plans.\n  As Senator Murray did in her home State of Washington, I also \ntraveled around my home State of Colorado. Several days ago I stood \nshoulder to shoulder with women's health experts, including an OB-GYN \nin Denver, who told me that physicians might now have to consider how \nan employer's religious beliefs might fit into their diagnosis before \nthey make a medical recommendation, which ought to be based solely on \ntheir patients' well-being. This is unacceptable. Women should never \nhave to ask their boss for a permission slip to access common forms of \nbirth control or other critical health services.\n  Today, as Senator Murray alluded, champions in women's health are \ntaking a stand on social media to illustrate why the Senate should come \ntogether this week to pass the Not Your Boss's Business Act. This \noutpouring of support from all over the country shows how important it \nis that we keep private health care decisions in employees' hands and \nout of corporate boardrooms.\n  As part of today's Digital Day of Action across the country, my staff \nand I put together a BuzzFeed post to dispel some misconceptions about \nthe Hobby Lobby decision and highlight why we need to pass the Not Your \nBoss's Business Act. Go to BuzzFeed.com/markudall and share my post to \nhelp push back against some of the myths.\n  Despite what some people say, this decision is a bad deal, and it \nwill undermine women's access to contraception across the country. But \nmore and more Americans are joining us to speak out because of how \nbackward this Hobby Lobby decision is. I am proud to have groups from \nacross the Centennial State, such as the Colorado Organization for \nLatina Opportunity and Reproductive Rights, NARAL Pro-Choice Colorado, \nPlanned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, and Colorado's Religious \nCoalition for Reproductive Choice, come out in support of our bill.\n  I believe the Supreme Court was wrong in its misguided Hobby Lobby \ndecision, which is already adversely affecting American women and \nfamilies. But we have a chance to fix this, and I stand here today to \ncall on my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to join me, join \nSenator Murray and America's workers who agree that women's health is \nnot your boss's business.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S4452]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HIRONO. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 18 years ago I wrote a law that has been \nrepeated annually ever since and is now codified as section 620M of the \nForeign Assistance Act. It has become widely known as the ``Leahy Law'' \nand it has two primary purposes.\n  The first is to prevent U.S. taxpayer funded training, equipment, or \nother assistance from going to units of foreign security forces that \nhave committed heinous crimes. We saw many instances when U.S. aid \nended up in the hands of foreign military or police forces that had \nengaged in rape, murder, torture, or other gross violations of human \nrights, and the U.S. was tainted by association with those crimes.\n  The second is to encourage foreign governments to bring to justice \nthe individual members of units responsible for such atrocities. In \nmany countries that receive U.S. aid there is a long history of \nimpunity for crimes committed by government security forces. Rather \nthan protect their citizens, they abuse them, and then they beat up or \nkill witnesses and threaten prosecutors and judges. They act outside \nthe law and literally get away with murder. They are the antithesis of \nprofessional, accountable military or police forces.\n  A similar, although not identical, provision that is also known as \nthe Leahy Law is contained in the annual Defense Appropriations Act.\n  Both Leahy Laws serve important national interests and they have \nbecome increasingly institutionalized within the U.S. government. The \nState Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor has \ndeveloped a database for vetting foreign units and individuals that is \ncontinually updated, and they and the Defense Department increasingly \ncoordinate to apply the laws consistently. The Department of State and \nforeign operations appropriations bill for 2015, reported to the Senate \non June 19, includes $5 million to pay salaries and other costs of the \nvetting process, an increase of $2.25 million above fiscal year 2014.\n  While the Leahy Laws have been modified over the years and their \nimplementation is a continuing work in progress, I appreciate the \nsupport they have received from the highest levels of the State and \nDefense Departments, and the willingness of officials in those agencies \nto work with Congress and representatives of human rights organizations \nand foreign governments to address issues of interpretation and \nimplementation as they arise.\n  As with many laws, the Leahy Laws have their detractors. However, \nwith rare exceptions questions about, or criticism of, the laws have \nbeen due to misinformation or misunderstandings that have been easy to \nclarify or resolve.\n  While I know of no one who has expressed opposition to the Leahy \nLaws, some have raised concerns with their implementation, suggesting \nthat they pose unacceptable obstacles to the ability of the U.S. \nmilitary to engage with foreign counterparts. Not only do the facts \nindicate otherwise, the laws are working. In more than 90 percent of \ncases the foreign units or individuals vetted have been deemed eligible \nto receive U.S. assistance under the Leahy Laws. In the rare instances \nwhen a unit or individual was denied assistance, it was due to credible \ninformation that the individual or unit had committed a heinous crime \nand the foreign government had done nothing about it.\n  At a July 10 hearing in the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on \nAfrica, Global Health, Global Human Rights and International \nOrganizations, Stephen Rickard, a former Senate staff member, State \nDepartment official, director of the Robert F. Kennedy Center for \nJustice and Human Rights, director of Amnesty International's \nWashington Office, and now executive director of the Open Society \nPolicy Center, provided testimony on the Leahy Laws. His testimony does \nan excellent job of describing the purposes and impact of the Leahy \nLaws, and addressing key questions that have been asked about their \nimplementation. I ask unanimous consent that his statement be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Statement of Stephen Richard, Executive Director, Open Society Policy \n                                 Center\n\n Presented to the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global \n      Health, Global Human Rights and International Organizations\n\n\n                Human Rights Vetting: Nigeria and Beyond\n\n                             July 10, 2014\n\n       I would like to begin by thanking Chairman Smith and \n     Ranking Member Bass for holding this important hearing and \n     for their leadership on human rights.\n       I have worked on the Leahy Laws in one form or another for \n     nearly 17 years and have discussed them with countless State \n     Department and Defense Department officials, as well as with \n     human rights experts working all over the world. I also spent \n     a period of time as a Franklin Fellow in the Department of \n     State during which time I was able to learn in detail about \n     the process for implementing the Leahy Laws. I have been \n     engaged on detailed questions about the application of the \n     Leahy Laws in Colombia, Turkey, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, \n     Indonesia, Nigeria, Kenya and dozens of other countries, and \n     I believe that these laws are among the most important human \n     rights statutes on the books. The law has been poorly \n     funded--less than two-hundredths of one percent of the cost \n     of U.S. military assistance is spent on Leahy Law vetting. \n     And it has often been misunderstood and misrepresented.\n       But with President Obama proposing a new $5 billion fund \n     for military assistance to combat terrorism it is essential \n     to help the public understand this vital law and to help \n     insure that it is vigorously implemented.\n     A Common Sense Formula for Security Cooperation Consistent \n         With U.S. Values\n       The Leahy Laws are common sense laws that prohibit the \n     United States Government from arming or providing military \n     training to security force and police units abroad who have \n     been credibly alleged to have committed gross human rights \n     violations. These laws (there is one for State Department \n     assistance and one for Department of Defense assistance) do \n     not prohibit the United States from providing assistance in \n     violent, conflict-wracked countries like Nigeria and \n     Colombia. On the contrary, because they involve a unit by \n     unit examination, the Leahy Laws provide a formula for the \n     United States to assist foreign military forces even in \n     countries where some government forces are committing gross \n     atrocities. They are a formula for success in such countries, \n     not a prohibition on engagement.\n     Four Numbers\n       There are four important numbers to keep in mind about the \n     impact of the Leahy Laws. (All these statistics have been \n     provided by the State Department and cover 2011-2013.) The \n     first number is 530,000. That's the approximate number of \n     foreign military and police units which the United States \n     government considered arming or training over the last three \n     years and subjected to Leahy vetting.\n       The second number is 90 percent. That is the minimum \n     percentage of prompt approvals given under the Leahy Law--\n     generally within 10 days of a request. There is even a ``fast \n     track'' approval process for countries with generally good \n     human rights records. Some vetting requests require more \n     information, investigation or discussion. But at least 90% \n     are approved more or less immediately.\n       The third number is 1 percent. In every one of the last \n     three years less than 1 percent of all units vetted under the \n     Leahy Law were ultimately declared to be ineligible for \n     assistance under the law. Of course it is true that the \n     number will be higher in some specific countries, but taken \n     as a whole the Leahy Law actually blocks aid in a miniscule \n     percentage of cases.\n       The final number is 2,516. The Leahy Law blocks aid in a \n     tiny percentage of cases, but that doesn't mean that it is \n     unimportant. Because the U.S. now provides training to so \n     many people, even 1 percent is a lot. And 2,516 is the number \n     of vetted units that the U.S. Government found to be credibly \n     linked to gross atrocities over the last three years when it \n     took the time to examine their records because of the Leahy \n     Law.\n       Those 2,516 units were not being asked to satisfy a high \n     standard. In no way does the Leahy Law require pristine \n     forces. In fact, the State Department defines ``gross human \n     rights violations'' to include a very short list of only the \n     most heinous offenses: murder, torture, rape, disappearances \n     and other gross violations of life and liberty. That's it. So \n     even though less than 1 percent of proposed units failed the \n     standard, it is still pretty\n\n[[Page S4453]]\n\n     shocking that over the last three years the United States \n     Government probably would have armed and trained 2,516 units \n     (or individuals in those units) containing murders, rapists \n     and torturers without the Leahy Law.\n       The Leahy Laws don't actually prohibit the U.S. from \n     working with even these units--the ones that have committed \n     murder and torture. It only says that the U.S. cannot arm or \n     train them until the foreign government takes steps to clean \n     up the unit.\n     Three Questions\n       So whenever anyone says that it is a problem for the United \n     States that it cannot train or arm a particular foreign \n     battalion or police unit, one should ask three questions:\n       (1) What did the unit do? If we can't work with them, it \n     must mean that the United States has determined that this \n     unit is one of the worst of the worst. It is in the 1 percent \n     of units where the U.S. government found credible information \n     linking it to murder, rape, torture or another gross \n     atrocity. So, when someone argues that we should arm a Leahy-\n     prohibited unit, one should ask, ``What did the unit do to \n     get on the list?''\n       (2) Why won't the government clean up the unit? Maybe the \n     foreign government wants to make a point to the U.S.--it \n     doesn't accept the U.S. commitment to human rights; it won't \n     let the U.S. ``tell it what to do.'' Maybe the government has \n     no control over its own military and cannot do anything to \n     clean up the unit even if it wanted to do so. But one should \n     insist on knowing: ``Why won't the government clean up the \n     unit?''\n       (3) Finally, if the unit committed murder, rape or torture \n     and the foreign government won't or can't clean it up, why \n     should U.S. taxpayers give that specific unit guns anyway? \n     Under what possible circumstances would it make sense for the \n     United States to arm known killers who are either completely \n     out of their government's control, or who work for a \n     government that refuses to take any action against them?\n     Responses to Three Criticisms\n       Tempus Fugit: There are a number of arguments raised \n     against the Leahy Law which might make some sense if the law \n     covered lesser offenses. For instance, there is an argument \n     that it makes no sense to keep a unit on the Leahy Law \n     ``pariah'' list long after the atrocity occurred, especially \n     if everyone who was in the unit has now moved on. But there \n     are no other contexts in which we would accept a 4 year, or 8 \n     year or even 15 year statute of limitations on murder, \n     torture or rape. So why accept one here? And the law is \n     intended to create an incentive for foreign governments to \n     improve their human rights records and to hold people \n     accountable. Letting a unit off the hook because the \n     government rotated people out of the unit (and into other \n     ones) or because the foreign government simply waited us out \n     for a few years sends exactly the wrong message. Moreover, \n     units have reputations and traditions that are regularly \n     passed on to new members of the unit over many years and even \n     decades. That is often true for units with gallant histories. \n     But it is also true of death squads and praetorian guards.\n       Just as importantly, one needs to ask what it says about a \n     foreign military ``partner'' if documented cases of murder, \n     rape and torture go without redress after decades. The \n     government always has the option of working with the United \n     States to create new, carefully vetted units--something that \n     has been done in a number of countries with gross human \n     rights problems. If the government will not do that, it is \n     probably trying to make a point. Is it appropriate to reward \n     such behavior with assistance?\n       Pariah Forever: Critics of the law also sometimes argue \n     that it is impossible for a tainted unit to be rehabilitated. \n     This is, of course, completely false--unless the government \n     in question refuses or is unable to take any meaningful \n     action to address the problem. So what these critics are \n     really saying is: It is almost never the case that America's \n     military partners in these countries have the political will \n     or commitment to human rights to take the kind of \n     disciplinary action against killers and rapists that is \n     absolutely routine in the U.S. military. And that is a very \n     odd sort of argument for waiving or weakening the Leahy Law \n     so that we can give more guns to these government's forces.\n       In fact, there are cases in which specific units have been \n     rehabilitated. But it takes a willing partner. This is one \n     area where critics of the law and its supporters should make \n     common cause to support earmarked funding for remediation of \n     tainted units. One percent of U.S. military assistance--just \n     one penny out of every dollar--should be set aside for \n     vetting and remediation. It should be used to help foreign \n     militaries set up JAG officer corps, criminal investigation \n     services and other elements of a professional disciplinary \n     system. This should simply be considered a cost of doing \n     business in some of the most violent places on earth. There \n     is a precedent for applying a fixed surcharge as a ``cost of \n     doing business.'' Every time the United States Government \n     sells weapons abroad it applies a surcharge--currently 3.5%--\n     to administer the sale. The U.S. should apply a 1% surcharge \n     to ensure that it knows what is being done with the other 99% \n     and so that it can help move its partner forces in a positive \n     direction on human rights.\n       Just a Few Bad Apples: Critics sometimes argue that it is \n     wrong to hold whole units accountable for the acts of just a \n     few, or perhaps even just one, member of the unit. They argue \n     that we should vet specific individuals rather than units and \n     only withhold information from those individuals who are \n     linked to atrocities.\n       Here it is important to understand that the Leahy Law was a \n     compromise. There was and is an important human rights law--\n     Section 502B of the Foreign Assistance Act--which does not \n     permit the United States to engage in a unit by unit \n     assessment of foreign partner forces: ``No security \n     assistance may be provided to any country the government of \n     which engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations of \n     internationally recognized human rights.'' There is a very \n     strong argument to be made under Section 502B that the United \n     States should be providing no assistance whatsoever to \n     Nigerian forces, and many others around the world.\n       But historically the United States has been extremely \n     reluctant to invoke Section 502B even in the most extreme \n     cases. So the Leahy Law was proposed as an intermediate step: \n     If the U.S. will not completely cut off governments engaging \n     in a consistent pattern of gross human rights violations, \n     then at least it should not arm the specific military units \n     it believes are the ones actually committing the gross \n     violations. However, Senator Leahy also believed that it \n     would be absurd and unreasonable to ask that human rights \n     victims be able to identify the specific murder, torturer or \n     rapist by name before the U.S. took any action. So, his law \n     states that if credible information can be presented that \n     links an identifiable unit to a specific atrocity the United \n     States would be required to cut off that unit--at least until \n     the foreign government identifies the specific individuals \n     within it who are responsible and deals with them.\n     One Final Thought\n       The Bible tells us in the Book of Acts that before his \n     conversion on the road to Damascus the Apostle Paul was a \n     persecutor of the Christian Church. In fact, according to \n     Acts (Chapter 7, Verse 59) he was present at the killing of \n     St. Stephen and held the cloaks of those who stoned him. He \n     cast no stones himself; but he was complicit. He gave aid to \n     the killers. When we go to places like Nigeria, shouldn't we \n     at least ask, ``Whose cloaks are we holding?'' That's all the \n     Leahy Law says.\n       The Leahy Law cannot guarantee that the U.S. will never arm \n     bad people. It's not a panacea. It's just the least we can \n     do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/14/senate-section/article/S4453-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n          TRIBUTE TO CHIEF WARRANT OFFICER 5 DANIEL SANDBOTHE\n\n Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I wish to honor CW5 Daniel Sandbothe \nof the 1107th Missouri National Guard in Springfield, MO. As a soldier, \nhe has dedicated 40 years to serving in the Missouri National Guard. \nOver those years, through his commitment and service, he has risen to a \nunique rank signifying his expertise in flying and maintaining the \nrotary aircraft of the U.S. Armed Forces.\n  CW5 Daniel Sandbothe's career started in 1972 in the 1038th \nMaintenance Company. Throughout the next four decades, he mastered the \nability to fly a variety of airframes commonly used by the U.S. Army, \nlogging more than 5,000 military flight hours. He has earned the \nrespected designations of instructor pilot, maintenance test flight \nevaluator, and rotary wing instrument flight examiner as he progressed.\n  His profession has sent him to four overseas duty stations in Central \nAmerica and Japan. He also participated in three combat tours, \nincluding Operation Desert Storm in 1991, Operation Iraqi Freedom with \n1107th Aviation Classification and Repair Depot in 2005, and Operation \nEnduring Freedom with 1107th Theater Aviation Sustainment Maintenance \nGroup in 2010. In addition, Daniel Sandbothe was selected to lead a \nteam to assist the Lebanese Armed Forces in improving their aviation \nmaintenance program.\n  CW5 Daniel Sandbothe has also been appointed to the Missouri Army \nNational Guard Senior Warrant Officer Advisory Council. His job will be \nto help pick the future non-commissioned leaders of the Missouri \nNational Guard's air elements. This distinction represents his \ncommitment to his profession as a United States serviceman.\n  His legacy will be felt by future generations of the National Guard \nin Missouri, including those he has trained, led, and mentored over the \nlast four decades. For his years of committed services, CW5 Daniel \nSandbothe has earned his retirement. I wish him well in his next \nopportunity and thank him for his years of service to Missouri and the \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/14/senate-section/article/S4453-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4453-S4454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             DIABETES STUDY\n\n Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I wish to draw attention to a study \nby the\n\n[[Page S4454]]\n\nUniversity of Florida on diabetes. Diabetes is a chronic disease that \naffects the body's blood glucose levels. Diabetic Americans have too \nmuch glucose in their blood, which can lead to serious health problems. \nIn addition to the large number of Americans who suffer from diabetes, \nthe disease is one of the costliest chronic diseases and, currently, \nabout 1-in-3 Medicare dollars is spent on people with diabetes.\n  This study, led by Dr. Todd Manini of the University of Florida's \nInstitute on Aging, suggests a correlation between the amount of time \npeople spend sitting and their risk of developing diabetes later in \nlife. The findings from this study are alarming, particularly given the \nstatistics about diabetes in our Nation. According to the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, in 2012, 29.1 million Americans--9.3 \npercent of the population--had diabetes. Diabetes was the country's \nseventh leading cause of death and Americans with diabetes spend an \naverage of 2.3 times more on medical expenses. The disease is also \nhighly pervasive amongst our older Americans--11.8 million seniors age \n65 or older, 25.9 percent of all Americans over 65, have diabetes and \n51 percent of seniors are pre-diabetic.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I am well aware \nof the challenges diabetes poses to seniors. Last July, the Aging \nCommittee held a hearing to discuss the growing impact of diabetes with \nadvancing age. Diabetes impacts millions of Americans across all ages \nand even though seniors are particularly vulnerable to problems created \nby the disease, diabetes needs to be fought across the age spectrum.\n  Researchers tracked the weights and sitting times of nearly 90,000 \nwomen between the ages of 50 and 79 who were not initially taking \ndiabetes medications. Women who sat more than sixteen hours during \ntheir waking day had the highest risk of developing diabetes, and even \nif they introduced an exercise regimen, this high risk remained. Obese \nwomen have a 23 percent risk of developing diabetes and were more \nlikely to develop diabetes than overweight and normal-weight women even \nif they were both sedentary for the same amount of time. The study \nfound that the diabetes risk can be reduced by standing or walking for \n5 minutes for every hour spent sitting.\n  This new University of Florida study enhances our understanding of \nthe disease and emphasizes the importance of healthy behavior and \nhabits throughout our lives. Though much progress has been made in \ndiabetes research, we still have a long way to go in combatting this \ndisease that affects millions of Americans. We must continue funding \ngroundbreaking research like that at the University of Florida and \npromoting the kinds of lifestyle changes that will reduce the risks of \ndiseases like diabetes in old age.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/14/senate-section/article/S4454-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/14/senate-section/article/S4454-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/14/senate-section/article/S4454-3", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4718.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to clarify and \nexpand Federal criminal jurisdiction over Federal contractors and \nemployees outside the United States, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I reintroduce the Civilian \nExtraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, CEJA. The United States has huge \nnumbers of Government employees and contractors working overseas, but \nthe legal framework governing them is unclear and outdated. To promote \naccountability, Congress must make sure that our criminal laws reach \nserious misconduct by U.S. government employees and contractors \nwherever they act. The Civilian Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act \naccomplishes this important and common sense goal by allowing United \nStates contractors and employees working overseas who commit specific \ncrimes to be tried and sentenced under U.S. law.\n  Tragic events in Iraq and Afghanistan highlight the need to \nstrengthen the laws providing for jurisdiction over American government \nemployees and contractors working abroad. In September 2007, Blackwater \nsecurity contractors working for the State Department shot more than 20 \nunarmed civilians on the streets of Baghdad, killing at least 14 of \nthem, and causing a rift in our relations with the Iraqi government. \nEfforts to prosecute those responsible for these shootings have been \nfraught with difficulties. The Blackwater trial is only just now under \nway, seven years after this tragedy, and the defendants continue to \nargue in court that the U.S. government does not have jurisdiction to \nprosecute them.\n  I worked with Senator Sessions and others in 2000 to pass the \nMilitary Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, MEJA, and then, again, to \namend it in 2004, so that U.S. criminal laws would extend to all \nmembers of the U.S. military, to those who accompany them, and to \ncontractors who work with the military. That law provides criminal \njurisdiction over Defense Department employees and contractors, but it \ndoes not explicitly cover people working for other Federal agencies, \nlike the Blackwater security contractors. Had jurisdiction in the \ntragic Blackwater incident been clear, it could have prevented some of \nthe problems that have plagued the case.\n  Other incidents have made all too clear that the Blackwater case was \nnot an isolated incident. Private security contractors have been \ninvolved in violent incidents and serious misconduct in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, including other shooting incidents in which civilians have \nbeen seriously injured or killed. MEJA does not cover many of the \nthousands of U.S. contractors and employees who are working abroad. The \nlegislation I introduce today fills this gap.\n  Ensuring criminal accountability will also improve our national \nsecurity and protect Americans overseas. Importantly, in those \ninstances where the local justice system may be less than fair, this \nexplicit jurisdiction will also protect Americans by providing the \noption of prosecuting them in the United States, rather than leaving \nthem subject to potentially hostile and unpredictable local courts. Our \nallies, including those countries most essential to our \ncounterterrorism and national security efforts, work best with us when \nwe hold our own accountable.\n  In 2011, the Senate Judiciary Committee heard testimony from the \nJustice Department and from experts in the area of contractor \naccountability about the many diplomatic and national security benefits \nof expanding criminal jurisdiction over American employees and \ncontractors overseas. That hearing also explored how best to ensure \nthat our Nation's intelligence activities would not be impaired by \nCEJA. The legislation I propose today has been carefully crafted to \nensure that the intelligence community can continue its authorized \nactivities unimpeded.\n  This bill would also provide greater protection to American victims \nof crime, as it would lead to more accountability for crimes committed \nby U.S. Government contractors and employees against Americans working \nabroad. The Committee has previously heard testimony from Jamie Leigh \nJones, a young woman from Texas who took a job with Halliburton in Iraq \nin 2005 when she was 20 years old. In her first week on the job, she \nwas drugged and gang-raped by coworkers. When she reported this \nassault, her employers moved her to a locked trailer, where she was \nkept by armed guards and freed only when the State Department \nintervened.\n  Ms. Jones testified about the arbitration clause in her contract that \nprevented her from suing Halliburton for this outrageous conduct. But \ncriminal jurisdiction over these kinds of atrocious crimes abroad \nremains complicated and depends on the specific location of the crime, \nwhich makes prosecutions inconsistent and sometimes impossible. We must \nfix the law to help avoid arbitrary injustice and ensure that victims \nwill not see their attackers escape accountability.\n  This legislation also provides another important benefit: It will lay \nthe groundwork to expand U.S. preclearance operations in Canada--\nthereby enhancing national security and facilitating commerce and \ntourism with our largest trading partner. The United States currently \nstations U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP, Officers in select \nlocations in Canada to inspect passengers and cargo bound for the \nUnited States before they leave Canada. These operations relieve \ncongestion at U.S. airports, improve commerce, save money, and provide \nnational security benefits. The United States and Canada are in ongoing \nconversations about an expansion of land, rail, marine and air \npreclearance operations that would greatly benefit the U.S. economy. \nBut one barrier in these discussions is that the United States lacks \nlegal authority to prosecute U.S. officials engaged in preclearance \noperations if they commit crimes while stationed in Canada. CEJA would \nensure that the U.S. has legal authority to hold our own officials \naccountable if they engage in wrongdoing, and thereby help pave the way \nto finalizing the expanded Canada preclearance agreement.\n  In the past, legislation in this area has been bipartisan. I hope \nSenators of both parties will work together to pass this important \nreform.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2598\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
