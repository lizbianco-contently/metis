Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the \nRepublican leader, if any, the Senate will be in morning business until \n5:30 p.m., with the time equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees.\n  At 5:30 p.m. there will be up to four rollcall votes. The first vote \nwill be on the confirmation of the Friedland nomination to be a U.S. \ncircuit judge for the Ninth Circuit. The next vote will be a cloture \nvote on the Weil nomination to be Administrator of the Wage and Hour \nDivision of the Department of Labor, and then a confirmation vote on \nthe Weil nomination. The last vote will be a vote on confirmation of \nthe O'Regan nomination to be Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment.\n\n\n                             Seemingly Real\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Nevada, and especially Las Vegas, is home to \nthe best entertainment on the planet. Those who visit Las Vegas and \nReno know they will find the best musical, theatrical, and comedic \nperformances anyplace on Earth. Some of the most popular performers in \nNevada are magicians and illusionists who entertain their audiences by \nmaking the impossible seem real. Through misdirection, these performers \ndistract viewers from what they know to be true and instead funnel \ntheir attention to something entertaining--and it is really fake.\n  It seems that the Republican party has decided to follow in Houdini \nand Copperfield's footsteps and employ a\n\n[[Page S2410]]\n\nbit of misdirection of its own. For example, last week the Wall Street \nJournal reported that the Republican Party has a newly adopted campaign \nstrategy to defeat Senate Democrats. They are going to attack me \nbecause their attacks and fabrications regarding the Affordable Care \nAct have borne little fruit.\n  In Senate races across the country, Republicans will avoid the issues \nthat matter most to Americans and instead will try to focus attention \non a Senator who is not even up for election--and that Senator is me.\n  What are those issues that Republicans so desperately want to avoid? \nHow about immigration? That bill was introduced a year ago, and it \npassed the Senate many months ago. It is a good piece of legislation \nand the vast majority of the American people think it is a good idea. \nYet instead of explaining to the American people why this bipartisan \nbill sits idle in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, \nthey want to change the subject.\n  The Speaker of the House of Representatives refuses to allow a vote. \nIf a vote were allowed to occur, it would pass overwhelmingly. It is a \ngood piece of legislation. Not only is it fair and equitable, but it \nwould also reduce the debt by $1 trillion.\n  While struggling American families plead to Congress for help in \nproviding work or getting paid fair, livable wages, House Republicans \nprefer to talk about anything other than what is relevant? Why? Because \ntheir billionaire sugar daddies are not interested in helping middle-\nclass Americans.\n  Charles and David Koch are not concerned with the long-term \nunemployed families, and so the Republicans they sponsor in the House \nof Representatives are content to do nothing. These billionaire oil \nbarons don't care that working women are being deprived of fair wages.\n  My daughter--or the Presiding Officer's wife--can do the exact same \nwork as a man but only get 77 cents while the man gets paid $1. We want \nto change that. The Koch-driven Republican Congress refuses even to \nallow us to have a vote on it. They have started filibusters here in \nthe Senate time and time again on this issue, and they will not bring \nthis matter to a vote in the House either.\n  As the Senate turns its attention to increasing the Federal minimum \nwage, which we moved to earlier today, is there any question as to \nwhether Republicans will once again do the Koch brothers' bidding? Of \ncourse not. They are not going to give millions of Americans a fair \nshot at earning a decent wage.\n  Eighty billion dollars is not enough for these two brothers. \nEvidently the Kochs think that $10.10 is too much for a hard-working \nAmerican with a family to take care of. If a person works 40 hours at \n$10.10, you just hit the magic spot where you are no longer in poverty. \nThey refuse to allow millions of Americans the opportunity to get out \nof poverty and to give millions of Americans a raise.\n  The Republicans in Congress yawn at the idea of giving the American \nmiddle class a fair shot at financial stability and instead have chosen \nto distract the American people by attacking me. Like all illusions, \nthey are using misdirection to call the American people's attention \naway from reality and attempting to buy America with their billions.\n  The Koch brothers and their accomplices continue to put millions upon \nmillions of dollars into attacking anyone and anything that stands in \ntheir way of getting richer--and already rich they are.\n  Senate Democrats refuse to stand idly by while two megarich \nindividuals attempt to create an American oligarchy.\n  I have spoken on the Senate floor against the Koch brothers' attempts \nto rig the system in their favor because it comes at the expense of \nfamilies in Nevada and families across this great country. In response, \none of the Kochs' puppet organizations announced its plans to run ads \nagainst me in the State of Nevada.\n  I am not running for anything for a few more years. As I said before, \nbeing the target of a couple of rich billionaires is not going to \nintimidate me.\n  Shockingly, the leadership of the Republican Party has decided to \nfollow suit with their new campaign strategy. It is obvious their \nprevious strategy of attacking ObamaCare has proven to be a miserable \nfailure. Over 8 million Americans have chosen the coverage of the \nAffordable Care Act, plus 3 million more who are on their parents' \ninsurance because of the Affordable Care Act. Up to 6 million people \nare on their way to having health care because of Medicaid, which is \nalso as part of ObamaCare.\n  For example, in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, 413,000 people have \nalready signed up for the State-sponsored health care they have in \nKentucky. So with one failed strategy behind them, Republicans and \ntheir benefactors are trying something new, but it is still the same \nsmoke-and-mirrors routine they tried in the past. Divert and obstruct \nis what they do.\n  To those Republicans who would rather bash me than speak out about \nwhat matters most important to their constituents, I say fire away.\n  To Charles and David Koch and their radical henchmen, feel free to \nattack me as much as you want. I can take it. Don't expect the American \npeople to be fooled by this newest slight of hand strike. Ultimately \nvoters will see the new tactic for what it is--a distraction that is \nkeeping American families from getting a fair shot at financial \nstability.\n  In the meantime Senate Democrats will continue to speak against the \nshadowy influence of two power-drunk billionaires and their devoted \nfollowers on Capitol Hill.\n  Most importantly, Senate Democrats will continue working on \nmeaningful legislation that will get our Nation's middle class back on \ntrack.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  Will the Chair announce the business of the day.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, in just a couple of hours in Milford, \nCT, at 7 p.m. this evening there will be a vigil that will bring \ntogether many different members of the Milford community to celebrate, \nmourn, and grieve the life of a beautiful young woman who suffered a \nsenseless and brutal death last Friday morning. In this inexplicable \nact of violence, she was killed by a fellow classmate shortly after 7 \nin the morning.\n  Jonathan Law High School was turned into a crime scene as members of \nthe emergency responder team--first the police and then the medics--\nsought to save her life. Tragically and unfortunately, they were unable \nto do so. The evening that was to be their junior prom instead became a \nvigil.\n  We will perhaps never know what prompted this horrific and \nunimaginable act of brutality. This horrific event has united and \nbrought together people who are now mourning Maren's death.\n  We know with certainty what a wonderful human being Maren Sanchez \nwas, and we also know this community has shown strength and courage by \ncoming together and uniting to help each other--particularly those \nstudents who knew her. We also know with certainty how gifted, \ntalented, compassionate, and caring she was as\n\n[[Page S2411]]\n\nthe manager of sports teams, a gifted singer, an athlete, school \npresident, and an honor student. Her whole future was ahead of her. \nMost remarkably, she was a person of consummate caring and compassion \nfor her fellow students. Those students struggle today to make some \nsense of this violence, to derive some meaning and maybe some comfort.\n  I went to Jonathan Law High School yesterday for part of the \nafternoon and spoke with Chief of Police Keith Mello, whose men and \nwomen have helped the community so deeply; the mayor of Milford Ben \nBlake, who has demonstrated leadership in this crisis; the \nsuperintendent of schools and principal of Jonathan Law High School; \nand the many teachers and parents and students and the grief counselors \nand therapists who came to speak with those students and help them to \nthink and live through this horrible tragedy.\n  What is remarkable and so impressed me yesterday was the love and \ncaring that people from disparate parts of this community showed for \neach other and continue to show in this testing time. This is a time of \nextraordinary adversity and tragedy. People who might otherwise be \nstrangers are drawn together by the thread of grief and will reform the \nfabric of a community by simple acts of caring. They are united today \nin their grief and bewilderment. They are seeking to honor Maren's \nlegacy and sustain it with the very qualities of courage, strength, \ncaring, and compassion she demonstrated throughout her life. Those \nqualities of caring, compassion, courage, and strength will see them \nthrough this tragedy as they come together for the vigil tonight.\n  We can all honor the legacy of this remarkable young woman by looking \nfor ways to make the world better, as she sought to do, and filling it \nwith song and color, the lust for life, and the joy and pride in her \ncontemporary accomplishments.\n  We need to search for steps we can take to make our schools better \nand safer. The time to talk about policy or steps to better school \nsafety will come, and I hope we will all be a part of that continuing \neffort in exploring how to protect anyone and everyone who comes to \nschool, which should be a haven of safety and insulated from violence--\nparticularly against the most vulnerable members of our community. But \nthose policy responses can wait until after the days of grief and \nmourning have passed as we celebrate this remarkable young life. She \nwas described by members of her class as an angel. Her cousin Edward \nKovac said on Friday:\n\n       Maren should be celebrating at her prom this evening with \n     her friends and classmates. Instead, we are mourning her \n     death and we are trying to understand this senseless loss of \n     life.\n\n  He said:\n\n       She was a bright light full of hope and dreams. In fact, \n     she was among the brightest of lights, full of the most \n     wondrous hopes and dreams.\n\n  So today my heart and prayers are with her family, her friends, the \nMilford community, as they gather for this vigil tonight. Separated by \ndistance, I will be with them in spirit, as I know my colleagues who \nknow of this tragedy will be as well. This kind of tragedy is \nindecipherable, incomprehensible to young men and women--16-year-olds--\nbut equally so to all of us of any age. My hope is that we will honor \nMaren Sanchez's legacy, that our hearts and prayers will go to her \nfamily, her parents, and all who knew her and all who would like to \nhave known her because she was such a remarkable and wonderful human \nbeing.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are told that this week, on \nWednesday, we are going to have a vote on the so-called minimum wage, \nthe so-called 40-percent increase in the minimum wage. This is part of \na jobs plan by my friends on the Democratic side. Now, it is not a plan \nthat is intended to pass anything, and that was revealed in a New York \nTimes article by my distinguished friend from New York, Senator \nSchumer, who may be an architect of this. It is to highlight political \ndifferences, which is a fair thing to do in the Senate. But lest anyone \nthink that someone is trying to pass a law here, they should not be \nconfused by that.\n  We have had three hearings on the minimum wage in the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee, of which I am the ranking \nRepublican member. We have had time to have those three hearings, but \nthe chairman of the committee, the Senator from Iowa, has said we do \nnot have time to markup the bill in committee or consider any \namendments to this idea with better proposals to create jobs. It was \nreported in one of the Hill newspapers that somebody said: Well, why \ndon't you have time for amendments on the minimum wage, and he said: \nWell, there might be embarrassing amendments. I think there probably \nwould be votes on embarrassing amendments--embarrassing only if you \nvoted against them.\n  So let me talk a little bit about this proposal by my Democratic \nfriends to create jobs by raising the minimum wage.\n  Now, they are on the right issue. The issue is jobs. We have been \nhome in Maine and Tennessee and around the country, and too many people \nare having a hard time finding a job. Too many people have been out of \nwork for more than 6 months. We call them the long-term unemployed. Mr. \nPresident, 10.5 million people are unemployed right now. Unemployed \nAmericans have been out of work an average of 9 months. That is beyond \nthe time for unemployment compensation, on the average.\n  It is hard to find a job. It is hard to create a job. It is \nespecially tough on people in their forties and fifties and sixties.\n  Family incomes are lower than we would like for them to be. The \ncritical problem is, there are too few jobs, especially for low-wage \nworkers. Then, we saw a report this morning that said that most of the \njobs created since 2008 have been lower-wage jobs rather than higher-\nwage jobs.\n  So the issue is right. It is jobs. The American people want it to be \neasier to find a good-paying job. The Democratic proposal we are going \nto vote on this week as a solution to the jobs problem is a proposal \nthat will eliminate 500,000 jobs. Now, let me say that again in case \nanyone thought I misread my page of notes. We are talking about jobs, \nand the Democratic proposal--this is the big deal this week. We are not \ngoing to do anything in the Senate this week of any significance on the \nfloor, so far as I know--a few nominations--except have a procedural \nvote Wednesday on the minimum wage proposal, and the Democratic \nproposal to make it easier to find a job is to eliminate 500,000 jobs.\n  In case you think I am making this up, let me quote where I got this \npiece of information. This is from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice. The Congressional Budget Office is something we set up by law \nbecause we will make our Republican points and we will make our \nDemocratic points, and we may shade it a little bit this way or a \nlittle bit that way. So we say to the CBO: You tell us the truth as \nbest as you can tell. They are nonpartisan. We do not always like what \nthey say. This is what they said about the Democratic proposal to \ncreate more jobs:\n\n       Once fully implemented in the second half of 2016, the \n     $10.10 option [to raise the minimum wage] would reduce total \n     employment by about 500,000 workers, or .3 percent. . . .\n\n  That is according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n  Should we believe the Congressional Budget Office?\n  Senator Heller, the distinguished Senator from Nevada, asked Janet \nYellen, President Obama's recently confirmed head of the Federal \nReserve Board, what her thoughts on the CBO study and the impact of \nraising the minimum wage would be. This is what she said. I quote \nPresident Obama's new Fed chief, Janet Yellen:\n\n       The CBO is as qualified as anyone to evaluate that \n     literature.\n\n\n[[Page S2412]]\n\n\n  And she said:\n\n       I wouldn't want to argue with their assessment.\n\n  So there we have the Congressional Budget Office saying it will \nreduce 500,000 jobs and the new head of the Federal Reserve Board--\nappointed by the President, confirmed by the Senate--saying she \n``wouldn't want to argue with their assessment.''\n  We will be hearing more from Democrats this week about the number of \npeople whose wages will be raised by the minimum wage. There will be \nthat. But the CBO also reported that $4 out of $5 earned from the \nincrease in the minimum wage will go to workers in families who are \nabove the poverty level. Mr. President, $4 out of $5 will go to workers \nin families who are above the poverty level, and nearly one-third of \nthose families who would benefit from the minimum wage increase already \nearn more than three times the poverty level.\n  This reminds me of ObamaCare in this way: According to a recent \nWashington Post story, only about 1 in 4 people signing up for \nObamaCare were previously uninsured. About three-quarters of people \nwith ObamaCare insurance already had insurance before we went through \nall the turmoil of the last 3 or 4 years.\n  In the same sort of way, the minimum wage is said to benefit low-\nincome Americans, but only 1 in 5 of the dollars from an increase will \ngo to families below the poverty line. And that is not all.\n  In addition to cutting 500,000 jobs and providing 80 percent of the \nbenefits to families above the poverty level, the Democratic jobs \nproposal imposes one more burden on the only Americans who are capable \nof solving this problem, and that is the job creators.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record following my \nremarks the testimony of Laurie Palmer of Waterville, ME, who owns four \nBurger King franchises with approximately 140 employees. I say to the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer, I had no idea he might be presiding \ntoday, but I am glad to have a Maine story.\n  Ms. Palmer says in her testimony:\n\n       An increase in the minimum wage will directly and \n     negatively impact my ability to create new jobs while \n     limiting the benefits available to my current employees. I \n     currently employ 60 people who work an average of 25 hours \n     per week and earn the current minimum wage as defined by \n     Maine law--$7.50 per hour. All but a handful of these people \n     were hired within the last 6 months. Mathematically, an \n     increase in the federal minimum wage would cost me an extra \n     $3,900 per week or $208,000 per year . . . my net income for \n     last year was approximately $35,100--with an extra $208,000 \n     in expenses, I will very likely be forced to close my \n     business.\n\n  She also notes, ``One hundred percent of my current staff starting at \nminimum wage are under 25.''\n  Republicans believe that if we want to create jobs, there is a better \nway. We would like to offer our ideas through the Health, Education, \nLabor & Pensions Committee. But as I mentioned, we only had time for \nthree hearings. Although we are able to spend a whole week on this on \nthe floor for one procedural vote, we are not allowed to offer \namendments in the committee and, so far as I know, here because there \nmight be embarrassing amendments.\n  Let's consider what those embarrassing amendments might be. They \nmight be about the earned-income tax credit. Senator Rubio of Florida, \nand Congressman Paul Ryan, have all suggested the earned-income tax \ncredit is a better way to make sure the lowest earning workers in \nAmerica have a better wage if we are going to get the government \ninvolved in it.\n  Of course, if we are going to do that, we are going to have to deal \nwith some problems, including the Internal Revenue Service estimate \nthat 21 or 25 percent of the payments are improperly made in 2012. We \ncould consider the proposals that, rather than giving those earned-\nincome tax credits out in a lump sum each year, they might be given out \nwith each paycheck.\n  But the Congressional Budget Office also said something about earned-\nincome tax credits. They said one-third of low-wage workers would be in \nfamilies [benefiting from the minimum wage increase] whose income was \nmore than three times the Federal poverty level in 2016. By contrast, \nsaid CBO, an increase in the earned-income tax credit would go almost \nentirely to lower income families. CBO also noted that the earned-\nincome tax credit encourages more people in low-income families to \nwork, a value we should encourage.\n  So if our goal as a country is to provide a minimum wage for working \nAmericans, why is it fair to assess the cost of that goal on just the \nAmericans who create the jobs? Of course it makes creating the jobs \nharder, but even more importantly, why should not every one of us who \npays taxes share in the burden of increasing America's workers' pay? \nThat is what happens with the earned-income tax credit.\n  There is another proposal, a bipartisan one. We call it the 30-to-40-\nhour workweek. Senator Collins of Maine is one of the principal \nsponsors. The Senator from Indiana I believe is the lead Democratic \nsponsor. It is a bipartisan proposal that would, in effect, be a 33-\npercent pay increase for millions of American workers who already have \nseen their hours cut because of ObamaCare. It is a way to prevent--to \nsay it another way--millions more workers from getting a 25-percent pay \ncut.\n  The reason all of this occurs is because ObamaCare defined full-time \nwork as 30 hours. We would like to change it to 40 hours. ObamaCare \nsays employers with 50 or more full-time workers must offer government-\napproved insurance or pay a fine. Full time is defined as 30 hours or \nmore. That sounds as though it was written in France.\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce says 74 percent of their members say the \nhealth care law makes it harder for their firms to hire workers. \nChanging the definition of full time to 40 hours would make it easier \nto hire. Senators Collins and Donnelly have introduced the Forty Hours \nis Full Time Act. It would change the definition of full time in the \nlaw to 40 hours per week. We could be discussing that this week. We \ncould have brought that up in our committee, had we been allowed to, or \nthe SKILLS Act.\n  There are 47 separate Federal jobs programs for which taxpayers are \nspending $18 billion. The Government Accountability Office says 44 of \nthose programs are duplicative. The SKILLS Act, passed by the House, \nconsolidates 35 Federal programs and creates a single workforce \ninvestment fund. Members of the Senate have been working with Members \nof the House to see if we can agree on a revision of the Workforce \nInvestment Act. We are making good progress.\n  If we can do a better job spending those dollars across America, that \nwould be a good way to help create more jobs in America or at least \nmake them easier to obtain. But we do not have time for that in our \nhearings. We could spend time debating amendments to transform long-\nterm unemployment compensation into job training. But we do not have \ntime for that amendment.\n\n  Today, Americans have been out of work for an average of 9 months. \nThey need new skills. They need skills that help them get a job. Then \nask almost anyone on either side of the aisle what is the best long-\nterm way to make sure that children of low-income families are prepared \nfor a good job. Almost every Governor I know is focused like a laser on \nthis. That is the chance to go to the best possible school.\n  I have introduced legislation that would allow States, such as \nTennessee or Maine, to take their money from approximately 80 existing \nfederal elementary and secondary education programs and turn it into \n$2,100 scholarships that would follow 11 million low-income children to \nthe school they attend. We could create $2,100 scholarships for 1 out \nof 5 school-aged kids in America.\n  When I say ``schools they attend,'' that could include a private \nschool, if the State decided that. But this would not be a Federal \nmandate to that effect. The State would make that decision. It would \nsimply make sure these Federal dollars follow the child to the school \nthe child attends. If the State wants it to be public, if the State \nwants it to be on this corner, that is up to the State. We could offer \nand discuss that amendment.\n  Why not give elementary and secondary children a ticket to a better \nschool? We give them a ticket to a childcare development center. We did \nthat in a bipartisan way last month. We have tickets to college. We \ncall those Pell grants. Why not help them go to better schools?\n\n[[Page S2413]]\n\n  Then there are other amendments that we think, on our side of the \naisle, have more to do with creating jobs than a so-called minimum wage \nproposal that the Congressional Budget Office says will destroy 500,000 \njobs. For example, we could build the Keystone Pipeline, which passed \nthe Senate last year during our budget discussions 62 to 37. That would \ncreate jobs.\n  We could pass trade promotion authority. President Obama has asked us \nto do that. Both in Europe and in Asia, the President has a chance to \nnegotiate trade agreements that would create more jobs in America as we \nship automobiles and soybeans from Tennessee and other places to the \nrest of the world. But the majority leader of the Senate says: No, that \nis dead for this year.\n  We could debate a proposal to reform the National Labor Relations \nBoard. I do not like the fact that they have become more of an advocate \nthan an umpire, with micro unions, with ambush elections, with \nundermining state right-to-work laws. But Democrats come back and say: \nWell, when the Republicans are in power, they are more of an advocate \nfor employers. Maybe there is some truth to that. Let's pass a law \nsaying: It would be better to create jobs in America if employers and \nemployees could count on the NLRB to be a fair and unbiased tribunal, \nan umpire, not an advocate.\n  We could create jobs in America and slow the spread of jobs to Europe \nfrom America by repealing the medical device tax. That also passed the \nSenate last year, 79 to 20, which means there are lots of Democrats for \nit as well as lots of Republicans. So as I say, the only thing \nembarrassing about these amendments to a jobs bill would be voting \nagainst them.\n  On the most important issue facing the country, surely we can do \nbetter than the stale, bankrupt idea that will be voted on this week on \nthe floor of the Senate, that according to the office we are supposed \nto trust for advice, the Congressional Budget Office, would, No. 1, \ndestroy 500,000 jobs; No. 2, concentrate most of the benefits on those \nabove the poverty line; No. 3, make it more expensive to create jobs; \nand, No. 4, tax only some taxpayers for a policy designed to benefit \nthe entire society.\n  This kind of thinking is right in line with ObamaCare, Dodd-Frank, \nand all of the other policies that have spread a big wet blanket of \nrules and regulations over our free enterprise system and made it \nharder to create a job and harder to find a job in the United States of \nAmerica. That is why we have 10.5 million people unemployed in America \ntoday for an average of 9 months. It is this constant parade of ideas \nthat increases the big, wet, smothering blanket of rules and \nregulations over the free enterprise system and that does nothing to \nmake it easier to create jobs and easier to find a job.\n  There are better ideas. Reform refundable tax credits to benefit all \nlow-income workers; replace long-term unemployment compensation with \njob training; change ObamaCare's workweek definition from 30 hours to \n40 hours to encourage full-time work; use existing Federal education \ndollars to give children of low-income families a $2,100 scholarship to \nchoose a better school. All of those would create an environment in \nwhich the job creators could create more jobs and in which these who \nwant them could find a job more easily.\n  That is what we should be about, instead of pretending we can pass a \nlaw in America and give many people a higher income. We can do that. We \ncan do that. But when we do it, make no mistake about it, we are \ndestroying 500,000 jobs and giving benefits to people above the poverty \nline instead of below.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nStatement From Laurie Anne Palmer, Burger King' Franchisee, \n                           Waterville, Maine\n\n       Chairman Harkin, Ranking Member Alexander and members of \n     this Committee, thank you for the opportunity to submit my \n     testimony today. My name is Laurie Anne Palmer and I own \n     Waterville Burger Corporation which runs four Burger \n     King' restaurants in the Waterville area of Maine. \n     I would like to note that I am a small business owner; my \n     views are my own and may not reflect those of the Burger \n     King' brand.\n       In 1972, my father, David Palmer, purchased the only \n     existing Burger King' restaurant in Maine. Over \n     the next 8 years, my mother and father expanded to 5 \n     restaurants around Portland and Waterville, Maine. After \n     selling their Portland stores, my parents formed Waterville \n     Burger Corporation and began growing their operations in the \n     Waterville area, eventually turning the company over to me in \n     1996. As a teenager and into college, I had worked part time \n     in their restaurants, so it was a natural fit for me to take \n     over upon their retirement. I've always considered my \n     parents' employees as my second family, and I still do so \n     today.\n       In 1998, I was forced to close one of my restaurants. This \n     restaurant was located in Boothbay Harbor, Maine--a very \n     seasonal small fishing town. The State of Maine's Department \n     of Transportation had rerouted the tourist traffic off I-95 \n     resulting in a bypass of the town. My other restaurants were \n     supporting this restaurant financially and it just did not \n     make sense to continue to lose money at that location. I have \n     invested significant time and money in my four remaining \n     stores, including transferring $25,000 of my personal savings \n     this year alone into the business to keep it afloat. I will \n     always do what it takes to keep my company healthy. Personal \n     sacrifice is the first step in cutting costs. I learned this \n     from my parents and will continue this method of operation. I \n     am proud to employ 140 people, 30 of which are full time and \n     110 are part time.\n       I am here today to talk to you about the Fair Minimum Wage \n     Act of 2013 (S. 460). As I understand it, this bill seeks to \n     increase the federal minimum wage from $7.25 per hour to \n     $10.10 per hour, which equates to a 39.3 percent increase. It \n     would also increase the cash wage for tipped employees from \n     $2.13 per hour to $7.07 per hour, a 232 percent increase. If \n     this legislation becomes law, small business owners like \n     myself--who already face minimal profit margins--will either \n     be forced to recoup the costs elsewhere or close their \n     businesses entirely. In a business that has been solely owned \n     and run by my family, this possible outcome would be \n     devastating not only for me, but for my second family--my \n     employees.\n\n\n                          The Franchise Model\n\n       It is important to understand that, as a franchisee, the \n     business model under which I operate is much different than \n     other small business owners. By signing a franchise \n     agreement, my businesses must carry certain trademarks and \n     other identifiers consistent with the Burger King' \n     brand. Burger King' Corporation also receives a \n     monthly royalty fee of 3.5 percent and a monthly advertising \n     fee of 4 percent of my gross sales.\n       As a franchisee, I am often seen as an agent of the brand \n     and not a small business owner. In fact, my salary comes from \n     the net income generated after royalty and advertising fees, \n     payroll, supplier bills, utility bills, and other costs \n     associated with running my business. My net income last year \n     was $35,100. In particularly slow months, I didn't receive a \n     salary at all. In the months devastated by weather I had to \n     contribute money into the business. Further, I am currently \n     preparing my business for the implementation of the \n     Affordable Care Act (ACA), which is going to cost me \n     thousands of dollars, if not more.\n       It is crucial to understand that, as a franchisee, \n     government mandates are paid out of my pocket--not that of my \n     franchisor. That's why additional proposals like an increase \n     in minimum wage will put yet another financial strain on my \n     business--one that's already struggling to keep its doors \n     open.\n\n\n                Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) Industry\n\n       As a franchisee in the QSR industry, my profit margins are \n     minimal. As a businessperson, I look at the penny profits of \n     the products I sell. Data from a P benchmark report \n     prepared by my purchasing cooperative, Restaurant Services, \n     Inc. (RSI), shows that, from November 2012-October 2013, the \n     average net profit per Burger King' Restaurant was \n     approximately $78,000. An increase in the minimum wage to \n     $10.10 per hour ($2.85/hour) for a small business owner \n     employing 10 minimum wage workers working 40 hours per week \n     is an increase of $59,280 per year. Simple math reveals that \n     an increase in minimum wage to $10.10 per hour would reduce \n     the average net income of a Burger King' \n     franchisee to $18,720 per year--a figure lower than the 2014 \n     federal poverty level for a family of three. For a franchisee \n     like me whose net profits are less than half of the $77,000 \n     average, it would simply put me out of business.\n       Further, a calculation of profits per employee reveal that \n     those in the QSR industry like me cannot afford to absorb the \n     impact of costs such as a minimum wage increase. In fact, a \n     study from the University of Tennessee's Center for Business \n     and Economic Research concluded that the average net income--\n     or profit--per employee for those in the hospitality industry \n     is $754--significantly lower than almost every industry in \n     the United States (see attached PPE Executive Summary). An \n     increase in minimum wage to $10.10 per hour would cost me \n     $5,928 for each full-time (40 hours per week) minimum wage \n     employee per year ($2.85 40 52)--a figure far below the \n     income generated per employee. Again, the math shows that I \n     simply cannot afford this minimum wage increase and, unless I \n     can recoup the costs somewhere else, will go out of business.\n\n\n                         Impact on My Business\n\n       An increase in minimum wage will directly and negatively \n     impact my ability to create\n\n[[Page S2414]]\n\n     new jobs while limiting the benefits available to my current \n     employees. I currently employ 60 people who work an average \n     of 25 hours per week and earn the current minimum wage as \n     defined by Maine law--$7.50 per hour. All but a handful of \n     these people were hired within the last 6 months. \n     Mathematically, an increase in the federal minimum wage would \n     cost me an extra $3,900 per week or $208,000 per year ($2.60 \n     25 60 52). As I mentioned above, my net income for last year \n     was approximately $35,100--with an extra $208,000 in \n     expenses, I will very likely be forced to close my business.\n       In order to remain in business and continue to employ over \n     140 individuals, these costs must be recouped somewhere. Most \n     likely, I will be forced to cut employee hours, increase menu \n     prices and/or freeze all possible new hires. The industry has \n     developed equipment engineered to reduce labor hours in the \n     restaurant--an increase in minimum wage would make the \n     purchase of this equipment a more likely consideration. These \n     employees are my second family--many of them have worked for \n     me for over 10 years. A small handful have even been with me \n     for over 20 years. Having to cut their hours or even lay off \n     employees would be almost as devastating to me as it would to \n     my employees.\n       While an increase in the minimum wage doesn't take into \n     account the overwhelming financial burdens of ACA \n     implementation, I have additional costs that are cutting into \n     my already minimal profits. Increases in food and energy \n     costs have been rising steadily over the last several years. \n     I must additionally consider the fact that my higher paid \n     employees will also be seeking an increase in pay as a result \n     of an increase in minimum wage. My payroll costs are at 30 \n     percent of my net sales with the current wage structure. \n     Simply put, another costly government mandate such as an \n     increase in minimum wage may be the nail in my business's \n     coffin.\n\n\n                      The Actual ``Minimum Wage''\n\n       In truth, the ``minimum wage'' is not a floor--it is an \n     opportunity for those who may neither want nor have access to \n     other employment. It is a ``starting wage'' in which \n     primarily young, inexperienced workers are given the training \n     and experience they would have not otherwise received. As a \n     result of hard work and dedication, many quickly receive pay \n     increases and are promoted within the organization.\n       The majority of my employees have been promoted due to \n     their hard work and dedication and now serve as managers in \n     my restaurants. In fact, my four General Managers began their \n     careers with me earning the minimum wage and have worked \n     their way to the top position in each of my restaurants. All \n     of my hourly managers began by earning the minimum wage and \n     have each worked hard to earn a management position. I \n     strongly believe in developing the talent of individuals.\n       One hundred percent of my current staff starting at minimum \n     wage are under 25. In fact, 47 percent of federal minimum \n     wage restaurant employees are teenagers, while 71 percent are \n     under the age of 25. The average household income of a \n     restaurant worker that earns federal minimum wage is $62,507. \n     Minimum wage income is often a supplement to family wages or \n     as ``spending money'' for younger workers.\n       An increase in the federal minimum wage will likely and \n     directly hurt those it was intended to benefit. By increasing \n     costs, small business owners like me will be forced to \n     eliminate entry-level jobs and redistribute tasks to more \n     senior employees. The availability of job opportunities for \n     those who need it the most will decrease and unemployment \n     will likely rise. In sum, a minimum wage increase will hurt \n     both small business owners and their potential employees \n     across the country--the last thing we need in an already \n     stagnant economy.\n       I'm proud of the opportunity I offer my employees and of \n     course I wish I could pay them more, but my industry business \n     model makes it very difficult. As I referenced previously, \n     this is a labor intensive business with tight margins. It is \n     challenging enough competing with McDonalds, Wendy's and \n     others, but when mandates like ACA and this proposed wage \n     hike are thrust upon me, I get scared, I really do . . . for \n     me and my employees.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to explain the effect of a \n     minimum wage increase on my business.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/28/senate-section/article/S2414-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ISRAEL\n\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, every Member of this body has expressed our \nbipartisan commitment for the United States to stand resolutely with \nour friend and ally, the nation of Israel. Doing so is right, and it is \noverwhelmingly in the national security interests of the United States \nof America.\n  It was therefore with great sadness that I read this morning about \nthe comments of Secretary of State John Kerry, who reportedly suggested \nat the Trilateral Commission that Israel could become an apartheid \nstate if his proposed two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian \npeace process fails.\n  Secretary Kerry has long experience in foreign policy, and he \nunderstands that words matter. Apartheid is inextricably associated \nwith one of the worst examples of state-sponsored discrimination in \nhistory--the apartheid system in South Africa that was ultimately \nbrought down by the heroic resistance of Nelson Mandela inside the \ncountry, supported by a concerted campaign of diplomatic and economic \nsanctions by the international community.\n  There is no place for this word in the context of the State of \nIsrael. The term ``apartheid'' means apart, different, and isolated--\nthe state of the victims of apartheid with which the Jews are \ntragically all too familiar. The notion that Israel would go down that \npath--and so face the same condemnation that faced South Africa--is \nunconscionable. The United States should be aggressively asserting that \nIsrael can never be made an apartheid nation while America exists and \nstands beside her because America will be with Israel regardless of the \nstatus of the diplomatic process.\n  Fifteen months ago, almost to the day, John Kerry was confirmed by \nthis body by a vote of 94 to 3. Despite my preference for giving the \nPresident the Cabinet members of his choice, I found that I could not \njoin the vast majority of my colleagues and support his nomination \nbecause I was convinced that as Secretary of State, John Kerry would \nplace what he considered to be the wishes of the international \ncommunity above the national security interests of the United States.\n  I fear that with these most recent ill-chosen remarks, Secretary \nKerry has proven these concerns well founded. Rather than focusing on \nour clear national security interests--which is continuing to guarantee \nIsrael's security through our unquestionable commitment to it--\nSecretary Kerry has instead repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to \ncountenance a world in which Israel is made a pariah because it will \nnot sacrifice its security to his diplomatic initiatives; likewise, he \nhas previously suggested that Israel might probably be subject to \nboycotts for the same grounds.\n  It is no wonder Israel's Defense Minister remarked in January that \n``the only thing that can `save us' is for John Kerry to win a Nobel \nPrize and leave us in peace.''\n  Indeed, my colleague, the senior Senator from Arizona, has suggested \nthat the foreign policy carried out by Mr. Kerry is the equivalent of a \n``human wrecking ball.'' The fact that Secretary Kerry sees nothing \nwrong with making a statement comparing Israel's policy to the \nabhorrent apartheid policies of South Africa--and doing so on the eve \nof Holocaust Remembrance Day--demonstrates a shocking lack of \nsensitivity to the incendiary and damaging nature of his rhetoric.\n  Sadly, it is my belief that Secretary Kerry has proven himself \nunsuitable for the position he holds and, therefore, before any further \nharm is done to our national security interests and to our critical \nalliance with the nation of Israel, that John Kerry should offer \nPresident Obama his resignation and the President should accept it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

FRIEDLAND TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE \n                     FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Michelle T. \nFriedland, of California, to be United States Circuit Judge for the \nNinth Circuit.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, more than 2 weeks ago, the Senate voted to \nend the filibuster on the nomination of Michelle Friedland of \nCalifornia to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit. That vote was the fourth time this year \nthat the Senate had to overcome a Republican filibuster of a highly \nqualified circuit court nominee. In stark contrast, the Senate \nconfirmed 18 of President Bush's circuit nominees within a week of \nbeing reported by the Judiciary Committee.\n  The Ninth Circuit is the busiest circuit court in the country. It has \nthe highest number of appeals filed, the highest pending appeals per \npanel and the highest pending appeals per active judge. It also takes \nfar longer than any other circuit court to resolve an appeal. The delay \nin resolving these appeals hurts the American people. After the \nconfirmation last month of John Owens and what I expect will be today's \nconfirmation of Michelle Friedland, the Ninth Circuit will be operating \nat full strength for the first time in more than 9 years. This is an \nimportant milestone, but we should not stop there. There are five \nadditional circuit court nominees awaiting Senate confirmation. I hope \nthat Senators who care about Americans having access to the courts will \nallow the Senate to confirm these nominees without further delay.\n  Michelle Friedland is an exceptionally talented attorney, who like \nthe other 19 judicial nominees confirmed earlier this year, could and \nshould have been confirmed last year. She was first nominated last \nAugust and after her hearing was delayed due to the Republican shutdown \nof our government, she finally came before the Judiciary Committee for \na hearing in early November.\n  In January, Ms. Friedland's nomination was voted out of the Judiciary \nCommittee with bipartisan support and she has the strong support of \nboth of her home state Senators--Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer. \nNevertheless, we were once again forced to follow the costly ritual of \nfiling and voting on cloture and wasting valuable floor time. There is \nno good reason we could not have voted to confirm Ms. Friedland last \nyear, and there is no good reason that we did not have a vote to \nconfirm her 2 weeks ago. Meanwhile, it is our Federal judiciary and the \nAmerican people who suffer from these delays.\n  If confirmed, Michelle Friedland would increase the gender diversity \non the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. She would be the seventeenth \nwoman to ever sit on this appellate court. In comparison, 83 men have \nbeen appointed to the Ninth Circuit over the course of its history. Her \nconfirmation will bring the percentage of active female judges sitting \non the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to nearly 38 percent. Her \nconfirmation will also mark the first time since the 29th judgeship was \nadded in 2007, that it has had a full complement of active judges \nserving on this busy appellate court.\n  I hope my fellow Senators will join me today to confirm Michele \nFriedland to the Ninth Circuit so that she can get to work for the \nAmerican people.\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I wish to express my opposition to \nthe nomination of Michelle Friedland to the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  Although Ms. Friedland has a fine resume, it is not her work \nexperience that concerns me but, rather, her views on many issues--\nviews that should give anyone reason to question her appointment as a \nU.S. Circuit Court judge. Most troubling to me is Ms. Friedland's views \nthat the International Court of Justice preempts U.S. law, despite the \nSupreme Court's repeated rejection of this notion. For those who don't \nknow, the International Court of Justice is the judicial arm of the \nUnited Nations and Ms. Friedland believes decisions from this court \nshould be binding on state courts in the U.S. I am thankful that the \nSupreme Court hasn't agreed with her and I'm fearful that her \nappointment to the Ninth Circuit will give her the opportunity to \nsurrender U.S. sovereignty to foreign courts and international law.\n  Another reason we, as legislators, should oppose Ms. Friedland is \nthat she has expressed views that indicate judges are free to legislate \nfrom the bench. As we all learn in grade school, the legislative branch \ncreates the laws, the executive branch enforces them, and the judicial \nbranch interprets them. Despite this, Ms. Friedland believes laws have \nno force unless a judge says they do. So when legislators, elected by \nthe people, pass a law or a constitution is amended, the new law has no \npower until a judge deems it enforceable and a constitution, state or \nU.S., does not create any rights unless the judiciary says it does. \nThis is a dangerous notion that tells me that Ms. Friedland is likely \nto only enforce laws and constitutional rights with which she agrees.\n  It is for these reasons that I am opposed to this nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question occurs \non the nomination.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Michelle T. Friedland, of California, to be United States Circuit \nJudge for the Ninth Circuit?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

On this vote the yeas are 51, the nays are 42.\n  The motion is agreed to.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I have many concerns with the \nnomination of Dr. David Weil to be the Administrator of the Wage and \nHour Division at the Department of Labor--DOL.\n  The Wage and Hour Division is an important agency that oversees the \nenforcement of more than a dozen laws that govern just about every \nprivate sector employment relationship in America. To fill this \nposition, we need someone who can be trusted by both employees and \nemployers to enforce the law without bias, and we need a qualified \nmanager. Unfortunately, I think Dr. Weil fails to meet that standard.\n  My greatest concern is about his ability to be impartial in carrying \nout the duties of his office. This role requires that he be a neutral \narbiter of law. But we have a number of writings and lectures by Dr. \nWeil that suggest he may use the power of government to pursue how he \nthinks the employer/employee relationship should be defined.\n  Dr. Weil has written a new book called ``The Fissured Workplace: Why \nWork Became So Bad for So Many and What Can Be Done to Improve It.'' In \nthis book, he suggests the Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division--\nthe division he is nominated to lead--could look for ways to expand its \ncurrent interpretations of labor law and should target employers who \nuse certain business models. In addition, in his book, Dr. Weil singles \nout a number of major employers, such as Marriott, Time Warner, Bank of \nAmerica, Walmart, Hershey, AT, Verizon, Subway, Hyatt, Apple, and \nFedEx. Dr. Weil states that current labor laws and traditional \nregulatory enforcement allow companies such as these to ``have their \ncake and eat it too,'' because they use common business models such as \nsubcontracting and supply chains and, therefore, can push liability for \ncompliance with workplace statutes off to other entities that are in \ntheir business model.\n  He further says that companies use multilayer business models ``to \navoid unionization,'' and appears to be critical of that, stating that \nemployers ``she[d] employment'' to find ``more subtle ways to shift \naway from a highly unionized workforce or move work to forms of \nemployment that are both legally and strategically difficult for unions \nto organize[.]''\n  Dr. Weil has been critical of the franchising industry as a whole. \nFor example, Dr. Weil believes the Wage and Hour Division should \ninvestigate corporate entities for wage and hour violations at \nindividual franchises/locations even though a direct employer-employee \nrelationship may not exist. He recommends investigating industries that \nemploy significant numbers of low-wage workers, such as the fast food, \nhotel/lodging, and construction industries.\n  The franchising industry has been an incredible engine of economic \ngrowth in this country and, according to the International Franchise \nAssociation, has created hundreds of thousands of successful small \nbusinesses, employing over 8 million individuals. Many of these \nbusinesses are owned by people who started on the bottom rung of the \neconomic ladder, making minimum wage, and worked their way up all the \nway to the top. Many of them are owned by women and minorities. For so \nmany people, franchising has been the path to the American Dream.\n  Take, for example, Laurie Palmer of Waterville, ME, who owns four \nBurger King franchises and employs approximately 140 people. She is \nalready worried about the prospect of closing her business with \npossible minimum wage increases and the cost of Obamacare. The last \nthing she should be worrying about is being singled out for a wage and \nhour investigation simply because she is a franchisee.\n  Dr. Weil's responses to written questions while his nomination was \nbefore the HELP Committee also raised several questions about his \npolicy positions. He gave non-answers to some pretty simple questions.\n  He would not answer yes or no when asked if he supports instructing \nWage and Hour Division investigators to presume a worker is an employee \neven if the employer has told investigators the worker is an \nindependent contractor. In other words, if an employer hires an \nindependent contractor, Dr. Weil may feel that he has the discretion to \ndecide that person is really an employee.\n  This is important because, just this month, a Texas Federal district \ncourt judge slapped DOL, and ultimately the taxpayer, with half a \nmillion dollars in costs for a failed wage and hour lawsuit. The Wage \nand Hour Division unsuccessfully tried to claim that a company's \nindependent contractors were employees. After multiple investigative \nmissteps noted by the court, including a wage and hour investigator \nimproperly shredding and burning interview notes and incorrectly \nassessing a $6 million penalty against the company, the court found \n``DOL failed to act in a reasonable manner'' and did not believe a \nreasonable person would conclude the folks in question were employees. \nIf Dr. Weil is confirmed, I hope he reads the court's decision closely \nto ensure this type of investigative behavior does not happen again.\n  Dr. Weil's writings suggest he may have a bull's eye on industries \nthat use subcontracting and franchising. And he would not answer yes or \nno when asked to commit to treating all complaints equally based on the \nmerits instead of the industry. Instead, he committed to\n\n[[Page S2417]]\n\ngiving the agency's investigators guidance on how to prioritize \ncomplaints, but made no indication of what complaints he thinks should \nbe a priority.\n  I am also concerned about Dr. Weil's lack of management experience. \nIf confirmed, Dr. Weil will be charged with supervising the work of \nmore than 1,800 employees in 54 field offices covering all of our \nstates and territories, with a $224 million budget. Dr. Weil has no \nmanagement experience beyond supervising small teams of people at \nBoston University and Harvard.\n  Several outside groups, including the Associated Builders and \nContractors, the International Franchise Association, and the National \nRestaurant Association have also expressed their opposition to Dr. \nWeil. The Wall Street Journal underscored its concerns with Dr. Weil by \ndescribing him as ``a life-long, left-wing academic with labor union \nsympathies, no private-sector experience or legal training, and limited \nmanagement experience.''\n  Last, I will note that this position has not had a confirmed \nAdministrator since the Bush Administration and this fact cannot be \nblamed on Republican delays or use of the filibuster. The President has \nnominated two individuals to this position, both of whom voluntarily \nwithdrew before any HELP Committee votes were scheduled. The last \nnominee withdrew his nomination in August of 2011--a full 32 months \nago.\n  After waiting this long, we need to get this right. I cannot support \na nominee who has advocated expanding current law beyond what Congress \nintended, nor could I support a nominee who is a proponent of targeting \nindustries and employers who use certain business models rather than \nbeing responsive to complaints of breaches of the law or one that has \nthe underlying goal of increasing unionization without regard to the \ndesires of employees themselves. Therefore, I cannot support Dr. Weil's \nconfirmation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the nomination of Dr. David Weil to serve as Administrator of the \nWage and Hour Division at the Department of Labor.\n  The Wage and Hour Division oversees some of the most fundamental \nprotections for American workers: it ensures that people are paid \nfairly in accordance with our minimum wage and overtime laws. It \nprotects vulnerable children when our child labor laws are abused. It \nensures that workers can spend time with their families when a new baby \nis born or a health crisis is looming. In short, this relatively \nunknown agency plays a huge role in how Americans experience their day-\nto-day working lives.\n  However despite this important mission, this critical agency was \nunfortunately allowed to atrophy during the last administration. The \ndivision took a backseat approach that relied almost exclusively on \ncomplaint-driven enforcement--relying on the questionable assumption \nthat vulnerable workers know their rights and will approach the agency \nto report violations of the law--rather than taking a more proactive \napproach to educate workers and seek out industries and populations \nwhere abuses are likely to happen. Furthermore, even this complaint-\ndriven system was often poorly managed--the Government Accountability \nOffice issued a harshly critical report finding that Wage and Hour \n``frequently responded inadequately'' to those complaints that it did \nreceive.\n  The current administration has corrected these problems and beefed up \nenforcement, revitalizing this essential agency. It has improved the \ncomplaint process and encouraged ``strategic enforcement'' that is \ngeared to efficiently using limited resources to maximize compliance \nwith the law.\n  With this new vision, the division has made great strides. Over the \npast 5 years, the Wage and Hour Division has returned more than $1.1 \nbillion in stolen wages to workers whose rights were violated. They \nhave done the best job ever of targeting their investigations to the \nworkplaces that have the most violations, even when the workers felt \ntoo threatened or too disempowered to complain. The Division also \nsuccessfully completed vital regulations to expand minimum wage and \novertime protections to nearly 2 million home health aides. As a result \nof the division's efforts, these hardworking people will soon get the \nmost basic of worker protections, and our country will benefit from a \nmore stable and reliable workforce to assist people with disabilities \nand our elderly loved ones live full and independent lives.\n  There are certainly more challenges ahead for Wage and Hour. In \naddition to implementing the new minimum wage rules for home care \nworkers in a careful and thoughtful manner, the division will be tasked \nwith developing an important new Obama administration initiative to \nupdate our outdated overtime rules. I am a strong supporter of this \neffort. Too many Americans are working longer and harder without \nanything to show for their efforts in their paycheck. Often low-wage \nand modestly paid workers can be forced to work long hours without \novertime compensation because the threshold for determining which \nworkers are automatically eligible for overtime pay is set too low. It \nis long past time to update these rules, to prevent abuses of low-wage \nworkers and ensure fair compensation for those who work long hours.\n  The Wage and Hour Division will also be tasked with implementing any \nminimum wage legislation passed here in Congress. While we will, of \ncourse, set the contours of the law here in Congress, the Wage and Hour \nDivision will be tasked with ensuring that employees and employers are \neducated about the new law and that employers are complying with its \nrequirements.\n  In facing these critical challenges, I can think of no one better to \nlead the Wage and Hour Division into the future than Dr. David Weil. \nDr. Weil is one of the Nation's leading experts on enforcement of wage \nand hour, safety and health, and other workplace regulations. He has \nspent the last 20 years teaching at Boston University's School of \nManagement, where he has done extensive empirical research on the \nprevalence of wage and hour violations and the effectiveness of \ndifferent enforcement strategies. Because of his expertise, he has been \ncalled on to work extensively with Labor Department officials for many \nyears to help them improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Wage \nand Hour Division. He has served as a consultant to the Department of \nLabor under both Democratic and Republican administrations, and has \nalso advised both Democratic and Republican officials at the State \nlevel. His expertise on these issues is indisputable.\n  Dr. Weil also approaches these issues from a unique perspective. He \nhas spent two decades as a professor of management at a business \nschool, teaching a course on strategic decision-making for businesses. \nThis insight into businesses' decision-making process will be \ninvaluable to working at the Wage and Hour Division--both to understand \nbusinesses better and to work with them more effectively. Dr. Weil also \nhas extensive experience in collaborating with a variety of groups, \noften playing a role of mediator and advisor--skills that will help him \nwork effectively with both worker advocates and the business community \nto advance the mission of the Wage and Hour Division.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have taken issue \nwith Dr. Weil's scholarship promoting strategic enforcement. I will \nconfess that I find these criticisms hard to understand. The basic idea \nthat Dr. Weil has articulated is that we have limited enforcement \nresources, and that we should target those resources--to the best of \nour ability--to industries where there is an objectively verifiable \npattern of noncompliance and where workers are particularly vulnerable \nto abuse.\n  This is a commonsense approach, especially in times of tight budgets. \nWe need to be trying to get the best bang for our enforcement buck, and \nDr. Weil has some great ideas for how to do that. I would think all the \nfiscal conservatives in this Chamber would be applauding his \nsuggestions to build a more efficient and effective Wage and Hour \nDivision. This sort of innovative thinking and strategic and efficient \nplanning will be a tremendous asset to the agency.\n  Indeed, a group of Dr. Weil's peers, respected academics at a variety \nof universities, strongly agree with this conclusion. They note: David \nis one of if not the nation's leading expert on enforcement of safety \nand health, wage and hour, and other workplace regulations. He has done \nextensive research\n\n[[Page S2418]]\n\non the effectiveness of different enforcement strategies and has worked \nintensively with Labor Department officials for many years to improve \nthe efficiency and effectiveness of the policies he will be entrusted \nto administer. The letter also notes his ``long history of public \nservice,'' including his work with current and former agency leadership \non both the Democratic and Republican sides. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave the text of this letter printed in the Record.\n  As this letter confirms, while Dr. Weil has never worked directly for \nthe division, he is intimately familiar with its mission and \noperations. He knows the Department, he knows the laws, and he can hit \nthe ground running to move this important agency forward.\n  It is clear that Dr. Weil is an exemplary candidate to administer the \nWage and Hour Division. It is unfortunate that the Wage and Hour \nDivision has been without a Senate-confirmed leader for many years now, \nand I am glad that we will soon be able to change that. I thank Dr. \nWeil for his willingness to go through this process, and for his \ncommitment to public service. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to support this nomination and allow it to move forward quickly \nso that Dr. Weil can get to work doing the important business of the \nWage and Hour Division.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                 October 29, 2013.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Chairman.\n     Hon. Lamar Alexander,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Health, Education, \n         Labor and Pensions, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Alexander: We are \n     all academics who study different aspects of employment \n     relations and public policy. Each of us has worked in and/or \n     advised the Department of Labor and other federal and state \n     government agencies in both Democratic and Republican \n     administrations. While we do not all share the same views on \n     employment policy issues, we share a tremendous respect for \n     David Weil and believe he would be an excellent Administrator \n     of the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor.\n       David is one of if not the nation's leading expert on \n     enforcement of safety and health, wage and hour, and other \n     workplace regulations. He has done extensive research on the \n     effectiveness of different enforcement strategies and has \n     worked intensively with Labor Department officials for many \n     years to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the \n     policies he will be entrusted to administer.\n       He brings a long history of public service to this \n     position. Among other things he worked closely with the late \n     John Dunlop, Secretary of Labor in the Ford Administration, \n     on a major study of work practices and productivity in the \n     apparel and textile industries. He currently serves as Co-\n     Director of the Transparency Policy Project at Harvard \n     University's Kennedy School of Government. He is recognized \n     by his colleagues at Boston University as an extremely \n     competent, fair, and thorough administrator.\n       For the past eight years he has served as the neutral Chair \n     of the Dunlop Agricultural Labor Commission, a position that \n     requires gaining and maintaining respect and trust from \n     diverse groups of employers, contractors, employees, \n     immigrants, and unions.\n       For all these reasons, we are pleased to endorse the \n     President's nomination of David Weil to be the Administrator \n     of the Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division. Please \n     feel free to contact any of us if we can be of further help \n     to your Committee.\n           Sincerely,\n       Richard Freeman, Professor, Department of Economics, \n     Harvard University;\n       Harry Katz, Dean, School of Industrial and Labor Relations, \n     Cornell University;\n       Lawrence Katz, Professor, Department of Economics, Harvard \n     University;\n       Thomas Kochan, Professor, MIT Sloan School of Management;\n       David Levine, Professor, Haas School of Business, \n     University of California-Berkeley;\n       Lisa Lynch, Dean, Heller School for Social Policy and \n     Management, Brandeis University;\n       Robert McKersie, Professor Emeritus, MIT Sloan School of \n     Management;\n       Paul Osterman, Professor MIT Sloan School of Management;\n       James Rebitzer, Chair, Dept. of Economics, Law & Policy, \n     School of Management, Boston University.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/28/senate-section/article/S2418-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NOMINATION OF DAVID WEIL TO BE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE WAGE AND HOUR \n                 DIVISION, DEPARTMENT OF LABOR--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume legislative session.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss partly the state of our \neconomy but more precisely the state of our workers. Working Americans \nare in some sense being attacked from both ends. We have seen an \norchestrated attempt to cut safety net programs where a low-income \nworker making $9, $10, or $11 an hour might be eligible in some cases \nfor SNAP or is surely eligible for the earned income tax credit.\n  Opponents strongly say that programs such as SNAP foster a culture of \ndependency and do not reward work. Those same elected officials--some \nof whom, I might add, have voted to raise their own pay--oppose efforts \nto ensure that hard work is reworded with fair pay. Last fall one House \nRepublican said: If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat.\n  I am all for quoting Scripture. I do not think it should be used to \nvilify hard-working people. Detractors of SNAP, opponents of the \nminimum wage, cannot have it both ways. By raising the minimum wage, it \nmeans, frankly, fewer people will be eligible for SNAP, because if \ntheir wages are higher, they cannot and should not be eligible for \ncertain benefits. So we create opportunities for Americans to earn a \nliving wage and no longer need those benefits.\n  One hundred years ago in January, Henry Ford, in 1914, announced that \nhe was going to pay his workers $5 a day. Nobody thought, when they \nlooked at Henry Ford and his life, nobody thought he was doing it out \nof the kindness of his heart. But that did not matter; he decided to \npay everybody in his plant $5 a day because he understood that paying \nthem more would mean a more prosperous workforce who could then, \npresto, have the money in their pocket to begin to buy a car, to buy a \nModel T or to buy one of Henry Ford's cars.\n  We should be taking a page from Ford's playbook. Productivity has \nincreased 85 percent in this country since 1979. It used to be as \nproductivity went up, wages went up. Since World War II, between 1945 \nand 1973, productivity went like this: Wages pretty much paralleled the \nincrease. In other words, workers who were producing more for their \nboss would get part of the wealth, would share in the wealth they were \nhelping to create for their company, for their boss.\n  So while productivity has increased 85 percent in the last 35 years, \ninflation-adjusted wages increased 6 percent, and the value of the \nminimum wage fell 21 percent. Think about that. Productivity went up 85 \npercent. Profits went up significantly. Wages went up only 6 percent. \nThe value of the minimum wage fell 21 percent. The value of the minimum \nwage, since 1968, is actually one-third less today--the minimum wage \ntoday is worth one-third less in buying power of the minimum wage in \n1968.\n  Simply put, workers, while they are earning more for their bosses, \nthey are making their companies more profitable, workers are not seeing \nthe wealth they helped to create. Fundamentally, the contract--not \nliterally a legal contract but the contract we once had in this country \nwas, if you work hard, if you take responsibility, if you are \nproductive, if you do things according to sort of society's mores, you \nwould benefit. You would benefit in higher wages. You would benefit in \na higher standard of living.\n  In the aftermath of the recession, the job growth, the increase in \njobs, has been in the low-wage job sectors. Men and women who lost \ngood-paying middle-class jobs, generally through no fault of their own, \nare returning to work at low-wage jobs, jobs that make it difficult to \nsupport a family.\n  Enrollment for programs such as SNAP has grown. I hear some of my \nsort of tea party colleagues complain that more and more people are \ngetting SNAP. They are, because wages are not going up, because the \nminimum wage has less buying power than it used to. So many workers \nthat were union, middle-class workers now are making lower wages 45 \nmillion people. So, yes, the number of people who are receiving SNAP \nbenefits, food stamps has gone up.\n  In 2011, 45 million people relied on those benefits. SNAP spending \nincreased, but that is a reason to pass the minimum wage. Increase \ntheir wages and fewer people will need that. Too many people who work \nharder than ever are barely getting by despite their best efforts. That \nis why millions of fast-food workers in cities across the country took \nto the streets in December for a National Day of Action, asking for and \ndemanding an increase in the minimum wage.\n  More than half of frontline fast-food workers, more than half of \nthose who work more than 40 hours per week, earn so little that they \nare forced to enroll their family in public assistance. Think of all \nthe companies, all the companies where workers are making such low \nwages and they are getting food stamps.\n  So I come to the floor to talk about the minimum wage and to \nspecifically discuss support for the Fair Minimum Wage Act. Majority \nLeader Reid has been supportive of this measure, as have most of my \ncolleagues in this Chamber. We have not yet been able to corral 60 \nvotes, which is what we need to break a filibuster, from those who I \nthink are far out of step with the country, with their constituents, \nwho oppose the minimum wage.\n\n  The Fair Minimum Wage Act would raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an \nhour in three 95-cent increments. In other words, it is $7.25 now. Upon \nthe President's signature, it would be $8.20. One year later it would \nbe $9.15. Then one year later it would be $10.10 an hour. The bill \nalso--this is important to note because it is rarely talked about. The \nbill also raises the Federal minimum wage for tipped workers from the \ncurrent $2.13 an hour to 70 percent of the regular minimum wage. If you \nwork in a restaurant, if you are a server, if you push a wheelchair at \nan airport, if you are a valet, if you are working in a hotel where you \nget tips, in most cases those employers are only required to pay the \nsubminimum wage, assuming that you are going to get up to the minimum \nwage with tips.\n  It does not always happen that way. It is a Federal law that it \nshould, but it does not always happen that way. As Senator Durbin and I \nwere talking earlier, it is not so easy to enforce that. So if you are \nin a diner and you are talking to your server, the chances are that \nyour server is making significantly less than the minimum wage, maybe \nhigher than $2.13--that is the law--but maybe no more than $3 or $4 an \nhour.\n  If you are in an airport and you see someone pushing an older person \nin a wheelchair, usually down the concourse, or someone who is disabled \nfor whatever reason, they are only making $3, $4 or $5 an hour.\n  The tipped minimum wage, $2.13, has not been raised since 1991. So \nevery time we have raised the minimum wage--we did it bipartisanly; \nPresident Bush signed it in 2007. We did one a few years before that--I \nwas in the House then--bipartisanly. The Presiding Officer from Indiana \nsupported these minimum wage increases. But every time we have raised \nthe minimum wage since 1991, the $2.13 subminimum wage, the tipped \nwage, has been stuck. It has never been raised. This will raise the \ntipped wage.\n  Let me share a couple of letters. I got a letter from Tom in Cuyahoga \nCounty, the county I live in, in Northeast Ohio:\n\n       Senator Brown, I'm a 50 year old food service worker with a \n     college degree, and I make $7.40 an hour. I just closed my \n     retirement account that had $2,500 in it to pay my bills--\n\n[[Page S2420]]\n\n     and it's still not enough to cover everything. Now with that \n     money gone, I should be able to qualify for food stamps. I \n     only have the most basic bills, and I don't have any credit \n     card debt or loans. How much longer do we have to wait for a \n     livable wage?\n\n  The people whom I have met who are working minimum wage or close to \nminimum wage, $8-, $9-, $10-an-hour jobs, are people who often hold two \njobs. They are working hard. They have so little to show for it. For \nsomebody who is willing to work as most people in this country do, they \nshould have a livable wage.\n  We know there are many more stories such as Tom's that all of us will \nhear if we go out in our States and listen. Pope Francis I exhorted his \nparish priests to go out and ``smell like the flock.'' The illusion of \nthe Old and New Testaments and sheep and shepherds was obviously what \nhe was referring to, but he was also referring to the fact of how \nimportant it is for people in his church, in the Roman Catholic Church, \nthe priests, the people who minister to people, should understand how \npeople live.\n  It is an important admonition for politicians too. I think more of my \ncolleagues should get out of Washington and ``smell like the flock'' as \nPope Francis said, meet people trying to make a go of it on a minimum \nwage, put food on their table to support their families, to put a \nlittle aside maybe for retirement someday; all of those are so \nimportant.\n  When we are seeing people working harder and harder, and, frankly, \ngetting paid less and less money for it because of the decline of the \nbuying power of the minimum wage, we know it is time for change.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the Fair Minimum Wage Act. It will \npull millions of people out of poverty. It will help our economy \nbecause it will put money in people's pockets that they will \nimmediately spend, generating other economic activity and creating \njobs.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/28/senate-section/article/S2420-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BROWN.

The Holocaust was the \nsystematic genocide of 6 million Jews and countless others, carried out \nby Adolf Hitler and his minions.\n  Today is Holocaust Remembrance Day. It is a reminder that we must \ncontinue to fight against genocide, racism, hatred, and violence. Yet \nwith Holocaust Remembrance Day also comes the hope provided us by the \nsurvivors.\n  I think of my friend the late Tom Lantos, a Congressman from \nCalifornia. Tom was a Hungarian Jew and a survivor of the Holocaust--\nand a survivor he was. I had the good fortune of traveling to Hungary \nand meeting with him there, and he showed us a number of places where \nhe escaped from the Nazis. It was a remarkable story, and he was a \nremarkable man.\n  He once said: ``I like to work hard to make this a better country, to \nprovide a just government for our people and make sure we have learned \nfrom the past.'' Tom Lantos' statement should apply to all of us.\n  Today we remember those who were lost, honor those who survived, and \nshare our grief with the families who suffered the tragedy of Nazi \nGermany during the Holocaust.\n  Let us remember the words of Congressman Lantos who, in spite of all \nhe suffered, had great hope and faith that we would work to stop \ngenocide in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/28/senate-section/article/S2420-3", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IATSE LOCAL 720 75TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. REID.

He and his wife \nMaria Nagy, reside in San Diego, CA, with their children Jack, 15, and \nCarly, 13,\n  I ask unanimous consent that his biography be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Captain Marko Medved, P.E., Civil Engineer Corps, United States Navy\n\n\n   Officer in Charge of Construction Marine Corps Installations West\n\n       CAPT Medved's first duty assignment was onboard USS \n     Leftwich (DD 984), home ported in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii where \n     he served as the Damage Control Officer, Missile Officer and \n     Fire Control Officer. He deployed with Leftwich to serve in \n     Desert Storm and Desert Shield in 1989-1990 and returned \n     again to the Persian Gulf in 1992-1993.\n       CAPT Medved transferred to the Civil Engineer Corps (CEC) \n     in the summer of 1993. He reported to his first CEC \n     assignment at Resident Officer-in-Charge of Construction, \n     Puerto Rico Area, in January 1994. Here he managed \n     construction contracts in the U.S. Virgin Islands and at \n     Naval Station Roosevelt Roads. CAPT Medved was then \n     reassigned to the Public Works Department (PWD) where he \n     directed the Technical Management Division, then Customer \n     Service for the Base Operating Support Contract. In October \n     of 1997, CAPT Medved joined the ``Professionals'' of Naval \n     Mobile Construction Battalion Five, leading a Detachment for \n     Training to assist in disaster recovery in Sao Miguel, \n     Azores, Portugal. He later deployed to Okinawa as Charlie \n     Company Commander and Air Detachment Commander. Upon \n     completion of graduate school in August 2000, he reported to \n     the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Fleet Readiness and \n     Logistics) staff to serve as Action Officer for Range \n     Planning and Base Realignment and Closure. During the 107th \n     Congress, CAPT Medved served as a Legislative Fellow for \n     Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi, working on Defense \n     Appropriations. He then served as the Public Works Officer at \n     Naval District Washington, Indian Head, Maryland--the Center \n     for Naval Energetics, until June 2005. Shifting coasts, CAPT \n     Medved lead the Coastal Integrated Process Team at NAVFAC \n     Southwest, supporting bases in San Diego, Ventura County and \n     Monterey. In his next assignment as the Assistant Regional \n     Engineer for Navy Region Southwest, he led the facilities \n     programs for naval bases and reserve centers across six \n     states. Deploying as an Individual Augment, he served as the \n     Public Works Officer for Al Asad Air Base, Iraq, where he \n     supported Marine and Army Division Commanders in Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom.\n       CAPT Medved graduated with distinction from Annapolis with \n     a Bachelor of Science degree in Ocean Engineering in May \n     1989. He later attended postgraduate school at the \n     Massachusetts Institute of Technology, earning a Master of \n     Science degree in Construction Engineering and Management in \n     August 2000. In the summer of 2011, he completed the Advanced \n     Management Program at the Duke Fuqua School of Business. He \n     holds qualifications in Seabee Combat Warfare and Surface \n     Warfare, is a member of the Acquisition Professional \n     Community, and is a registered Professional Engineer in \n     Virginia. CAPT Medved's awards include the Legion of Merit, \n     Meritorious Service Medal (three awards), Navy Commendation \n     Medal (three awards), Navy Achievement Medal (three awards), \n     and the Combat Action Ribbon.\n\n[[Page S2421]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/28/senate-section/article/S2421-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 99th \nanniversary of the Armenian Genocide--a tragedy that has left a dark \nstain on the collective conscience of the world.\n  Between 1915 and 1923, more than 1.5 million Armenians were marched \nto their deaths in the deserts of the Middle East, murdered in \nconcentration camps, drowned at sea, and forced to endure unimaginable \nacts of brutality at the hands of the Ottoman Empire.\n  The Armenian Genocide--along with the Holocaust is one of the most \nstudied cases of genocide in history. Countless experts have documented \nthe atrocities that occurred, compiling an overwhelming body of \nhistorical evidence on the Armenian Genocide.\n  However, successive U.S. administrations have refused to call the \ndeliberate massacre of the Armenians by its rightful name, continuing \nonly to refer to it as an annihilation, massacre, or murder.\n  It has been nearly a century since the Armenian Genocide began and \neach day that goes by without full acknowledgement by the United States \nprolongs the pain felt by the descendants of the victims, as well as \nthe entire Armenian community.\n  For years, I have been urging both Democratic and Republican \nadministrations to finally acknowledge the Armenian Genocide for what \nit was--genocide. I do so again today.\n  The United States has often led the international community in \nspeaking out against violence and suffering wherever it occurs. But \ntragically, our Nation is on the wrong side of history when it comes to \nthe Armenian Genocide. I hope that this year we right this terrible \nwrong once and for all.\n  It is time for the United States to join the list of countries from \nArgentina to France as well as 43 U.S. States that have unequivocally \naffirmed the Armenian Genocide.\n  Genocide is only possible when people avert their eyes. Any effort to \ndeal with genocide--whether past, present or future--must begin with \nthe truth.\n  So this April 24, as we pause to remember the victims of the Armenian \nGenocide and to celebrate the many contributions Armenian Americans \nhave made to our great nation, I hope that the United States will \nfinally and firmly stand on the right side of history and call the \ntragedy of 1915-1923 by its rightful name.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/28/senate-section/article/S2421-2", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO H. SAWIN MILLETT\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, on May 30, H. Sawin Millett will step \ndown as commissioner of the Maine Department of Administrative and \nFinancial Services, one of many positions he has held during a \nremarkable career of more than 55 years of dedicated service at all \nlevels of government. I rise today to join the people of Maine in \nthanking him for his many contributions as he retires to his family, \nhis farm, and his beloved hometown of Waterford, ME.\n  Sawin has served five Maine Governors--Republican, Democratic, and \nIndependent--and in the cabinets of four. His energy, expertise, and \ncommitment to responsible and accountable government have been applied \nto such diverse areas as education, finance, and mental health \nservices.\n  Sawin served six terms in the Maine legislature and was lead House \nRepublican on the Appropriations Committee during the last three. His \ninstitutional knowledge and keen understanding of the State budget \nprocess and fiscal operations has been invaluable to our State. \nBuilding on his early career as a teacher, coach, and principal, he was \nthe first executive director of the Maine School Management Association \nand an assistant professor at the University of Southern Maine.\n  It is fitting that Sawin's life in public service began at the local \nlevel, serving as selectmen in the towns of Dixmont and Waterford, and \nas a town meeting moderator.\n  The appreciation of Sawin's service crosses party lines. When the \nannouncement of his retirement was made, both sides of the aisle were \nunited in praise for this generous mentor and effective leader who has \nalways been devoted to the people of Maine.\n  I have had the privilege of knowing Sawin for many years. We served \ntogether in the cabinet of Gov. John McKernan, and I was fortunate to \nhave him on my State staff during my first term in the Senate. I also \nhave had the pleasure of knowing his wonderful wife Barbara, who has \nbeen a strong and loving partner for more than 57 years. On behalf of \nthe people of Maine, I wish them health and happiness in the years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/28/senate-section/article/S2421-3", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      LET FREEDOM RACE CELEBRATION\n\n  Mr. BURR.

This Memorial Day Weekend, the 55th \nLet Freedom Race Celebration at CMS will bring together more than \n100,000 military guests to celebrate our military heroes and honor \ntheir service. This Memorial Day tradition will, once again, showcase \nour military strength by demonstrating patriotic unity and pride for \nthose who served in our Armed Forces to protect us.\n  Over the 55 years of the Memorial Day weekend celebration at \nCharlotte Motor Speedway, millions of race fans have joined together to \ncelebrate America's military heroes and honor their service. \nGenerations of men and women have worn their Nation's uniform with \npride and put their lives on the line to protect and preserve our most \nprecious commodity: freedom. Many of them paid the ultimate price and \nshould always be remembered for their sacrifice.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor Columbus State \nCommunity College in recognition of its 50th anniversary and the \nopportunities it has provided to students throughout Ohio. On September \n30, 1963, Columbus State was founded in the basement of Central High \nSchool in Columbus, OH. Since its inception, Columbus State has grown \ntremendously by expanding its enrollment and academic offerings from an \ninitial 67 students to more than 25,000 students. The diverse student \nbody has come from more than 130 countries and all of Ohio's 88 \ncounties.\n  The mission of Columbus State is ``to educate and inspire, providing \n[its] students with the opportunity to achieve their goals.'' This \nmission is vital to the Columbus community. Throughout its 50 years, \nColumbus State has provided exemplary educational opportunities through \nmore than 200-plus degree and certificate programs. It has awarded \nnearly 50,000 degrees and has a nearly $1 billion annual impact on the \nlocal economy. The school also provides several transfer options and \ncontinuing education opportunities to students.\n  I have visited Columbus State and seen firsthand the excellent \neducation and training it provides to students, including the resources \navailable through the Center for Workforce Development. The center \ncollaborates with companies in the Columbus region to address workforce \nneeds through innovative approaches to education and customized \ntraining. It is helping to ensure that students are prepared with the \nskills they need for the jobs of the 21st century.\n  I am pleased to honor Columbus State Community College and \ncongratulate everyone who was a part of making its first 50 years a \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/28/senate-section/article/S2421-5", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/28/senate-section/article/S2421-6", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2421-S2422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO IVOON PADILLA-RODRIIGUEZ\n\n Mr. HELLER.
