Mr. President, today, with the inspiration of the second \ninauguration of President Obama fresh in our minds, we renew our \nefforts to fulfill the promise of prosperity for every American.\n  The theme of yesterday's inauguration was ``Faith in America's \nFuture.'' Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., whose birth and life we also \ncelebrated Monday, once said, ``Faith is taking the first step even \nwhen you don't see the whole staircase.'' I have faith that the Members \nof the 113th Congress will bring this Nation closer to realizing the \npromise of prosperity. The last Congress was too often characterized by \nsharp political divides--divides that hampered efforts to foster \nsuccess for all Americans. I am hopeful and cautiously optimistic that \nthe 113th Congress will be characterized not by our divisions but by \nour renewed commitment to cooperation and compromise. I urge every \nwoman and every man fortunate enough to serve in this Chamber to \nremember that it is possible to hold fast to our principles while \nmaking the compromises necessary to move our country forward.\n  Democrats will hold fast to the guiding principle that a strong \nmiddle class--and an opportunity for every American to enter that \nmiddle class--is the key to this Nation's success. Democrats will stand \nstrong--strong for the standard of balance. We will remain resolute--\nresolute in the pursuit of fairness for all Americans, regardless of \nwhere they were born or the color of their skin, regardless of the size \nof their bank accounts, regardless of their religion or sexual \norientation.\n  Those principles will direct our course as we introduce our first 10 \nbills today--a tradition we have had in the Senate, which is that the \nmajority party introduces the first 10 bills--as we mend our broken \nimmigration system, strengthen our schools, and rebuild our roads and \nbridges, and we will look to those principles as we bring forth other \nmeasures included in those 10 bills. Those principles will be foremost \nin our minds as we balance the right to bear arms with the right for \nevery child to grow up safe from gun violence. Those principles will be \nour North Star as we work to end wasteful tax loopholes and balance \nthoughtful spending reductions with revenue from the wealthiest among \nus. And those principles will point the way as we work to ensure that \nthis country's uniformed servicemembers never struggle to find \nemployment when their military duties end. Through every struggle and \nevery triumph, those principles must be our guide.\n  Not a single piece of important legislation can pass the Senate or \nbecome law without the votes of both Democrats and Republicans, so we \nwill be willing to compromise and work with our colleagues across the \naisle. Unfortunately, a number of bipartisan bills passed the Senate \nduring the last Congress that were never acted upon by the House of \nRepresentatives. So this year the Senate will revisit some of those \nlegislative priorities that passed on a bipartisan basis here.\n  We will again take up the Violence Against Women Act. This is an \nimportant piece of legislation that is expiring. We will take up the \nfarm bill, which is a revolutionary piece of legislation that would \nsave the country up\n\n[[Page S26]]\n\nto $24 billion. We will again revisit historical reforms to save the \nU.S. Postal Service, and we will take up legislation to make whole \nvictims of Hurricane Sandy. Each of these initiatives passed the Senate \non a bipartisan basis after deliberation and debate during the last \nCongress but was left to languish by the House.\n  The Senate will continue to help our fellow Americans recover from \nHurricane Sandy before another similar disaster strikes. Hundreds of \nthousands of homes and businesses were destroyed in New York, New \nJersey, and New England, and tens of thousands of Americans were left \nhomeless by this destructive storm. We have a responsibility to aid our \ncountrymen as they rebuild their lives and their communities, as we \nhave after terrible floods, fires, and storms in other parts of our \nNation.\n  Once we complete that vital legislation, the Senate will take action \nto make this institution we all love--the U.S. Senate--work more \neffectively. We will consider changes to the Senate rules. Because this \nmatter warrants additional debate, today we will follow the precedents \nset in 2005 and again in 2011. We will reserve the right of all \nSenators to propose changes to the Senate rules, and we will explicitly \nnot acquiesce in the carrying over of all the rules from the last \nCongress. It is my intention that the Senate will recess today rather \nthan adjourn to continue the same legislative day and allow this \nimportant rules discussion to continue later this month. I am hopeful \nand cautiously optimistic that the Republican leader and I will reach \nan agreement that allows the Senate to operate more effectively in the \ncoming months.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/22/senate-section/article/S26-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S26]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz).

Mr. President, I wish to start by congratulating \nPresident Obama on his inauguration. Presidential inaugurations are \nalways a time for the country to come together. We all feel a certain \npride in the event, and we are reminded of how fortunate we are to live \nin a Nation where we have the ability to choose our leaders freely and \nresolve our differences in peace. Inauguration Day is also a time for \nnew beginnings, a chance to learn from the mistakes and missed \nopportunities of the past as we reengage in some vitally important \ndebates about our future.\n  Too often over the past 4 years, political considerations have \ntrumped the need to put our country on a sound financial footing and a \npath to prosperity. Today we should recommit ourselves to the task of \nfacing up to our problems head-on. I understand that the passions of an \nelection can sometimes overshadow the business of governing, but the \nPresidential campaign is now behind us, and so it is my hope that the \nPresident will finally be willing to do what Republicans have been \nasking him to do since his first inauguration 4 years ago, and that is \nto work with us on identifying durable solutions to the problems we can \nonly solve together, to put aside those things we know we can't agree \non and focus on what we can.\n  We should start with spending and debt because if we don't get a \nhandle on that, nothing else matters. If we don't work together to \nstrengthen our entitlement programs, they will go bankrupt. Automatic \ncuts will be forced on seniors already receiving benefits, rendering \nworthless the promises they have built their retirements around. It is \nnice to say, as the President did yesterday, that these programs free \nus to take the risks that make our country great, but if we don't act \nto strengthen and protect them now, in a few years they simply won't be \nthere in their current form. And if we don't work together to control \nthe debt, then the cost of our interest payments alone will eventually \ncrowd out funding for things we all agree on--from defense, to \ninfrastructure, and assistance for those who need it most. In short, \nthe debate we are now engaged in over the growing Federal debt is about \nmuch more than numbers on a page; it is about the cost of inaction in \nterms of promises broken, jobs lost, and dreams deferred. That is why \nthere is simply no more time to waste.\n  Over the past 4 years, while the President focused on reelection and \ntoo many Senate Democrats focused on avoiding tough decisions, the debt \ngrew by more than $6 trillion. We saw the President blast House \nRepublicans for doing their job and passing a budget while Senate \nDemocrats didn't even propose one. Rather than work with us to save \nexisting entitlements, we saw the President team up with Democrats in \nCongress to force through a brandnew entitlement that will make it even \nharder to cover the cost of programs we already have. In short, \nDemocrats have put off the hard stuff until now, and our problems have \nonly gotten worse.\n  But that was the first term. A second term presents the opportunity \nto do things differently, and in the Senate that means a return to \nregular order. Later this week the House plans to send the Senate a \nbill to address the debt limit in a timely manner. Once we get it, the \nSenate should quickly respond. If the Senate version is different from \nthe one the House sends over, send it to conference. That is how things \nare supposed to work around here. We used to call it legislating.\n  I know a lot of Democrats are afraid of a process that exposes their \npriorities, particularly on spending and debt. After nearly 4 years of \nrefusing to pass a budget, they have only now reluctantly agreed to \ndevelop a spending plan for the coming fiscal year. All I would say to \nthat is since the revenue question has been settled, I am sure the \nAmerican people are eager to see what other ideas Democrats might have \nto bring down our ruinous deficits.\n  Let me just say that one thing Americans will no longer tolerate is \nan attitude that says we can put off our work until the very last \nminute. They are tired of eleventh-hour deals. They are tired of \ncareening from crisis to crisis, and so am I.\n  The good news is that a return to regular order is the surest way to \nsolve the problems we face. And I hope some of my friends on the other \nside will agree that there is value in this body actually functioning \nthe way it was intended to. Let's face it. The status quo isn't \nworking. The Senate isn't functioning as it should. It has nothing to \ndo with the process that has served us well for a very long time. But \nif we work together and strive to avoid some of the bad habits that \nhave developed around here, I truly believe we will be able to achieve \nthe kinds of solutions that have eluded us for the past 4 years and \ndeliver some positive results for the people who sent us here, with \ntime to spare.\n  We can do better. I know my constituents expect better than what they \nhave been getting from Congress in recent years, and so should we.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/22/senate-section/article/S26-3", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S26]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the minority \nleader, and I think he essentially gets to the point all of us, in this \nfirst week for the 113th Congress, need to be focused on and need to \naddress. This is our first workweek back after the inauguration \nfestivities of yesterday, and I think it is an appropriate time for the \nMembers of this body to discuss the challenges that lay before us over \nthe next 2 years.\n  The most critical and, in my opinion, the most pressing of these \nchallenges is one we have been dealing with for the past 2 years and is \nnow of even more critical importance, and that is the out-of-control \ngovernment spending that weakens the health of our economy, threatens \nthe security of our country, and jeopardizes opportunities for future \ngenerations.\n  When I arrived here 2 years ago, it was clear the American people \nwere\n\n[[Page S27]]\n\nconcerned about out-of-control Federal spending. At the beginning of \nthe President's term 4 years ago, the debt limit stood at $10.626 \ntrillion plus. In the 4 years of that term, it has risen to over \n$16.400 trillion--nearly a $6 trillion increase.\n  It is unprecedented in the history of our country to have such out-\nof-control spending. It has resulted in our borrowing a very \nsubstantial amount of each year's budget, which is not healthy whether \nyou are a family or you are a business or you are a State government or \nyou are the Federal Government. The chickens will come home to roost if \nwe continue to do that.\n  Each American's share of our national debt now is well over $50,000. \nThat means every new baby born in this country instantly owes the \ngovernment more than $50,000.\n  We have had 4 straight years of trillion-dollar deficits without a \nbudget in this body. The minority leader just talked about that. \nHopefully, we will finally have a budget to work off of and a budget \nfor which we can look at what the priorities are and make tough \ndecisions about how we spend taxpayers' money.\n  We currently spend over $40,000 a second. These are not partisan \nnumbers, and this should not be a partisan issue. These are the facts. \nAs our former Governor in Indiana, Mitch Daniels, said: Just do the \narithmetic. This is not a deep philosophical or ideological issue. It \nis a matter of basic math.\n  With financial problems as great as these, it is my hope as we return \nnow to this 113th Congress we will be able to address this fiscal \ncrisis. It is the same hope I had 2 years ago when I joined the 112th \nCongress. As we know, we went through a series of efforts to begin to \naddress this problem. Many of those were on a bipartisan basis--we had \nthe Gang of 6 and then we had the supercommittee of 12. These were \nbipartisan efforts. Many of us worked with our colleagues across the \naisle to try to put a grand bargain together. Of course, the President \nhad his own commission led by Mr. Bowles and former Senator Simpson. He \nrejected that. The Simpson Bowles proposal would have been a good \nblueprint upon which to begin our discussions. I will be talking some \nmore about that and the disappointment--the extreme disappointment--of \nMr. Bowles and Mr. Simpson in terms of the inability of this body to \naddress what has been predicted as the most predictable financial \ncrisis in our Nation's history.\n  We went through this whole process of the fiscal cliff. We, \nunfortunately, had to pick the lesser of two evils in order to protect \nnearly 99 percent of taxpayers from drastic tax increases, starting \nwith the lowest to the highest taxpayer. The fiscal cliff deal may have \nallowed the President to fulfill his campaign promise to raise taxes on \nmillionaires and billionaires, but it did little or nothing to address \nexcessive Federal spending.\n  So the debate now shifts. The President got his taxes. With revenue \noff the table, the debate shifts to where it needs to be and should \nhave been in the first place; that is, addressing spending reductions.\n  Just last week Fitch Ratings warned that America's AAA credit rating \nis at risk if the Congress and the President increase the debt limit \nbut fail to enact a ``credible medium-term deficit reduction plan.'' We \ncan expect to see more headlines like this if we do not come together \nand take action to deal with our country's debt obligations.\n  In the coming days and weeks I will be speaking in this Chamber and \noutlining what I believe are rational steps we need to take to get our \nfiscal house in order. The easy thing to do, and the way Congress has \noperated over these past 2 years, is to look at our fiscal situation \nand say: Well, we have more time; or we can deal with this after the \nnext election. While I thought that was exactly the wrong tactic to \ntake, that is what happened. There were a series of efforts, but each \none ended up so-called kicking the can down the road or postponing the \nday of decision.\n  This is the day of decision. This is the hour of decision. This is \nthe time when we have to step up now and address our out-of-control \nspending. We have had that next election. The President has been \nreelected for 4 years. Members have been reelected. We have this \nchallenge now in front of us. Continuing with the status quo, governing \nby a crisis, and failing to address our spending problem must be \nunacceptable.\n  Mr. President, 2013 is the year. In 2014 we are back in another \nelection. We all know the precious 6 to 9 to 12 months that lay before \nus is the time--postelection, with the President's reelection and new \nMembers here--this is the time we have to step up and address our debt \nand deficit problem.\n  If we do not do so now, most experts who look at this, whether they \nare liberal or conservative, nonpartisan or partisan, ideological or \nnonideological, have virtually all come to the conclusion that unless \nwe address this now in 2013, with an election year in 2014, 2015 will \nbe too late.\n  We have seen what is happening in Europe. We see what is happening in \nJapan. We see what is happening around the world--a world hungry for \nAmerica to lead, to address its problem, not by pushing it down the \nroad, not through avoiding tough decisions, but addressing the real \nissue before us that impacts the future of this country and the future \nof generations to come.\n  So now is the time, now is the hour of decision that we have to take \nto go forward and address this problem. As I said, I will be using this \nplatform and others as a way to address what I believe we need to go \nforward with, not only looking at the larger picture but also looking \nat how this government spends way beyond its means, spends money that \nit does not have, wastes money through bureaucracy and waste and failed \nefforts, tries to do more than it should or could or is able, and I \nwant to document some of those--everything from the macro to the micro, \nfrom the absurd to the bureaucratic to the necessary tough decisions, \nparticularly in regard to our entitlements that have to be addressed in \norder to preserve and save those programs for not only current \nbeneficiaries but for future beneficiaries.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to begin this process, \nand I think each of us must dedicate ourselves to the challenge that \nlies before us. That challenge is dealing with our out-of-control \nfiscal situation, that if not controlled will bring this country down \nand continue this economic malaise that we are currently in.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/22/senate-section/article/S27-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S27-S32]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CHANGING SENATE RULES\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about \nour efforts to change the Senate rules. As we began the 113th Congress \non January 3, Senators Merkley, Harkin, and I submitted a resolution to \nreform the Standing Rules of the Senate. Thirteen of my colleagues have \nsigned on to cosponsor our resolution.\n  When we submitted the resolution, we agreed with the majority leader \nthat it would be best to have the debate about reforming our rules \nafter the inauguration. I appreciate his willingness to work with us on \nthis important issue. Although we postponed the debate, we preserved \nthe right of a simple majority of this body to amend the rules in \naccordance with article 1, section 5 of the Constitution.\n  Senate Resolution 4, our proposal to reform the rules, is simple, it \nis limited, and it is fair. Again, we are not ending the filibuster. We \npreserved the rights of the minority. Here is what we are proposing: an \nend to the widespread abuse of silent filibusters. Instead, Senators \nwould be required to go to the floor and actually tell the American \npeople why they oppose a bill or nominee in order to maintain a \nfilibuster. Debate on motions to proceed to a bill or to send a bill to \nconference would be limited to 2 hours. Postcloture debate on a \nnominee, other than a Justice of the Supreme Court, would be limited to \n2 hours rather than the current limit of 30 hours.\n  These are sensible changes. These are reforms we are willing to live \nwith if\n\n[[Page S28]]\n\nwe are in the minority, and yet we are warned these simple reforms will \ntransform the very character of the Senate and leave the minority \nwithout a voice. These arguments are covers for continued abuse of the \nrules.\n  The reforms we propose are modest--some would say too modest--but \nthey would discourage the excessive use of filibusters. The minority \nstill has the right to filibuster, but not the right of one Senator to \ndo so by simply picking up the phone, by simply making an announcement \nand then going out to dinner or, more likely, out to a fundraiser. I \nhave listened carefully to the arguments by the other side against \nthese changes. Let me say, again, we are not talking about taking away \nthe rights of the minority, we are not talking about abolishing the \nright of debate or to filibuster, but there must be change. The abuse \nof the filibuster and other procedural rules has prevented the Senate \nfrom doing its job. We are no longer the world's greatest deliberative \nbody. In fact, we barely deliberate at all. This does not honor this \ninstitution, and it does not serve the American people.\n  For most of our history the filibuster was used very sparingly, but \nin recent years what was rare has become routine; the exception has \nbecome the norm. Everything is filibustered, every procedural step of \nthe way, with paralyzing effect. The Senate was meant to cool the \nprocess, not send it into a deep freeze.\n  Since the Democratic majority came into the upper Chamber in 2007, \nthe Senates of the 110th, 111th, and 112th Congresses have the three \nhighest totals of filibusters ever recorded. Lyndon Johnson faced one \nfilibuster during his 6 years as Senate majority leader. In the same \nspan of time Harry Reid has faced over 390. Lyndon Johnson, 1, Harry \nReid, 390. Legislation is blocked at every turn. The result is not \nsurprising. The Senate of the 112th Congress passed a record low 2.8 \npercent of bills introduced. That is a 66-percent decrease from the \nlast Republican majority in 2005-2006, and a 90-percent decrease from \nthe high in 1955-1956. By every measure, the 112th Congress was the \nmost unproductive Congress in our history.\n  My Republican colleagues have come to the floor and made many \nimpassioned statements in opposition to amending our rules at the \nbeginning of this Congress. They say the rules can only be changed with \na two-thirds supermajority, as the current filibuster rule requires. \nThey argue that any attempt to amend the rules by a simple majority is \nbreaking the rules to change the rules. This is simply not true. The \nsupermajority requirement to change Senate rules is in direct conflict \nwith the U.S. Constitution. Article 1, section 5 of the Constitution \nstates:\n\n       Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, \n     punish its Members for disorderly Behavior, and, with the \n     Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member.\n\n  When the Framers required a supermajority, they explicitly said so, \nas they did for expelling a Member. On all other matters, such as \ndetermining the Chamber's rules, a majority requirement is clearly \nimplied. There have been three rulings by Vice Presidents, sitting as \nPresident of the Senate--where the Presiding Officer is sitting today--\nwho have ruled on the meaning of article 1, section 5.\n  In 1957, Vice President Nixon ruled that:\n\n       The right of a current majority of the Senate at the \n     beginning of a new Congress to adopt its own rules, stemming \n     as it does from the Constitution itself, cannot be restricted \n     or limited by rules adopted by a majority of a previous \n     Congress.\n\n  Vice President Rockefeller and Vice President Humphrey made similar \nrulings at the beginning of later Congresses.\n  The Constitution is clear, and there is also a longstanding common \nlaw principle--upheld in the Supreme Court--that one legislature cannot \nbind its successors. Many of my Republican colleagues have made the \nsame argument. For example, in 2003 Senator John Cornyn wrote in a Law \nReview article:\n\n       Just as one Congress cannot enact a law that a subsequent \n     Congress could not amend by majority vote, one Senate cannot \n     enact a rule that a subsequent Senate could not amend by \n     majority vote. Such power, after all, would violate the \n     general common law principle that one parliament cannot bind \n     another.\n\n  So amending our rules at the beginning of a Congress is not breaking \nthe rules to change the rules, it is reaffirming that the U.S. \nConstitution is superior to the Senate rules. When there is a conflict \nbetween them, we follow the Constitution.\n\n  Some of my colleagues may believe that using the Constitution in this \nway would be harmful to the Senate. But there is an alternative. We do \nnot have to reform the rules with only a majority vote. Each time the \nfilibuster rule has been amended in the past, a bipartisan majority of \nSenators was prepared to use the constitutional option. But with a \nmajority vote on the reforms looming, enough Members agreed on a \ncompromise and they passed the changes with two-thirds in favor.\n  We could do that again. I know many of my Republican colleagues agree \nwith me. The Senate is not working. As I visit with my Republican \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, they tell me they are \nunhappy with the way things are. I said 2 years ago I would push for \nthe same reforms at the beginning of the next Congress regardless of \nwhich party was in the majority.\n  At the time, many people believed the Democrats would lose their \nmajority. So let me be clear: If Leader McConnell had become the new \nmajority leader in this Congress, I would have asked him to work with \nme on these same reforms.\n  I will say again, the proposed changes will reform the abuse of the \nfilibuster. They will not trample the legitimate rights of the minority \nparty. I am willing to live with all the changes we are proposing, \nwhether I am in the majority or the minority.\n  The other side has suggested a change in the rules is an affront to \nthe American people. But the real affront would be to allow the abuse \nof the filibuster to continue.\n  We have to change the way we do business. We have to govern. It is \ntime for us to pay attention to jobs and the economy and what matters \nto American families--what they talk about around the kitchen table. \nThat was the message that was sent us from this election, and we would \ndo very well to listen to it.\n  Under the abuse of the current rules, all it takes to filibuster is \none Senator picking up the phone. That is it--does not even have to go \nto the floor and defend it--just a phone call by one Senator: no muss, \nno fuss, no inconvenience, except for the American public, except for a \nnation that expects and needs a government that works, a government \nthat actually works together and finds common ground.\n  Maybe some of my colleagues believe the Senate is working as it \nshould, that everything is fine. We do not take that view. It is not \nworking and it needs change. The American people of all persuasions \nwant a government that actually gets something done. The challenges are \ntoo great, the stakes are too high for a government of gridlock to \ncontinue.\n  The New York Times yesterday and several of the local newspapers in \nmy home State have editorialized about moving forward with reform and \nhow important that is. I ask unanimous consent that an editorial from \nthe New York Times and an editorial from the New Mexican be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 21, 2013]\n\n                       A Chance To Fix the Senate\n\n       For six years, Democrats in the Senate have chafed at an \n     unprecedented abuse of the filibuster by Republicans, who \n     have used the practice to hold up nominees high and low and \n     require a supermajority for virtually every bill. But now \n     that they finally have an opportunity to end much of this \n     delay and abuse, Democrats are instead considering only a few \n     half-measures.\n       When the Senate returns on Tuesday, it will still \n     technically be in the first legislative day of the session, \n     which means only a simple majority is necessary to change the \n     rules for the rest of the session.\n       With the support of 51 senators, the rules could be changed \n     to require a ``talking filibuster,'' forcing those objecting \n     to a bill to stand and explain their reasons, at length. The \n     current practice of routinely requiring a 60-vote majority \n     for a bill through a silent objection would end, breaking the \n     logjam that has made the chamber a well of inefficiency and \n     frustration.\n       Several younger senators, led by Jeff Merkley of Oregon and \n     Tom Udall of New Mexico, say that if pressed, a majority of \n     the Senate would support their plan for the talking \n     filibuster. But older senators aren't so\n\n[[Page S29]]\n\n     sure, and have reportedly persuaded Harry Reid, the majority \n     leader, to back off the idea. With the experience of having \n     been in the minority themselves, these Democrats are fearful \n     of losing a powerful tool should Republicans ever return to \n     power in the chamber.\n       That would squander a moment for change. Supermajorities \n     were never intended to be a routine legislative barrier; they \n     should be reserved for the most momentous bills, and the best \n     way to make that happen is to require that objectors work \n     hard for their filibuster, assembling a like-minded coalition \n     and being forthright about their concerns rather than hiding \n     in the shadows or holding up a bill with an e-mailed note.\n       Currently there are six opportunities to filibuster most \n     bills, and Republicans have exploited them all. Mr. Reid \n     wants to reduce those opportunities and speed things up, \n     primarily by ending the filibuster on motions to proceed to \n     debate on bills.\n       That change alone could cut a week of delay on most \n     measures. He also wants to curb filibusters that prevent \n     conference committees from meeting and that hold up some \n     presidential nominations.\n       A faster-moving Senate would be useful, but that should not \n     be the only goal. The best way to end the Senate's sorry \n     history of inaction is to end the silent filibuster, forcing \n     lawmakers to explain themselves if they want to block \n     legislation supported by the majority.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From the New Mexican, Jan. 5, 2013]\n\n                   Filibuster Reform: We Need It Now\n\n       The first day of the 113th Congress took place last week. \n     But fortunately, for the hopes of filibuster reform in the \n     U.S. Senate, opening day will continue later this month, \n     likely Jan. 22. It is, after all, on the opening day of a \n     session that the Senate can revise its rules with a simple \n     majority of 51 votes--and a rules revision to make it easier \n     to do the people's business is desperately needed.\n       New Mexico Sen. Tom Udall, a Democrat, has been a leader in \n     the efforts to reform the U.S. Senate, a move that should not \n     be seen as partisan. Should easing the logjam of holds on \n     bills and appointments help the Democratic majority right \n     now, a rules change could assist Republicans in the future. \n     In politics, no majority is permanent, after all. However, \n     Udall and others--notably U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon \n     Democrat--are right to keep pressing for substantive reform \n     in how the contemplative Senate does its work. The problem \n     facing the Senate is this: Obstructionists in the minority \n     have essentially made it impossible to do business without a \n     supermajority. To pass legislation, the Senate routinely \n     needs 60 votes--the number that can overcome a filibuster--\n     rather than a simple majority. With their reform, Udall and \n     Merkley want any senator who puts a hold on a bill to have to \n     get up and actually filibuster. That is, talk and talk and \n     talk, without stopping, so that the whole world sees who is \n     gumming up the works. Anonymous holds would stop, whether on \n     legislation or appointments that require Senate confirmation. \n     This seems like common sense. A senator who wants to make a \n     stand should have to stand up and tell the country why.\n       What is common sense in flyover country is controversial in \n     Washington, D.C., where lawmakers enjoy exercising secret \n     holds out of the light of day. Even instituting the reform \n     will be difficult. Normally, changing Senate rules takes 67 \n     votes; on the first day of Congress, though, 51 votes will do \n     the job. Senate tradition--and boy, is the Senate \n     traditional--frowns upon changing rules with such a narrow \n     margin. Doing so is called the ``nuclear'' option by \n     detractors, and the ``constitutional'' option to those hoping \n     to break open stifling Senate culture. In recent days, a \n     different Senate rules change package has been discussed, one \n     proposed by Democratic Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan and \n     Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona and backed by others. \n     We like its bipartisan origins, but unfortunately, the \n     senators' proposal appears too watered down to fix gridlock. \n     It would make it tougher for the minority to block debate, \n     but by guaranteeing minority members two amendments, could \n     serve up another method of killing legislation.\n       We are encouraged that Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada \n     chose to recess, rather than adjourn, the Senate on its first \n     day of the session, thus giving Udall and Merkley time to \n     garner support for their substantive rules reform. The right \n     for a single senator to stand on principle, holding up \n     legislation out of strong conviction, must be protected--and \n     asking a politician to talk, after all, is no heavy penalty. \n     What must go by the wayside is the ability of any senator to \n     stall appointments, or hold up necessary legislation, just \n     because.\n       When the Senate continues its first day later this month, \n     we urge Majority Leader Reid to go for broke. Seek true \n     reform, allowing the filibuster to remain only if senators \n     will stand up and speak for their positions out loud where \n     all can see. If need be, institute the reform with 51 votes. \n     Otherwise, the Senate will not be able to conduct the \n     essential business of the country--again. And whether \n     approving Cabinet secretaries or ambassadors or judges, or \n     passing necessary laws on immigration and gun control, the \n     nation needs a Senate that can move legislation through in a \n     timely, thoughtful but never cumbersome fashion.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Three of my Senate colleagues who have just \nbeen elected are in the Chamber. I think one of the best things about \nthis new class of Senators who have come into the Senate is they have \nstudied this issue, they understand this issue, they have been out \nthere with the American people and listened to them. The American \npeople are demanding change.\n  So it is a real pleasure to see in the chair the Senator from Hawaii, \nwho is the Presiding Officer, and on the floor the Senator from North \nDakota and also the Senator from Maine. I know shortly we will be going \ninto our caucus and having a very lively debate about which way to move \nforward, how we do reform.\n  I am convinced we are going to reform these rules. I hope we do it \nworking with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. But if they \nwill not come with us, we are in a position where we are in the \nmajority, and we have to make this institution work for the American \npeople.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I am rising today to talk about the \nvision we have ahead for the next 2 years and how this Senate can \nfulfill its responsibilities under the Constitution to do its \nlegislative responsibilities addressing the big issues facing America.\n  I don't think anyone is unaware that for the last 2 years this \nChamber has seen simply inaction and paralysis. It has been rated as \none of the worst 2-year sessions in the history of the U.S. Government.\n  Well, what are we going to do differently? How is it that we only \naddress 1 out of 24 appropriations bills over the last 2 years? How is \nit that so many important bills never made it to the floor of the \nSenate, bills such as the replacement for No Child Left Behind, which \nwas a bipartisan vision that came out of committee.\n  How is it that so many bills came to this floor to never see a final \nvote? These are bills, such as the DISCLOSE Act, which would have \neliminated secrecy in campaign donations; the DREAM Act, which would \nhave honored creating a future for those who know only America as their \nhome; the President's jobs package, which would have helped put America \nback to work; and the closing of loopholes for the biggest, most \nwealthy oil companies. Those funds could be put to use reducing our \ndeficit or funding critical programs for working Americans.\n  On issue after issue after issue, we saw inaction. What we heard \nyesterday at the start of this next 2 years was a call from the \nPresident for action. In his inaugural speech he said:\n\n       For now decisions are upon us, and we cannot afford delay. \n     We cannot mistake absolutism for principle, or substitute \n     spectacle for politics, or treat name-calling as reasoned \n     debate. We must act, knowing that our work will be imperfect. \n     We must act, knowing that today's victories will be only \n     partial.\n\n  The President echoed, if you will, the thought that he brought into \nhis first 4 years, the urgency of now. We have big issues facing \nAmerica, and it is time for the executive branch and the legislative \nbranch to work together to address those issues.\n  In this call for action, we must ask how much action can there be if \nwe see more than 100 filibusters in the next 2 years? How much action \ncan there be if on every request for a vote an objection is heard that \ncreates a day of delay in this Senate? The contrast is enormous from \nthe time that Lyndon B. Johnson was President of the Senate.\n  Lyndon B. Johnson, during 6 years of presiding over this body, saw \none filibuster. Harry Reid, in his 6 years of presiding over this \nSenate, has seen 391 filibusters.\n  Let me convey that even when we have the votes to end a filibuster, \nthe fact that it is launched creates enormous paralysis. Imagine you \nare debating a bill, and you continue debating through the end of the \nweek. When you come in the following Monday to debate, and nobody has \nanything left to\n\n[[Page S30]]\n\nsay, then someone says: I ask unanimous consent that we have a final \nvote on this bill. Now, you see, we don't have a previous question on \nthis floor, so one has to ask unanimous consent. Any of the 100 \nSenators can weigh in and say no.\n  When they weigh in and say no on that Monday, then on Tuesday a \npetition is put forward with 16 Senators saying: Let's have a vote on \nclosing debate. That vote can't happen until Thursday, under the rules.\n  If it is successful on a Thursday, we have to have 30 hours more of \ndebate before we can hold the final vote. That takes us into Saturday. \nMonday through Saturday is lost based on an objection on Monday by one \nSenator.\n  If we have 391 of these objections that waste a week of our time in \nthe course of a 6-year period, then we basically waste every \nlegislative week because there are not 391 weeks in a 6-year period.\n  It becomes pretty simple to see why we only were able to get one \nappropriations bill done in the last 2 years, and why so many bills \nnever made it to the floor of the Senate for consideration even though \nthey were essential to restoring the economic vitality of our Nation \nand putting people back to work. I, for one, find this absolutely \nunacceptable.\n  Over our history there have been three basic forms of filibusters. \nThe first only worked in an age when transportation didn't work very \nwell, and at any given moment there were a number of Members who \ncouldn't get here to the floor of the Senate because they were \ntraveling from their farms and the axle on their wagon broke or the \ntrain broke down or so on and so forth. Sometimes those journeys would \ntake many weeks and things happened along the way. In that situation, a \nquorum of 50 percent plus 1 was sometimes in doubt, and those seeking \ndelay could say: You know what. Let's deny a quorum.\n  Well, that was an effective tool only through that period. Then, as \nthat changed, folks said: You know, we have the respect here of hearing \neveryone out. Therefore, if I can get to the floor of the Senate, I may \ndelay this Senate as long as I am able to speak.\n  Well, it is through this effort that we have a number of famous \nfilibusters, folks such as Strom Thurmond holding forth for 24 hours. \nWe have, however, seen that a person can only delay the Senate for 24 \nhours. Then someone else can seek the floor, and you may proceed. So \nthat was a fairly modest strategy.\n  In both the case of the denying quorum and in the case of speaking as \nlong as you could, you had to spend time and energy. You had to \norganize, and it was visible before this body. It was visible before \nthe reporters gathered in the balcony. Therefore, the American people, \nlong before there was a television camera here, could see what you were \ndoing, and the public could provide feedback on that.\n  But now we come to the modern era, from 1970 forward, in which it has \nbecome popular to start using the objection as an instrument of party \nwarfare, the objection to a final vote. If we turn back before 1970, we \nhad an overlap between the parties of perhaps 30 Members. So if you had \nused this objection, you would have a good sense that you would be able \nto get cloture. Furthermore, there was a social contract that you only \ninterrupted the workings of this body on an issue of deep principle. \nYou only blockaded the operations of the Senate on an issue of profound \nconcern to your State, not as a routine instrument of party politics.\n  But that has changed over the last 43 years, since 1970 forward, and \nnow the minority party can say: Let's show that the majority can't even \nget an agenda onto the floor of the Senate, and then let's complain \nabout them not acting. This is not a philosophy that serves America. It \nis not a philosophy that was embraced through the extent of our \nhistory. You came here with the responsibility to contribute in \ncommittee, to contribute on the Senate floor, to try to make bills \nbetter, and to try to get issues addressed. You were not trying to \nparalyze this body so issues don't get addressed that may be contained \non that side. That, quite frankly, is an unacceptable theme that has \nstarted to haunt this Hall, and we need to do something about it.\n  Indeed, if we look at the modern era where the parties have become so \ndivided, we no longer see that overlap of 30 Senators. Therefore, any \nminority group, be it the Democrats, be it the Republicans, has the \nability to bring this Chamber to a halt. But is it right to do so? If \nwe cannot persuade our colleagues it is wrong to do so, then we need to \nchange the rules of the Senate. We need to insist if someone is going \nto throw a shoe into the gears, if someone is going to blockade the \nability of the Senate to deliberate and decide, then that Senator needs \nto take responsibility here on the floor of the Senate.\n\n  Yes, we should get rid of the filibuster on the motion to proceed. \nFilibustering on whether to get to a bill does not enhance deliberation \non the bill itself. We should make that decision in a crisp fashion and \nget on to the work, not waste weeks trying to decide if we are going to \ndo the work of the people.\n  Second, we should get rid of the filibuster on going to a conference \ncommittee. Both Chambers have decided. They have voted in favor of the \nbill. It has been passed in different forms. Nothing should impede \ngetting to conference and having a negotiation. Indeed, out of those \nnegotiations, even if starting with one Chamber having a dramatic view \ndifferent from the other, there is a coming together that takes steps \nforward that both Chambers can agree to. So nothing should impede that \nnegotiation from going forward. We recognize a bill can still be \nfilibustered when it comes back from committee, so why impede getting \nto the conference committee in the first place?\n  We should greatly reduce the number of hours after we have gotten \ncloture on debate. On nominations, by the time we vote on closing \ndebate, our Members know how they are going to vote on that nominee. So \nwe could have a final 2 hours but not a final 30 hours. Thirty hours is \nanother wasted set of days we can ill afford. And certainly it makes \nsense to say, whenever possible, we should cut down that 30 hours on \nbills after we have reached cloture. We can do it by unanimous consent, \nand we often do that now. We can do it by requiring Senators to proceed \nto a vote if they do not stand and talk, but that is postcloture.\n  Here is the thing: When 41 Senators say they want additional debate, \nthey want to delay the decisionmaking process here in the Senate, they \nshould be willing to stand and make their case before their colleagues \nand the American people. It takes time and energy if you go that \ndirection. It doesn't become a freebie where one Senator spends no \ntime, no energy, and can go off to dinner or on vacation while \nparalyzing the Senate. You should have to spend the time and energy to \nbe here to make your case.\n  Not only is that important in stripping away frivolous filibusters, \nit also means the American people get to weigh in. I am absolutely \nconvinced if we were to go back to the debate on the DISCLOSE Act, \nwhich stripped away secrecy in campaign donations, and we had 59 votes \nto close debate--we needed a sixtieth--if those who voted for \nadditional debate, and who fled this Chamber fearful of making their \ncase before the American people, had been required to stand and defend \nsecrecy and foreign donations in our campaign system, the American \npeople would not have said they were heroes but they were bums. They \nwould have weighed in and said to their own Senators: Join the effort \nto close debate, because to stand in the way of a final vote over \nsecrecy in campaign donations does great damage to our democracy. Maybe \nthe pressure and common sense of the citizens would have helped address \nthe bitter partisanship that guides this body.\n  At a minimum, the citizens of this Nation have the right to know what \nis happening to legislation here on floor. The idea it is being \nparalyzed by the secret filibuster is unacceptable, so we should \ninclude the talking filibuster in any package we bring to modify the \nrules of the Senate.\n  I see my colleague from New Mexico has come to the floor, and he \nspoke earlier. He has put forward the vision that we must, at the start \nof every 2 years, evaluate how the Senate is working, and if it has \nproblems we need to pass changes in the rules to address those \nproblems.\n  This is not some remote concept of inside baseball. This is about \nAmerican citizens having a legislature that can\n\n[[Page S31]]\n\naddress the big issues facing our Nation. So I praise him for his \nleadership in putting this forward, which has led to this day. And it \nis the second time. We were here 2 years ago making this case, making \nthis argument that we owe it to our citizens to improve the workings of \nthe Senate, and we are here again today.\n  There is a saying about the Senate, that the Senate is the world's \ngreatest deliberative body. If only it were so. It has been, at various \npoints in its history, a thoughtful Chamber, a deliberative Chamber. \nBut not today. It is driven by deep partisan differences, those being \nconverted into strategies of paralysis, that prevent deliberation. We \nmust change that. It is our responsibility as Senators to change that. \nThe American people expect it. Let's make it so.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to \nengage in a colloquy with my friend, the Senator from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, once again let me say at \nthe beginning it is a real pleasure to see my old attorney general \ncolleague, now the Senator from North Dakota, Heidi Heitkamp, in the \nchair presiding over the Senate, and also to see the Senator from \nMaine, Angus King, here--our new Senators. I think Senator Merkley \nwould agree with this, that our new Senators bring an energy to this \nthat we don't necessarily have. We are 4 years from our last campaign. \nWe ran in 2008. I love hearing their stories and what they have heard \nand how they have visited with people in townhall meetings.\n  The American people get this. I don't think there is any doubt that \nthey really get this. I know my colleague has done a number of \ntownhalls on this issue. I just hope, as we have the chance to discuss \nthis, both in our caucus and on the floor and with other Senators, that \nwe can capture the energy of the Senators who have arrived here and \nhave been out with the people in their States, with their constituents, \nand what they bring to this.\n  But I wanted to ask the Senator because, among many of our Senators, \nhe does regular townhall meetings--and I have also done a number in my \ncareer--is this kind of rules change something that is so arcane that \npeople don't understand it? Are they saying: Why are you bothering with \nprocedure or do people get it? Do they get it in Oregon when you are in \na meeting?\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. To my colleague from New Mexico, I would say they most \nadamantly get it. In fact, I had 13 townhall meetings 2 weeks ago, in \nconservative parts of the State, in more liberal parts of the State. \nAnd in every setting--every setting from conservative to liberal--folks \nsaid: Please, please continue this effort to address the filibuster and \nthe paralysis, and the simple notion behind the talking filibuster.\n  If a Senator is voting for more debate--that is to delay the workings \nof the Senate--then he or she should be making their case on the floor \nso the citizens get to see what is going on and they get to decide \nwhether they support it or oppose it. That idea resonates with people. \nIt is the way folks think the Senate works, and they often think the \nrules that required it in the past have been changed so it does not \nhappen now. So it is a chance I have to explain to them that what has \nchanged is the social contract; that when people objected to the Senate \nproceeding with its business in the past, they wanted to make their \nviews known on the Senate floor. They wanted to take responsibility \nbecause they realized it was a very high privilege to be able to delay \nthe Senate and they had a responsibility to do so only for deeply \nprincipled or large issues and to make their case known.\n  So I do see overwhelming support. I feel as though the American \npeople are so far ahead of maybe our own Chamber in understanding how \nbroken we are and how much it needs to be fixed.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. The Senator made some nice comments about \nme--he was probably a little too generous--and I wanted to also thank \nhim for all the work he has done on this issue. He has been a \npassionate voice for change, and he and I have both reached out to our \nfriends across the aisle and tried to get things done.\n  I always bring this back to the question of why are we doing this. We \nare doing this so government can tackle the issues the American people \ncare about. And I think there are two times in history--I am sure there \nare many others--where for me the Senate was in its glory days. We \nshould always remember we have that potential. We see little bits of \nlight every now and then here, such as with the passage of a \ntransportation bill or a farm bill out of the Senate where \nbipartisanship exists and we come together, but I wish to talk very \nbriefly about two time periods that I consider to be the glory days of \nthe Senate.\n  One was before the Civil War. In the 40 years before the Civil War, \nthe Senate was grappling with how do we hold the Union together. There \nwas tremendous discussion, and Senators such as Daniel Webster and John \nCalhoun and others would work with each other and have heated debate, \nbut for that 40 years before the Civil War, they held the country \ntogether. It was the Senate that fashioned those compromises that \nallowed the country to stay out of the Civil War. They didn't \ncompletely prevent it, but most people, looking at history, say those \nwere some of the glory days of the Senate.\n  The second period was in the 1960s and 1970s, with Senators such as \nMuskie and Stafford and Chafee--giants in this body--who stepped \nforward on civil rights, stepped forward on environmental issues, \nstepped forward on the pressing issues of the time. So the Senate, once \nagain in that time period, passed laws.\n  I remember; I was a kid here in Washington, and my father was \nSecretary of the Interior, when the wilderness law, the Clean Water \nAct, the Clean Air Act, and the Environmental Protection Agency was set \nup. Those were big laws--big, bold laws--that were dealing with our \nproblems. So once again, they are glory days of the Senate.\n  I think we have that potential. As I see the new Senators coming in, \nthe folks who were elected with us, and the Senators who arrived in the \nlast 5 or 10 years, I think we have the ability to respond in a big, \nbold way to the crises that face us.\n  I know Senator Merkley came here as a young man with Senator \nHatfield, I believe, and he saw a different Senate. Maybe he could talk \nabout that. We don't want to stay; I know we are going to a caucus and \nwe have our generous chair here--our presiding officer--so we don't \nwant to keep her up here too long.\n  Anyway, I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I think my colleague from New Mexico is absolutely right \nin pointing out there were periods when the Senate really worked to \nface the big issues of America. And it wasn't that there weren't \nprofound differences. There were fierce differences, emotional \ndifferences, deep differences, but folks came to this floor, they \nconversed, they laid out their arguments and, ultimately, they made \ndecisions about which way to go. They didn't bring the attitude: Well, \nlet's paralyze this Chamber from doing anything. Had they done that, \nthere would never have been the set of changes that addressed \nsignificant issues in either of those periods.\n  My colleague is right that a part of the reason I feel so strongly \nabout restoring the functioning of this Senate is that when I came here \nas an intern at age 19 for Senator Hatfield, I had the very good \nfortune to be assigned to the Tax Reform Act of 1976, and then I had \nthe even better fortune that it came up on the floor of the Senate. So \nduring the many days it came before the body, I sat up in the staff \ngallery and watched as amendment after amendment was raised and debated \nand voted on. And since in those days there was no camera or e-mail, \nthe member of the Senate team who was responsible for it would run down \nfrom the staff gallery, intercept their Senator, and tell them what the \nissue was, what was said about it, what the folks back home thought \nabout it, what the set of motions was that had been dealt with on it, \nand so it was a legislature at work. And rarely, rarely, did the \nthought that anything would not be decided by 51 pass the minds of \nSenators.\n\n[[Page S32]]\n\nAgain, that objection for 51 was reserved for very special, very rare \noccasions. It might happen once or twice in your career.\n  I do feel that the conversation we have before us is so important \nthat I thought I would put up this chart. As my colleague can see, this \njust dramatizes it. It is a picture of Lyndon B. Johnson showing his \none filibuster in 6 years, one time that he needed to get a cloture \nmotion to try to shut down debate; otherwise, there was a courtesy that \npeople said what they had to say and then stood aside and took votes. \nAnd here we have Harry Reid in his 6 years--it says ``387 and \ncounting.'' It hit 391 before we completed his sixth year. So there is \nan enormous difference.\n  The work we are engaged in right now of trying to find a way to have \nevery voice heard and then to be able to proceed to be accountable and \ntransparent before the public is so important.\n  As the Senator and I have engaged in this conversation, sometimes we \nhave heard criticism from across the aisle saying: You are trying to \nsilence the voice of the minority. Does the Senator see anything in the \nproposals that we have been advocating that in any way silences the \nvoice of the minority?\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. In looking at this, I do not see anything in \nthe proposals, and I think we, in working on this together, tried to \nbring a discipline to it that said we want to preserve the best \ntraditions of the Senate, we want the minority to be heard, we want the \nminority to have amendments, and we want them included in the process. \nWhat we don't want is the tyranny of the minority. And the Founders \ntalked about the tyranny of the minority. They talked about the fact \nthat if you allowed a small minority to govern and block the governing \nof the majority, that was the tyranny of the minority, and they feared \nthat.\n  So I think that when we consider this and we talk about the \nfilibuster and our institution today, our Senate, where many times the \nRepublican leader has come to the floor and said that it is going to \ntake 60 votes, everything takes 60 votes, that isn't the way the \nFounders designed it. The Founders actually had very strong language \nfor what they thought of supermajorities.\n  Everybody remembers their history. The Founders came off the Articles \nof Confederation. It was a supermajority. It didn't work. It was \nbroken. So they only put into the Constitution in five places \nsupermajorities--things such as expelling a Member and ratifying a \ntreaty--but otherwise it was simple majorities. And when the history is \ngoing to be written, it is hard to tell how this happened. But to have \na leader of the Senate stand and say that everything takes 60 votes--\nthe Founders never contemplated that. When they adopted rule XXII in \n1917, that wasn't what they were trying to do, and the rule has \nactually been turned on its head.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I would like to follow up on the last \npoint Senator Udall of New Mexico made about our Founders.\n  I have in my hand three of the Federalist Papers, Federalist Papers \n22, 75, and 58. These are by Madison and Hamilton, and they explore \nthis issue of the supermajority. It was a very conscious decision that \na supermajority was not put into the Constitution for decisions of \nthese Chambers. And the reason why--and they explained it more \neloquently--is essentially that if you take the path that the minority \nthinks is the right path rather than the path the majority thinks is \nthe right path, then over time you make a series of worse decisions. \nThe minority might be right on occasion, but most of the time the \nviewpoint brought by those representing the greatest number of States \nin this case or the greatest number of citizens on the House side is \nthe path that makes sense. And they warned about the supermajority as \nan instrument that would bring paralysis. It is almost as if they could \nlook forward 200 years to this moment and say: Don't do that because \nyou will end up with paralysis.\n  This is from Federalist Paper No. 22 by Alexander Hamilton. He wrote \nthis in 1787, and he notes in commenting about the issue of a simple \nmajority that ``there is commonly a necessity for action. The public \nbusiness must, in some way or other, go forward. If a pertinacious \nminority can control the opinion of a majority, respecting the best \nmode of conducting it, the majority, in order that something may be \ndone, must conform to the views of the minority; and thus the sense of \nthe smaller number will overrule that of the greater, and give a tone \nto the national proceedings. Hence, tedious delays; continual \nnegotiation and intrigue; contemptible compromises of the public \ngood.''\n  Let me read that last set of words about what Hamilton said would \nhappen if you had a supermajority requirement in the Senate: ``tedious \ndelays; continual negotiation and intrigue; contemptible compromises of \nthe public good.'' I think anyone watching the proceedings of the \nSenate for the last 2 years would say that Hamilton was right on the \nmark in that regard. And, of course, he was not alone. There was not a \nsingle Federalist Paper written arguing that there should be a \nsupermajority in the Senate or the House because of the experience that \nhad been had previous to forming the strategy embodied in the \nConstitution.\n  Let's turn to James Madison. In Federalist 58, James Madison said:\n\n       It has been said that more than a majority ought to have \n     been required for a quorum . . .\n\n  He goes on to discuss it in various views, and he said:\n\n       Lastly, it would facilitate and foster the baneful practice \n     of secessions; a practice which has shown itself even in \n     States where a majority only is required; a practice \n     subversive--\n  And here is the key language--\n       a practice subversive of all the principles of order and \n     regular government; a practice which leads more directly to \n     public convulsions, and the ruin of popular governments, than \n     any other which has yet been displayed among us.\n\n  He also made the point that we would end up with equitable sacrifices \nto the general weal--or general good.\n  So as we turn to our conversations in our respective caucuses and to \nthe dialog here on the floor of the Senate, I ask my colleagues to \nsearch your hearts about our responsibility to the citizens of the \nUnited States of America to address the big issues facing America, \nwhich means that we don't paralyze this body in secret. If my \ncolleagues have points to make, then make them as was done during the \nperiods of great debate on the floor of the Senate: Make them on the \nfloor of the Senate, engage in that debate, and when no more is to be \nsaid, when all 100 Senators say: We have had our full input, then let's \nmake a decision.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/22/senate-section/article/S32-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S32]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, let me take a moment to welcome you to \nthe Senate. I look forward to working with you and welcome you, coming \nfrom the House of Representatives to the Senate.\n  Over the Christmas holidays most of our Nation was focused on what \nCongress would do to avoid the so-called\n\n[[Page S33]]\n\nfiscal cliff. What was largely missing from that conversation was how \nto address the much greater and more damaging problem, our growing \nnational debt.\n  I am not exactly sure what the definition of fiscal cliff was. I \nthink it had different meanings to different people. We dealt with a \nportion of the fiscal cliff, a slight delay in sequestration, and the \nconsequences of the so-called Bush tax cuts expiring on December 31, \nbut the serious problem is our national debt. Last year's budget \nshortfall reached $1.1 trillion; the fourth straight year of trillion-\ndollar deficit spending.\n  This out-of-control government spending has increased our national \ndebt to a record $16 trillion, which is more than the entire U.S. \neconomy produced in goods and services for the entire year of 2012.\n  Last week Secretary Geithner let Congress know it will reach its \nborrowing limit as soon as mid-February. President Obama will request \nthat Congress raise the debt ceiling once again. This is the fifth time \nthat President Obama has requested the debt limit be raised to allow \nthe Federal Government to borrow and spend more money.\n  What is the point of even having a debt limit if Congress simply \nextends the Treasury's borrowing capacity each time the limit is \nreached? While some may say it is irresponsible not to raise the debt \nlimit, our Nation finds itself at a point of such indebtedness that it \nis equally as irresponsible to extend the debt ceiling without \nsignificant reductions in Federal spending.\n  I voted against an increase to the debt limit 2 years ago and intend \nto vote against another increase unless we substantially change the way \ngovernment does business by reducing Federal spending.\n  In addition to it being alleged that it is irresponsible not to raise \nthe debt ceiling, sometimes it is suggested it is not compassionate to \nnot spend money. Where is the compassion in spending money we don't \nhave that is being borrowed and will have to be repaid by future \ngenerations of Americans--our kids and grandkids?\n  Our country is facing enormous fiscal challenges that, if left \nunchecked, will have a disastrous impact on the future of our Nation. \nThe simple truth is that government is spending more than it is taking \nin, and this pattern must not, and in fact cannot, continue.\n  During the last 2 years alone the government has spent more than $7.3 \ntrillion and increased the Nation's debt by more than $3.2 trillion. We \ndidn't get into this situation overnight. It has been years in the \nmaking. Our staggering national debt and deficits are the \nresponsibility of many Congresses and Presidents from both political \nparties who have allowed us to live well beyond our means for far too \nlong. Americans deserve leadership in Washington to confront these \nfiscal challenges and fight for the future of our Nation. However, to \ndate, our President and our Congress--this Congress--has failed to \nprovide that leadership.\n  We learned from the New Year's Eve fiscal cliff negotiations that our \nwork to tackle our debt must begin now. It cannot wait until the \neleventh hour when the deadline is near and the consequences are \npreventable. We have all heard the saying that the definition of \ninsanity is doing the same thing over and over but expecting different \nresults. Why should we expect our fiscal situation to change if we keep \ndoing the same thing: raising the debt limit so we can borrow more \nmoney and spend more money?\n  We know what needs to be done. It will just take the political \ncourage to do it. Rather than wait for another last-minute deal that \ngets rushed through with little input from the American people, it is \ntime we have an open and honest debate.\n  I think Americans are ready for leadership that involves tough \ndecisions. The President must come to the table with Congress and put \ncourage and common sense before politics, and that means getting \nserious about our government's finances.\n  One of the best ways to rein in spending is to set a budget and live \nby it. No country, business, or family can operate responsibly without \na budget. Crafting a budget is one of the basic responsibilities of \nCongress, but this Senate has not passed a budget in more than 1,300 \ndays.\n  When a Kansas family meets the max on their credit card, they don't \njust call the credit card company and ask them to raise their credit \nlimit so they can keep on spending. No. They cut back on spending and \nchange their budget. Washington needs to do the same.\n  I hope the stories the Senate is going to address a budget are true, \nand I hope that means the Budget Committee will meet and--in regular \norder--deal with a budget. I am a member of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee. I hope we have the opportunity to do appropriations bills \nwhich matter and follow that budget.\n  We must take serious action to address this fiscal cliff--the real \none--of $48 trillion in unfunded obligations. These programs, which \nrepresent promises made by the Federal Government to Americans, must be \nkept. It is not about undoing Social Security or Medicare or Medicaid, \nit is about making certain they are available, fiscally sound, and that \nanother generation of Americans can receive the benefits.\n  Another solution, besides the budget, in getting our spending back \nunder control is to consider and adopt many of the bipartisan \nrecommendations put forth by the President's own Deficit Reduction \nCommission. The cochairs of that Commission have warned that if we fail \nto take swift and serious action, the United States faces the most \npredictable economic crisis in history. Yet the President and Senate \nleadership has ignored these recommendations and continues to spend \nborrowed money without regard for the consequences.\n  The President's solution is to raise revenues to balance the budget, \nbut those tax increases--if he got all he asked for--would only cover \nour spending for a few weeks. The budget the President proposed during \nthe 4 years he has been President raises taxes. Every budget that the \nPresident has proposed in the 4 years he has been in office has raised \ntaxes. One would think maybe that means the deficit is going down. But, \nunfortunately, the budgets proposed by President Obama would raise \ntaxes, raise spending, and increase debt. To me, that suggests \nincreasing taxes is never the solution that results in less spending \nand less deficits but just increased taxes and more spending.\n  History shows us that every time money is raised in Washington, DC, \nmore money is spent by Washington, DC. The revenues we need to balance \nour books are not increases in taxes but revenues coming from a strong \nand growing economy. To turn our economy around and put people back to \nwork, Congress and the administration should be implementing policies \nthat encourage job creation; rein in burdensome government regulations; \nreplace our convoluted Tax Code with one that is fair, simple, and \ncertain; open foreign markets to American-manufactured goods and \nagricultural products; and develop a comprehensive energy policy. We \nare not immune from the laws of economics which face every Nation.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that government spending on \nhealth care, entitlements, Social Security, and interest on the \nnational debt will consume 100 percent of the total revenues generated \nby the Federal Government by the year 2025. That means the money the \ngovernment spends on national defense, transportation, veterans' health \ncare, and other government programs will have to be borrowed and will \ndrive us even further into debt.\n\n  The CBO issued a report last June which warned that unless we work to \nreduce our debt, we will face the increased probability of a sudden \nfiscal crisis that would cause investors to lose confidence in the \ngovernment's ability to manage its budget, and the government would \nthereby lose its ability to borrow at these affordable rates.\n  I do not want to experience the day when our creditors decide we are \nno longer creditworthy and America has to suffer the same consequences \nas the countries that have ignored their debt crisis. We need to look \nno further than the current situation of many countries in Europe to \nsee what high levels of national debt will do to a country's economic \nhealth.\n  Last week one of the major credit rating agencies, Fitch, warned that\n\n[[Page S34]]\n\nAmerica risks losing its AAA credit rating if Congress and the \nPresident fail to agree to a ``credible medium-term deficit reduction \nplan.'' Fitch's warning is yet another reason we need to work together \nto put our country on a sustainable path for the future. We need to \nheed this warning and take steps now to prevent another credit \ndowngrade.\n  The American people expect the President and Members of Congress to \nconfront our Nation's challenges and not push them off to some future \ndate. They also want their concerns and voices heard. The last-minute \ndeals, the negotiations by a handful of people are very disturbing to \nme and to many Americans.\n  Today I am pleased to share a new opportunity which gives Kansans a \nvoice in the debate on how to reduce spending through a new Web site \ncalled Fight for our Future. Kansans can access that site from my home \npage and learn more about the government's true fiscal condition. Not \nonly can they share their thoughts on why we should cut spending, but \nthey can also vote for a debt reduction proposal they think will be \nmost effective. They will be able to add their name to a message that \nwill be sent to the President and congressional leaders to urge us to \nput politics aside and work to save our country's future.\n  The debate over government spending is often seen as one that is \nphilosophical or simply partisan bickering. All my life I heard \nRepublicans and Democrats argue about spending, deficits, and taxes. \nThey think that is what goes on in Washington, DC. This time it is \ndifferent. Our failure to act will have dramatic consequences to the \ndaily lives of Americans. This is about whether an American can find a \njob, afford to make payments on their homes and cars, and whether their \nkids will have a bright future.\n  The debt limit crisis we are facing now did not have to be a crisis. \nWe knew the day would come when we would have to deal with the \nconsequences of living beyond our means. Let's work together to solve \nthis tremendous challenge.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday President Obama made a beautiful \nspeech. I think everyone agrees that he is a very persuasive speaker. \nAlthough I didn't agree with anything he said, it was said beautifully.\n  I want to read one part of his speech because I don't want to get it \nwrong. He said:\n\n       We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing \n     that the failure to do so would betray our children and \n     future generations . . . The path towards sustainable energy \n     sources will be long and sometimes difficult. But America \n     cannot resist this transition. We must lead it. We cannot \n     cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs \n     and new industries. We must claim its promise. That's how we \n     will maintain our economic vitality and our national \n     treasure.\n\n  That is a direct quote which came out of the President's speech, and \nit has a lot of little subliminal things in there that people did not \npick up on, but I did.\n  One is--and they talked about that--we must show the leadership. That \nis because of all the things they try to do to damage the economy, to \ndestroy the economy, in terms of the cap-and-trade agenda. And all of \nthat are things that other countries are just waiting for us to do. It \nis not that we are going to provide the leadership, and all of a sudden \nChina is going to say: Hey, they are doing it, so maybe we ought to do \nit. China, instead, is sitting back hoping that will happen in this \ncountry, so they can have all the jobs that are chased away from our \nmanufacturing base.\n  There are a few sentences the President dedicated to global warming, \nand the rest of his speech could be labeled as a liberal laundry list. \nAnd I think everyone was expecting that.\n  I was not surprised that the President decided to do this. All during \nthe campaign and during the weeks since the election, the President's \nextreme environmental base has been very vocal with their frustrations.\n  A lot of them go back and say: At one time, Mr. President, you had \nthe White House and you had the House and you had the Senate, and yet \nyou did not even try to get this stuff done. They are talking about, of \ncourse, the cap-and-trade system. In fact, there is one good reason he \ndid not get it done, and that is because the votes just are not there.\n  They want the President to immediately regulate hydraulic fracturing, \nofficially reject the permit for the Keystone pipeline, advance the \nregulatory powers of the EPA to cut CO2 emissions, use all \nof his political capital to push a legislative fix to climate change, \nand to kill America's oil and gas industry.\n  That is what was expected of him. And now, since he does not have to \nrun for reelection, you are going to get a lot more than you did \nbefore. So that should make them happy. But it is a lot more rhetoric \nand not a lot more action.\n  Studies done during the most recent debate--and that would have been \nthe Waxman-Markey bill; that was the cap-and-trade bill just a couple \nyears ago that they had; I think that might have been the last one we \nhad--the estimates--this is interesting--going all the way back to the \nKyoto treaty, they said, the cost, if you try to do cap and trade, is \ngoing to be between $300 billion and $400 billion a year. Well, that is \nbetween $300 billion and $400 billion a year.\n  I do something in my State of Oklahoma, and I suggest that the \nPresiding Officer may do this in his State of West Virginia. Every year \nI get the figures on how many families there are in my State of \nOklahoma who file a Federal tax return and actually pay Federal taxes. \nThen I do the math. The way it works out, if you are talking about $400 \nbillion a year--and I have not had one person argue with that figure \nthat I have been using for over 10 years now--but if you do the math, \nthat means for each person in my State of Oklahoma, it would cost them \nabout $3,000 a year to do it. The interesting part of this is, you do \nnot really accomplish anything by doing it.\n  This same agenda at the EPA, under authority he is claiming is under \nthe Clean Water Act, has to be something we are going to talk about. \nAnd I do not have any hesitation in doing that.\n  Bills such as the Waxman-Markey bill--and I believe Senator Boxer and \nseveral others have had bills--the cost of that being of some $400 \nbillion a year, would affect industries and emitters of CO2 \nthat emit 25,000 tons of CO2 or more a year--25,000 tons. \nThat would truly be just the big emitters. However, the effort of this \nadministration--since they cannot get it passed through legislation--is \nto do it through regulation under the Clean Air Act.\n  The Clean Air Act is specific. And the Clean Air Act goes after \nanyone who emits at least 250 tons of CO2. So stop and think \nabout that because it is very difficult to try to evaluate it and \ndetermine just how much it would cost. The regulations they have would \nforce these facilities to receive--anyone who is regulated under this--\nEPA construction permits, rehabilitation permits, monitoring devices, \nand install unnecessary and costly technology to reduce CO2 \nemissions without any corresponding benefits. This would give the EPA a \nhand in everything.\n  The cost of this is so great that it cannot be calculated. Stop and \nthink about this. If the Waxman-Markey bill--or any of the other pieces \nof legislation that were called cap-and-trade regulations--were passed, \nthat would regulate only those 25,000 tons or more of emissions. \nHowever, the Clean Air Act is 250 tons. So 25,000 tons would be $400 \nbillion a year. How much would it be for just 250 tons? That means \nevery\n\n[[Page S35]]\n\nuniversity, every school, every hospital would be subject to the \nregulation. That is something they have been attempting to do for a \nlong time.\n  I have to say, there are a lot of appointees of President Obama whom \nI do not like at all. One I do like--and I am sorry she is not \nstaying--is Lisa Jackson. Lisa Jackson was the Director appointed by \nPresident Obama to be the Director of the Environmental Protection \nAgency. I found one thing really curious about her. While she is very \nliberal philosophically, she does not lie. That is all I can really ask \nof people.\n  I can remember in this case, when they finally gave up--this is just \n2 years go. They finally gave up and said: We are not going to be able \nto pass any kind of a bill for cap and trade, but we are going to go to \nCopenhagen and tell them we are going to do it another way. If we \ncannot get a bill passed, we will do it through regulation.\n  To do it through regulation instead of legislation--this is kind of \nin the weeds--you have to have an endangerment finding. That is what \nthe law says. So Lisa Jackson was before our committee, and I asked her \na question. I said: Madam Administrator, tomorrow I am going to leave \nfor Copenhagen to be the one-man truth squad--because everybody has \nbeen over there lying to these other countries saying we are going to \npass something over here--and I have a feeling that once I leave town, \nyou are going to have an endangerment finding and do this through \nregulation. I could see her kind of smiling. I said: When you do that, \nthe regulation that you have is going to have to be based on science. \nThat is what the law says. What science are you going to use? Her \nanswer was: Well, we will use mostly the United Nations IPCC.\n  A lot of people do not realize--I wrote a whole book about this--this \nthing all started way back 12 years ago, and it was a thing by the \nUnited Nations. They formed the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change. They are the ones who came up with all this stuff. So \nshe said it is going to be on the IPCC.\n\n  Well, poetic justice. It could not have been done better if we had \nplanned it, because it was not weeks after that, it was days after \nthat, that what happened? Climategate. All of a sudden, they realized, \nthrough some leaked information, that the IPCC had been lying all those \nyears.\n  I will mention a couple things.\n  The UK Telegraph said it is the ``worst scientific scandal of our \ngeneration.''\n  Clive Crook of the Financial Times said: ``The stink of intellectual \ncorruption is overpowering.''\n  IPCC prominent physicist resigns because ``Climategate was a fraud on \na scale I have never seen.''\n  Further, another U.N. scientist bails. U.N. IPCC coordinating author \nDr. Phillip Lloyd calls out IPCC ``fraud.'' ``The result is not \nscientific.''\n  And the list goes on and on. Just stop and think about it. The UK \nTelegraph--one of the biggest publications in the UK--saying it is the \n``worst scientific scandal of our generation.''\n  So we now know that was the science they were going to use. I will \nalways be appreciative of Director Jackson for being totally honest in \nher response.\n  But we can guess that would be devastating and cripple the Nation and \nbankrupt our economy. We know what would happen. The contrast here is \nstark. On one hand, you have the President saying he wants to control \ncarbon for the sake of protecting our economy and, on the other hand, \nyou have the President's EPA embarking on a regulatory crusade that \npotentially would be devastating to our economy and America.\n  The President and the EPA have been working for 4 years to build a \ncase to justify the need for Federal regulation of hydraulic \nfracturing. A minute ago I listed all the things that were in his \nspeech that I think would be devastating to the economy. One is \nhydraulic fracturing. I will bet you, 5 years ago, if you said \nhydraulic fracturing, people's eyes would glass over and they would not \nknow what you were talking about. They all know now because hydraulic \nfracturing is a process that is used to get oil and gas out of tight \nformations. I know quite a bit about it because it all started in 1949 \nin my State of Oklahoma.\n  In 1949, in Duncan, OK, we discovered that you could unlock these \nreserves using hydraulic fracturing. So it is something that has been \nused that way for over a million--a million--applications, and the \nStates have been regulating it and doing so quite well. Everyone is \nsatisfied with the way it has been regulated.\n  There has never been a case--getting back to Lisa Jackson, I asked \nher a question in one of our committee hearings--and it was live with \nTV covering it--I said: Can you tell me and can you identify one case \nin a million--a million applications of hydraulic fracturing--one case \nwhere there has been groundwater contamination? She said she could not. \nSo there has never been a confirmed, documented case of groundwater \ncontamination because of hydraulic fracturing.\n  Because of these facts, the only reason for EPA regulation of \nhydraulic fracturing is to significantly limit, if not ban, its use. It \nwould kill the domestic oil and gas industry, which I believe, more \noften than not, that is exactly what they want.\n  Well, in closing, the President's remarks yesterday were not \nsurprising to me. But it did confirm the fact that this President is \nnot interested in pursuing an agenda that would help the growing \nsegments of the economy, such as the oil and gas industry.\n  People talk about our reliance upon the Middle East and people who \ncould become our enemies for oil and gas. All we have to do is produce \nour own, get the political obstacles out of the way, so we can be \ntotally independent.\n  I wish to mention two things President Obama has said. One, he says \nthat oil and gas production during his administration--his 4 years--has \nboomed. This is true, but not in the public sector. It has done so \nbecause of hydraulic fracturing, horizontal drilling, and all these \ntechnologies that have been very successful and have worked. He has \nmade the statement over and again that: Well, it would not do any good \nif we opened public lands for production because it would take 10 years \nbefore that would affect the supply and the cost of oil and gas.\n  Well, there is a guy whose name is Harold Hamm. Harold Hamm is \narguably the most successful independent oil man in America today. He \nis from Enid, OK. I called him because I was going to be on a very \nliberal TV show and knew they were going to ask this question. I called \nhim so I could document an answer. The statement they were going to \nmake was: Well, President Obama has said it would take 10 years for \nthat, for oil to reach the pumps if you opened public lands. How long \ndo you think it would take?\n  So I called Harold Hamm. I said: Harold, you have to be accurate in \nresponding to this question because I am going to use it on national TV \ntonight, and I am going to use your name. So I said: If you were to set \nup your rig in New Mexico and start drilling--you say: Go right now--\nhow long would it take for the first barrel you brought up to reach the \npumps? Without hesitating, he said 70 days--not 10 years, 70 days. Then \nhe went on and told me what would happen each day, how long it would \ntake to go through the refining process and reach the pumps.\n  So that is just one of the things that has been said over and over to \nmake people believe it is true.\n  Let me mention a couple of things in winding this down.\n  Richard Lindzen is from MIT. Richard Lindzen is probably the foremost \nauthority. No one has really questioned him in the past. His statement \nwas: Regulating CO2 is a bureaucrat's dream. If you regulate \nCO2, you regulate life.\n  That is exactly what it would be. Everyone would fall into that \nregulation.\n  Getting back to why--I do not want people to sit around and worry \nabout it--you are going to hear a lot of talk and the President is \ngoing to do all he can under regulations to try to do cap and trade. We \nfound out--it took extensive research--that the President, in his first \n4 years, has actually spent $68.4 billion on cap and trade, and that \nwas not authorized.\n  So he can do a lot of it through regulation, but it is not going to \npass. The reason it is not going to pass is, as we have stated, the \ncost would be extensive. And what would be accomplished--again, going \nback to when I asked a question of the Administrator of the EPA, Lisa \nJackson, in another\n\n[[Page S36]]\n\nhearing--I said, if we were to pass any of the regulations, any of the \nlegislation, the Waxman-Markey legislation or any of the rest of them, \nwould this reduce CO2 emissions worldwide? She said: No, it \nwould not. She said: Because the problem is not here in the United \nStates. The problem is in China, in India, in Mexico, and other places.\n  So you can carry that argument even further. If we were to do this in \njust the United States, if you were one of those who really believes \nthat CO2 emissions are causing all these problems--which I \ndo not agree with--but if you really believe that, it still would not \nreduce them. It would actually have the effect of increasing them \nbecause as we chase away our manufacturing base--because we cannot \ngenerate the electricity to sustain it--where do they go? They go to \ncountries such as China and India and Mexico and other countries where \nthey have little or no emissions regulations.\n  So with that, while it sounded real good yesterday in his speech, and \nI do have a great deal of respect for the President and his persuasive \nabilities, I want people to realize, those who are out there \nrecognizing that we can become independent in our energy development in \nthis country, that they are not going to be able to pass cap-and-trade \nany more now than they have failed to do so in the last 10 years.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/22/senate-section/article/S36-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S36-S38]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HURRICANE SANDY\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I came to the floor this afternoon to \nspeak briefly about Hurricane Sandy and what the Senate and the House \ncould and should be doing to help the survivors of this catastrophic \ndisaster that occurred now over 3 months ago on the northeast coast. We \nfrom Louisiana are very familiar, unfortunately, with disasters. We \nhave had quite a number over the past several years. Unfortunately, I \nhave become an expert on disasters. I don't want to be, but I am \nbecoming one as chair of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee and as a leader from Louisiana. All of us, whether we are \nschool board members, city council members, mayors, parish officials or \nGovernors from Louisiana, are becoming experts on disasters because we \nare having a lot of them.\n  So I came to the floor to say just a few things this afternoon about \nHurricane Sandy. First, I wish to begin by saying the people of the \nNortheast--and they don't need me to tell them this--have a wonderfully \nstrong delegation in the Senate, Senators Schumer, Gillibrand, \nMenendez, and Lautenberg. Of course, in Maryland--though we don't hear \nmuch about Maryland, there were one or two small counties that were \nterribly affected in Maryland--and Senator Cardin and Senator Mikulski \nhave been, day in and day out, working with me and with many others, of \ncourse, trying to fashion a robust and smart response to the disaster \non the East Coast.\n  We want it to be smart because the taxpayers don't want to waste \nmoney on things that don't work. Of course, the survivors want it to be \nsmart because they need us to do our best work now. We can't be late \nand sloppy and bureaucratic. They have churches to rebuild and faith-\nbased organizations to get back up and running. There are schools and \nlibraries and, most importantly, of course, their homes and their \nbusinesses. So this is very important work.\n  It has been difficult because there are many different philosophies \nabout how to tackle this. I have made my positions fairly clear on \ncertain aspects such as offsets, et cetera. But today I wanted to come \nto the floor to just acknowledge the extraordinary work of the \ndelegation--led in large measure by Senator Schumer--of Members who \nhave been absolutely rolling up their sleeves at every meeting and \ntrying to build bipartisan support, which we have to do in the Senate. \nThe House can sometimes get away with sending things over here with \nonly the Republicans voting for it and no Democrats, but over here we \ncan't get anything done unless it is done with all of us together. It \nis just a different set of rules in the Senate, so we have had to work \nvery hard.\n  Senators Schumer and Gillibrand and other Members worked very hard to \nget together the necessary votes to get that $60 billion out of here a \ncouple weeks ago. The House, of course, unfortunately, stripped away \nsome provisions but, happily--happily--they left some of the best \nreforms we have been able to think of in the last 4 or 5 years in the \nbill, and that is what I wish to talk about today.\n  I am a big believer in sending aid to the people in America who need \nit. We send a lot of aid overseas, and we will sure send a lot of aid \nwhen we rebuild Afghanistan and Iraq, but I am a real big believer in \nsending aid to our own taxpayers when their homes are flooded or \ntornadoes have taken out their area or fires have raged out of control \nor major storms have hit their area. I am a big believer that when \npeople pay taxes all their life--middle-class families as well as the \npoor and the working poor, as well as the wealthy, who pay a lot of \ntaxes--they deserve their government to respond when they are at a very \ndark moment. That is what is happening on the east coast, and these \nconstituents and citizens of ours could not get this help. They need it \nmore quickly.\n  We are moving as fast as we can--not fast enough for this Senator, \nbut hopefully we can get this vote and this bill to the President's \ndesk. I know President Obama will be happy to sign this and is eager to \nsign it. I wish to also say thank you to President Obama for his strong \nsupport of a robust supplemental and to say how proud I am to have \nworked with his Cabinet, many of whom are involved in this recovery, \nand particularly the Secretary of HUD, who is probably one of the most \nable leaders. All the Cabinet members are very able, but the Secretary \nof HUD is particularly knowledgeable about rebuilding in a more \ncoordinated fashion because he actually got to practice on us down in \nthe gulf coast. We were kind of like the guinea pigs. Hopefully, we \nhave worked out a lot of the problems and we can take all the best \npractices and lessons learned.\n  But Shaun Donovan will do a great job leading that effort on the east \ncoast, I have no doubt, with both a very strong Democratic Governor and \na very strong Republican Governor--Governor Christie and Governor Cuomo \nin that area--along with Mayor Bloomberg and Mayor Cory Booker and so \nmany other small-town officials involved in the recovery. They will \nhave a great friend and a knowledgeable and reliable partner in \nSecretary of HUD Shaun Donovan.\n\n  But let me go into just a few things we were able to redesign, \nthinking that our citizens and our constituents want government to be \nleaner. They want government, most importantly, to be smarter and more \nefficient, and I could not agree more. We have tried, at least in the \ndisaster recovery--when the response to Katrina and Rita was such a \ndisaster itself--to reshape some of this and make it better and \nsmarter. So we put some very effective and smartly designed programs \ninto the Sandy supplemental.\n  I want to begin by thanking my friend and colleague from the State of \nMississippi, Senator Cochran, who joined me in introducing the Disaster \nRecovery Act in 2011 that contained many of these reforms. Our States \nhave endured the same series of disasters and bureaucratic roadblocks \nto recovery over the past eight years, and we are determined to prevent \ncommunities in the northeast from experiencing the same inefficiency \nand waste. His contributions to the Gulf Coast's recovery and the \ndevelopment of this legislation have been tremendous, and I am grateful \nfor his partnership in this endeavor.\n  I also wish to thank my House colleagues, particularly Congressman \nShuster, Congressman Rahall, Congressman Denham, Delegate Holmes-\nNorton, Congressman Mica, who is the outgoing chair of the committee \nover there and was so instrumental in helping to fashion some of this, \nCongresswoman Slaughter, Congresswoman Lowey, Congressman Alexander and \nCongressman Richmond. In particular,\n\n[[Page S37]]\n\nCedric Richmond, who is from Louisiana and a dear friend, along with \nCongressman Alexander, from my home State, were very instrumental in \nhelping their colleagues--one is a Republican, one is a Democrat--kind \nof understand why it is important to have these reforms stay in the \nbill, and they were successful. I am very grateful to them for that.\n  One of the things from the several lists of things that were in this \nbill--and that I want to put into the Record--I will just go over and \nhighlight briefly.\n  No. 1, in the Sandy supplemental, it will reauthorize two expired \npilot programs from the post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act \nthat allowed FEMA to repair rental units as a cost-effective temporary \nhousing alternative to trailers and mobile homes and to utilize \nexpedited debris removal procedures.\n  This might not seem very interesting to people, unless you and your \nfamily are looking at living in an 8-by-16 or 8-by-24 trailer for the \nnext 6 months. Then you are very interested. In the old days, when \nKatrina happened, all people were given were trailers and, in some \ninstances, with formaldehyde in them, which made for a lovely and very \nhealthy way to live for 6 months. We don't want to go over the \nnightmares of what happened after Katrina and Rita, but we decided we \nhad to give our citizens some other options besides trailers. So if \nsomething would happen in Massachusetts, Madam President, your Governor \nand your local officials could come together and maybe be a little bit \ncreative in thinking about some rental repairs, where maybe people \ncould move into some of the blighted properties. That would also help \nwith the blight. Instead of spending $120,000 per trailer, maybe we \ncould do a little investing in some blight reduction and, at the same \ntime, giving people a temporary place to live. So that is smart. I \nthink taxpayers appreciate it when we try to spend their money in a \nwiser, built-to-last kind of way. That is what the Sandy supplemental \nallows.\n  It also allows the State to draw down a portion of its hazard \nmitigation funds from FEMA in order to leverage mitigation \nopportunities earlier in the reconstruction process. In the old days, \nit would take 18 to 36 months for funding to become available, in some \ninstances, to rebuild a school. That is too long. Can you imagine a \ncommunity going 3 years without even getting their school started?\n  I realize sometimes it takes a long time to build things, but you \ndon't want to wait 3 years before you start. So the way we do it now, \nwithout spending any more money, is just allowing the Federal \nGovernment to push out some of the front money to the locals so they \ncan get started on mitigation projects much sooner. So that is a very \nsmart reform that is included.\n  In addition, we also provide grants on the basis of reliable fixed \nestimates for rebuilding damaged infrastructure and facilities and \nexpedited removal of storm debris. This approach will be faster, \ncheaper, and more effective. The Public assistance program as currently \ndesigned may be one of the most dysfunctional programs in the entire \nFederal Government and will not work for this disaster. Under the \ncurrent approach, initial damage estimates are often incomplete. \nProjects must be reversioned multiple times. Decisions are often not \nmade in writing. Frequent staff turnover leads to decision reversals. \nHundreds of meetings result in incalculable administrative waste. And \nit can take years for even a small project to be completed. And let me \njust put this in English.\n  What this means is in the old days when Katrina hit--and people are \nnot going to believe it when I say this, but it is true, and I will put \nthis in the Record so people can go find it. But in the old days we \nwould have to take measurements and pictures of a tree to determine how \nwide the branch was because if it was more than 3 inches you got \nreimbursed, and if it was less than that you didn't. We would have to \ngo take pictures of trees where the debris came down to try to get the \npaperwork necessary for the reimbursement. Those days are hopefully \nover with.\n  We will now do kind of an estimate just like any normal, rational \nperson would do. You know from past storms how much debris is usually \nthere. You could sort of measure that. There are ways--not just \nsubjective but objective, like geospatial modeling, without having to \ntake pictures of limbs on trees and measure them individually--which is \na complete waste of time and wholly irrational and, of course, \nsurvivors who are standing there without a house are wondering why \ngovernment officials are going around taking pictures of shrubs. So we \nneed to move past that. Hopefully, we will with some of this \nlegislation.\n  No. 4 codifies temporary legislative measures that were enacted to \nfacilitate smarter recovery, including third-party arbitration, \neliminating penalties on alternate projects, and consolidating \nfacilities into a single project. This was my most important thing, and \nI would like to take a minute to explain it to everyone.\n  A while after Katrina, which was a nightmare, I kept wondering why \nthese project worksheets were never getting settled. We would send \nthousands of these worksheets to the Federal Government and say: This \nwas our library. We estimate it will cost $5 million to rebuild it.\n  The Federal Government would say: No, we think it is $2.5 million. \nThat is all we owe you.\n  So I said: I can understand there could be a disagreement. Who \nresolves it? No one. What do you mean, no one? No one. It just keeps \ngoing around and around, and we just keep sending paper back.\n  I said: Is there any timeline for the resolution? No. I said: Is \nthere any third-party arbitrator? No. So we put in a third-party \narbitrator so that if a project is disagreed to by the locals about \nwhat was there, what it looked like, how they should rebuild it, we now \nhave a rational way to step in and get a decision, and it is \nnonnegotiable. You can't appeal it. But it is better than not having a \ndecision. The local governments really support this, and I am happy we \ncould get that done.\n  In addition--this was one of my favorites--everyone would run around \ngiving press conferences about how we were going to build smarter and \nstronger and better, et cetera. Except when we looked into the law and \nactually read the law, it was illegal. If you tried to move a police \nstation like 10 feet to get it out of the way of the river, or the land \nhad sunk and you wanted to move it to higher ground, you would actually \nbe penalized 25 percent because it became an alternate project since it \nwasn't exactly the same. So I said: We don't want to build the exact \nsame thing. That was the problem to begin with. Some of our buildings \nwere in places they shouldn't have been. Some of our buildings were \nbuilt with materials we should never have used. So why are we having to \nrebuild the same old thing?\n  Well, that was because that was what the law said. I said: Well, the \nlaw needs to be changed, and we are changing it.\n  So I hope people, while they fuss at government--and I know we have a \nlot to do to get things straight--know a lot of thought has gone into \nsome of these reforms, and they are based on real-life experiences on \nwhat communities have gone through. Hopefully, the Northeast will \nbenefit from this as we go forward.\n  Let me just put a few more things in the Record. No. 5 allows \nfamilies to use FEMA individual assistance for childcare expenses.\n  Here is another thing we found. We do depend on individual citizens \nto rebuild their communities. Trust me. The Federal Government may send \na lot of money, but they didn't gut houses. Do you know who gutted \nhouses? The churches helped, the volunteers helped, and seniors. Many \nveterans who had fought the war in the ``greatest generation,'' they, \nat 80 years old, put on gloves and overalls and gutted their own \nhouses.\n  I mean take your house down to the studs. It is a hard thing to do. \nNot only is it physically hard, it is emotionally devastating. The \nFederal Government did not come in and gut people's houses. We had to \ngut our houses by ourselves.\n  After we sorted our debris by EPA requirements and dragged it out to \nthe sidewalk and made sure it didn't touch a part of the lawn--because \nif it did, they couldn't pick it up because they can't go on private \nproperty to pick up debris. It is a nightmare. But this is going to be \nalleviated because parents and grandparents need to get back to gut \ntheir homes. They have to have a\n\n[[Page S38]]\n\nplace for their kids to go that is safe. You can't have children \nrunning around in dangerous places. So people aren't thinking about \nthis in a recovery, but schools have to be up and running, and you \nreally should be able to use some of this money for daycare so the \nparents can work. Some of them quit their jobs to rebuild their homes. \nThey lived off their savings and they went back to work. It is a tough \nsituation.\n  But I am happy, and I want to thank Mark Shriver, Save the Children, \nand the National Commission on Children and Disasters who led this \ninitiative trying to help us focus on the storms of the future, what we \ncould do better to help children to make sure their needs are cared \nfor. We think about adults, but, of course, most of these families have \nkids, sometimes young children. So we have done a little bit. I wish we \ncould have done more, but we negotiated the best we could, and at least \nwe got the childcare provision in.\n  It reduces bureaucratic waste by eliminating duplicative agency \nreviews for the same project and the same set of laws governing \nenvironmental, historic preservation, and benefit-cost requirements. It \nalso helps the environment by incentivizing recycling of debris. So if \nwe can find a way to recycle it, then people get paid a little bit more \nas opposed to just throwing it in the landfills. We think that will be \na good opportunity to try to promote some good technologies for \nrecycling. And--this is very important--it also corrects a gap in \ncurrent law that prohibited tribal governments from requesting Federal \nassistance. They were completely prohibited under the former law. \nReally, as a matter of fair policy and the Federal law, tribes should \nbe able to request some assistance as well, and that was corrected in \nthis piece of legislation.\n  It also, finally, eliminates a perverse incentive in the law to use \nhigh-priced contract labor for emergency work instead of local \ngovernment employees, such as firefighters and police officers, which \nshould save the Federal Government millions of dollars.\n  In closing, I want to thank all of the different organizations that \nhelped to pass this: the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National League \nof Cities, the National Association of County Organizations, \nInternational Association of Emergency Managers, International \nAssociation of Firefighters, International Association of Fire Chiefs, \nand the Association of State Floodplain Managers.\n  This is not a subject that is always fun to talk about because when \nyou are talking about it, it is a lot of suffering that is going on, \nwhether it is Joplin, MO, or Gulfport, MS, or New Orleans, LA, or New \nYork, NY, or the boardwalk in New Jersey. And many of those not-so-\nsmall beach communities are very highly populated. There is a lot of \nsuffering. But it is important for us to try, when we can, when we see \nthat the response is not what it should be, to take the time to push \nout some reforms, to fix what we can fix so that the $60 billion that I \nhope we will send to them can be used smartly, quickly, and \nefficiently.\n  I am living proof of a Senator who has had to literally help lead the \nrebuilding of the gulf coast, along with my friends from Texas, \nMississippi, Alabama, and Florida. My hometown is New Orleans. My \nbrother is now the mayor, and he is rebuilding that city every day. \nEighty percent of the residential communities on the east bank were \ndestroyed completely. That would be like 80 percent of the District of \nColumbia but not Anacostia, but 80 percent--which would be the whole \nother side of DC on this side of the river--being uninhabitable. It is \nhard for people to get their head around that scale. I think \nMassachusetts has experienced some of these storms. But the scale and \nscope of the loss is just hard to get your head around. Even though it \nis not on the 5 o'clock news or the 6 o'clock news or 10 o'clock news \nor now 24-hour news, it is still happening. So this money and these \nreforms are important.\n  So I hope the Senate will act quickly this week. We may have to take \nup a few amendments from the minority. We have already had the debate \nabout offsets, and we have decided that in the middle of the battle we \ndon't have to argue about who is going to pay for the bullets. We need \nto go ahead and send the money, and we will figure out how to pay for \nit later. We are going to pay for it. It is not a question of whether \nit is going to be repaid. It will be paid for. We should not be arguing \nabout that while the water is rising or while people are gutting their \nhomes or worshiping in tents along the beach. They need their churches \nback, they need their communities back, and we need to send them money \nand the smarter tools to help them with the recovery.\n  So I again thank so many colleagues for helping with this, \nparticularly Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins, who led a lot of \nthese efforts through their leadership of the Homeland Security \nCommittee and spent a significant amount of time along with their staff \nreviewing and helping to improve this legislation, as well as my \ncolleagues on the Appropriations Committee on Homeland Security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/22/senate-section/article/S38-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S38]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSIONS OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

INOUYE\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I deeply miss my friend Danny Inouye.\n  Danny Inouye's passing leaves a huge void in the Senate and for me \npersonally, as I have lost a dear friend, and now being the sole U.S. \nSenator to have served in World War II is a lonesome post--especially \nafter losing the presence of a Medal of Honor winner.\n  Danny was not only a great Senator for his constituents, but also the \nmost popular among his Senate colleagues. He exemplified what it means \nto serve and represented the very best qualities of our country. \nWhether in the Army or as Hawaii's representative in Washington since \nthe State's birth, he worked tirelessly to do right by every Hawaiian \nand every American.\n  Danny volunteered to serve in the Army's 442nd Regimental Combat \nTeam, which was almost entirely made up of Nisei, or people of Japanese \ndescent born in the United States. Although its members faced \ndiscrimination at home and many of their families were in internment \ncamps, the 442nd is widely acknowledged as the most decorated infantry \nunit in the history of the U.S. Army. All of us who served admired the \ncourage and heroism Danny displayed on the battlefield especially in \nSan Terenzo, Italy when 4 days before the war's end, he lost his arm in \nbattle, earning a Purple Heart.\n  When Danny first joined the Senate in 1962, World War II veterans \nwere common in our chamber and, over the past five decades, the \nSenators who served in World War II have shared a bond that overcame \npartisan politics. But I am now the last of that group and I will \ncontinue to look to Danny's example to bring colleagues together to do \nwhat is right for all Americans.\n  Danny and I partnered together time and time again on the \nAppropriations Committee to write legislation that has made America \nsafer and healthier for our families. I will always be especially \nthankful for his help in crafting relief bills for New Jersey in our \ntimes of need after Hurricane Irene and Superstorm Sandy. In fact, his \nlast piece of legislation in the Senate was one to provide relief to \nthose affected by Sandy.\n\n[[Page S39]]\n\n  But perhaps Danny's defining quality was this--in a time and \nprofession that increasingly rewards grandstanding and grasping for the \nspotlight, Danny served with intelligence, grace and humility. And \nwhile he was always a humble and quiet leader, when Danny spoke other \nSenators listened closely and took his words to heart. His voice never \nwavered when it came to advocating for an America that leaves no one \nbehind.\n  He was a giant in the Senate, and we will never forget the legacy he \nleaves behind. As the last World War II veteran in the Senate, I \npromise to always do whatever I can to uphold his commitment to service \nand love of country.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues in \nremembering our friend and colleague Senator Daniel Inouye. Dan Inouye \ndedicated his life to Hawaii and represented Hawaii from when it \nachieved statehood until his death.\n  Senator Inouye was respected and loved by members of both parties and \nboth chambers. He was the last Senator to serve with both Everett \nDirksen and Richard Russell. Senator Inouye learned early the \nimportance of doing something for the good of the Nation and the good \nof the Senate, as well as the importance of personal relationships and \ntrust among colleagues. For Dan Inouye, his word was his bond and that \napplied to Democrats and Republicans alike. He became the chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee, the Senate President Pro-Tempore, was the \nsecond longest serving Senator in history and served on special \ncommittees investigating the Watergate and Iran Contra scandals. At the \ntime of his death, he had long become a Senate giant in his own right.\n  Long before reaching the Senate, Dan Inouye was an American hero. \nEnlisting in the Army after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, he served in \nEurope earning a Bronze Star, Purple Heart and Distinguished Service \nCross for helping his fellow soldiers while suffering terrible \ninjuries. Later in life, President Clinton would confer upon him the \nMedal of Honor.\n  His moral character and life experiences made Senator Inouye a leader \non many of the pressing issues of the day from civil rights to veterans \nbenefits and from health care to helping people with disabilities. \nThrough his position on the Appropriations Committee, Senator Inouye \nwas able to direct funding to important projects and research that \nhelped bring about important advancements as well as simply help \npeople.\n  Dan Inouye was also a strong supporter of Israel and the Jewish \ncommunity. From his advocacy on behalf of Holocaust survivors, to his \nefforts to help free Jews from the former Soviet Union to his \ninfluential role in securing funding for Israel, Senator Inouye was a \ntireless friend and advocate. He was given the nickname ``Trumpeldor'' \nafter a Zionist hero, Joseph Trumpeldor.\n  In closing, I am reminded of a quote used to eulogize Daniel Webster \nthat President Nixon used when eulogizing Everett Dirksen, ``Our great \nmen are the common property of the country.'' Senator Inouye was indeed \na great man and our country is better off today for his commitment, his \nconscience and his years of dedicated service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/22/senate-section/article/S39-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S39]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/22/senate-section/article/S39-2", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S39]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/22/senate-section/article/S39-3", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S39]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING RECESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 3, 2013, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on January 4, 2013, during the recess of \nthe Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker had signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 41.

A bill to provide anti-retaliation protections for antitrust \nwhistleblowers; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to once again join with \nSenator Grassley and today introduce the Criminal Antitrust Anti-\nRetaliation Act. This legislation, which is identical to our \nlegislation from last Congress, will provide important protections to \nemployees who come forward and disclose to law enforcement price fixing \nand other criminal antitrust behavior that harm consumers. This \nlegislation is a continuation of the long partnership that I have had \nwith Senator Grassley on whistleblower issues.\n  Congress should encourage employees with information about criminal \nantitrust activity, such as price fixing, to report that information by \noffering meaningful protection to those who blow the whistle rather \nthan leaving them vulnerable to reprisals. Throughout our history, \nwhistleblowers have been instrumental in alerting the public, Congress, \nand law enforcement to wrongdoing in a variety of areas. These \nindividuals take risks in stepping forward, and many times their \nactions result in important reforms and have even saved lives.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is based on recommendations \nfrom the Government Accountability Office, which interviewed key \nstakeholders in the antitrust community and found widespread support \nfor anti-retaliatory protection in criminal antitrust cases. The \nprovisions in this bill are modeled on the whistleblower protections \nthat Senator Grassley and I authored as part of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, \nand are narrowly tailored to ensure that whistleblowers are not \nprovided with an economic incentive to bring forth false claims.\n  The antitrust laws protect consumers and serve to promote our free \nenterprise system. Our bipartisan bill will help to ensure that \ncriminal violations of these laws do not go unreported. I urge the \nSenate to act quickly to pass this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 64\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act of 1994; \nread the first time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on the first day for bill introductions \nthis year I once again join with Senator Crapo and a distinguished, \nbipartisan group of Senators to introduce the Violence Against Women \nReauthorization Act of 2013. This life-saving legislation should be a \ntop priority of the new 113th Congress. It is our hope that the Senate \nwill act quickly to pass this strong, bipartisan bill to help all \nvictims of domestic and sexual violence.\n  The Senate acted just 9 months ago to approve the Leahy-Crapo \nViolence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2012 with 68 bipartisan \nvotes. Despite our best efforts, the House did not join in our \nbipartisan efforts and enact that bill into law.\n  By now, the litany of VAWA's successes is familiar, but important. \nSince this historic legislation first passed in 1994, States have \nstrengthened criminal rape statutes, and every State has made stalking \na crime. The annual incidence of domestic violence has dropped more \nthan 50 percent. We have helped to provide victims with critical \nservices like housing and legal protection. Those are just a few \nhighlights. We need to remember that behind those numbers are thousands \nof lives made immeasurably better.\n  Despite VAWA's success, there is a pressing need to update and \nstrengthen its protections. The Center for Disease Control and \nPrevention's 2010 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey \nfound that one in four women has been the victim of severe physical \ndomestic violence and one in five women has been raped in her lifetime. \nThese numbers are almost too awful to contemplate.\n  Real life cases remind us that this reauthorization is long overdue. \nLast month, I read in the Burlington Free Press the story of Carmen \nTarleton, a woman from Thetford, VT. Five years ago, Carmen's estranged \nhusband broke into her home, beat her with a baseball bat, and poured \nindustrial-strength lye on her, severely burning a great deal of her \nbody and nearly blinding her. Her doctors said that she had suffered \n``the most horrific injury a human being could suffer.'' Today, she is \nnearly blind, disfigured, and continues to experience pain from her \ninjuries. Despite this, Carmen is courageously sharing her story.\n  Stories like this one remind us that every day that we do not pass \nlegislation that will help to prevent horrific violence and assist \nvictims, more people are suffering. Late last year while Congress \nfailed to act on our bipartisan bill, we saw tragic domestic violence-\nrelated murder-suicides in Missouri and Colorado. We also learned of \nharrowing new accounts of sexual assaults on college campuses. These \nare just more examples of the kind of tragedies that unfold every day \nacross the country.\n  The Leahy-Crapo bill would support the use of techniques proven to \nhelp identify high-risk cases and prevent domestic violence homicides. \nIt would increase VAWA's focus on sexual assault and push colleges to \nstrengthen their efforts to protect students from domestic and sexual \nviolence.\n  This reauthorization will allow us to make real progress in \naddressing the horrifying epidemic of domestic violence in tribal \ncommunities, where one recent study found that almost three in five \nnative women have been assaulted by their spouses or intimate partners. \nIt will allow services to get to those in the LGBT community who have \nhad trouble accessing services in the past.\n  Every VAWA reauthorization Congress has passed has taken steps to \nhelp immigrant victims of violence, who are often particularly \nvulnerable. Last year's bill included a modest increase in the number \nof U visas available to immigrant victims who help law enforcement, \nwhich is good for victims and for law enforcement. Unfortunately, that \nprovision led to a technical objection from House Republican leaders. \nIn the interest of making quick and decisive progress, we introduce the \nbill today without that provision in order to remove any excuse for \nHouse inaction. We have retained other important improvements for \nimmigrant victims in the bill we introduce today as part of our \ncommitment to ensuring that all victims are protected.\n  I still believe strongly in the U visa increase that was in last \nyear's Leahy-Crapo bill. I authored that provision after hearing from \nlaw enforcement and the experts in the field. I think it is needed to \nencourage assistance to law enforcement and to protect immigrant women \nand I remain committed to enacting it and ensuring that the\n\n[[Page S158]]\n\nneeded U visa increase is adopted. I intend to work to include it in \ncomprehensive immigration reform legislation that we should consider \nearly in this Congress. It will be part of our immigration reform \neffort.\n  We have included, as well, in this year's bill the specific \nprovisions of the SAFER bill that I worked out with Senator Cornyn and \nSenator Grassley last year and that then passed the Senate unanimously \nlate in the session. I hope that Senators who opposed VAWA last year \nwhile supporting those provisions will now join with us in our effort \nto enact VAWA reauthorization that includes those provisions, as well.\n  All of the provisions in our bill were developed with the help of \nvictims and with those who assist them every day. They are common sense \nmeasures that will help real people. It is past time for Congress to \nmove beyond partisan politics in order to provide help to victims of \ndomestic and sexual violence.\n  We can make these concrete and important changes in the law that will \nprevent terrible violence and provide more help to victims. There is no \nexcuse for delay. I hope all Senators will join me in quickly moving \nthis bill through the Senate and that the House will quickly work with \nus to get a strong VAWA bill to the President.\n  I thank Senator Crapo, the lead Senate Republican cosponsor of our \nbill and Senators Murkowski, Mikulski, Ayotte, Collins, Coons, Durbin, \nBennet, Klobuchar, Shaheen, Kirk, Cantwell, Murray, Udall (CO), Casey, \nand McCaskill, who join us as original cosponsors and have all been \nstrong supporters of VAWA. I look forward to many others joining us to \nmove forward on this vital legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record as follows:\n\n                                 S. 47\n\n     To reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act of 1994.\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to increase public safety by punishing and deterring \nfirearms trafficking; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation directed \nat combating the practice of straw purchasing and illegal trafficking \nin firearms. I thank the law enforcement partners who have contributed \nideas and Senator Durbin for joining me in this effort. I hope that as \nSenators become familiar with the proposal, they will see it as a \nfocused approach to provide law enforcement officials with the tools \nthey need to go after those who engage in the illegal trafficking. This \ncommonsense measure deserves the bipartisan support that will be \ncritical to any effort in the Senate to reduce gun violence in America.\n  I have heard again and again from Senators on both sides of the aisle \nthat keeping guns away from those who should not have them is a goal \nworth pursuing. This bill will further that effort. When the President \nspoke last week about the need for legislative action in the wake of \nthe horrific events at Sandy Hook Elementary School, strengthening our \nlaw enforcement efforts against illegal gun trafficking was one of the \nkey issues he proposed. This bill will answer that call to action.\n  Next week, the Senate Judiciary Committee will hold the first hearing \nof the 113th Congress on the issue of gun violence. I expect that part \nof that discussion will include examining various legislative proposals \nSenators have put forward. We need to move beyond platitudes and toward \nsolutions. It is my hope that as the Committee proceeds we can find \nareas of common ground.\n  There is now broad recognition that the Second Amendment guarantees \nthe individual right to own a firearm, and that self protection is an \nessential part of that right. To the extent there used to be a backdrop \nof uncertainty about the meaning of the Second Amendment, that time is \npast. I have long believed that the right to bear arms for protection \nis a fundamental right. The Supreme Court has now confirmed the \nindividual right guaranteed by the Second Amendment. That is no longer \nquestioned. So we can proceed now in this discussion with certainty \nthat Americans' constitutional rights will be preserved while we seek \nsolutions to prevent gun violence.\n  There is broad agreement that keeping guns away from those suffering \nfrom mental illness and criminals is the right thing to do. I am a \nresponsible gun owner. I know that other responsible gun owners will \nsupport better enforcement of the laws that exist to keep guns out of \nthe hands of criminals and the mentally ill. We cannot allow those who \nare barred from buying guns to circumvent our laws. That is just common \nsense.\n  Law enforcement officials have complained for years that they lack \nthe legal tools necessary to effectively combat illegal firearms \ntrafficking. Congressional inquiry during the last Congress should have \nput a spotlight on the very difficult legal environment within which \nlaw enforcement officials currently operate. In fact, one of the \nwhistleblowers who testified about the misguided tactics used by \nFederal law enforcement in firearms trafficking investigations in \nArizona described the current laws as ``toothless''. If we are to \naddress gun violence, we must respond to this clear vulnerability.\n  The Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act will make important \nchanges to Federal firearms statutes to give law enforcement officials \nthe tools they need to investigate and prosecute the all-too-common \npractice of straw purchasing and illegal trafficking of firearms. This \npractice typically involves a person who is not prohibited by Federal \nlaw purchasing a firearm on behalf of a prohibited person, or at the \ndirection of a drug trafficking or other criminal organization. It is a \nproblem that must be addressed. It not only results in the support of \nlarger criminal organizations, but also in the proliferation of illegal \nfirearms and gun violence in our communities. It puts both law \nenforcement officials and law abiding firearms dealers in a very \ndifficult position but more importantly, this makes our citizens and \ncommunities less safe.\n  Under current law, there is no specific statute that makes it illegal \nto act as a straw purchaser of firearms. Nor is there a law directly on \npoint to address the illegal trafficking of firearms. As a result, \nprosecutors must cobble together charges against a straw purchaser \nusing so-called ``paperwork'' violations such as lying on a Federal \nform. These laws are imperfect, and do not give prosecutors the \nleverage needed to encourage straw buyers, often the lowest rungs on a \nladder in a criminal enterprise, to provide the information needed for \ninvestigators and prosecutors to go after those directing and profiting \nfrom such activity.\n  The bill I introduce today will add a new provision to our Federal \ncriminal code to specifically prohibit serving as a straw purchaser of \nfirearms, and establishes tough penalties for those who purchase \nfirearms for, on behalf of, or with the intent to transfer the firearms \nto someone prohibited from making that purchase directly. Under current \nlaw, it is a crime to transfer a firearm to another with the knowledge \nthat the firearm will be used in criminal activity. This bill would \nstrengthen this existing law by prohibiting such a transfer where the \ntransferor has ``reasonable cause to believe'' that the firearm will be \nused in relation to criminal activity. The bill does contain important \nexemptions from the prohibition, namely, the transfer of a firearm as a \ngift, or in relation to a legitimate raffle, auction or contest.\n  This bill will complement existing law that makes it a crime to \nsmuggle firearms into the United States by specifically prohibiting the \nsmuggling of firearms out of the United States.\n  The provisions laid out in this legislation are focused, commonsense \nremedies to the very real problem of firearms trafficking and straw \npurchasing. The bill does not affect Federal firearms licensees, and in \nno way alters their rights and responsibilities as sellers of a lawful \ncommodity.\n  As the Senate seeks a way forward to find national solutions to \nreduce gun violence, I hope Senators from across the political spectrum \ncan work together to find common ground. We have a responsibility and a \nduty to refine our laws consistent with the rights guaranteed by the \nSecond Amendment. As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, a Senator, a \nVermonter, an American, a father and a grandfather, I am prepared to \nhear all ideas, listen to all views, and work with Senators from both \nsides of the aisle. The bill I introduce today is the first of several \nproposals I expect to support to reduce gun violence. I look forward to \ndiscussing it further with fellow Senators and witnesses at the \nupcoming hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/22/senate-section/article/S180-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1.

Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, Members of \n     Congress, all who are present, and to all who are watching, \n     welcome to the Capitol and to this celebration of our great \n     democracy. This is the 57th inauguration of an American \n     President, and no matter how many times one witnesses this \n     event, its simplicity, its innate majesty, and most of all \n     its meaning, that sacred, yet cautious, entrusting of power \n     from we, the people, to our chosen leader, never fails to \n     make one's heart beat faster as it will today with the \n     inauguration of President Barack H. Obama.\n       We know we would not be here today were it not for those \n     who stand guard around the world to preserve our freedom. To \n     those in our Armed Forces, we offer our infinite thanks for \n     your bravery, your honor, your sacrifice.\n       (Applause.)\n       This democracy of ours was forged by intellect and \n     argument, by activism and blood, and above all, from John \n     Adams to Elizabeth Cady Stanton, to Martin Luther King, Jr., \n     by a stubborn adherence to the notion that we are all created \n     equal and deserve nothing less than a great Republic worthy \n     of our consent.\n       The theme of this year's inaugural is ``Faith in America's \n     Future.'' The perfect embodiment of this unshakable \n     confidence and the ongoing success of our collective journey \n     is an event from our past. I speak of the improbable \n     completion of the Capitol dome and capping it with the Statue \n     of Freedom which occurred 150 years ago in 1863.\n       When Abraham Lincoln took office 2 years earlier, the dome \n     above us was a half-built eyesore. The conventional wisdom \n     was it should be left unfinished until the war ended, given \n     the travails and financial needs of the times. But to \n     President Lincoln, the half-finished dome symbolized the \n     half-divided Nation. Lincoln said: If people see the Capitol \n     going on, it is a sign we intend the Union shall go on. So \n     despite the conflict which engulfed the Nation and surrounded \n     the city, the dome continued to rise.\n       On December 2, 1863, the Statue of Freedom, a woman, was \n     placed atop the dome, where she still stands. In a sublime \n     irony, it was a former slave, now free American, Philip Reid, \n     who helped to cast the bronze statue.\n       Our present times are not as perilous or despairing as they \n     were in 1863, but in 2013 far too many doubt the future of \n     this great Nation and our ability to tackle our own era's \n     half-finished domes.\n       Today's problems are intractable, they say; the times are \n     so complex, the differences in the country and the world so \n     deep we will never overcome them. When thoughts such as these \n     produce anxiety, fear, and even despair, we do well to \n     remember Americans have always been, and still are, a \n     practical, optimistic, problem-solving people; that, as our \n     history shows, no matter how steep the climb, how difficult \n     the problems, how half-finished the task, America always \n     rises to the occasion. America prevails and America prospers.\n       (Applause.)\n       Those who bet against this country have inevitably been on \n     the wrong side of history. So it is a good moment to gaze \n     upward and behold the Statue of Freedom at the top of the \n     Capitol dome. It is a good moment to gain strength and \n     courage and humility from those who were determined to \n     complete the half-finished dome. It is a good moment to \n     rejoice at this 57th Presidential inaugural ceremony, and it \n     is the perfect moment to renew our collective faith in the \n     future of America.\n       (Applause.)\n       Thank you and God bless these United States.\n       In that spirit of faith, I would now like to introduce \n     civil rights leader Myrlie Evers, who has committed her life \n     to extending the promise of our Nation's founding principles \n     to all Americans.\n       Mrs. Evers will lead us in the invocation.\n       Mrs. EVERS. America, we are here, our Nation's Capitol, on \n     this day, January the 21st, 2013, the inauguration of our \n     45th President, Barack Obama. We come at this time to ask \n     blessings upon our leaders, the President, Vice President, \n     Members of Congress, all elected and appointed officials of \n     the United States of America.\n       We are here to ask blessings upon our Armed Forces, \n     blessings upon all who contribute to the essence of the \n     American spirit, the American dream, the opportunity to \n     become whatever our mankind, womankind allows us to be. This \n     is the promise of America.\n       As we sing the words of belief, ``This is my country,'' let \n     us act upon the meaning everyone is included. May the \n     inherent dignity and inalienable rights of every woman, man, \n     boy, and girl be honored. May all Your people, especially the \n     least of these, flourish in our blessed Nation. One hundred \n     fifty years after the Emancipation Proclamation and 50 years \n     after the march on Washington, we celebrate the spirit of our \n     ancestors which has allowed us to move from a nation of \n     unborn hopes and a history of disenfranchised votes to \n     today's expression of a more perfect Union.\n       We ask, too, Almighty, that where our paths seem blanketed \n     by throngs of oppression and rippled by pangs of despair, we \n     ask for Your guidance toward the light of deliverance, and \n     with the vision of those who came before us and dreamed of \n     this day, that we recognize their visions still inspire us. \n     They are a great cloud of witnesses unseen by the naked eye \n     but all around us thankful that their living was not in vain. \n     For every mountain You gave us the strength to climb, Your \n     grace is pleaded to continue that climb for America and the \n     world.\n       We now stand beneath the shadow of the Nation's Capitol \n     whose golden dome reflects the unity and democracy of one \n     Nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n       Approximately 4 miles from where we are assembled, the \n     hallowed remains of men and women rest in Arlington Cemetery; \n     they who believed, fought, and died for this country. May \n     their spirit infuse our being to work together with respect, \n     enabling us to continue to build this Nation, and in so doing \n     we send a message to the world that we are strong, fierce in \n     our strength, and ever vigilant in our pursuit of freedom.\n       We ask that You grant our President the will to act \n     courageously but cautiously when confronted with danger and \n     to act prudently but deliberately when challenged by \n     adversity. Please continue to vest his efforts, to lead by \n     example in consideration and favor of the diversity of our \n     people. Bless our families all across this Nation.\n       We thank You for this opportunity of prayer to strengthen \n     us for the journey through the days that lie ahead. We invoke \n     the prayers of our grandmothers who taught us to pray: God \n     make me a blessing. Let their spirit guide us as we claim the \n     spirit of old. There is something within me that holds the \n     reins. There is something within me that banishes pain. There \n     is something within me I cannot explain. But all I know, \n     America, there is something within--there is something \n     within.\n       In Jesus's name and the name of all who are holy and right, \n     we pray.\n       Amen.\n       (Applause.)\n       Mr. SCHUMER. I am pleased to introduce the award-winning \n     tabernacle choir, the Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir, to sing \n     ``Battle Hymn of the Republic.''\n       (Performance by the Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir.)\n       Mr. SCHUMER. Please join me in welcoming my colleague and \n     friend, the Senator from Tennessee, the Honorable Lamar \n     Alexander.\n       Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, ladies \n     and gentlemen, the late Alex Haley, author of ``Roots,'' \n     lived his life by these six words: ``Find the good and praise \n     it.'' Today we praise the American tradition of transferring \n     or reaffirming immense power in the inauguration of the \n     President of the United States. We do this in a peaceful, \n     orderly way. There is no mob, no coup, no insurrection. This \n     is a moment when millions stop and watch, a moment most of us \n     always will remember. It is a moment that is our most \n     conspicuous and enduring symbol of the American democracy. \n     How remarkable that this has survived for so long in such a \n     complex country, when so much power is at stake, this freedom \n     to vote for our leaders and the restraint to respect the \n     results.\n       Last year, at Mount Vernon, a tour guide told me our first \n     President, George Washington, once posed this question: What \n     is\n\n[[Page S185]]\n\n     most important of this grand experiment, the United States? \n     Then Washington answered his own question in this way: Not \n     the election of the first President but the election of its \n     second President. The peaceful transfer of power is what will \n     separate our country from every other country in the world.\n       Today we celebrate the 57th inauguration of the American \n     President: Find the good and praise it.\n       (Applause.)\n       It is my honor to introduce Associate Justice of the U.S. \n     Supreme Court Sonia Sotomayor for the purpose of \n     administering the oath of office to the Vice President. Will \n     everyone please stand.\n       Associate Justice SONIA SOTOMAYOR administered to the Vice \n     President-elect the oath of office prescribed by the \n     Constitution, which he repeated, as follows:\n       I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., do solemnly swear that I will \n     support and defend the Constitution of the United States \n     against all enemies foreign and domestic; that I will bear \n     true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this \n     obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose \n     of evasion, and that I will well and faithfully discharge the \n     duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me \n     God.\n       Justice SOTOMAYOR. Congratulations.\n       (Applause.)\n       Mr. SCHUMER. It is my pleasure to introduce renowned \n     musical artist James Taylor.\n       (Applause.)\n       (Performance by James Taylor.)\n       Mr. SCHUMER. It is my honor to present the Chief Justice of \n     the United States, JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR., who will administer \n     the Presidential oath of office.\n       Everyone, please rise.\n       The Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, JOHN G. \n     ROBERTS, JR., administered to the President-elect the oath of \n     office prescribed by the Constitution, which he repeated as \n     follows:\n       I, BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA, do solemnly swear that I will \n     faithfully execute the office of President of the United \n     States and will, to the best of my ability, preserve, \n     protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. So \n     help me God.\n       The CHIEF JUSTICE. Congratulations, Mr. President.\n       (Applause.)\n       Mr. SCHUMER. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my great privilege \n     and distinct honor to introduce the 44th President of the \n     United States of America, Barack H. Obama.\n       (Applause.)\n       The PRESIDENT. Thank you. Thank you so much.\n       Vice President Biden, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the \n     U.S. Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens, \n     each time we gather to inaugurate a President, we bear \n     witness to the enduring strength of our Constitution. We \n     affirm the promise of our democracy. We recall that what \n     binds this Nation together are not the colors of our skin or \n     the tenets of our faith or the origins of our names. What \n     makes us exceptional--what makes us American--is our \n     allegiance to an idea, articulated in a declaration made more \n     than two centuries ago:\n       We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, \n     Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\n       (Applause.)\n       Today we continue a never-ending journey to bridge the \n     meaning of those words with the realities of our time, for \n     history tells us that while these truths may be self-evident, \n     they have never been self-executing; that while freedom is a \n     gift from God, it must be secured by His people here on \n     Earth.\n       The patriots of 1776 did not fight to replace the tyranny \n     of a king with the privileges of a few or the rule of a mob. \n     They gave to us a republic, a government of and by and for \n     the people, entrusting each generation to keep safe our \n     founding creed. For more than 200 years, we have. Through \n     blood drawn by lash and blood drawn by sword, we learned that \n     no union founded on the principles of liberty and equality \n     could survive half slave and half free. We made ourselves \n     anew and vowed to move forward together. Together, we \n     determined that a modern economy requires railroads and \n     highways to speed travel and commerce; schools and colleges \n     to train our workers. Together, we discovered that a free \n     market only thrives when there are rules to ensure \n     competition and fair play. Together, we resolve that a great \n     nation must care for the vulnerable and protect its people \n     from life's worst hazards and misfortunes. Through it all, we \n     have never relinquished our skepticism of central authority, \n     nor have we succumbed to the fiction that all society's ills \n     can be cured through government alone. Our celebration of \n     initiative and enterprise, our insistence on hard work and \n     personal responsibility, these are constants in our \n     character.\n       We have always understood that when times change, so must \n     we; that fidelity to our founding principles requires new \n     responses to new challenges; that preserving our individual \n     freedoms ultimately requires collective action, for the \n     American people can no more meet the demands of today's world \n     by acting alone than American soldiers could have met the \n     forces of fascism or communism with muskets and militias. No \n     single person can train all the math and science teachers we \n     will need to equip our children for the future or build the \n     roads and networks and research labs that will bring new \n     jobs to our shores. Now, more than ever, we must do these \n     things together as one Nation and one people.\n       (Applause.)\n       This generation of Americans has been tested by crises that \n     steeled our resolve and proved our resilience. A decade of \n     war is now ending.\n       (Applause.)\n       An economic recovery has begun.\n       (Applause.)\n       America's possibilities are limitless, for we possess all \n     the qualities this world without boundaries demands: youth \n     and drive, diversity and openness, an endless capacity for \n     risk, and a gift for reinvention.\n       My fellow Americans, we are made for this moment, and we \n     will seize it so long as we seize it together.\n       (Applause.)\n       For we, the People, understand that our country cannot \n     succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many \n     barely make it.\n       (Applause.)\n       We believe America's prosperity must rest upon the broad \n     shoulders of a rising middle class. We know America thrives \n     when every person can find independence and pride in their \n     work, when the wages of honest labor liberate families from \n     the brink of hardship. We are true to our creed when a little \n     girl born into the bleakest poverty knows she has the same \n     chance to succeed as anybody else because she is an American, \n     she is free, and she is equal, not just in the eyes of God \n     but also in our own.\n       (Applause.)\n       We understand outworn programs are inadequate to the needs \n     of our time. We must harness new ideas in technology to \n     remake our government, revamp our Tax Code, reform our \n     schools, and empower our citizens with the skills they need \n     to work harder, learn more, and reach higher. But while the \n     means will change, our purpose endures. A nation that rewards \n     the effort and determination of every single American, that \n     is what this moment requires. That is what will give real \n     meaning to our creed.\n       We, the people, still believe that every citizen deserves a \n     basic measure of security and dignity. We must make the hard \n     choices to reduce the cost of health care and the size of our \n     deficit. But we reject the belief that America must choose \n     between caring for the generation that built this country and \n     investing in the generation that will build its future.\n       (Applause.)\n       For we remember the lessons of our past, when twilight \n     years were spent in poverty and parents of a child with a \n     disability had nowhere to turn. We do not believe, in this \n     country, freedom is reserved for the lucky or happiness for \n     the few. We recognize that no matter how responsibly we live \n     our lives, any one of us, at any time, may face a job loss or \n     a sudden illness or a home swept away in a terrible storm. \n     The commitments we make to each other, through Medicare and \n     Medicaid and Social Security, these things do not sap our \n     Nation; they strengthen us.\n       (Applause.)\n       They do not make us a nation of takers; they free us to \n     take the risks that make this country great.\n       (Applause.)\n       We, the people, still believe our obligations as Americans \n     are not just to ourselves but to all posterity. We will \n     respond to the threat of climate change, knowing the failure \n     to do so would betray our children and future generations.\n       (Applause.)\n       Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, \n     but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires and \n     crippling drought and more powerful storms. The path toward \n     sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes \n     difficult, but America cannot resist this transition; we must \n     lead it. We cannot cede to other Nations the technology that \n     will power new jobs and new industries; we must claim its \n     promise. That is how we will maintain our economic vitality \n     and our national treasure, our forests and waterways, our \n     croplands and snow-capped peaks. That is how we will preserve \n     our planet, commanded to our care by God. That is what will \n     lend meaning to the creed our Fathers once declared.\n       We, the people, still believe that enduring security and \n     lasting peace do not require perpetual war. Our brave men and \n     women in uniform, tempered by the flames of battle, are \n     unmatched in skill and courage. Our citizens, seared by the \n     memory of those we have lost, know too well the price that is \n     paid for liberty. The knowledge of their sacrifice will keep \n     us forever vigilant against those who would do us harm. But \n     we are also heirs to those who won the peace and not just the \n     war, who turned sworn enemies into the surest of friends, and \n     we must carry those lessons into this time as well.\n       We will defend our people and uphold our values through \n     strength of arms and rule of law. We will show the courage to \n     try and resolve our differences with other Nations \n     peacefully, not because we are naive about the dangers we \n     face but because engagement can more durably lift suspicion \n     and fear.\n       America will remain the anchor of strong alliances in every \n     corner of the globe, and we will renew those institutions \n     that extend our capacity to manage crisis abroad, for no one \n     has a greater stake in a peaceful world than its most \n     powerful Nation. We will support democracy from Asia to \n     Africa, from the Americas to the Middle East, because our \n     interests and our conscience compel us to act\n\n[[Page S186]]\n\n     on behalf of those who long for freedom. We must be a source \n     of hope to the poor, the sick, the marginalized, the victims \n     of prejudice, not out of mere charity but because peace in \n     our time requires the constant advance of those principles \n     that our common creed describes: tolerance and opportunity, \n     human dignity and justice.\n       We, the people, declare today that the most evident of \n     truths, that all of us are created equal, is the star that \n     guides us still, just as it guided our forebears through \n     Seneca Falls and Selma and Stonewall, just as it guided all \n     those men and women, sung and unsung, who left footprints \n     along this great Mall to hear a preacher say we cannot walk \n     alone, to hear a ``King'' proclaim that our individual \n     freedom is inextricably bound to the freedom of every soul on \n     Earth.\n       (Applause.)\n       It is now our generation's task to carry on what those \n     pioneers began, for our journey is not complete until our \n     wives, our mothers, and daughters can earn a living equal to \n     their efforts.\n       (Applause.)\n       Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and \n     sisters are treated like anyone else under the law, for if we \n     are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to \n     one another must be equal as well.\n       Our journey is not complete until no citizen is forced to \n     wait for hours to exercise the right to vote. Our journey is \n     not complete until we find a better way to welcome the \n     striving, hopeful immigrants who still see America as a land \n     of opportunity; until bright young students and engineers are \n     enlisted in our workforce rather than expelled from our \n     country.\n       Our journey is not complete until all our children, from \n     the streets of Detroit to the hills of Appalachia, to the \n     quiet lanes of Newtown, know they are cared for and cherished \n     and always safe from harm. That is our generation's task--to \n     make these words, these rights, these values of life and \n     liberty and the pursuit of happiness real for every American.\n       Being true to our founding documents does not require us to \n     agree on every contour of life. It does not mean we will all \n     define liberty in exactly the same way or follow the same \n     precise path to happiness. Progress does not compel us to \n     settle centuries-long debates about the role of government \n     for all time, but it does require us to act in our time.\n       (Applause.)\n       For now decisions are upon us, and we cannot afford delay. \n     We cannot mistake absolutism for principle or substitute \n     spectacle for politics or treat name-calling as reasoned \n     debate. We must act, knowing our work will be imperfect. We \n     must act, knowing today's victories will be only partial and \n     that it will be up to those who stand here in 4 years and 40 \n     years and 400 years hence to advance the timeless spirit once \n     conferred to us in a spare Philadelphia hall.\n       My fellow Americans, the oath I have sworn before you \n     today, similar to the one recited by others who serve in this \n     Capitol, was an oath to God and country, not party or \n     faction, and we must faithfully execute that pledge during \n     the duration of our service. But the words I spoke today are \n     not so different from the oath that is taken each time a \n     soldier signs up for duty or an immigrant realizes her dream. \n     My oath is not so different from the pledge we all make to \n     the flag that waves above and that fills our hearts with \n     pride. They are the words of citizens and they represent our \n     greatest hope.\n       You and I, as citizens, have the power to set this \n     country's course. You and I, as citizens, have the obligation \n     to shape the debates of our time, not only with the votes we \n     cast but with the voices we lift in defense of our most \n     ancient values and enduring ideals. Let each of us now \n     embrace, with solemn duty and awesome joy, what is our \n     lasting birthright. With common effort and common purpose, \n     with passion and dedication, let us answer the call of \n     history and carry into an uncertain future that precious \n     light of freedom.\n       Thank you. God bless you, and may He forever bless these \n     United States of America.\n       (Applause.)\n       Mr. SCHUMER. At this time, please join me in welcoming \n     award-winning artist Kelly Clarkson, accompanied by the U.S. \n     Marine Band.\n       (Kelly Clarkson and the Marine Band performed.)\n       Mr. SCHUMER. Wow. Our next distinguished guest is the poet \n     Richard Blanco, who will share with us words he has composed \n     for this occasion.\n       Mr. BLANCO. Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, America, \n     ``One Today.''\n\n     One sun rose on us today, kindled over our shores, peeking \n           over the Smokies, greeting the faces of the Great \n           Lakes, spreading a simple truth across the Great \n           Plains, then charging across the Rockies. One light, \n           waking up rooftops, under each one, a story told by our \n           silent gestures moving across windows.\n     My face, your face, millions of faces in morning's mirrors, \n           each one yawning to life, crescendoing into our day: \n           pencil-yellow school buses, the rhythm of traffic \n           lights, fruit stands: apples, limes, and oranges \n           arrayed like rainbows begging our praise.\n     Silver trucks heavy with oil or paper--bricks or milk, \n           teeming over highways alongside us, on our way to clean \n           tables, read ledgers, or save lives--to teach geometry, \n           or ring up groceries as my mother did for twenty years, \n           so I could write this poem for all of us today.\n     All of us as vital as the one light we move through, the same \n           light on blackboards with lessons for the day: \n           equations to solve, history to question, or atoms \n           imagined, the ``I have a dream'' we all keep dreaming \n           or the impossible vocabulary of sorrow that won't \n           explain the empty desks of twenty children marked \n           absent today, and forever. Many prayers, but one light \n           breathing color into stained glass windows, life into \n           the faces of bronzed statues, warmth onto the steps of \n           our museums and park benches as mothers watch children \n           slide into the day.\n     One ground. Our ground, rooting us to every stock of corn, \n           every head of wheat sown by sweat and hands, hands \n           gleaning coal or planting windmills in deserts and \n           hilltops that keep us warm, hands digging trenches, \n           routing pipes and cables, hands as worn as my father's \n           cutting sugarcane so my brother and I could have books \n           and shoes.\n     The dust of farms and deserts, cities and plains mingled by \n           one wind--our breath. Breathe. Hear it through the \n           day's gorgeous din of honking cabs, buses launching \n           down avenues, the symphony of footsteps, guitars, and \n           screeching subways, the unexpected song bird on your \n           clothes line.\n     Hear: squeaky playground swings, trains whistling, or \n           whispers across cafe tables. Hear: the doors we open \n           each day for each other, saying, hello, shalom, buon \n           giorno, howdy, namaste, or buenos dias in the language \n           my mother taught me--in every language spoken into one \n           wind carrying our lives without prejudice, as these \n           words break from my lips.\n     One sky: since the Appalachians and Sierras claimed their \n           majesty, and the Mississippi and Colorado worked their \n           way to the sea. Thank the work of our hands: weaving \n           steel into bridges, finishing one more report for the \n           boss on time, stitching another wound or uniform, the \n           first brushstroke on a portrait, or the last floor on \n           the Freedom Tower jutting into a sky that yields to our \n           resilience.\n     One sky: toward which we sometimes lift our eyes tired from \n           work, some days guessing at the weather of our lives, \n           some days giving thanks for a love that loves you back, \n           sometimes praising a mother who knew how to give, or \n           forgiving a father who couldn't give what you wanted.\n     We head home: through the gloss of rain or weight of snow, or \n           the plum plush of dusk, but always--home, always under \n           one sky, our sky. And always one moon like a silent \n           drum tapping on every rooftop and every window, of one \n           country--all of us--facing the stars. Hope--a new \n           constellation waiting for us to map it, waiting for us \n           to name it--together.\n\n       (Applause.)\n       Mr. SCHUMER. Ladies and gentlemen, it is now my privilege \n     to introduce Rev. Dr. Luis Leon to deliver the benediction.\n       Reverend LEON. Let us pray.\n       Gracious and eternal God, as we conclude the second \n     inauguration of President Obama, we ask for Your blessings as \n     we seek to become, in the words of Martin Luther King, Jr., \n     citizens of a beloved community loving You and loving our \n     neighbors as ourselves.\n       We pray that You will bless us with Your continued presence \n     because without it, hatred and arrogance will infect our \n     hearts. But with Your blessing, we know that we can break \n     down the walls that separate us.\n       We pray for Your blessing today because without it, \n     mistrust, prejudice, and rancor will rule our hearts, but \n     with the blessing of Your presence, we know that we can renew \n     the ties of mutual regard which can best form our civic life.\n       We pray for Your blessing, because without it, suspicion, \n     despair, and fear of those different from us will be our rule \n     of life. But with Your blessing, we can see each other \n     created in Your image, a unit of God's grace, unprecedented, \n     irrepeatable, and irreplaceable.\n       We pray for Your blessing, because without it, we will see \n     only what the eye can see. But with the blessing of Your \n     blessing, we will see that we are created in Your image \n     whether Brown, Black or White, male or female, first-\n     generation immigrant American or Daughters of the American \n     Revolution, gay or straight, rich or poor.\n       We pray for Your blessing, because without it, we will only \n     see scarcity in the midst of abundance. But with Your \n     blessing, we will recognize the abundance of the gifts of \n     this good land with which You have endowed this Nation.\n       We pray for Your blessing. Bless all of us privileged to be \n     citizens and residents of this Nation with a spirit of \n     gratitude and humility that we may become a blessing among \n     the Nations of this world.\n       We pray that You will shower with Your life-giving spirit \n     the elected leaders of this land, especially Barack, our \n     President, and Joe, our Vice President.
