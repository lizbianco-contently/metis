It is a committee \nwhere most all of the legislation is funneled, and what we have focused \non in recent months is the problem we have with judges.\n  Yesterday my friend did a remarkably good job in leading a precedent \nindicating the issues we have with the DC Circuit, and I so appreciate \nhis leadership on this issue and all the other issues on which the \nJudiciary Committee works. It is too bad we cannot have the Judiciary \nCommittee as it was in our earlier years in the Senate where the \nproductivity of that committee is not thwarted by not being able to \nbring items to the floor.\n  The Judiciary Committee has a wide range of jurisdiction over matters \nthat are so important to our country, such as our national security \nagencies and cyber security. There is a multitude of issues the \nJudiciary Committee deals with, and I wish we could be doing more \nlegislation on the floor which comes from that committee.\n  I wanted to extend my appreciation to the Senator for the good work \nhe has done, and I also want to send accolades to the people of Vermont \nfor having this good man leading the Senate in many different ways, not \nthe least of which is being the Senate President pro tempore.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/13/senate-section/article/S7965-6", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7965-S7966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              DRUG SAFETY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the symptoms of fungal meningitis can be \nvery subtle at first: headaches, fever, even light can start bothering \npeople, as well as neckaches and backaches. The disease can also cause \nstrokes, seizures, and even coma.\n  Fungal meningitis led to the death of at least 64 unfortunate \nAmericans when they were injected with a contaminated medicine. The \nmedicine--a steroid injection used to heal back pain--was tainted by \nunsanitary conditions from a facility that was masquerading as a \ncompounding pharmacy in Massachusetts. The true compounding pharmacies \nprovide custom-made medications for patients with unique health needs \nthat cannot be treated by off-the-shelf prescription medicines. This \npractice is essential and can be critical for children, cancer \npatients, and people with severe allergies.\n  The contaminated medicine mixed at the New England Compounding Center \nwas sent to scores of medical facilities in 23 different States and \ngiven to 14,000 patients. As I have indicated, 64 of them died and \nhundreds of those patients were seriously ill.\n  Recently a heart medication mixed at the same pharmacy was linked to \nthe death of two young Nevada boys, ages 4 and 6, according to a \nlawsuit filed by their parents.\n  The New England Compounding Center was skirting Federal regulations \nand manufacturing large batches of drugs for mass distribution in very \nunsanitary conditions. By avoiding the safety inspections required of \nlarge-scale drug manufacturers, companies such as this one can boost \nprofits, but in the process they risk lives.\n  The legislation on the floor will end that dangerous practice and \nensure that patients have access to high-quality custom medications. \nThis is not a contentious issue. On the contrary, this legislation has \nwide bipartisan support--led by Harkin and Alexander--and would pass by \na wide margin in mere moments if not for the stall tactics by a few \nRepublican Senators. This bill has already been delayed for more than a \nmonth because of these tactics, and Republicans continue to insist on \nrunning out the clock on this matter.\n  As everyone knows, if all time is required on the procedural issues, \nwe will not be able to finish the bill until this Sunday--that includes \nworking Saturday--and the final 30 hours won't run out until sometime \non Sunday. It is time to dispense with this noncontroversial measure--a \nmeasure that will safeguard the lives of vulnerable\n\n[[Page S7966]]\n\nAmericans, people with back pain and other maladies--and move on to \nother important legislative priorities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/13/senate-section/article/S7966-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey).

Mr. President, one of the favorite pastimes of \npoliticians in Washington is to talk about how frustrated the American \npeople are with politicians in Washington. After the past few weeks, it \nis easy to see why. I am talking about the President's promise, \nrepeated dozens of times, that if you like your health care plan, you \ncan keep it, and the sobering realization by literally millions of \nAmericans is that it was not true.\n  Some of the top fact checkers in the country have used terms such as \n``pants on fire'' and ``false'' and ``four Pinocchios'' to describe the \nclaim that under ObamaCare folks would be able to keep their plans.\n  In a matter of weeks, it has gone from being one of the law's top \nselling points to a national punchline. If millions of people were not \nso frustrated and upset by it, it might actually be funny, but it is \nnot the least bit funny.\n  At this stage about 50,000 folks are believed to have signed up for \ninsurance on the Federal exchange--way below administration estimates. \nThat is 50,000 folks who have signed up for insurance on the exchange, \nwhile 3.5 million Americans have lost their health care coverage. In \nother words, about twice as many folks have lost their insurance in the \nState of Idaho alone since October 1 as have obtained health insurance \nacross the entire Federal exchange all across America. So this is a \nreal crisis.\n  In my home State of Kentucky, over a quarter of a million people have \nlost their private health care plan so far and only about 7,000 \nKentuckians have been able to obtain new private insurance under \nObamaCare. If you consider that Kentucky received $250 million in \ntaxpayer funds to get ObamaCare up and running, that works out to about \n$35,000 per private insurance enrollee, and that is before the taxpayer \nsubsidies kick in.\n  We have literally thrown untold millions at this disastrous rollout, \nand what do we have to show for it? Millions of people losing their \ncoverage despite assurances from the President they would be able to \nkeep it. He said they would be able to keep it, period. That is what \nthe President said.\n  Let's be very clear about something. These insurance cancellations \nare not any kind of an accident. This is no accident. It is the way the \nlaw was designed. Remember, in order for ObamaCare to work, millions of \nAmericans had to lose the coverage they purchased on their own so the \ngovernment could dump them into the ObamaCare exchanges. That way the \ngovernment could then get them to pay more to subsidize coverage for \neverybody else. That is the way this was designed to work.\n  The 31-year-old dentist from Louisville whom I mentioned last week--\nthe one who is not married, has no kids--now has to carry pediatric \ndental care on his plan. He is one of the unfortunate ones subsidizing \ncare for everybody else.\n  Despite the fact that the President and other supporters of the bill \nvowed up and down that folks would be able to keep the health care plan \nthey had and liked, the fact is that was never true. It was never true \nand they knew it. They knew folks would lose their coverage. They knew \nit all along. Just as the President once famously predicted that \nutility rates would necessarily skyrocket as a result of his cap-and-\ntrade policy, so too would health care rates skyrocket under ObamaCare. \nThe only difference is that on health care, Democrats apparently knew \nthey could not tell people how it would all shake out in the end, but \nthey knew. That is why in 2010 every Democrat who was in the Senate \nvoted against a Republican proposal designed to hold the President to \nhis word.\n  The fact is the President's health care law was designed to capture \nmillions of middle-class Americans, jack up their premiums, and use the \nextra cash to keep ObamaCare afloat. This is not some unforeseen \nconsequence of the law, it is the law. It is working just as they \ndesigned it--just like what they voted for.\n  It is hard to take seriously this faux outrage we have seen of late \nfrom some of our Democratic friends. As for the President, this should \nbe no great revelation to him either. Just the other day the media \npointed out that the administration knew for years that Americans would \nlose coverage.\n  But there is something else.\n  At a bipartisan health care summit in 2010, the President was asked \ndirectly about this kind of thing by House Majority Leader Cantor. In \nreply, the President admitted that 8 million to 9 million would have to \nchange coverage and justified it on grounds they would be getting \nbetter coverage from the government once they lost it. So the President \nactually admitted during that event that millions would lose their \nhealth care and still went out on the campaign trail claiming Americans \ncould keep the health care plans they had.\n  This is why Americans feel so hurt by this particular broken promise. \nAnd what many of them want to know is why would Washington Democrats \npersist with it even after it became clear it was false?\n  I think the reasons are simple enough. One, they needed to pass the \nObamaCare bill; and, two, they needed to sell it to a skeptical public. \nAnd neither would have been possible without it.\n  If the President had gone out and told people that if he likes your \nplan, you can keep it--if the President had said if he likes your plan, \nyou can keep it--it would have never passed. That is why the \nPresident's so-called apology the other night rang so hollow for so \nmany.\n  ObamaCare's problems run so deep and the broken promises are so \npervasive that it is impossible to identify an ``easy fix.'' It truly \nought to be repealed or delayed. But if the President is sorry for \nbreaking his promise to the American people, there is a natural place \nto start. He could support legislation that would help restore the \nplans for the folks who want them back, and he can act on it as early \nas this Friday. That is because the House is expected to send over a \nbill that would allow Americans to keep the plans they have and want to \nkeep. There is no reason the President and Senate Democrats should not \njoin Republicans and the American people in supporting it.\n  This does not have to be a partisan battle. These cancellations have \nnot discriminated based on party. The people out there who are \nfrustrated and upset at losing their health care plans are Democrats \nand Republicans. The President can help all of them by backing the bill \nthe House is expected to pass on Friday.\n  I think that is basically what President Clinton was suggesting \nyesterday when he said the President should honor the commitment the \ngovernment made to these folks, even--even, said Bill Clinton--if it \nmeans changing the law.\n  I have had a lot of disagreements with President Clinton over the \nyears. But at key moments he was willing to cross party lines, and I \nthink here is a moment where the American people are expecting \nPresident Obama to do the same. Allowing Americans to keep their health \nplans is a promise Democrats made over and over.\n  Whether or not they meant it, Democrats promised this to the American \npeople, and it is their duty to make good on what they said. Once the \nHouse acts, my conference will be watching closely to see whether the \nSenate Democratic majority allows a vote and will help us send a bill \nto the President's desk. The American people will be watching closely \nas well.\n  So my message to the President is simple: Mr. President, our \nconstituents are frustrated and they are upset. You could help. Do the \nright thing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/13/senate-section/article/S7966-3", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7966-S7967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONGRATULATING FORD MOTOR COMPANY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I am here today to discuss the most \nimportant issue facing Hoosiers--and all Americans--and that is getting \na good job.\n  Good jobs allow us to provide for our loved ones, educate our \nchildren, and ultimately retire with dignity. Good jobs are also \ncritical for strong communities and a vibrant economy. That is why I am \nproud to be part of the group of Senators working on Manufacturing Jobs \nfor America. It is an effort to refocus the Senate on helping \nbusinesses create jobs and helping communities pursue economic \ndevelopment in the area of manufacturing.\n  This effort is aimed at building bipartisan support for modernizing \nthe manufacturing sector, increasing access to capital, strengthening \nour workforce, and creating the conditions necessary for American \nmanufacturers to grow and create jobs.\n  I have two bills as a part of this effort, the Skills Gap Strategy \nAct and the AMERICA Works Act. Both of them are focused on closing the \nskills gap. There are an estimated 600,000 manufacturing jobs that are \nunfilled across our country in part because employers cannot find \nworkers with the skills they need to fill these open jobs.\n  We need to match up unemployed or underemployed Americans with the \ntraining and education programs employers need so we can get more \nAmericans into these good-paying, skilled jobs.\n  Last month my friend, Senator Dean Heller, and I introduced the \nSkills Gap Strategy Act. This directs the Department of Labor to \ndevelop a goal-oriented strategy to address our skills gap challenges. \nIn order for every Hoosier who wants a job to have a job, and for \nIndiana's economy to continue to grow, we must train Hoosiers for the \njobs that are available right now.\n  Our bill examines how we can better use existing resources to \nprioritize training and education programs and prepare our workforce to \nhit the ground running on day one.\n  The Skills Gap Strategy Act requires the Department of Labor to \nprovide recommendations on: increasing on-the-job training and \napprenticeship opportunities, helping employers participate more in \neducation and workforce training, and identifying and prioritizing in-\ndemand credentials in existing and emerging industries.\n  When completing this report, we call on the Department to consider: \nspecific labor barriers contributing to the skills gap; policies that \nhave proven successful in key industries, regions, and countries where \nemployers play a larger role in education and workforce training; and \nways to better utilize Registered Apprenticeship and other workforce \ndevelopment programs.\n  We are also asking the Department of Labor to develop plans with the \nDepartments of Commerce and Education to align education with industry \nand enhance employer participation in K through 12 and career and \ntechnical education programs, to increase preapprenticeship and college \ncredit courses in secondary schools, and to improve school-to-work \ntransitions and connections.\n  I am a strong believer in being fiscally responsible with Hoosier \ntaxpayer dollars. That is why our bill asks the Department of Labor to \nfocus on these solutions that use existing resources, existing \nprograms, and existing personnel--not new programs or new spending.\n  Closing the skills gap requires participation from individual \nworkers, the education community, and employers. But we have the \nability to help, and a specific plan should be in place to do just \nthat.\n  Also a part of the Manufacturing Jobs for America effort is another \nbill I am proud to support that focuses on closing the skills gap. \nIntroduced by Senators Hagan, Heller, and myself, the AMERICA Works Act \nmodifies existing Federal training programs so that they place a \npriority on programs and certifications that are recognized and \ndemanded by industry.\n  I have heard time after time from Hoosier business owners and \neducators and workers about the pressing need to close the skills gap \nand to get more people to work.\n  To address this issue while not increasing Federal spending, the \nAMERICA Works Act modifies the Workforce Investment Act, Perkins Career \nand Technical Education, and Trade Adjustment Assistance to prioritize \nthe credentials that employers need now.\n  The improvements made in this bill benefit both workers and \nemployers, as workers would know that the time they spend training is \nmore likely to lead to employment in a good-paying job, and employers \nwould know that it is more likely that the people they hire would have \nthe training they need to get the job done on day one.\n  The Department of Labor estimates there are nearly 4 million job \nopenings in the United States, despite an unemployment rate that is \nstill over 7 percent and despite millions of Americans looking for \nwork. Now is the time to get to work on these jobs and match these \npeople up with the job opportunities that are available out there. That \nis the most important thing we can be doing.\n  When Americans are working, we are a stronger nation. The \nManufacturing Jobs for America effort to pass bipartisan legislation \nthat everyone can buy into that helps manufacturers and workers is one \nimportant way we can move the ball ahead.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking Chairman \nHarkin, Ranking Member Alexander, Senators Franken and Roberts, and all \nof their staffs for their tremendous leadership on this bill. This bill \nwas also developed in concert with our counterparts in the House of \nRepresentatives. I extend my thanks to ranking member Henry Waxman and \nchairman Fred Upton and their staffs of the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee. What we have now is a bipartisan, bicameral bill that \naddresses two very serious issues: the safety of compounded drugs and \nthe security of our entire drug supply.\n  Last fall an outbreak of fungal meningitis stunned the Nation and \nthus far has claimed the lives of 64 people and has sickened 751 in 20 \nStates. This issue hits home for me because it started in\n\n[[Page S7968]]\n\nMassachusetts. At the center of this tragedy was the New England \nCompounding Center, also known as NECC. It is located in Framingham, \nMA. I met some of the victims of this terrible outbreak and heard about \ntheir struggles, people like Jerry Cohen, a resident of Pikesville, MD, \nwho went to the doctor for routine steroid injections to treat \nrecurring back pain and received two doses that came from the \ncontaminated lots. Jerry suffered a stroke and had to adjust to a new \nlife, dealing with dizziness, nausea, weakness, and exhaustion. Melanie \nNorwood's mother Marjorie went into a Tennessee hospital to treat an \nacute back injury she suffered while mowing the lawn. Instead of \nwalking out of the hospital, Marjorie became severely sick, spent \nmonths in the hospital and a nursing home, and now has permanent nerve \ndamage and medical bills that are close to putting her into bankruptcy.\n  For the last decade complaints about sterility, safety, lack of valid \nprescriptions, and mass production of drugs have been lodged against \nNECC. Yet the company was allowed to continue operating largely \nunchecked, falling between the regulatory checks that exist between \nFederal oversight of drug manufacturers and State oversight of \npharmacies.\n  Sadly, NECC was not an isolated instance. Almost a year ago I issued \na report detailing more than a decade of violations and problems at \ncompounding pharmacies all across our Nation. Contaminated IV \nsolutions, tainted steroid injections, and fouled eyedrops permanently \nimpacted thousands of patients' lives across this country and killed or \ninjured dozens across 34 States. The New England Compounding Center, \nlike many large compounding facilities, fell into a regulatory black \nhole. That is because there are two kinds of compounding pharmacies: \nthe neighborhood pharmacist you have known and trusted for years and \nthe large drug manufacturers operating in the shadows that have slipped \nthrough the regulatory cracks.\n  Traditional compounding pharmacies make custom medication that fits \nthe needs of an individual patient, such as creating a liquid \nmedication instead of a pill for an elderly patient or a child because \nit is easier to swallow. We are familiar with that corner-store \npharmacist who does that for a patient. These pharmacies are an \nimportant tool in our medical arsenal and have historically fallen \nunder the jurisdiction of the States. They are the corner pharmacies \nthat people grew up with. They are the corner pharmacies that people \ntrust.\n  But there has been a recent disturbing trend of larger compounding \npharmacies entering the market, making high-risk drugs sold to \nhospitals and clinics throughout the country. These compounding \nfacilities are operating more as modern-day drug manufacturers rather \nthan the mortar-and-pestle compounders of yesteryear on the corner near \nyour home. They are not on Main Street, and they do most of their \nbusiness out of site and under the FDA's radar.\n  In 1997 Congress passed a law to define FDA's role in the oversight \nof compounding pharmacies, but just 2 days before the new law was to \ntake effect seven compounding pharmacies sued to block its enactment. \nSince then, the law and the FDA's authority to regulate compounding \npharmacies have been mired in litigation and uncertainty. The result is \nthat oversight of even large-scale drug manufacturers, such as NECC, \nhas been largely relegated to the States.\n  How are the States doing their job? Well, last April I issued an \ninvestigative report that took a deep look at how States actually \noversee and govern the activities of compounding pharmacies. What I \nfound was a regulatory state of disarray. My investigation found that \nnationwide most State regulators did not look at the safety of \ncompounding pharmacies. They do not make all their activities and \ninvestigations public. Some of them did not even know how many \ncompounding pharmacies exist in their State, and States typically are \nnot equipped to regulate the safety of large companies shipping massive \nquantities of drugs outside their own borders into States all across \nour country.\n  Since the NECC outbreak, some States have made efforts to improve \ntheir regulations and guidelines over compounding pharmacies, but the \nresults are not consistent. Within the last month my home State of \nMassachusetts passed through its house and senate a bill that I am \nproud to say will put in place the strongest State regulations in the \ncountry overseeing the compounding pharmacy industry. However, while \nMassachusetts has become a national leader in the oversight of \ncompounding pharmacies in the aftermath of what happened at NECC, this \ndoes little to protect the residents of other States. It cannot protect \nresidents of Massachusetts from drugs that are shipped in from other \nStates that do not have strong safety standards in place.\n  The Drug Safety and Security Act in front of us today helps to solve \nthat problem by creating for the first time a national and uniform set \nof rules for compounding pharmacies that wish to register with the FDA \nand be subject to FDA oversight and enforcement. The bill also provides \ntransparency by requiring the FDA to publish a list of the name and \nlocation of registered facilities that are compounding drugs in large \nquantities without a prescription. The Drug Safety and Security Act \nalso mirrors several concepts from the VALID Compounding Act of 2013, \nlegislation which I introduced in the House of Representatives. The \nbill distinguishes between compounders engaging in traditional pharmacy \nwork and those making large volumes of compounded drugs without \nindividual prescriptions. It places limits on the types and quality of \ningredients that can be used to compound drugs. It ensures that drugs \nremoved for the market for safety and effectiveness reasons are not \ncompounded. The bill requires reporting of adverse events, such as \npatient sickness or hospitalizations that could be caused by \ncompounding pharmacies that are registered with the FDA. It provides \nmore information on the label of compounded drugs, including \nidentification of the drug as being compounded--the first time ever \nthat this information will be required.\n\n  Because of this bill, for the first time ever, the FDA will know who \nthese large sterile compounding entities are and what they are making. \nThe FDA will be given the resources it needs to conduct inspections of \nthose facilities. For the first time ever, hospitals and health care \nfacilities will have the option of purchasing compounded drugs that are \nsubject to rigorous FDA quality standards and oversight. Because this \nbill removes the legal ambiguities of existing law, compounding \npharmacies will no longer fly under the radar. This bill will go a long \nway in ensuring that public health is protected and compounded drugs \nare safe.\n  I specifically thank Chairman Harkin and his staff for including in \nthis bill a provision that I authored requiring the GAO to examine \nwhether States and Federal authorities are doing their jobs to properly \nensure the safety of compounded drugs.\n  Congress needs to continue to keep a close eye on the FDA and this \nindustry, holding them accountable for their new responsibilities. This \nstudy will assist us in carrying out effective oversight of this new \nlaw. We need to ensure that a tragedy like the NECC meningitis outbreak \nis never repeated.\n  With the passage of the Drug Safety and Security Act, today we have a \nclear example of what Congress can accomplish when both sides come \ntogether in a bipartisan fashion. We can protect the public, we can \nhold industry to high but achievable standards, and we can support \nsmall businesses that have been doing the right thing for years.\n  This is a very important, historic piece of legislation. It goes \nright to the heart of what Congress can do to make sure that when drugs \nare in interstate commerce, we are protecting people so that the health \nof their families is, in fact, being protected. That is the essence of \nwhat Congress should be doing.\n  It is a very good day when Congress is working to protect the people \nof our country. Today is one of those days. Throughout the course of \nthis week we are going to have a discussion about the role the Federal \nGovernment has to play in ensuring that the drugs which families in our \ncountry use are, in fact, safe for their consumption, that the \nrepresentations that are made to those families are accurate. We cannot \naccept a rollback of the protections,\n\n[[Page S7969]]\n\nwhich did happen in this area. That exposed families to the kinds of \nrisks that generations ago were common within our country. It is a big \nday. It is a historic piece of legislation.

It has been less than 6 weeks since the President's health \ncare initiative, the Affordable Care Act, was launched. The Web site is \nstill not working, but the Web site will work. Actually, the Web site \nwill be the easiest thing, in my view, that the administration will \ndeal with as they try to solve the problems created by the act itself \nand, frankly, then the problems that were created by the Web site not \nworking when we started.\n  What we see happening already in these 6 weeks is that families are \nlosing their current health care coverage, and certainly the cost, in \nexample after example from my State of Missouri and across the country, \nappears to be going up at substantial levels for many families. A few \nfamilies are lucky enough that they don't have much additional cost but \nnot very many. A lot of families are simply losing the coverage they \nhave had even though the President said, as we all have been reminded \nover and over in recent days: If you like your health care plan, you \ncan keep your health care plan.\n  Apparently, there are a whole lot of caveats on that that weren't \nsaid at the time, because people aren't able to keep their health care \nplan. The Associated Press reported that at least 3.5 million people \nhave received cancellation notices. I heard somebody at the White House \nthe other day say: These individual policies, that is only about 5 \npercent of all the people in the country. Five percent of all of the \npeople in the country are millions and millions of people. Even if \nthere weren't millions of people, if someone is one of the 3.5 million \nfamilies who were recently told their health care policy was \ncancelled--100 percent of their health care policies were cancelled \nbecause they don't have one right now--or at least they were told they \nwon't have one sometime between now and the end of the year.\n  As millions of people are losing their plans, we find out that only a \nfew thousand people are signed up. Reports apparently show that fewer \nthan 50,000 people have been able to successfully get through this \nsystem in 6 weeks, a period where the estimate was 500,000 people. So \nfar we have 50,000 people signing up, not 500,000 people. We have \nmillions of people losing their plans, even though everybody was told \nthat if they like their plan, they will be able to keep their plan.\n  It is estimated now that 7 million people were expected to get \ncoverage by the end of March. Nobody, any longer, thinks that is a \nnumber that will come anywhere close to being achieved.\n  The American people, obviously, would like the President to figure \nout how to live up to the promise that people can keep the health care \nthey have if they like it. A lot of people are weighing in.\n  President Clinton, in the last day or so, says we ought to figure out \na way to keep the promise. This is not a real reach. This was not a \npromise made only one time and accidentally stated, this was a promise \nstated over and over again: If you like your health care plan, you can \nkeep it. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.\n  We are finding that is not true. Whether it is President Clinton who \nsaid we should figure out how to keep that promise, or there are all \nkinds of bills being filed in both the House and the Senate that would \nkeep the promise, what I think we are going to find out is there are \nmany promises in the Affordable Care Act that aren't going to be kept.\n  We already know this has a workplace impact that is not good. People \nare going from full time to part time. People are trying to keep their \nemployee numbers under 50 so they don't have to comply with the law. I \nhave heard from many Missourians who have seen their hours reduced, \nseen their health care premiums rise, seen their options of insurance \nlimited and their policies being cancelled. They deserve to have the \npeople who made this pledge now keep this pledge.\n  Congressional Democrats voted for the law. And there are very few \nlaws one could say congressional Democrats voted for the law. This is a \nlaw that not a single Republican in the House or the Senate supported.\n  There were many alternatives available. High-risk pools would work \nbetter, medical liability reform, expanding the marketplace where one \ncould buy across State lines, more reporting by healthcare providers of \nwhat they charge and what their results are.\n  The idea that there were no other options, which is widely repeated--\nthat the people who don't want to follow the Affordable Care Act don't \nwant to do anything--is simply not true. When I was a Member of the \nHouse of Representatives, I filed a handful of bills, none of which \nwere more than 75 pages long, that would deal with these rifleshot \nthings that would have made the best health care system in the world \nbetter. It wasn't perfect, but it was the best health care system in \nthe world, and I think we are in danger of losing that.\n  The President promised: If you like your doctor, you can keep your \ndoctor. Over and over again, that is not the case. The largest insurer \non the Missouri exchange, on the exchange that Missouri voters have \naccess to, doesn't include the largest hospital system. That means \nthousands of patients won't be able to see the doctors or to go to the \n13 hospitals of the largest health care system from the company that \nwas their likely provider. This was the largest insurer--and as of this \nmoment, the largest insurer in our State, the largest health care \nsystem--not part of their plan. Your insurance company, hospital, long-\ntime doctor, all should be your choice, not the choice of some \ngovernment-dictated health care plan. With only one other insurer \nselling policies in the region where this big hospital system is, \npeople aren't going to be able to go there.\n  Many States have this same problem. Many States have options that \ndon't include many of their hospitals or many of their health care \nproviders.\n  People are beginning to look at this and not only be concerned about \na violated pledge, but being concerned about somebody besides them \ninterfering with a long-term relationship with the hospital people go \nto and the doctor they see. Patients across the country are seeing and \nare likely to continue to see narrower and narrower networks available \nto them as insurers will try to keep costs down.\n  With all of the new mandates in the law, one of the things they can \ncontrol is they can negotiate with the people who would be available to \nsee patients under their plan. That is obviously what has happened.\n  Smaller networks can require patients to travel farther. People are \ndriving by the doctor's office that they went to for years to get to \nthe doctor they now have to go to. People are passing by the hospital \nthat their family may have gone to for generations to get to the \nhospital that now is the only hospital available in their area, \navailable under the exchange. This is going to become the routine for \nAmericans who aren't going to be able to keep the insurance they like. \nThey are not going to be able to keep the doctor they like, and in many \ncases they won't be able to go to the hospital they like.\n  Last week I told stories of several Missourians who had preexisting \nconditions and are going to lose those policies when the Missouri high-\nrisk pool goes out of existence.\n  Another thing we suggested in 2009 was to look for ways to expand the \nhigh-risk pools and make them work even better. They were working \npretty well. The problem was there was always a waiting list to get \ninto the high-risk pool. This was a way to deal with preexisting \nconditions. In a State such as ours where 4,300 people are in the high-\nrisk pool, they pay about 135 percent of the normal premium. That is a \nlittle more than the normal premium, but they are getting insurance \nafter they got sick. This is a high-risk\n\n[[Page S7970]]\n\npool where that has to work, 135 percent. For somebody who didn't have \ninsurance until they got sick or lost their insurance after they got \nsick, that was probably a whole lot better than they are going to do \nright now. They are finding out it is a whole lot better than they are \ngoing to do right now.\n  One of the stories we received this week was from Pam in Oronogo, MO, \njust outside of Joplin. Pam says her oldest son Aaron was born with a \nmedical condition where there was a buildup of fluid inside his skull. \nHe had his first shunt surgery at age 18 months. Her family has a \nfamily business and held onto their insurance through the business as \nlong as they could, because they knew that no one would insure Aaron if \nthey lost their insurance. That is obviously not a reason we would want \nto see perpetuated.\n  Aaron, however, was ready to go to the high-risk pool. After 10 \nyears, their premiums had increased to $2,000 a month with a $10,000 \ndeductible. They were able to get Aaron in the high-risk pool and they \nwere reasonably comfortable with that.\n  With the elimination of the high-risk pool--all of which close \nDecember 31 in every State in the country--Pam and her family have to \ngo to the exchange for Aaron. The exchange has to take Aaron, because \nhe can get into the exchange.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUNT. He can get into the exchange even if he had a preexisting \ncondition. What they found in the exchange is Aaron can no longer use \nhis neurosurgeon from Kansas City, the surgeon he has used for years \nnow. They can't buy a catastrophic policy that would allow them to have \nsome choice and pay some upfront costs on their own so they could have \nthe doctor they are comfortable with. This is where they are. The \ninsurance they had has gone away. The insurance they have doesn't allow \nthem to see the doctor this young man has seen for years with a \ncondition he has had his whole life.\n  The President also promised that premiums would decrease, and that is \nclearly not the case.\n  I look forward to Missourians continuing to let us know the \nchallenges they are having. I look forward to being able to share those \non the floor of the Senate in the next few weeks.\n  One of my constituents from Independence discovered when his wife \ncame home, their policy which has been costing $500 a month now is \ngoing to cost $1,100 a month. She is the office manager of an office \nwith about 20 employees. Their insurance more than doubled.\n  Unfortunately, these aren't the only cases I could talk about today. \nThey are not nearly as limited as we would hope they would be. People \nare finding out that the Affordable Care Act that wasn't good for the \nworkplace is now turning out to be not very good for health care.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/13/senate-section/article/S7970-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7970-S7971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     DRUG QUALITY AND SECURITY ACT\n\n  Mr. BURR. We have heard about horror stories. I want to talk about \nanother one, the bill that is in front of the Senate today, the Drug \nQuality and Security Act.\n  The Senate has an important opportunity to advance balanced \nbipartisan legislation on behalf of our Nation's patients. The Drug \nQuality and Security Act will respond to the tragic events surrounding \nlast year's meningitis outbreak and will strengthen and improve our \nnational pharmaceutical supply chain. Last year's unfortunate \ncompounding meningitis outbreak has reminded us that had the early \nwarning signs been heeded, we might have been able to prevent or \nmitigate the crisis in the first place.\n  In light of what Congress has learned since the outbreak first \noccurred last fall, this bipartisan legislation includes provisions \nthat respond to and take a big step toward addressing the issues which \nled to the unfortunate pharmaceutical compounding tragedy over 1 year \nago.\n  America's patients expect and deserve the peace of mind that \nmedicines they take are safe and effective. FDA's repeated warnings of \ncounterfeited drugs making their way into our prescription drug supply \nchain and the increased number of pharmaceutical thefts are the early \nwarning signs of a potential and growing threat that could \nsignificantly compromise or endanger the health and well-being of \npatients across our Nation.\n  In recent years, States have responded by putting new requirements in \nplace. At a time when we should be working to lower the cost of health \ncare, this increasing patchwork of State and regulatory requirements \nis, instead, driving up the cost of health care in America.\n  For more than 1 year I have worked with Senator Michael Bennet and my \ncolleagues on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee on bipartisan legislation to address these problems and to \nstrengthen the safety, security, and accountability of our Nation's \npharmaceutical drug supply chain.\n  The Drug Quality and Security Act, which we have before us today, \nincludes provisions that will establish strong, uniform prescription \ndrug-tracing standards that reflect today's realities and ensure a \nsafer and more secure pharmaceutical drug supply chain.\n  The Drug Quality and Security Act establishes a uniform electronic \nunit-level system over the next decade that will increase the security \nand ensure a safer pharmaceutical drug supply chain from manufacturers \nall the way to dispensers. This legislation will require trading \npartners to be authorized to pass and receive information as part of \ntheir transactions. It raises the wholesale distribution licensing \nstandard. It establishes licensure standards for third-party logistics \nproviders and requires suspect and illegitimate products to be \nappropriately handled.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Alexander \nfor their leadership on this very important bipartisan bill. I \nespecially would like to recognize Senator Bennet, who has been a \nstrong partner throughout the crafting of this legislation. For more \nthan 1 year we have worked together on this bipartisan legislation with \nour colleagues and have finally achieved an important balance with this \nbill.\n  I might add we were told this couldn't be done. We were told this was \ntoo difficult. But for 1\\1/2\\ years we have tackled this objective. \nCongress has the opportunity to proactively put in place uniform, \nworkable standards that will allow stakeholders greater regulatory \ncertainty and give patients the confidence they deserve in the safety \nand security of our Nation's pharmaceutical drug supply chain.\n  Congress's opportunities are twofold because this legislation is also \nour chance to respond to a crisis that impacted the lives of hundreds \nof patients nationwide, and I hope my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting the Drug Quality and Security Act.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  To follow up the conversations on today's bill, I listened to my good \nfriend Senator Blunt talk about Aaron, one of those Americans caught in \nthe crosshairs of the Affordable Care Act and its unintended \nconsequences. I was home this weekend and I was stopped by five \nindividuals--five individuals--with practically the identical story. \nThey came up and said: Richard, I was covered. I had insurance. I have \nno preexisting conditions, nor does anybody in my family. I had a \n$10,000 deductible insurance policy that cost me about $450 a month, \nand I had the security of knowing it was there. I just got my new \nnotice and my insurance went to a $15,000 deductible and my monthly \npremium is $1,440. These are five individuals--five different \nfamilies--but with a similar story.\n  I think of the yearlong debate we had on the Affordable Care Act and \nthe claims that were made: reduced premiums, bring down health care \ncosts, provide coverage for those who don't have it. Today what do we \nsee? Today's snapshot, and this may change: dysfunctional Web site, 5 \nmillion people who have been notified they have lost their insurance, a \nvery tepid enrollment of individuals, and what has gotten lost in \nreality is that there are hundreds of thousands of Americans\n\n[[Page S7971]]\n\njust like the five who came up to me this weekend. They are still \ngetting insurance, but their deductible went up to $15,000 and their \npremium went up to $1,440 a month.\n  Tell me, where in that scenario is this affordable? Tell me, where in \nthis process did they get a better plan than they had before? Their \ndeductible went up $5,000. That means the first $15,000 of their health \ncare is coming right out of their pocket and they are paying $1,440 a \nmonth to have the security of knowing there is insurance after that.\n  Clearly, these are five Americans who would tell me this falls \nwoefully short of the promises made to them. I would be willing to bet \nin every State, in every House district around the country, we are \ngoing to continue to hear stories about this.\n  We will, I am sure, debate heavily where we move to from here. But \ndon't forget that under this bill, now that we have extended the \nenrollment period to March 31, under the law every insurer who bids to \nbe in the exchange, starting April 1 of next year through April 27, has \nto submit their bids for 2015. Let me repeat that. For every insurer \nthat wants to be in the exchange, starting April 1 of next year through \nApril 27, they will have to submit their premium bids for 2015. They \nare going to do that having no experience with the pool of insured \nlives because we have extended until March 31 the enrollment. That \nassumes the Web site gets fixed and that people are going to enroll. \nWith little actuarial history, these insurance companies are going to \nhave to bid for 2015. Imagine what the premium cost is going to be in \n2015 when it is not 5 percent of the American people now in the \nexchange but it is 100 percent--it is all the employers that are \nimpacted by 2015 prices.\n  I have always been taught there are signs you should pay attention \nto. When five people come to you and say: Listen, my deductible went \nfrom $10,000 to $15,000 and my premium went from $450 to $1,440, that \nis a warning sign. We ought to listen to it.\n  We still have a chance to fix this. Most important, as Senator Blunt \ntalked about, it means when you have a high-risk pool in Missouri and \nNorth Carolina, you let them keep the high-risk pool. We can manage it \nmuch better on a State level than we can in nationalizing and doing \ntop-down health care in this country.\n  This will not be the end of the conversation on the Affordable Care \nAct. The American people deserve better and this Congress must produce \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, there is an old expression used by many \nHoosiers and others across America that is time tested: Your word is \nyour bond. In Indiana, as in so many other places across our country, \nwe value honesty and good old-fashioned truth-telling, even if it hurts \na little bit to hear the truth.\n  Having spent the previous 4 days in Indiana listening to Hoosiers, it \nis clear to me many people in my State--and as I am reading, \nnationwide--are pretty fed up with Washington right now, and they have \ngood reason to be. They are frustrated because the promises that were \nmade to them are being broken and outright guarantees have been \ndisregarded.\n  President Obama, both before and after his signature legislation--now \ncalled ObamaCare--passed, promised all Americans they could keep their \nhealth insurance plans if they liked those plans. It was a promise \nrepeated over and over again. For many Americans it was the sole reason \nthey supported the Affordable Care Act. But the President's guarantee, \nannounced publicly by him several times, simply was not true.\n  In recent months, millions of Americans have received notifications \ntheir plans are being canceled because of the ObamaCare law, and \nreports indicate now the White House has known this for over 3 years--\nthat these cancellations were coming. So when the American people found \nout the White House knew the bad news was coming all along, they were, \nto put it mildly, not happy.\n  It is clear that some of those who voted for ObamaCare and continued \nto support it are now agreeing with the majority of Americans that the \nPresident's health care law simply is not working. One such Member has \nfloated the idea of having the Government Accountability Office and the \ninspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services \nconduct ``a complete, thorough investigation to determine the causes of \nthe design and implementation failures of HealthCare\n.gov.''\n  We need to talk about the fundamental policies and provisions that \nundermine this law going forward.\n  Fixing the Web site, if that happens--it can happen and eventually it \nwould have to happen--is not the real problem. The real problem is a \nflawed design. Two Democrats have introduced a bill entitled ``Keeping \nthe Affordable Care Act Promise Act.''\n  A House Democrat recently stated, ``I think the President was grossly \nmisleading to the American public'' when he promised Americans they \ncould keep their health care coverage if they liked it. Even former \nPresident Bill Clinton has said he thinks the President's pledge to \nallow Americans to keep their coverage should be honored.\n  In an interview this week, former President Clinton said:\n\n       So I personally believe, even if it takes a change in the \n     law, the President should honor the commitment that the \n     Federal Government made to those people and let them keep \n     what they got.\n\n  There is a growing admission from the supporters of ObamaCare that we \nare dealing with more than just a Web site glitch; that we are dealing \nwith fundamental policy design flaws. So I agree with President \nClinton. Regardless of whether you support ObamaCare, there should be \n100 percent bipartisan support for letting Americans keep what they \nhave been promised--that they can keep their existing health care \ninsurance plans if they like them.\n  It is time to acknowledge, however, as Senate minority leader Mitch \nMcConnell said yesterday, that it goes beyond this; that the Affordable \nCare Act is beyond repair. This disastrous law needs to be repealed and \nreplaced with real reforms that drive down the cost of health care, \nincrease the quality of care, and put patients, not Washington \nbureaucrats, in charge of their health care decisions.\n  Unfortunately, this President and Senate Democrats have made it clear \nthey will never allow a full repeal to pass, despite all the broken \npromises to the American people and despite the fact the law simply \nisn't working.\n  Given this reality, the appropriate step, I believe, and one with \ngrowing, bipartisan support is for a 1-year delay of the implementation \nof ObamaCare.\n  I have offered a bill to delay the individual mandate--to join with \nthe decision already made by the President to have a 1-year delay of \nthe employer mandate--so all Americans can have the same relief, not \njust business. By delaying the mandates--all the mandates in this \nhealth care law--we can give the American people a fundamental choice \nwhen they go to the polls in 2014: continue ObamaCare or replace it \nwith sensible, affordable reforms that drive down the cost of care, \nincrease the quality, and, most important, put patients, not Washington \nbureaucrats, in control of their health care decisions and their health \nfuture.\n  In closing, I would say this to the President: Your word needs to be \nyour bond. As Albert Einstein once said: Whoever is careless with the \ntruth in small matters cannot be trusted with important matters.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. WARREN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. WARREN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, it hasn't been even a month since the \nend of the Republican shutdown of the government, and they are already \nback at trying to paralyze the government again.\n  Yesterday, the Republicans blocked an up-or-down vote on the \nnomination\n\n[[Page S7972]]\n\nof Nina Pillard to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. This filibuster \ncomes just 1 week after Republicans filibustered the nomination of \nPatricia Millett to the DC Circuit, and less than 1 year after \nRepublicans filibustered Caitlin Halligan, who eventually just gave up \nand withdrew her nomination.\n  Republicans now hold the dubious distinction of having filibustered \nall three women that President Obama nominated to the DC Circuit. \nCollectively, these women have diverse experiences in private practice, \nin government, and in public interest law. Between them, they have \nargued an amazing 45 cases before the Supreme Court and have \nparticipated in many more. All three have the support of a majority of \nSenators. So why have they been filibustered? The reason is simple. \nThey are caught in a fight over the future of our courts--a fight over \nwhether the courts will be a neutral forum that decides every dispute \nfairly or whether the courts will be stacked in favor of the wealthy \nand the powerful.\n  Every day in Congress we deal with the influence of powerful groups \nand their armies of lobbyists. But in our democracy, when we write \nlaws, sometimes we can push back on that power. In our democracy we \nhave tools that can be used in the legislative process--tools such as \nopen debate, public opinion, and political accountability, tools that \ncan help the people win these fights. I saw it happen up close in the \n2008 financial crisis when we were able to get a strong consumer \nfinancial protection bureau despite the efforts of the large financial \ninstitutions to kill it.\n  But the story doesn't end when Congress passes a law. Powerful \ninterests don't just give up. They shift their fight to the courts \nbecause they know that if they can weaken or overturn a law in court, \nthey turn defeat into victory. If they can break the courts by putting \nenough sympathetic judges in lifetime positions, a friendly judicial \nsystem will give them the chance to undermine any laws they don't like. \nThat is already happening in the Supreme Court. Three well-respected \nlegal scholars, including Judge Richard Posner of the Seventh Circuit, \na distinguished judge and conservative Reagan appointee, recently \nexamined almost 20,000 Supreme Court cases from the last 65 years. The \nresearchers concluded that the five conservative justices currently \nsitting on the Supreme Court are in the top 10 most procorporate \njustices in more than half a century. Justices Alito and Roberts are \nnumber one and number two.\n  Take a look at the win rate of the national Chamber of Commerce in \ncases before the Supreme Court. According to the Constitutional \nAccountability Center, the national Chamber moved from a 43-percent win \nrate during the last 5 terms of the Burger court, to a 56-percent win \nrate under the Rehnquist court, to a 70-percent rate under the Roberts \ncourt. Follow this procorporate trend to its logical conclusion, and \npretty soon you will have a Supreme Court that is a wholly owned \nsubsidiary of big business.\n  The powerful interests that work to rig the Supreme Court also want \nto rig the lower courts. The DC Circuit is a particular target because \nthat court has the power to overturn agency regulations. If a business \ndoesn't like it when the agencies implement the will of Congress, they \ntry to undermine those agencies through the DC Circuit.\n  In the next 5 years, the DC Circuit will decide some of the most \nimportant cases of our time--including cases which will decide whether \nWall Street reform will have real bite or whether it will just be \ntoothless. Swaps dealers, the securities industry, the Business \nRoundtable, and the Chamber of Commerce are all lining up to challenge \nthe new rules that agencies have written to try to put some teeth into \nWall Street reform and other laws. These big-industry players want \nbusiness-friendly judges to help bail them out.\n  So let's be clear. Nine of the 14 judges on the DC Circuit who \ncurrently hear cases were appointed by Republican Presidents. The \nPresident with the most appointees on that court right now is Ronald \nReagan.\n  This lopsided court has been busy striking down environmental \nregulations that stop companies from spewing mercury into the air we \nbreathe, striking down investor protections that hold corporate boards \naccountable, striking down a requirement for employers to provide \naccess to birth control under ObamaCare. Each of these regulations \nexists because Congress has passed laws telling the agencies to write \nthem.\n  It is true that sometimes an agency may get it wrong, but these days \nthe DC Circuit seems to be finding more and more ways to help bail out \nthe businesses that never wanted to be regulated in the first place.\n  Republicans have noticed what is going on with this lopsided court. \nThey would like to keep things the way they are, and they have not been \nsubtle about it. Many Republicans have talked openly of their \nopposition to any new judges to fill the three vacancies on this court \nprecisely because the new nominees will give the court more balance and \nfairness. Republicans may prefer a rigged court that gives their \ncorporate friends and their armies of lobbyists and lawyers a second \nchance to undercut the will of Congress, but that is not the job of \njudges. Judges aren't supposed to make law. Judges aren't supposed to \ntilt politically one way or the other.\n  Republicans may not like Wall Street reform. They may not like \nObamaCare. But Congress passed those laws. President Obama signed those \nlaws. President Obama ran for reelection on those laws, while his \nopponent pledged to repeal them--and his opponent lost by nearly 5 \nmillion votes. It is not up to judges to overturn those laws or their \nassociated regulations just because they don't fit the judges' policy \npreferences.\n  There are three vacancies on the DC Circuit, and the President has \nnominated three impressive people to fill those vacancies--including \nPatricia Millett and Nina Pillard. These nominees are not ideological. \nThey have extraordinary legal resumes and have received bipartisan \nsupport from top litigators around the country. They are among the top \nlegal minds of this generation.\n  This is how the President plans to push back against efforts to tilt \nour judicial system: by nominating judges who will be judges--judges \nwho will be fair, judges who will be evenhanded, judges who will have \nthe diversity of professional experience to understand and consider all \nsides of an issue.\n  I understand that Republicans may prefer to keep the DC Circuit \nexactly as it is. But article II, section 2 of the Constitution says \nthe President of the United States nominates judges, with the advice \nand consent of the Senate. There is no clause that says, except when \nthat President is a Democrat. Democrats allowed President George W. \nBush to put four very conservative judges on the DC Circuit. All four \nare still serving, and one is Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  There are three vacancies in the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. The \nPresident of the United States has nominated judges to fill those \nvacancies. That is his job, and it is the job of the Senate to confirm \nhighly qualified, independent judges. That is how our system works. \nThat is what the Constitution demands.\n  Republicans these days do not seem to like that. They keep looking \nfor ways to keep this President from doing his job. So far they have \nshut down the government, they have filibustered people he has \nnominated to fill his administration, and they are now filibustering \njudges to block him from filling any of the vacancies with highly \nqualified people. We need to call out these filibusters for what they \nare--naked attempts to nullify the results of the last Presidential \nelection, to force us to govern as though President Obama had not won \nthe 2012 election.\n  President Obama did win the 2012 election--by 5 million votes. He has \ndone what the Constitution requires him to do--nominated highly \nqualified people to fill open vacancies on the Federal bench. If \nRepublicans continue to filibuster these highly qualified nominees for \nno reason other than to nullify the President's constitutional \nauthority, then Senators not only have the right to change the \nfilibuster rules, Senators have a duty to change the filibuster rules. \nWe cannot turn our back on the Constitution. We cannot abdicate our \noath of office. We have a responsibility to protect and defend our \ndemocracy, and that includes protecting the neutrality of our courts\n\n[[Page S7973]]\n\nand preserving the constitutional power of the President to nominate \nhighly qualified people to court vacancies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/13/senate-section/article/S7973-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, the question of the week is, more \nimportant than apologizing, will President Obama live up to his promise \nthat Americans can keep the care they have and like? Democrats are \nclearly running away from embracing this law and are suggesting the \nPresident live up to his promise as well. Yesterday former President \nClinton said:\n\n       I personally believe, even if it takes a change to the law, \n     the President should honor the commitment the Federal \n     Government made to those people and let them keep what they \n     got.\n\n  That is from former President Clinton yesterday in a interview he \ndid.\n  More and more we see people on the Democratic side of the aisle \ncoming forward, acknowledging what many of us have been acknowledging \nfor a long time; that is, this is not living up to expectations. We \nneed a timeout. It is clearly not working, it is not ready for prime \ntime, and it is obvious that we need to acknowledge that and come up \nwith plan B.\n  Senator Durbin, here in the Senate, said in an interview Tuesday that \nthe cancellations of their coverage that people might face under \nObamaCare and the statement that people could keep their plans ``should \nhave been clarified.''\n  Democratic Representative Kurt Schrader from Oregon thinks the \nPresident was grossly misleading to the American public and said:\n\n       I think the President was grossly misleading the American \n     public.\n\n  Senator Feinstein, who is not up for reelection, is supporting \nlegislation to allow individuals to maintain enrollment in the plans \nthey like.\n  These mistruths are clearly affecting the President's credibility. \nPresident Obama's approval ratings have dipped to a record low. A poll \nfrom Quinnipiac University that was released shows respondents \ndisapprove of the President's job performance by a 54-to-39 margin. His \napproval rating of 39 percent is worse than his previous alltime low of \n41 percent in the Quinnipiac survey done previously. Further, more \npeople--52 percent--say the President is not honest and trustworthy.\n  We are on the verge of another misstatement from this administration \nwhere they make promises to the American people that they do not meet. \nLast month the administration promised they would have healthcare.gov \nfixed by the end of November. It appears unlikely, according to today's \nWashington Post, where a headline reads: ``Troubled HealthCare.gov \nunlikely to work fully by end of November.''\n\n  For proof that this Web site design has been a failure of leadership, \ncompare it to Cyber Monday volume at amazon.com in 2012. According to \namazon.com's press release, it sold 27 million items on Cyber Monday, \nor 306 items per second. That is how the private sector has been able \nto process huge volumes of data and requests. If we compare and \ncontrast that with the rollout of ObamaCare and healthcare.com, it is a \nstunning failure--even epic in terms of the inability of that whole \nprogram to function with any level of competence.\n  It is clear that technology exists to fix the Web site to handle high \nvolumes, but, as the President has said, the health care law is more \nthan just a Web site, and that is where most of us come down on this \nissue. This is a flawed policy that is causing millions of Americans to \nlose the health care they like. Most of us know someone who has had his \nor her health care canceled by ObamaCare, and it is going to get worse. \nThe Associated Press reports that at least 3.5 million have received \ncancellation notices, and that number is expected to increase to tens \nof millions of people. As Americans--millions more--are losing their \nplans, only thousands are signing up through ObamaCare.\n  Constituents are encouraged to visit our Web site at \nrepublican.senate.gov/yourstory to submit their stories about how this \nis impacting them personally. The American people deserve to have their \nstories heard, and Americans deserve to have the President and \ncongressional Democrats keep their promise.\n  We believe what former President Clinton said yesterday is correct; \nthat is, President Obama should honor the commitment the Federal \nGovernment made to those people and let them keep what they have. That \nis essentially where we are today. I would simply ask rhetorically, \nwhat is the President going to do to address and honor the promise he \nmade to the American people that they can keep what they have?\n  Increasingly, more and more Democrats--and, of course, there are many \nof us on this side of the aisle who predicted this would happen a long \ntime ago--realize this was an ill-conceived policy. I have maintained \nfor a long time that it was built upon a faulty foundation; therefore, \nyou cannot just fix a Web site or have an IT specialist come in and \nexpect this to get better. This is a flawed policy, and it is already \nhaving profound and harmful impacts on the American people. We believe \nmany more people will be harmed in the future as the insurance is fully \nimplemented.\n  The best we can do for the American people in order to minimize the \nimpact and harm is to put off, suspend, delay--whatever you want to \ncall it--the implementation of ObamaCare. Frankly, the best we could do \nin the long run is pivot away from this failed policy and move in a \ndirection that actually does address some of the fundamental problems \nwe have with health care in this country today.\n  There is a whole list of solutions Republicans have advanced and put \nforward in the past--for example, allow people to buy insurance across \nState lines and create interstate competition so we have insurance \ncompanies competing with each other. Obviously, if we have competition \nand the forces of the market at work, it helps to bring down costs and \nprices.\n  Another example is to allow small businesses to join larger groups to \nget the benefit of group purchasing power--to pool, if you will. That \nis something we have been proposing for some time, and it has been \nconsistently defeated by Democrats in Congress. Other examples are \nreducing the cost of defensive medicine by ending the junk lawsuits \nthat clog up our legal system and drive up the cost of health care, \nallowing an expanded use of health savings accounts and those types of \nvehicles that are out there for people today to put money aside for \ntheir health care needs; allowing people to have a refundable tax \ncredit so they can buy their own insurance, which would give them more \nchoices, create more competition, and, again, put downward pressure on \nthe cost and price of health care in this country.\n  Those are commonsense step-by-step solutions that we think would work \nso much better than having one-sixth of our entire economy, which is \nwhat health care represents, taken over by the Federal Government. \nPolitical command and control in Washington, DC, is driving the \ndecisionmaking for Americans across the country. As we have already \nseen, the Federal Government does not do complicated tasks very well, \nand the Federal Government doesn't do comprehensive tasks very well.\n\n[[Page S7974]]\n\n  Everybody talked about a comprehensive solution to this problem. \nClearly, we have problems in America today that need to be addressed. \nWe have a lot of people who don't have health care, and that needs to \nbe fixed. We have people with preexisting conditions, and that needs to \nbe addressed. There are solutions to those problems that don't include \nand don't entail having the Federal Government take over one-sixth of \nthe American economy, which is what happened with ObamaCare. We are \nseeing the impacts and the results of that today.\n  I suggest we take a timeout and make a conscious decision to move in \na different direction--a direction that will lead to lower costs, \nhigher quality of care, allow people to keep the plan they like if they \nlike it, allow people to keep the doctor they like, and keep the cost \nof health care at an affordable level.\n  One thing we have seen since ObamaCare passed and is now in the \nprocess of being implemented is that the promise that people would see \ntheir health care costs go down, not up--that promise is another broken \npromise because what we are seeing in America today is canceled \npolicies. As people try to get new policies, there are increased costs. \nWe are seeing that in the individual marketplace. When the President \nwas campaigning for his health care law, he said he would drive the \ncosts down for families by $2,500 per family. Yet we have seen the cost \nper family increase since he took office by $2,500.\n  We have a cloud hanging over our economy right now because of this \nmassive new regulation with a massive amount of government mandates. \nDue to government-approved insurance, the workweek has been redefined \nfrom a 40-hour workweek to a 30-hour workweek. We have a lot \nof employers who are creating part-time jobs instead of full-time jobs. \nIn order to avoid the mandates and requirements and costs associated \nwith ObamaCare, employers are hiring people to get under that 30-hour \nworkweek. There are a lot of people who are hired to work 29 hours a \nweek. Well, Americans can't take care of their families and meet the \nneeds they have in their personal and family budgets on 29 hours a \nweek, so more and more people are having to get more than one job. In \nfact, some estimates show that the majority of jobs that have been \ncreated over the last year have been part-time jobs, not full-time \njobs. That is the impact this is having on the overall economy.\n\n  If we are serious about getting the economy growing and expanding \nagain and creating good-paying jobs for middle-class Americans, there \nare a number of things we can do to create that kind of economic \ngrowth. What we have seen of late is a growth rate that hovers between \n1 and 2 percent. The economy is lethargic and sluggish compared to any \nhistoric average. We continue to have chronic high unemployment. If we \nfactor in that the labor participation force is literally at the lowest \nlevel in the last 35 years, we would have to go back to the \nadministration of President Carter. At that time there were fewer \npeople working as a percentage of the entire workforce. If we factor \nthat in, we have an economy that is in a very bad way.\n  As I said, there are a whole series of things that need to be done to \nget the economy growing and expanding at a faster rate, create more \njobs, and increase the take-home pay for middle-class Americans. We \nreally need to start over with Obamacare.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. I suggest it starts with shutting this down and starting \nover. We need to create more options, more choices, and more \ncompetition in the health care economy so people can get away from the \nsticker shock we have seen with ObamaCare and get costs down. We need \nto get away from these cancellation notices that are going out and \nallow people to keep the care and doctor they have and like. Because of \nthe broken promises under ObamaCare, that is not happening.\n  Until we decide this was the wrong direction and pivot and go in a \ndifferent direction, we are going to continue to see the results we \nhave today--higher costs, more cancellations, people not being able to \nkeep the care they like or the doctor they like. We can do better and \nshould do better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I would like to talk for a few minutes \nabout a subject that will affect all of us at some point in our lives; \nthat is, the safety of our medicine.\n  If my child or wife urgently needed medicine, I would have a number \nof questions: Will my loved one get well? What is going to happen? But \nI should never have to ask a question about whether the medicine my \nfamily takes is safe and whether it is what the doctor says it should \nbe.\n  More than 1,000 patients and their families across Minnesota found it \nnecessary to ask that question last year during the meningitis \noutbreak. They had to ask that question because the contaminated \nmedicine they received could have caused them enormous harm. More than \n700 patients across the country got sick and more than 60 died after \nreceiving these contaminated injections produced by a large-scale \ncompounding pharmacy in Massachusetts that was essentially an \nunregulated drug manufacturer.\n  In Minnesota we specialize in medical innovation. We have some of the \nbest doctors and health care systems and biomedical pioneers anywhere \nin the world. Our Nation has an incredible capacity for innovation and \ndevelopment in this field. There is no possible explanation that can \njustify the fact that more than 17,000 vials of contaminated medicine \nwere shipped to providers throughout the country. That should simply \nnot be happening. That is why the legislation we are set to pass, which \nI helped to write, is so important. It will go a long way toward making \ncompounded medication safer and preventing another outbreak like the \none we had a little over a year ago.\n  Many people don't know what pharmacy compounding is--including many \npatients who have received compounded medicine. Compounding is a \ntraditional practice of a pharmacy where a pharmacist makes a new drug \nor takes an existing one and changes it based on a particular patient's \nneeds. If a patient needs a drug and is allergic to one ingredient in \nit, the pharmacy can remake the drug, or compound it, without that \ningredient based on a doctor's prescription. Pharmacists and pharmacies \nare regulated by the States.\n  This practice of tailoring medications for individual people is \nincredibly important, and it has always been a part of practicing \npharmacy. It will continue under the bill we have written. But that is \nnot what happened in Massachusetts last year; instead, a facility \nexploited a legal loophole to make thousands of doses of a product that \nwas not FDA approved and sold it to hospitals and clinics across the \ncountry without receiving a prescription. As I said, more than 700 \npatients got sick after receiving that medicine and 64 people died. \nThat is why my colleagues and I have worked so hard over the past year \nto develop the bill before us today, the Drug Quality and Security Act, \nwhich takes important steps for preventing this kind of outbreak in the \nfuture.\n  I would like to take a moment to thank my friends on both sides of \nthe aisle and in both the Senate and the House who have worked so hard \non this legislation.\n  I thank chairman Tom Harkin for his leadership and for the bipartisan \nHELP Committee staff process that was crucial to producing this \nlegislation.\n  I thank ranking member Lamar Alexander and Senator Pat Roberts for \ntheir commitment to getting this bill right.\n  I thank the staff who worked so hard on this bill. Specifically, I \nthank members of Senator Harkin's staff: Jenelle Krishnamoorthy, \nElizabeth Jungman, and Nathan Brown. I also thank Senator Alexander's \nstaff: Mary Sumpter-Lapinski and Grace Stuntz, as well as Jennifer \nBoyer, who works for Senator Roberts. Their hard work and dedication \nhelped to develop this important legislation.\n  I also thank Hannah Katch, a member of my staff, who has worked \ntirelessly on this bill.\n  I thank Chairman Upton and Ranking Member Waxman and their colleagues \nin the House for their work, as\n\n[[Page S7975]]\n\nwell as the many stakeholders who have worked productively with us to \ndevelop and improve this proposal. In particular, I counted on input \nfrom the Minnesota Board of Pharmacy, the Minnesota Pharmacist \nAssociation, Thrifty White Pharmacy, and many other experts and \npharmacists in Minnesota who helped us get this bill right.\n  Is our legislation perfect? No. There were a number of provisions in \nthe bill that we passed out of the HELP Committee that would have \nprovided additional safety and quality assurances for patients, but in \norder to come to a compromise with the House of Representatives, our \nlegislation changed. Although the final bill does not include \neverything I would have liked, the bill before us today will take an \nenormous step forward for patient safety.\n  The bill will reinstate the law that allows the Food and Drug \nAdministration to regulate large-scale compounders that have exploited \na loophole in the law in order to act effectively as unregulated drug \nmanufacturers. It will also give hospitals and health systems the \noption of buying compounded products from facilities that are inspected \nby the FDA and are complying with the FDA's quality standards. And it \nwill do all of that without changing the rules for traditional \npharmacies, which will continue to be regulated by their State boards \nof pharmacy.\n  Specifically, our bill creates a new option for facilities that want \nto provide compounded drugs to hospitals and health centers. These \nentities, called ``outsourcing facilities,'' will be inspected by the \nFDA and will have high quality standards. The hospitals that buy from \nthese facilities will be able to trust that the compounded medicine \nthey buy from outsourcing facilities is safe.\n  If a compounder chooses not to be either a traditional pharmacy or an \noutsourcing facility, the FDA will be responsible for making sure that \ncompounder complies with the normal requirements for pharmaceutical \nmanufacturers. Those are the options. Unlike what we saw in \nMassachusetts, these facilities will no longer be able to occupy an \nunregulated no man's land. So under the new law, there will be \ntraditional pharmacies, which will continue to be regulated at the \nState level; outsourcing facilities, which the FDA will oversee; and \npharmaceutical manufacturers, which will be regulated by the FDA, as \nthey have been.\n  I am also pleased that the bill we wrote on compounding is paired \ntoday with another bill on the drug supply chain, which is aimed at \nmaking sure that the FDA-approved medicine that patients receive is \nsafe and has not been tampered with. By creating a national system to \ntrack drugs from the time they leave the manufacturer until they are \ndispensed to patients, this legislation will provide certainty that our \nmedicines are what they say they are.\n  My colleagues, Senators Bennet and Burr, have been working on this \nproposal for more than 2 years, and I thank them for their work and \ncongratulate them on this important achievement.\n  My home State of Minnesota is a model for pharmacy practice \nnationwide. Not only does our State have important protections for \ncompounding pharmacies that have kept the medicine made in Minnesota \nsafe, but Minnesota pharmacists have also led the Nation in developing \ninnovative new ways of helping their patients get the right medicine at \nthe right time.\n  For example, pharmacists at Hennepin County Medical Center in \nMinneapolis found that when a pharmacist reviewed the prescriptions for \npatients with complex conditions before they were discharged from the \nhospital, those patients had fewer problems related to their medicine \nand were 50 percent less likely to be readmitted to the hospital. So it \nsaved a lot of money. It cost HCMC about $112,000 for pharmacists to \nprovide this service, and it saved the hospital nearly $600,000. This \nis exactly--exactly--the kind of innovation that we are known for in \nMinnesota, and our pharmacists are on the front lines of this kind of \nreform and discovery.\n  The pharmacists at HCMC, and those around Minnesota, do incredibly \nimportant work. They provide access to needed medicine for thousands of \npatients every day. Those pharmacists and their patients must be able \nto trust that the medicine is safe and it will work. The Drug Quality \nand Security Act will take an important step toward preventing another \noutbreak like the one we saw last year, and I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in passing the Drug Quality and Security Act into law.\n  Thank you, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, in a front page story yesterday, the \nWall Street Journal reported that fewer than 50,000 people had \nsuccessfully used the Federal ObamaCare Web site to enroll in a private \nhealth plan--less than 50,000. Meanwhile, we know that millions of \nAmericans are already getting a cancellation notice from their \ninsurance company telling them that their current policy--even if they \nlike it--will no longer be available. In other words, if you like what \nyou have, it turns out you cannot keep it--as millions of people are \nfinding.\n  No less a luminary in the Democratic Party than President Clinton has \nsaid that ObamaCare should be reformed to let people maintain their \ncurrent health insurance. And we will see some votes in the House of \nRepresentatives as soon as Friday on that proposition, helping the \nPresident keep his promise to the American people that if you like what \nyou have, you can keep it, which currently has proven not to be the \ncase.\n  Just a month ago, Democrats of all stripes were declaring that Obama \nwas the settled law of the land and condemning attempts on our side of \nthe aisle to actually reform it. Now we are seeing more and more of our \nfriends across the aisle contemplating serious changes aimed at fixing \nsome of the law's myriad problems. Some, but not all, of the problems \nwith ObamaCare have become painfully obvious--some, because I think \nmost people probably think ObamaCare has already been implemented, \nwhen, in fact, it has only begun to be implemented.\n  But we know ObamaCare is forcing people to lose their health \ninsurance and/or their doctor. It may be that even in the exchanges, \nthe hospital which they prefer to be treated at or the doctor from whom \nthey would prefer to have their care, they will not be available on the \nexchanges.\n  We also know that ObamaCare is raising health care premiums. Again, \nthe President promised that if we passed ObamaCare, we would see a \nreduction in the premiums for a family of four of about $2,500. Instead \nof seeing premiums go down, we are seeing premiums go up.\n  We know that Medicare and Medicaid remain on an unsustainable path, \nand we are actually seeing, in many States, the States opting to expand \nthe Medicaid program, when they cannot even care for or pay for the \npeople who are currently in the Medicaid program.\n  We have found that organized labor has gone to the White House. They \nsaid that because of the incentives in ObamaCare, many full-time \nemployees were now being put on part-time work in order to avoid some \nof the penalties associated with ObamaCare.\n  We know that in the medical device sector--one of the most innovative \nparts of health care today--those jobs are moving offshore. They are \nmoving outside of the United States, and it is stifling innovation, \nthis medical device tax which is part of the pay-for of ObamaCare.\n  But here is another issue that has not gotten much attention lately. \nI was a little surprised when I came across this article in the \nAtlantic magazine, but the truth is the ObamaCare structure penalizes \npeople for getting married. Certain couples who do qualify for the \nObamaCare subsidies right now would lose those subsidies if they got \nmarried. In some cases, the ObamaCare marriage penalty could amount to \nthousands of dollars. So just when you think things could not quite get \nany worse, you find out they do.\n  As if all these problems were not bad enough, ObamaCare has also \ncreated a magnet for fraud and corruption in the so-called navigators \nprogram. You will remember, the navigators were created in order to \nhelp people sign up on the exchanges. But we know the navigators will \nbe collecting sensitive tax and personal information--medical, both \nphysical and mental health information--from folks all across the \ncountry as\n\n[[Page S7976]]\n\nthey try to navigate ObamaCare. But we also know, because the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services admitted this last week, that they are not \nsubject to any kind of background check, including a criminal \nbackground check. As a matter of fact, I think Secretary Sebelius \nsurprised an awful lot of people when she admitted that people \nparticipating in the navigator program could possibly be convicted \nfelons because there is simply no screening mechanism to bar them from \nparticipating in the process and no background check whatsoever.\n  Then we have learned, as a result of some creative journalists, that \nnavigators, including those in my home State of Texas, were actively \nencouraging people to break the law as a process of signing up for the \nObamaCare exchanges.\n  It is simply astounding that the administration is urging the \nAmerican people to give their Social Security numbers and sensitive \npersonal information to people who have not been properly vetted. \nYesterday I called on the President to suspend the navigators program, \nand I want to reiterate that call today. He needs to end it, at least \nuntil basic precautions are taken to prevent identity theft and \ncorruption and fraud.\n  Given the lack of Federal background checks and other safeguards, \nthis program is an invitation to fraud and identity theft.\n  As with so many other aspects of ObamaCare, the problems with the \nnavigators program are the result of politically motivated decisions. \nDo not just take my word for it. Consider the scathing indictment that \nwas recently issued by Michael Astrue, who served as HHS general \ncounsel from 1989 to 1992. More recently, he served as a commissioner \nfor Social Security, from 2007 to 2013.\n  Writing in the Weekly Standard, Mr. Astrue points out:\n\n       Instead of hiring well-screened, well-trained, and well-\n     supervised workers, HHS decided to build political support \n     for the Affordable Care Act by pouring money into supportive \n     organizations so they could launch poorly trained workers \n     into their communities without obtaining criminal background \n     checks or creating systems for monitoring their activities.\n\n  Over the long term, we need to dismantle ObamaCare entirely and \nreplace it with patient-centered alternatives that will actually bring \ncosts down; improve the quality of care, by making more care \naccessible; and leaving the choices with consumers and their families, \npatients and their doctors making the decisions, not Washington, DC. In \nthe short term, we need to also dismantle the navigators program before \nit unleashes a wave of fraud and corruption.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, before I make my remarks, I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Reed from Rhode Island be recognized immediately \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I rise today, also, to speak about a \nsubject on the minds of all Americans and that is the rollout of the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act or ObamaCare.\n  Many of us have predicted the implementation of ObamaCare would \nresult in difficulties for American families, businesses, and our still \nfragile economy.\n  We spoke about the tax hikes that would come, the rising premiums, \nthe canceled policies, the benefit cuts to Medicare programs for \nseniors, and other problems in the flawed law. Still, the President \ninsisted that he was right and that he knew best what Americans wanted.\n  Since then, countless opportunities have been provided for our \ncolleagues to join us in defunding or at least delaying the \nimplementation of this damaging law.\n  To further sow confusion, the administration has selectively changed \nthe law to suit its political advantage.\n  And now that October 1 has come and gone, millions of Americans are \nbecoming painfully aware of the reality of how ObamaCare will affect \nthem.\n  The American people are seeing the effects of ObamaCare, not based on \nthe rhetoric of politicians or the debate here in Congress, but by \ntheir own personal experiences in dealing with it.\n  The initial feedback is clear, and it is not pretty. The trillion \ndollars in new taxes that I led the fight against on the floor during \nthe initial ObamaCare debate are now largely in effect.\n  And as I said, and many others warned, and the Joint Tax Committee \nhas actually confirmed, a significant portion of those tax increases \nare hitting squarely on the middle-income families the President \nsolemnly pledged to protect. He said that people in America who make \nless than $250,000 per couple or $200,000 per individual would not see \none dime of tax increases as a result of the act.\n  Yet now we are seeing that the burden of this huge tax increase is \nfalling squarely on those in what the President has defined as the \nmiddle class. The American people are also now experiencing for \nthemselves the reality we have long warned against--that the President \nhas also broken his promise that his health care plan would lower \npremiums by $2,500 on average for Americans.\n  In fact, the Washington Post fact checker gave that President's \npledge a three Pinocchios score for not being true. Yet another promise \nproven to be false is the President's pledge to the American people \nthat if you like your doctor and you like your current health care \nplan, you can keep it.\n  Again, the Washington Post reviewed this pledge. But this time it \ngave the President four Pinocchios saying, ``The President's promise \napparently came with a very large caveat: If you like your health care \nplan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan--if we deem it to be \nadequate.''\n  I recently received a letter from Nancy from Eagle, ID, about the \nloss of her husband's employer-provided coverage. The cancellation \nnotification reads that ``due to the Affordable Health Care Act and \nunprecedented increases in healthcare costs, effective January 1, 2014 \ntraditional comprehensive medical insurance will no longer be \navailable.'' Instead, his employer will offer two preventive health \ncare plans and refer them to the exchange to purchase his insurance.\n  After browsing the exchange Web site, Nancy and her husband have \nrealized they will either be forced to pay $500 more a month on health \ninsurance premiums or pay a lower premium rate which would result in \nlimited access to providers and hospitals.\n  Simply put, this is wrong. But I fear that there will be many more \nlike Nancy with similar experiences. This week I was contacted by Matt \nfrom Meridian, ID, about his wife who receives coverage through her \nemployer. They will see their premiums rise and a considerably higher \ndeductible due to the increased cost to her employer because of \nObamaCare.\n  Just 1 month after the ObamaCare exchange rollout, at least 3.5 \nmillion Americans have received insurance cancellation notices. This \nnumber is expected to dramatically increase in coming months. Over \n100,000 of those people live in Idaho, according to the Associated \nPress. According to media reports, the administration knew Americans \nwould not be able to keep their current coverage, even though the \nPresident continued to push the message that people could.\n  After breaking this promise, the President is now telling millions of \nAmericans who have had their insurance cancelled that they should shop \naround for policies that frankly could be more costly and require them \nto change their doctors.\n  Many of my colleagues in the Senate, as a response to this, are \ncosponsoring a measure known as the If You Like Your Health Plan, You \nCan Keep It Act. This act is one the Senate should immediately take up \nand pass.\n  Idahoans are now learning that the flawed health care law will force \nthem to change their plans and in many cases pay higher premiums. While \nthis law was sold on the promise of providing health care coverage for \nthe uninsured, it is creating new uninsured Americans who will be \nforced to enter the troubled Federal health care exchanges.\n  At the same time, the administration refuses calls for transparency \nand hides information about enrollment numbers. It is hard for me to \nbelieve that in the year 2013, when we have iPhones, tablets, Twitter \nand Google, the administration has no idea or ability to release \nenrollment numbers.\n\n[[Page S7977]]\n\n  According to documents released recently from the House oversight \ncommittee, six people signed up for ObamaCare on day one. We understand \nthat more are signing up now, but it could be that the administration \nhas such low numbers of enrollments for their signature achievement \nthat they do not want to present the accurate facts.\n  Many of us in this body are concerned also about the security risks \nposed by ObamaCare. Several weeks ago, Republican members of the Senate \nFinance Committee wrote to Department of Health and Human Services \nSecretary Kathleen Sebelius, asking whether all Federal privacy and \nsecurity standards were met prior to the launch of healthcare.gov, the \nWeb site to sign up for ObamaCare.\n  We have asked Secretary Sebelius to provide answers and information \nto a series of questions detailing what levels of security and privacy \nmeasures were undertaken prior to the launch of the Web site to \nsafeguard the privacy of those Americans signing up for coverage \nthrough healthcare.gov. This is a serious concern that must be \naddressed.\n  Additionally, because of the law, some businesses are cutting back on \nemployees and on hours, making it harder for Americans to find full-\ntime jobs. Those who do hold on to their full-time jobs could lose \ntheir employer-sponsored private insurance and are instead being dumped \ninto the exchange or into the failing Medicaid system.\n  These are just some of the unfortunate realities we are facing with \nthe implementation of ObamaCare. As these stories continue to pour in, \nI urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, along with the \nPresident, to carefully listen to the American people, to American \nbusinesses and this feedback and work together to defund and repeal \nevery element that proves not to work.\n  We must replace those failed policies with true reforms that are in \nthe best interests of the American people and in the best interests of \nthe American economy. From day one, the administration has continued to \nmake excuses for why healthCare.gov is not functioning properly, even \nthough they have had years to prepare and perform testing.\n  The American people see now that this law is more than just a Web \nsite problem; it is a train wreck. This system was not ready and the \nlaw looks impossible to fix. Simply put, the promises of this law are \nnothing like its realities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, it is clear we have honest disagreements \nabout how we should address our budget. I believe the path forward \nshould be fair and balanced. That is not what we have seen to date. We \nhave enacted $2.4 trillion in deficit reduction, with $1.8 trillion \ncoming from spending cuts. These cuts put tremendous pressure on \nimportant domestic investments in areas such as education, health care, \nand national security.\n  I do not believe cutting domestic programs that invest in our future \nand help low- and middle-income American families is the right thing to \ndo, especially when we can close egregious tax loopholes that benefit \nmultinational corporations and some of the wealthiest Americans.\n  Again, we have made significant progress in deficit reduction. The \nbulk of that has been cutting programs that invest in the country and \nhelp families. To go forward, we need a balanced approach, selective \ncuts, but we also need to close some of these egregious loopholes that \nare benefiting--not the small business man or woman living in Rhode \nIsland--but multinational corporations--not working wage earners in \nRhode Island--but some of the wealthiest Americans.\n  I know some of my colleagues disagree with me. But in order to \naddress our long-term fiscal challenges, the brinkmanship has to stop. \nDrawing lines in the sand and daring people to cross them has to stop. \nWhat we need is not to surrender our principles but to reach principled \ncompromise.\n  That is why we should provide immediate certainty that the shutdowns \nand the threats to wreck the economy are totally off the table. We can \ndo this by agreeing to adequate top-line numbers for the appropriations \nprocess for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 and eliminating the job-killing \nsequester.\n  Then we can move forward to a long-term debate about our fiscal \nchallenges. We can then build consensus and reach this principled \ncompromise. In reaching that compromise, I would urge my colleagues to \ninclude policies that focus on jobs and economic growth, that restore \nfairness to our Tax Code and preserve hard-earned Social Security and \nMedicare benefits.\n  Looking over the last few years, the uncertainty and the brinkmanship \naccording to most economists has robbed us of growth. That growth, in \nand of itself, not only would have put more Americans to work, but it \nwould have contributed to deficit reduction, even more than we have \nalready been able to do to date.\n  If we are serious about deficit reduction, if we are serious about \nnarrowing the gap in terms of equality in our society, then we have to \nemphasize not only wise fiscal policies that reduce the deficit \ndirectly but wise fiscal policies that encourage growth and also reduce \nthe deficit.\n  Let's agree to those top-line numbers. Let's also eliminate the \nsequester and let's move forward. That is why we were sent here. \nAmericans want us to keep the economy moving forward and to get the \neconomy working for them. They do not want to see us engage in \nprocedural maneuvers that simply leave us without adequate progress on \nthese issues that are extraordinarily important to them.\n  We are recovering from the most recent self-inflicted wound--the \ngovernment shutdown and near default. That manufactured crisis was \nabsolutely unnecessary and it was particularly unnecessary to threaten \nthe credit of the United States. A vast majority of Americans are clear \nthat at a minimum we should keep the government open and we should pay \nour bills. We have always done that. Only in the last few years and \nharking back to when Mr. Gingrich was Speaker did the other side engage \nin this sort of brinksmanship.\n  This does not work for Americans. They do understand we have \ndifferences in policy. They do understand we have to debate these \nvarious differences. But at a threshold level, government has to be \nworking for them, not sporadically but constantly. And we cannot \nthreaten the credit of the United States.\n  Jumping from these manufactured crises to crises is no way to do the \njob. As I said before, there are immediate tasks before us. We have to \nhave a reasonable expenditure level for our budgets for fiscal years \n2014 and 2015. Sequester must stop. Then we have to start to look at \nlonger term problems that are being driven by demographics.\n  We know the sequestration is harming our job growth. CBO has \nestimated that the 2013 and 2014 sequester will cost the economy \n900,000 jobs. Simply suspending or limiting the sequester, if we can \ngenerate 900,000 jobs, most Americans would say that is the right \npolicy. If you can just do that and create jobs, then do it.\n  It is obvious the sequester is not workable. The House of \nRepresentatives, our colleagues, have had very difficult times passing \nbills that adhere to sequestration, bills that traditionally passed \noverwhelmingly, like transportation and infrastructure bills. If we \ncannot even do that under the pressure of the sequester, then, again, \nwe are back to a dysfunctional government. It might be formally open, \nbut it is not helping people and it's not doing the things we have to \ndo: getting economies to grow, letting States build bridges, sewers, \nand highways.\n  Senator Mikulski has done an extraordinary job as the chairwoman of \nthe Appropriations Committee. She has been working hard to make sure we \nbring bills to this floor that not only have the support of our \nMembers, our colleagues, but also meet the needs of the American \npeople.\n  I have the privilege of chairing the interior subcommittee. We have \nbeen able, working with my colleague Senator Murkowski from Alaska, to \npropose--we have not brought it to the subcommittee or full committee--\nbut to propose a mark that would respond to the real needs of this \ncountry in terms of clean water and drinking\n\n[[Page S7978]]\n\nwater infrastructure--which is vital to the economy of every American \ncommunity.\n  On the other side, the House is proposing a cut of $1.756 billion, \nmore than 75 percent. That cut would devastate these programs and \nresult in 97,000 fewer jobs. These are the good kinds of construction \njobs, high-paying jobs, that allow families to stay above the water and \nallow communities to prosper. The workers who are putting in those \ninfrastructure projects are also going to local supermarkets, local \nrestaurants, paying the fees and dues to the Little League teams, and \ndoing the things we expect every family should be able to do and we \nhope every family can do.\n  In the Transportation bill, for example, we were able to maintain our \npromise to fund transit, airport, and highway systems. We have been \nable to set aside more than $1 billion for the popular TIGER grant \nprogram and a new initiative to replace bridges in critical \ntransportation corridors. This is an effort that can benefit every \nState in this country in terms of infrastructure projects.\n  Looking across the Capitol at the House Republican Transportation \nbill, they are cutting by $7.7 billion--even more than last year's \nsequestration level. It not only eliminates the TIGER grants for 2014, \nit reaches back to 2013 TIGER grants and cuts them by $237 million. \nThese kinds of cuts are untenable.\n  They also signal a very different attitude here. It was at one time \nclear that transportation was one of those issues that united us, \nRepublicans and Democrats, the North, the South, the East, and the \nWest, because it was something that every community needed and every \ncommunity understood. Now we see this dichotomy, and that is unhealthy \nfor our government and for our economy.\n  House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers said last July when these \ndraconian cuts forced House leaders to pull the bill from \nconsideration:\n\n       With this action, the House has declined to proceed on the \n     implementation of the very budget it adopted just three \n     months ago. Thus, I believe that the House has made its \n     choice: sequestration--and its unrealistic and ill-conceived \n     discretionary cuts--must be brought to an end.\n\n  Even the chairperson of the House Appropriations Committee is \nsignaling that sequestration is untenable and unworkable.\n  On this side of the Capitol, Chairman Mikulski has been a strong \nvoice echoing--not only echoing, but asserting--that position \nconstantly.\n  We can't get rid of sequestration with spending cuts alone. We can't \ncut our way to prosperity. Revenue has to be part of the solution.\n  In fact, as we have done over the last several years, we have cut \ndiscretionary spending dramatically. We are down to not fat but bone, \nand so we need additional revenues.\n  There is some good news. There are loopholes, egregious loopholes, \nthat in and of themselves should be closed, regardless if we were \ndealing with the issues of deficit and sequestration. They are not \nappropriate, not efficient, and they do not add to the overall economic \nbenefit of the country. They do benefit very narrow interests. It comes \ndown to whether my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are \nwilling to see these special preferences prevail or whether the \nnational economy and the families across this country will benefit.\n  We have to move forward. We have to emphasize things that will help \nus, for example, create more manufacturing jobs in this time and for \nthe future. I think at one point we thought manufacturing was passe. We \ndiscovered it is not only not passe but it is absolutely vital, because \nwe can't take new innovation, new discoveries, at which we are so good, \ncommercialize them, and then create new products in that \ncommercialization process, unless we have manufacturing.\n  We learn a lot on the manufacturing floor. We have seen products we \nhave developed intellectually become not only manufactured but improved \nby other countries who have the ability to manufacture, we have to get \nback to doing that.\n  We have to be able to align our workforce and our education system so \nthat we have the skills for the next century. Job training has to be \ncompetent, efficient, and adequate. All of this requires investments in \nresources, not simply cutting away and cutting away.\n  Ultimately, as we understand, and as our predecessors, particularly \nmy predecessor, Senator Claiborne Pell, understood, education is the \nengine that pulls this country forward. We used to assume we were the \nmost educated. We were the country with the best record of college \ngraduates. We were the country that advanced public education for \neveryone. We look around the world and we have slipped in terms of \ncollege graduates. We have slipped in terms of skills. Our public \neducation system needs to be reinvigorated. Not only with suggestions \nfrom the sidelines, not only with new approaches, but also with real \nresources. These investments have to be made.\n  It is a multifaceted approach, but I think we have to begin with only \nthe simple understanding, as we go forward, we need to provide the \neconomy, our constituents, and ourselves the certainty of an adequate \nfunding level for the government for the next 2 years. We need to \nsuspend, dispense with, postpone--whatever the appropriate term--\nsequestration, because it is not going to help us grow the economy. In \nfact, it will take away about 900,000 jobs.\n  Then we have to certainly make it clear we will not threaten the \ncreditworthiness of the United States by defaulting on our debt.\n  If we can do these things, and I believe we can, we can provide the \ncertainty that our private entrepreneurs need to make real investments \nin the economy and to grow. In all of this, we have to bring a balanced \napproach. It is not only cutting, it is expenditure cuts wisely chosen, \ntogether with revenue wisely chosen, through closing loopholes that \nwill give us a growing economy, hopefully increase opportunity, and put \nus back on the path to profound sustained economic recovery.\n  (The further remarks of Mr. REED are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. REED.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto address the Senate as in morning business and that the Senator from \nSouth Carolina, Mr. Graham, be allowed to join me in a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                                  Iran\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the administration's negotiations with \nIran failed to achieve an interim agreement this past weekend, and if \npublished reports are accurate, we owe our French allies a great deal \nof credit for preventing the major powers in the negotiations--the so-\ncalled P5-plus-1--from making a bad, bad, bad interim deal with Iran--a \ndeal that could have allowed Iran to continue making progress on key \naspects of its nuclear program and in return receiving an easing of \nbillions of dollars in sanctions.\n  The Senator from South Carolina and I are not opposed to seeking an \ninterim agreement with Iran as a way to create better conditions for \nnegotiations on a final agreement. We joined with some of our \ncolleagues in a letter to the President in support of such an approach \nbefore the Geneva agreement. But our support was conditioned on the \nneed for any interim agreement to be based on the principle of \nsuspension for suspension; that is to say, the Iranians would have to \nfully suspend their enrichment of uranium and the development of their \nnuclear weaponization programs and infrastructure, including \nconstruction of the heavy water reactor at Arak. The idea would be to \nfreeze Iran's nuclear program in place so that negotiations could \nproceed on how to roll it back without the threat the Iranians could \nuse negotiations as a delaying tactic.\n\n[[Page S7979]]\n\n  I remind my colleagues they have done that time after time. In fact, \nthe new President of Iran, Mr. Rouhani, bragged when he was negotiator \nthat they were able to fool the negotiators and increase the \ncentrifuges from 150 to 1,000. We have seen the movie before.\n  If Iran agreed, though, to this freeze, Senator Graham and I have \nsaid we would support suspension of our efforts to pass and implement \nnew sanctions. Unfortunately, public reports suggest the administration \nwas willing to agree in Geneva to less than a full suspension of Iran's \nprogram and to pay for that inadequate step with billions of dollars in \nsanctions relief. This is not ``suspension for suspension,'' regardless \nof administration claims to the contrary. And that is a problem. It \nputs too much trust in President Rouhani--the one whom I talked about \nbefore who bragged--he bragged--about deceiving the international \ncommunity when he was Iran's nuclear negotiator. In fact, the current \ndiplomatic efforts are consistent with a pattern of past dealings \nundertaken by the Iranian government to buy breathing space and shift \ninternational expectations in order to continue development of its \nnuclear program.\n  We have to avoid an interim agreement that diminishes Iran's \nincentive to make the hard decisions we ultimately need them to make as \npart of a final agreement, and that final agreement must require Iran \nto do the following: Comply with all outstanding U.N. Security Council \nresolutions; sign, ratify, and implement the additional protocol of the \nnuclear proliferation treaty; address outstanding concerns of the IAEA, \nespecially through expanding inspection measures; halt construction on \nand ultimately dismantle the Arak heavy water reactor; stop development \nof advanced centrifuges; and turn its supply of enriched material over \nto the IAEA.\n  A final agreement should also not recognize that Iran has any \ninherent right to enrich. A country that has continuously been on the \npath for nuclear weapons, that has violated protocol after protocol, \nshould not have the ``right to enrich.'' Without these measures, Iran's \nnuclear program will continue to grow. And as the program grows, it \nwill be harder to track and harder to set back.\n  Only when Iran seriously undertakes measures to dismantle its nuclear \nprogram should sanctions be unwound. The administration should not \nweaken the strong negotiating position that Congress has helped create. \nInstead, it should use its position to its advantage.\n  Before I ask my friend from South Carolina to comment, I would add \nthat we should not forget the context of Iran and negotiations with \nIran. This is an arms control issue--the nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, we \nseem to ignore the fact that Iran is spreading terror throughout the \nMiddle East and would like to throughout the world.\n  It is the Iranians who have armed and trained and equipped 5,000 \nHezbollah, who are slaughtering people in Syria. It is Iran that sends \nthe Iranian Revolutionary Guard into Syria and slaughters people. It is \nIran that is supporting the Islamic extremist groups that are now \nmoving seriously on the side of Bashar Assad into Syria. It is Iran \nthat is spreading terror throughout the Middle East and would attempt \nto throughout the world. They still view the United States of America \nas the great Satan. They are still committed to ``wiping Israel off the \nmap.''\n  Iran is a threat to peace in the world. And it is not only the issue \nof nuclear weaponry, it is their entire behavior of spreading terrorism \nthroughout the region, propping Bashar Asad while he continues to \nslaughter, maim, rape, torture, and kill. And for this administration \nand this Secretary of State to ignore those facts about Iran, in my \nview, is disgraceful conduct.\n  Finally, before I turn to my friend from South Carolina, I would add \nthat the influence and power of the United States throughout the world, \nespecially in the Middle East, is no longer there. Every Middle East \nleader I talk to, everyone I know in the region, says they believe the \nUnited States is leaving, the United States is not in any way involved, \nand they are making accommodation for the absence of the United States \nleadership.\n  This President does not believe in American exceptionalism. America \nmust lead or Iran, Russia, and other countries will lead, and sooner or \nlater the United States will pay a very heavy price. We must not ignore \nthe lessons of history. Several times in our history we have tried to \nwithdraw the fortress America, and every time we have paid a very heavy \nprice.\n  So I say to my friend from South Carolina, it is important, this \nIranian issue, it is of transcendent importance, but I do not believe \nit can be viewed in a vacuum, considering Iran's continued effort to \ntry to undermine and destroy everything--the freedom and democracy--for \nwhich American stands.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If I could respond, I guess the essence of what we are \ntrying to say is we believe Iran is the problem, not the solution, to \nthe Mid East and the world at large. There has been bipartisan support \nfor curtailing and controlling and eventually eliminating the Iranian \nnuclear program. There has been bipartisan support for our friends in \nIsrael, and we want to keep it that way. We want to make sure Congress \nspeaks with one voice, that we are helpful when we can be, and that we \noffer criticism at an appropriate time.\n\n  I guess the concerns we have about this agreement are that it is \ngetting to be more like North Korea in a fashion that makes us all \nuncomfortable. If you interject billions of dollars into the Iranian \neconomy now, without dismantling the centrifuges, I think you have made \na huge mistake.\n  What are we trying to accomplish? We are trying to make sure the \nIranians do not have the capability to develop a nuclear weapon. The \nfirst question you have to ask: Are they trying to build a nuclear \npowerplant--a nuclear infrastructure for commercial purposes--or are \nthey trying to create capability to produce a weapon? Trust me on this: \nNobody goes about building a commercial nuclear program this way. They \nare trying to build a nuclear weapon. Why? Because that would give them \ninfluence in the region they have never had. It would give Iran a \nstrong standing in the historical Sunni-Shia conflict between the \nPersians and the Arabs. And as a consequence, it would lead to a \nnuclear arms race in the Mid East, because the Sunni Arabs are not \ngoing to allow the Shia Persians to have a nuclear capability.\n  They also believe, fairly rationally so, if they get a nuclear \nweapon, the regime is probably home free; that the West is going to \nback off, much as we did in North Korea. So the decision of how to \nhandle this program is probably the most important decision President \nObama will make in his second term and will be one of the most \nimportant decisions the world makes for the future of our planet here \ngoing into the 21st century.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If my friend would yield for a question, the Senator from \nSouth Carolina and I have known the Prime Minister of Israel rather \nwell over the years. Obviously, the first target of Iran, in the case \nof a nuclear weapon, would be Israel. Iran has never stepped back from \nsaying that Israel should be wiped from the face of the Earth. Has the \nSenator from South Carolina ever known a time since the creation of the \nState of Israel that the United States and Israel have been further \napart; that there has been more open disagreement and, indeed, tension \nat a level the likes of which we have never seen? And does it not \nappear by not including Israel in any of the negotiations, to start \nwith, but also there seems to be a complete disregard of the knowledge, \ninformation, and frontline status of Israel in this whole issue?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Well, I think it is pretty obvious the tensions are \ngrowing, and not just with Israel. I believe the Obama administration's \neagerness to reach a deal is unnerving to the people in the region, and \nnot just Israel. The Israelis and the Sunni Arabs are being pushed \ntogether in an unprecedented fashion. We are hearing out of the Arab \ncommunity the same concerns as out of the Israeli community. So that is \nan odd alignment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And haven't the Saudis already basically let it be known \nif Iran acquires a nuclear weapon they will be right behind them?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Oh, absolutely, it will create an arms race.\n  There is a positive note here: The Congress itself. The Congress has \nnot been confused. We are more together on this issue than we have ever \nbeen. The Congress passed 90 to 1 a resolution rejecting the idea of \nallowing the\n\n[[Page S7980]]\n\nIranians to have a nuclear weapon and trying to contain them. The idea \nof containing a nuclear-armed Iran is not a good idea. We fear they \nwould share the technology with a terrorist group that would wind its \nway here to the United States. And Israel believes they could never \nhave a moment of peace with a nuclear-armed Iran. Containment won't \nwork.\n  Secondly, the Congress, 99 to 0, said: If Israel has to defend itself \nagainst a nuclear-capable Iran, has to intervene to stop this \nexistential threat to the Jewish state, that we would provide \npolitical, economic, and military support. So the Congress has been \nvery much together.\n  The next thing we hope to do is have a resolution, bipartisan in \nnature, that defines the end game. What are we trying to accomplish? We \ndon't want a war. Nobody wants a war. The idea of the Iranians having a \ncommercial nuclear powerplant is OK with me. Mexico and Canada have \ncommercial nuclear power facilities. They just don't enrich uranium. \nThey buy the product from the world community. They don't have \nenrichment and reprocessing. I don't mind the Iranians having a nuclear \npowerplant for commercial purposes as long as the international \ncommunity controls the fuel cycle.\n  Here is the problem: They are insisting on the right to enrich. And \nthe problem is you can take uranium and enrich it to a certain level \nfor commercial purposes, and with today's technology you can break out \nand have a nuclear weapon very quickly.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I ask, aren't the parameters of this proposed \nagreement to allow them to continue to enrich materials?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The concern the Israelis have, and that my colleague and \nI have, is the number of centrifuges available to the Iranians is into \nthe tens of thousands now, pushing from 18 to 24,000. Who really knows. \nBut the advanced centrifuges we are talking about can take 3.5-percent \nenriched uranium and go to 90 percent to get a weapon in just a matter \nof weeks, if not months.\n  So here is the rub: I think Congress will speak with one voice. We \ndon't mind a commercial capability for the Iranians as long as you \ncontrol the fuel cycle. As to the previously enriched uranium, \nparticularly the 20 percent stockpile, turn it over to the \ninternational community. That is the U.N. position. Stop enriching. \nThere is no right to enrich. At the end of the day, this plutonium \nheavy water reactor that you are building is a threat to Israel beyond \nbelief. Dismantle that reactor. You don't need a heavy water plutonium-\nproducing reactor to engage in commercial power production. These are \nwhat we would like to let the administration know would be a successful \noutcome regarding the Congress. They actually mirror the U.N. \nresolutions.\n  I am hopeful we can find a way to end the nuclear program in Iran \nwhich would be a win-win situation for the Iranians and the world at \nlarge. But what we can't afford to do is get it wrong with Iran. These \nnegotiations, the interim agreement, as Senator McCain stated so well, \nsent chills up the spine of almost everybody in the region. So if the \nIranians insist upon enriching, to have the ability to take the uranium \nand enrich it in the future, I think is a nonstarter. That would be \nincredibly dangerous, and we will wake up one day with a North Korea in \nthe Middle East. If the Iranians get a nuclear weapon, it will be far \nmore destabilizing than North Korea having a nuclear weapon on the \nKorean Peninsula. It will open Pandora's box.\n  I am hopeful the administration will go into the next round of \nnegotiations eyes wide open, understanding where the American people \nand the international community are and the people in the region and if \nwe get a deal, it is a good deal. But what is a good deal? To make sure \nthe Iranians can have a peaceful nuclear power program but can't get a \nbomb. The only way they can get a bomb is to have enrichment capability \nas part of an agreement. Mexico, Canada, and 15 other nations have \nnuclear powerplants for commercial purposes, but they don't insist on \nenriching uranium to provide the fuel. If they insist on enriching, \nthat tells us all we need to know about what their true intent is.\n  I thank Senator McCain for bringing his voice.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is also true that the right to enrich is undercut by \ntheir many years' record of deception and efforts at acquiring a \nnuclear weapon.\n  Finally, again, I want to emphasize our Israeli friends are on the \nfrontline. It is not the United States of America that the ayatollahs \nhave committed to ``wipe off the face of the earth,'' that have been \ndedicated ever since the Iranian revolution to the extinction of the \nState of Israel.\n  So shouldn't we pay close attention? We aren't dictated by Israeli \nbehavior, but shouldn't we profit from their experiences? Twice the \nIsraelis have had to act militarily against nuclear facilities. Twice \nthey have had to do that in order to prevent in one case Syria and \nanother case Iraq from acquiring nuclear weapons which would threaten \nthem with extinction. Now this agreement, clearly, in the words of the \nIsraeli Prime Minister, is something that is very dangerous to the very \nexistence of the State of Israel.\n  Again, Israel does not dictate American policy, but to ignore the \nwarnings of literally every expert in the Middle East--especially that \nof Israel, including Arab countries--I think is ignoring evidence and \nopinions that are very well informed. To get an agreement for the sake \nof an agreement, in my view, would be a disaster.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Would the Senator yield? To conclude, why are the \nIranians at the table? Because the sanctions are working. The Congress \nhas passed tough sanctions. To the Obama administration's credit, they \nput together an international coalition--unprecedented in nature--which \nhas gotten the Iranians' attention and we are at the table. The last \nthing we want to do is relieve the pressure because that is what got \nthem there. There are two things they must understand: Until you \nabandon your nuclear quest for a bomb and replace it with a reasonable \nsolution for commercial nuclear power aspirations, we will continue \nsanctions. The threat of military force is also one of the factors that \ngot them to the table.\n  Jay Carney said yesterday: If you push for new sanctions, you are \ninviting war. I would like to respond. I think the reason we are having \na peaceful opportunity moment here is because of the sanctions. If we \nback off now and infuse billions of dollars into the Iranian economy \nand leave the centrifuges in place, we are inviting an attack by \nIsrael. If you don't shut down the plutonium heavy water reactor, \nIsrael is not going to sit on the sidelines forever. So to not have a \ncontinuation of sanctions until we get the right answer is going to \ninvite more destabilizing in the region.\n  We have to realize that Israel is in a different position than almost \nanybody else. They are close. The Iranians have talked about wiping \nthem off the map. When it comes to the Jewish people, they don't take \nthat stuff lightly anymore. When they say ``never again,'' they \nliterally mean it. Can you tell the Prime Minister of Israel--given the \nbehavior of the Iranians in the last 30 years--that they are just \njoking? Can you tell the people of the United States, if the Iranians \ngot a nuclear weapon, they wouldn't share it with a terrorist group to \ncome our way? Name one thing they have produced they haven't shared.\n  So this is a moment of history. This is the biggest decision \nPresident Obama will make, and I would like to help him make the right \ndecision. I would like to help the world resolve this problem without a \nwar. But here is the situation we find ourselves in: If we attack Iran \nto stop their nuclear program if we couldn't get a peaceful ending, we \nwould open Pandora's box. It would be difficult. But if they got a \nnuclear weapon, it would empty Pandora's box. That is the world in \nwhich we live. We have a little time to get this right. I hope we can.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I appreciate the patience of my friend from Iowa, and I \nthank the Senator from South Carolina.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to cover the bill we are on, the \nDrug Quality and Security Act. Before I do, I ask unanimous consent \nthat at the end of my remarks the Senator from New Hampshire, Ms. \nAyotte, be recognized to speak.\n\n[[Page S7981]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. One year ago, we were at the beginning of our effort to \nunderstand one of the worst public health crises this country has \nexperienced in recent years. We were just learning about the New \nEngland Compounding Center's astonishing disregard for basic procedures \nto ensure that the products they were manufacturing were sterile. We \nwere shocked and saddened by the news that hundreds were sick and \ndozens had died from infections caused by NECC's blatant disregard for \npatient safety, and we were fearful for the fate of the thousands of \nadditional patients who had received injections of NECC products.\n  Despite the urgency of that crisis, the bill we are considering was \nnot slapped together overnight--far from it. It is the product of a \nfull year of careful bipartisan policy collaboration, and it rests upon \nthe factual foundation developed through the bipartisan oversight \ninvestigation that Senator Alexander and I launched over 1 year ago. \nWhen we learned of the NECC tragedy, we did not rush to pick up a pen \nand dash off a quick legislative answer. Instead, we sought to \nunderstand what that story was, what its causes were, so we could \ndevelop legislation which would make a difference in the future and not \njust make headlines.\n  In early October of 2012, shortly after the outbreak became known, \nthis is what the outbreak looked like. We had these States with 64 \ndeaths and 750 people got sick. I don't mean they just got sick \novernight and then got better. Some of the people who lived will have \nlingering illnesses for the remainder of their lives. In many cases \nthey will never be able to work again because of meningitis. My \npartner's home State of Tennessee was very hard hit with 153 cases. \nMichigan was the highest with 264 cases.\n  But this is what it looked like when this outbreak occurred. As we \ncan see, there were a couple out West, and it was starting to spread in \nthat direction. Thankfully, the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention was able to intervene and find the source of it and stop it; \nagain, another example of how CDC protects the American people.\n  When this happened, we began to talk directly with various \nstakeholders to understand it. We continued to talk to the FDA and the \nCDC on their investigations. We held briefing calls with the \nMassachusetts Board of Pharmacy, where the NECC was located. We talked \nto an array of compounding pharmacies and purchasers of the compounded \nproducts.\n  On October 25 of last year, to explore the need for and potential \ncontours of legislation, the committee launched a bipartisan process to \nexamine the respective State and Federal roles in regulating \ncompounding pharmacies. My oversight team worked with Senator \nAlexander's to gather documents from FDA and from the State of \nMassachusetts that shed light upon how NECC had been allowed to grow so \nlarge with so little oversight. Last November, we released an initial \nreport and held a hearing exploring the statutory and regulatory gaps \nthat contributed to this tragedy. Our bipartisan investigation \ncontinued and culminated in a final report released on May 22 of this \nyear.\n  Over the course of this investigation, we explored how drug \ncompounding has evolved as an industry over the past couple of decades. \nDrug compounding is a traditional and longstanding activity of \npharmacies. It serves an important role in our health care system. \nCompounding is when just a few people--maybe only one person--needs a \ncertain compound of a drug. So a pharmacist, maybe not with the classic \nmortar and pestle but with other devices, mixes, compounds the specific \ndrug that is needed. Maybe it is needed for a few people in a hospital, \na specific chronic illness that someone might have. This is sort of the \ntraditional compounding, where you can't just get a prescription for it \nand go down to the pharmacy and have it filled, simply because there is \nnot that big of a demand for it. But over the last couple of decades a \nnumber of large-scale drug compounding companies have started to \nproduce large batches of high-risk drugs for national sale.\n  For example, at the time of the meningitis outbreak, NECC's sister \ncompany called Ameridose was providing prepared IV mixtures to 25,000 \nhospitals and facilities across the country. Despite a scope of \noperations that makes these companies much more similar to drug \nmanufacturers than to pharmacies, they primarily faced oversight \nsimilar to State-licensed community pharmacies rather than the more \nrigorous quality standards governing traditional drug manufacturers.\n  Our investigation found that both NECC and Ameridose had lengthy \ntrack records of producing drugs of questionable sterility and potency, \nand both had been the subject of repeated adverse event reports and \nconsumer complaints. The committee review of FDA documents indicates \nthat between 2002 and 2012, NECC was the subject of at least 52 adverse \nevent reports, exposing the dangers created by its hazardous \ncompounding practices with documented issues including the failure to \nensure the sterility of equipment and products, the distribution of \ndrugs containing particulate matter, the manufacture of superpotent and \nsubpotent drugs, mislabeling of drugs, inaccurate ``beyond use'' \ndating, and the illegal distribution of drugs in the absence of \npatient-specific prescriptions.\n  Similarly, between 2007 and 2012, internal documents indicate that \nAmeridose was the subject of at least 18 adverse event reports. \nAmeridose was cited in 2008 for producing a compounded version of the \npain reliever fentanyl that was more than 100 percent stronger than the \nstandard level.\n  What was happening at NECC during this time period was unfortunately \nan example of a larger problem across the industry. In an effort to \nunderstand better the risks posed by increasingly large drug \ncompounding companies, the FDA undertook surveys of compounded drugs in \n2001 and 2006. In each of those surveys, about one-third of the drugs \nsampled failed one or more standard quality tests. In the 2006 survey \nof sterile injectable drugs, 33 percent of the samples contained either \nnot enough or too much of the active drug ingredient.\n  Between 2001 and 2011, FDA documents indicate at least 25 deaths and \n36 serious injuries, including hospitalizations, were linked to large-\nscale drug compounding companies, including 13 deaths in 2011 alone. \nBetween 1998 and 2005, FDA documented at least 38 deaths and 210 \ninjuries from drugs that were contaminated, mislabeled, or caused \noverdoses because they contained more of the active pharmaceutical \ningredient than indicated. These include the deaths of 6 infants and \nchildren, and at least 18 other children paralyzed, burned, \nhospitalized, or suffering from other severe reactions, and these \nnumbers likely understate the actual number of adverse events because \ncurrent law, unlike what we have in this bill, does not require \nreporting of adverse events.\n  Our bipartisan investigation concluded that large-scale drug \ncompounders continue to pose a serious risk to public health. At the \ntime of our final report in May, we had identified at least 48 \ncompounding companies that had been found to be producing and selling \ndrugs that were contaminated or created in unsafe conditions in just \nthe preceding 8 months since this outbreak.\n  I guess what I am saying is, if you follow this, this had been going \non for some time but it kept getting worse and worse as more and more \nof these large-scale drug compounders found they could get away with \nit.\n  In that same time 10 drug compounders had issued national recalls \nbecause of concerns about contamination, and 11 drug compounders had \nbeen ordered by State licensing agencies to stop producing some or all \ndrugs.\n  Our investigation concluded that in order to reduce the serious and \nongoing risk to the public health from compounded drug products, it is \nessential that a clear statutory framework be enacted that requires \nentities compounding drugs outside of traditional pharmacy practice to \nengage in good manufacturing practices and to better ensure the \nsterility and quality of their drugs. So we developed this bill, the \nDQSA, as we called it, to address the regulatory gaps that we \nidentified in this investigation.\n  Under the legislation before us, large compounders such as NECC or \nany other compounder that chooses to operate outside of traditional \npharmacy\n\n[[Page S7982]]\n\npractice have only one legal option: They must register with the FDA. \nThey must follow good manufacturing practices. They must tell FDA when \ntheir products hurt people; otherwise, they must follow the \nmanufacturer-like requirements that apply to outsourcing facilities \nunder this bill. If they are not traditional compounders and they do \nnot meet the requirements for outsourcing facilities, our bill says FDA \ncan shut them down immediately.\n  The Drug Quality and Security Act is a carefully crafted bill that \nnot only responds to the NECC outbreak but to the root causes that I \nhave gone over that go back almost 2 decades, that really led up to \nthis tragedy. It is good bipartisan policy.\n  I pointed out the other day in my remarks, and I point out again \ntoday, it has wide industry and consumer support: the Academy of \nNutrition and Dietetics, the American Pharmacists Association, the \nChamber of Commerce of the United States, large drug manufacturers, and \nalso consumer groups--the Center for Science and Democracy, the Center \nfor Medical Consumers, and others. So it has both consumer and industry \nsupport.\n  I wanted to take this time to lay out the background as to why this \nbill is so vitally important. I will also point out the House of \nRepresentatives passed this bill on a voice vote. Now we have it here \nat the desk. It is the same basic bill we passed out of our committee \non a bipartisan unanimous vote.\n  Last night we had a 97-to-1 vote on cloture to proceed to this bill. \nThat ought to be an indication that this is an important bill, but one \nthat has broad bipartisan support. Now, under the rules of the Senate \nwe have 30 hours, of which I am now taking my part of 1 hour. I don't \nintend to take the whole hour. Then we go 30 hours, and then we get on \nthe bill. If one person then--this one person--continues to object, I \nguess we will have to file cloture on the bill. That will take 2 days \nto ripen, 2 days for cloture to ripen. Then we will have yet another \nvote on cloture on the bill. I assume we will get 97 to 1. Then we have \n30 hours after that, and then we vote. I think that takes us to Sunday, \nif I am not mistaken, if we stay here.\n  This is not really part of what I want to talk about, but I think \nthis is an important reason why I have supported a change in the rules \nof the Senate since 1995. We cannot continue to be a 21st century \ncountry, to be a major world power, and operate under 19th century \nrules and regulations. It is just not right that one person, one \nSenator, any Senator--I am not pointing fingers at anyone. I am saying \nanybody, any one Senator in the face of a bill that is not only vital \nfor the health and safety of the American people but which has broad \nbipartisan support--that one person could tie up the Senate for \nliterally a week or more through procedural roadblocks. That is why I \nsay we need to do something about the rules around this place.\n  If this were a contentious issue, I could see the need to slow things \ndown. This has to do with the health and safety of the American people. \nA lot of time and effort went into this bill, by Republicans and \nDemocrats, FDA, CDC, pharmaceutical companies, consumer groups. That is \nwhy I think it has such broad support. I hope we do not have to go \nthrough all this. But if we do, we do. There is no doubt in anybody's \nmind that this bill will pass and it will probably pass on a 97-1 vote. \nBut why tie up the Senate for all this time? Why put off the signing of \na bill that would get action to protect the health and safety of the \nAmerican people?\n  I hope we can bring this to a resolution and have a vote up or down \non it. Frankly, I think we could probably voice-vote the bill. I think \nwe could ask for unanimous consent--but for one person--and then we \ncould voice vote it. Then, if there is an objection, maybe we do have \nto have a rollcall. If someone wants a rollcall, that is their right, \nbut at least let's vote on the bill and get it out of here. That is the \nleast we can do to protect the health and safety of the American \npeople.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, last week I came to the floor to discuss \nthe negative impact that ObamaCare is having on the people of New \nHampshire. I shared dozens of compelling stories from my constituents, \nwho are telling me that they are seeing their coverage canceled and \nthey are seeing their premiums rise. These sad stories continue to \narrive in my in-box every day, and these are real people. They are \nhaving great difficulty with not only the Web site but structural \nproblems that exist with the law itself. They deserve to have their \nvoices heard on the floor of the Senate. I will say, as one of my \nconstituents said to me: Lives in New Hampshire are depending on it.\n  Last week President Obama said he was sorry to those who are now \nreceiving cancellation notices. But a simple apology falls short \nbecause the structural problems we are now seeing with this law, \nincluding the cancellation notices that too many of my constituents are \nreceiving, were problems that many in this Chamber, even before I got \nelected to the Senate, warned about before the law was passed.\n  Here are some of the stories I want to share from people in New \nHampshire and how they are being impacted by this law.\n  Jeanne in Meredith wrote me she was diagnosed with breast cancer 2\\1/\n2\\ years ago. She was laid off from her job of 20 years and then went \non COBRA. Jeanne traveled to Mass General in Boston to receive care and \nwhen her coverage ran out she worked with her insurance agent to \nreceive coverage that she could afford and that would allow her to \ncontinue with her subsequent treatments without any interruptions. She \nhas now told me that what she has worked out in the plan she had has \nbeen canceled. She wrote me:\n\n       I liked my plan. And I not only liked my doctors, I \n     consider them my lifeline. If I purchase a plan under the \n     Exchange, I lose access to all my doctors in Boston, and I am \n     finding that I will also lose my oncologist in Nashua as \n     well. This can't be happening.\n\n  Lori in Littleton wrote me. She told me she and her husband recently \nwere notified that their coverage will be canceled. When she learned \nabout the new plan that was being offered to comply with ObamaCare, she \nsaid:\n\n       We were shocked that the cost would be $400 a month more \n     than we are currently paying. This is way beyond our budget. \n     So we began to explore the so-called Exchange to shop for all \n     of our choices. Once again, we were very frustrated to learn \n     that New Hampshire has a monopoly with only one carrier [on \n     the exchange].\n\n  What I have also heard from my constituents is concerns that they are \nreceiving notices that their premiums are rising as a result of \nObamaCare. Sara in New Castle wrote me that her premiums for a high-\ndeductible plan that complies with ObamaCare will be double her current \npremium. Moreover, Sara said that she ``will no longer be able to go to \nPortsmouth Hospital. My primary physician, gynecologist, eye doctor, \nand children's pediatrician are all excluded from the ACA plan that I \nwill be forced to purchase by the end of 2014.''\n  She finished the letter she wrote to me by saying: ``No, my family is \nnot better off with the ACA.''\n  John in Pembroke wrote:\n\n       The new law is called the Affordable Care Act. What a \n     hurtful joke that is to hard-working Americans. My existing \n     policy is being canceled. After I called Anthem to inform \n     them they must have misheard the President and the other \n     supporters of the ACA, they told me that my existing policy \n     did not meet the standards for the new law. I was shocked. \n     The new higher plans from Anthem in the best case scenario \n     are more than double my existing plan.\n\n  David in Nashua wrote me that recently he saw his coverage canceled \nlike too many others. He wrote:\n\n       When working with Anthem to get a plan that will have the \n     closest coverages and plan services with similar deductibles \n     and copays, I was disheartened to learn it will cost me an \n     additional $110 per month--about 40 percent more than I was \n     paying.\n\n  He continued:\n\n       To get comparable services to what I had it will cost an \n     additional $45 per month. All said, I am looking at an \n     increase of $155 per month.\n\n  David said he is looking at a 57-percent increase in costs and an \nadditional $1,800 per year.\n  He said to me:\n\n       This is grossly unacceptable, has been misleading from the \n     words conveyed by the President and downright frustrating to \n     have to deal with such a problem.\n\n  A couple from Amherst, NH, wrote me and said:\n\n       . . . because of the Affordable Care Act our health \n     insurance plan is being canceled and\n\n[[Page S7983]]\n\n     the least expensive plan, either within the exchange or \n     outside of it, will more than double our cost. The least \n     expensive plan we can obtain will increase our monthly \n     premium from $582 to $1,183 per month. Our annual premium \n     under the new health care law will increase from $6,984 to \n     $14,196--an increase of [over $7,000] per year.\n\n  They further wrote to me:\n\n       President Obama promised us that if we liked our plan, we \n     could keep it. But ours has been canceled. President Obama \n     promised us that if we liked our doctor we could keep our \n     doctor.\n       President Obama promised us that under the new health care \n     law we would save $2,500. But our premiums will be increasing \n     by over $7,000 a year.\n\n  A couple from Center Sandwich also contacted me. They said their \nrates will double and cost them an additional $7,000 per year.\n  They wrote:\n\n       We are both in our second careers and in our 50s, working \n     hard and doing two jobs. Blue collar couple who are very \n     healthy. Under this so-called Affordable Care law, our rates \n     are going to double!\n\n  Scott from Concord wrote:\n\n       I currently have a great family plan through my work. This \n     plan costs me $240 per month. On January 1st this plan will \n     cost me $600 per month. I can't afford to pay such a high \n     premium. Now I am forced to get a plan that has a 50% greater \n     deductible, and much higher co-pays.\n\n  I also heard from a mother from Manchester. She has a little girl who \nis scheduled to have surgery at the beginning of January. As any mother \nwould be, she is worried, and now she has been told her plan has been \ncanceled. She wrote:\n\n       I looked, and my current plan is not available through the \n     Exchange. I will have to purchase a plan with a high \n     deductible. The new plan will cost over $1,200 per month, \n     increasing my premium which is currently just over $1,000 per \n     month. The new plans, through the Exchange, have a smaller \n     network of doctors, so I could be losing my doctors too.\n\n  Finally, I am hearing frustration and concerns from my constituents \nabout the Web site.\n  David in Bedford wrote:\n\n       My wife and I are semi-retired and have been trying since \n     October 1 to obtain health insurance through HealthCare.gov. \n     We have also used the telephone option but we were unable so \n     far to obtain coverage.\n\n  He finished this message to me by saying:\n\n       We are very concerned with being without coverage on \n     January 1, 2014.\n\n  I heard a similar concern from a resident in Greenfield who also \nexpressed deep concern about private information put on the Web site. I \nheard the same from a registered nurse from Milford. She expressed \nfrustrations about how the exchange is working.\n  There are many more pieces of correspondence I have received from my \nconstituents. I will not share them all on the floor today, but their \nvoices deserve to be heard. Because of this law, people in New \nHampshire are losing the coverage they thought they could keep. They \nare getting premium increase notices, which they cannot afford to pay, \nthat are attributed to ObamaCare. Finally, as I have previously said on \nthe floor, some people are having their hours cut because it defines \nthe workweek as a 30-hour workweek. Unfortunately, the people who do \nwant to continue to work more hours are being harmed.\n  As I have done before, I come to the floor today to call for a \ntimeout on ObamaCare. We need a timeout because we are seeing that the \nproblems with this law are much deeper than a Web site. We hope those \nproblems will be fixed. Of course, they have not yet been fixed. The \nWashington Post reported today that they may not even be fixed with \nwhat the administration has represented--at the end of this month.\n  That said, what about the canceled policies, the premium increases, \nand the lost hours? It is time to have a timeout where we do what \nshould have been done in the beginning. Instead of passing a law of \nthis magnitude on a partisan basis, people need to come together to \naddress health care, rising costs, access, and the issues the American \npeople want us to take on. This law is not the answer, and the American \npeople--and the people of New Hampshire--deserve better.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Early Childhood Education\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nthe issue that got me into politics many years ago in the first place--\nearly childhood education.\n  I thank my friend and colleague Chairman Harkin, whose leadership on \nthis critical issue is unparalleled. I am delighted he is on the floor \ntoday as well. I also thank Senators Casey and Hirono for their strong \nsupport of early childhood education. They are great partners in this \nwork as well.\n  Of the 535 Members of Congress, I have to say each one of us comes to \nWashington, DC, with our own unique background. We are a collection of \nmilitary veterans, farmers, business owners, and a lot more.\n  As for me, I come to Congress as a mother and preschool teacher. When \nmy kids were much younger, I found that their wonderful preschool \nprogram was being closed down by my State because of budget cuts. When \nmy children were very young, I put them in my car and traveled to \nOlympia, our State capital, which is 100 miles away, to explain to \nthese legislators, whom I did not know, why they could not cut this \nimportant program. When I got there, legislators told me there was \nnothing someone like me could do to save that preschool program. One \nlegislator in particular told me I was just a mom in tennis shoes and \nhad no chance of changing anything. He said I could not make a \ndifference.\n  Well, that made me slightly mad. I drove home, picked up my phone, \nstarted calling other moms and dads, and they called moms and dads from \naround our State. Over time--about 3 months--we organized thousands of \nfamilies in our State. We wrote letters, held rallies, and when all was \nsaid and done the legislature listened to us and reinstated that \npreschool program. I went on to teach in that program as a preschool \nteacher and then to serve on my local school board.\n  When I eventually did come to Washington, DC, as a U.S. Senator, I \nknew firsthand that if we want to strengthen our economy and give our \nkids a brighter future, we could not wait until they were teenagers or \nadults to invest in them. I had seen in my own classrooms that when \nyoung children get the attention they need, they are miles ahead of \ntheir peers on the path to success. I saw that my own students who knew \nhow to raise their hands or ask questions or stand in line to go to \nrecess were the ones who were then able to go on and tackle a full \ncurriculum in school.\n  That is why this week I joined a bipartisan group of colleagues to \nintroduce legislation that will give every American child access to \nhigh-quality early education. The bill, the Strong Start for America's \nChildren Act, aims to significantly increase access to and quality of \nearly learning programs that start when a child is born and last until \ntheir first day of kindergarten. This legislation authorizes a Federal \nprogram that supports our individual States' efforts to educate their \nyoungest citizens. It ensures that early learning programs everywhere \nhave quality teachers and meet high standards, but it also provides \nStates, school districts, and preschool programs the flexibility they \nneed to meet their local children's needs.\n  Although I approach this issue today as a grandmother and mother and \na former preschool teacher, many of my colleagues have their own \nreasons to support early education. Former law enforcement officers and \nlawyers and sheriffs whom I work with know that when we invest in our \nchildren at a young age, they are more likely to stay out of trouble \nand out of jail. Business leaders and economists know that when we \nspend $1 on a child's education in the first few years of their life, \nwe save as much as $17 throughout their life. Our military leaders tell \nme that 75 percent of our Nation's 17- to 24-year-olds are ineligible \nto serve their country often because they are not able to pass the \nnecessary math and reading.\n  It is not only teachers who are fighting for pre-K, it is generals, \nsheriffs, and CEOs. Fifty years of research backs this up. We know that \n80 percent of a person's brain development occurs before the age of 5. \nWhile China is aiming to provide 70 percent of their children with 3 \nyears of preschool by 2020 and India is doing the same, we do not\n\n[[Page S7984]]\n\nhave a national strategy to get the youngest Americans ready to learn. \nNobel Prize-winning economist James Heckman, an advocate for early \nlearning, says ``skill begets skill.''\n  This summer I traveled throughout my home State of Washington \nvisiting early learning programs. I heard from a kindergarten teacher \nwho told me that while some of her students in kindergarten are \npracticing writing their names on their work, others are learning how \nto hold a pencil. Those children, even at an early age, are already \nplaying catchup. So when a child who has benefited from early education \nknows how to open a book and turn a page, someone can teach them to \nread. But in classrooms across our country, some children are falling \nbehind. The gap between children who start school ready to succeed and \nthose who don't has serious implications for our country's future.\n  Although historically we have invested in education to build a path \nto the middle class, we are now falling behind. We now rank 28th \nglobally in the proportion of 4-year-olds enrolled in pre-K and 25th \nglobally in public funding for early learning. That cannot continue.\n  In the coming weeks and months, I will be working with my chairman \nSenator Harkin, who is here today, and with many others to work toward \nmaking some smart investments in our educational system so we can move \nthis legislation forward. Our country in very large part is the product \nof decisions that were made decades ago. The decision to make public \neducation a priority now will have an extraordinary impact on the next \ngeneration. Every day we are choosing between being a country that is \nstruggling to catch up or being a country that has the knowledge and \npower to continue to lead.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 3204 and S. 1197\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise today to again advocate for no \nWashington exemption from ObamaCare. This is an issue I have talked \nabout with several of our colleagues in this body, and I have been \njoined by many supporters in the House of Representatives. I believe it \nis very important.\n  As we hear story after story from Americans in each of our States \nabout what they are facing--being dropped from policies they liked and \nwanted to keep, having premium increases of 1,000 percent in some \ncases, getting their work hours cut back to under 30 hours a week--the \nfact remains that Washington has essentially an exemption from all of \nthat pain. Washington has a big taxpayer-funded subsidy that nobody \nelse in America at the same income level can get, and that really needs \nto end.\n  One critical component of this issue is the fact that even though the \nObamaCare statute clearly said that every Member of Congress and all of \ntheir official staff had to go to the exchanges for their health care--\nand of course mentioned nothing about any huge taxpayer-funded \nsubsidy--in fact, that language was considered and not included. Even \nthough that is crystal clear under the statute, the Obama \nadministration issued a special rule to get around that clear language. \nPart of that rule, which I think is outrageous on its face, says: Well, \nwe don't know who official staff are. We cannot determine that, so we \nare going to leave it up to each individual Member of Congress to \ndetermine who their official staff are. As long as they deem certain \nstaff nonofficial, then they don't have to go to the exchanges at all. \nThey don't have to follow that clear mandate in the statute itself.\n  Well, again, when we are talking about folks who work on our staff, \ncommittee staff, and leadership staff, that is ridiculous. They are \nclearly official staff. They are not campaign staff. They are not off \nCapitol Hill and outside of government. They are not working for other \nentities. They are clearly official staff. This is just one of the \nmajor ways this illegal rule does an end run around the clear language \nof the statute.\n  In reaction to that part of the illegal rule, I introduced a bill \nthat simply says these decisions by each individual Member of the \nSenate and the House need to be made public. There needs to be full \ndisclosure when anybody is using this end-run around and saying: Yes, \nthis person works for me but somehow they are not ``official,'' so they \ndo not have to follow the mandate of ObamaCare to go to the exchanges. \nThat information should absolutely be public, and I put that in the \nform of a bill which I have filed both as a freestanding bill and as an \namendment to the measure before the Senate today.\n  Whatever we think about the underlying issues--and I know there is \ndisagreement--to me it should be a no-brainer that there is full \ndisclosure about how each individual office handles the situation. That \nis not fully disclosed now. Some Members may choose to say it to the \npress, to answer press questions, but it is not public information. It \nseems clear to me that how each office elects to handle that situation, \nhow each elected Member elects to handle that situation, should be, by \ndefinition, public information, fully disclosed.\n  The measure I am talking about right now, that is all it does. It \ndoes not prohibit anything else from going on. I object to that. I have \nother measures I will push to prohibit it. But all the measure I am \ntalking about right now does is make sure that information, that \nelection by each individual Member, is public, that there is full \ndisclosure about something I think clearly the public has a right to \nknow about. So I am simply on the floor lobbying for that measure to \npass and lobbying for a vote opportunity up or down on that important \nprovision.\n  My first choice would be a simple vote on the measure in front of the \nSenate right now, the drug compounding bill. I have no interest in \ndelaying progress of that bill. I simply want an amendment vote on the \nmeasure I am describing. We can vote it up or down. Either way, I think \nit is crystal clear this bill will proceed to become law. If my \namendment is adopted, it would be voted on in the House. I think it \nwould clearly be passed, become law. That is my first choice request \nhere.\n  If that is not possible, I do have a second choice request, which is \nto simply make this vote in order in the context of the next major bill \ncoming to the floor, the National Defense Authorization Act--again, a \nsimple amendment, a simple vote. I have no interest in delaying the \ntime running on the consideration of this bill, on delaying votes on \nthis bill, or of delaying debate and voting on other amendments on the \nDefense authorization bill. It seems to me that is a very basic, \nstraightforward request: a vote on a pure disclosure provision.\n  By the way, this provision has been hotlined on the Republican side, \nand there is no Republican objection to the substance of this \nprovision. It is pure disclosure. We all think it should be public \ninformation. There is no objection.\n  So I would simply ask unanimous consent to proceed in this way and \nexpedite, in the process, consideration of all of this, including the \ncompounding bill on the floor right now. The distinguished floor \nmanager for the bill said a few minutes ago he does not want delay on \nthis bill. I do not want it either. There does not have to be any \ndelay, and, in fact, this unanimous consent will expedite all of that \nconsideration.\n  In that spirit, I ask unanimous consent that all remaining time on \nthe motion to proceed to H.R. 3204, the compounding bill, be yielded \nback; that the motion to proceed be agreed to; that my amendment No. \n2024 be the only amendment in order; that no second-degree amendments \nbe in order; and that the amendment be subject to a 60-vote affirmative \nthreshold for adoption; I further ask that there be 2 hours of debate \nequally divided, and that upon the use or yielding back of that time, \nthe Senate proceed to a vote on my amendment; following the disposition \nof my amendment, that the bill, as amended, if amended, be read a third \ntime and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and \nlaid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. VITTER. Well, Mr. President, reclaiming my time, that is \nunfortunate.\n\n[[Page S7985]]\n\nThat could dispose of this bill and pass this bill today--a very \nstraightforward, expeditious way of passing this bill with no delay.\n  I said I had a second choice, a path forward which I think is very \nreasonable as well, related to the National Defense Authorization Act.\n  So let me propose this unanimous consent request: I ask unanimous \nconsent that all remaining time on the motion to proceed to H.R. 3204, \nthe compounding bill, be yielded back; that the Senate proceed to H.R. \n3204; that the bill be read a third time and passed, and the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; I further ask \nthat the Senate then proceed to the consideration of S. 1197, the \nnational defense authorization bill; that my amendment, which is at the \ndesk, be called up, and that notwithstanding rule XXII, my amendment \nremain in order; that no second-degree amendments to my amendment be in \norder; and that the amendment be subject to a 60-vote affirmative \nthreshold for passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on behalf of leadership, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. VITTER. Well, Mr. President, reclaiming my time again, I think \nthat is unfortunate. That would be an even quicker route forward on the \ncompounding bill because had that unanimous consent request been agreed \nto, the compounding bill would have just passed the Senate. It would \nhave happened right now, and we would move on to something that clearly \nneeds time for debate and discussion and amendments, the National \nDefense Authorization Act.\n  In closing, let me underscore all I am seeking, urging, and, yes, \ndemanding is a clear up-or-down vote on a pure disclosure provision: \nlet the public know, as I think they clearly have a right to, how each \nindividual Member is handling the situation. If a Member actually has \nthe gall, in my opinion, to say: No, all these people who work for me \nare not ``official staff'' and therefore they can right out ignore the \nclear language and mandate of ObamaCare that says Congress and all \nstaff must go to the exchanges for their health care--people have a \nright to know that.\n  By the way, a lot of Members, including myself, say: No, we are all \ngoing to the exchanges. That is what the law says. It is perfectly \nclear, and that is what we are going to live by. A lot of Members are \ndoing that.\n  Either way, the public should know what is going on. There should be \nfull disclosure, and that is all the provision I am discussing today \ndoes.\n  It has been completely cleared by hotline on the Republican side. \nThere is no objection. I would urge us to move forward with a simple, \nstraightforward vote on it, so we can expedite consideration of this \nbill on the floor, so we can move more quickly to the national defense \nauthorization bill, which does merit a lot of significant floor time, \nso we can have amendment votes on that bill immediately and not have \nany controversy about that.\n  I urge that reasonable and expedited and clear path forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to say a couple things about my \nobjections. I know a lot of Senators, when they object, always use that \nphrase: reserving the right to object. But I think if you look at the \nSenate rules, there is no such provision for reserving a right to \nobject. I have always made it my habit that if you object, you object, \nand then, when you get time on the floor, you explain why you objected. \nThus, I am taking my time now to explain why I objected.\n  The Senator from Louisiana propounded two unanimous consent requests. \nThe first was basically that we go ahead and get to the bill, the \ncompounding bill that we are on right now; that his amendment, which \nhas nothing to do with the bill, by the way--and I think he would agree \nwith that. It has nothing to do with it. It is not even relevant, not \neven germane to this bill. It has something to do with ObamaCare and \nwhether we tell people whether our staffs are going on the exchange. So \nit has nothing to do with this bill.\n  It seems odd that the Senator from Louisiana says he wants an \ninalienable right to be able to offer an amendment to this bill, but no \none can offer an amendment to his amendment. It is kind of a double \nstandard, to my way of thinking. He says that we vote on his amendment \nand that no second-degree amendments be in order. Why not? If \namendments were allowed to be in order on the bill that were nongermane \nand nonrelevant, why shouldn't there be a second-degree amendment \nallowed on his amendment? Kind of a double standard. He wants it all \nhis way, without thinking about the rest of the Senate. Well, again, \nthat is why I keep saying we need the rules changed so that not one \nperson can demand such outrageous accommodations.\n  Again, this bill is so important to get passed and to get to the \nPresident so we can begin this process of protecting the health and \nsafety of the American people. We know how to treat compounders, and \nthey have to register and stop doing what they have been doing in the \npast. This is vitally important.\n  The Senator says: Well, we can expedite it if only you will do it my \nway. Why should we have to do it his way? When 97 people already voted \non this bill, when it passed the House by unanimous consent, why should \nit be: Well, this one Senator has the right to stop this bill, slow it \ndown, unless we meet the demands of that Senator? Yes, it is outrageous \nin terms of how we conduct our business in the Senate.\n  Again, I have argued for a long time that rules need to be changed. I \nhave also argued for a long time that the minority ought to have the \nright, the inalienable right, to offer amendments, but amendments that \nare relevant and germane to the bill before you; otherwise, you get \namendments on everything from Timbuktu to wherever on any bill, and \nthat you can keep offering them and offering them and offering them.\n  It was my understanding that the majority leader offered to the \nSenator from Louisiana an up-or-down vote on his amendment--not on this \nbill, but at some point an up-or-down vote, as long as that was the \ndefinitive vote on the amendment and it would not keep coming up. It is \nfurther my understanding that the Senator disagreed with that, that he \nwanted the right to bring it up again and again and again and again. I \nthink this is, again, an outrageous imposition of one Senator's views \nand considerations on the entire Senate.\n  I would say to the Senator that there ought to be some way for the \nSenator to get an up-or-down vote on his amendment--not on this bill. \nIt is not relevant. It is not germane. I do not think it is relevant or \ngermane on the Defense bill. I will say more about that in a second. \nBut we have a lot of things coming down the pike before we leave here \nthis year--or even in the next session of this Congress--to accommodate \nthe Senator from Louisiana on his amendment. But why should we have to \nkeep voting on it time after time after time if we have one dispositive \nvote on it up or down, which is, as I understand, what the majority \nleader offered?\n  Secondly, in regard to the second unanimous consent request proffered \nby the Senator from Louisiana, to which I objected on behalf of the \nmajority leader--I am not the chairman of the Defense Authorization \nCommittee, nor do I have the right to bring legislation to the floor--\nagain, the Senator wants everything accommodated to his wishes because \nif you read the unanimous consent request, the Senator asks the Senate \nthen proceed--well, there is a word missing there--it means: to the \nconsideration of S. 1197, the Defense authorization bill.\n  That is the right of the majority leader. It is the majority leader's \nright to bring legislation on the floor--not my right, not the right of \nthe Senator from Louisiana, not the right of a Senator from anyplace \nelse. I do not know if the majority leader wants to go to the Defense \nauthorization bill next. I do not know, but that is not my decision to \nmake. But the Senator from Louisiana says he wants to make that \ndecision, and to make sure the Senate does just that. I would say to \nthe Senator from Louisiana, well, when he becomes the majority leader, \nhe would have that right.\n  So he wants, again, to be able to bring up his amendment--again, \nwhich has nothing basically to do with the\n\n[[Page S7986]]\n\nDefense authorization bill--and, again, that no second-degree amendment \nbe in order on his amendment--again, a little bit of a double standard.\n  He wants the right to offer a nongermane, nonrelevant amendment to a \nbill, but nobody can offer any amendments to his amendment in the \nsecond degree. Well, I think we see this for what it is. The Senator \nobviously wants to vote on his amendment, maybe today, maybe tomorrow, \nmaybe next week, maybe next month; I do not know how many times he \nwants to vote on his amendment. He was offered the right for an up-or-\ndown dispositive vote on that amendment.\n  My understanding is--it is only my understanding; I do not know \nwhether this is correct--that was turned down by the Senator from \nLouisiana. So I say that is why I objected to both of these requests, \nbecause on the compounding bill, of the necessity to get it through. I \ndo not know whether the Senator's amendment would fail or lose. I do \nnot. But I do know that the House has said they will not take the \ncompounding bill back. You might say the House is unreasonable. I do \nnot run the House. I do not run the House. All I know is the House \npassed it by unanimous consent, sent it over here, and said if it is \namended, they will not then revisit it. That is what the House said.\n  So if the Senator's amendment, as worthy as it might be to some, is \nput on the compounding bill, that is the end of the compounding bill. \nThat is the end of protecting the people of America, their health and \ntheir safety, that we have worked so hard to come together. That is why \nit has no place on this bill.\n  It may have a place, and I say that the Senator should have a right \nfor a vote on his amendment at some point on either a relevant bill or \na freestanding bill, that the Senator gets the right for an up-or-down \nvote on his amendment, either as a freestanding bill itself or as a \nrelevant or germane amendment to some other bill on the floor. He \nshould have that right but not to stymie, to stop a bill that is so \nvital to the health and safety of the American people. That is why I \nobjected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the \ndistinguished floor manager. I want to respond very briefly. My goal is \na clear up-or-down vote on this pure disclosure proposal. I am open for \nsuggestions for that to happen in any reasonable timeframe, meaning \nthis calendar year.\n  I have focused on these two bills simply because it seems to me, from \nwhat I know of the Senate schedule and floor activity, these are going \nto be the only opportunities in terms of amendments proposed. If there \nare other opportunities we can identify for this year, if we can \nidentify an opportunity for a vote on a freestanding bill, I am all \nears. I am completely open to that. I want more amendment votes in the \nSenate, not fewer. If there is a side-by-side idea, that is fine by me. \nI am completely open to that. I simply made these concrete suggestions \nbecause, based on what I know of the majority leader's plans for the \nrest of the calendar year, these are going to be the amendment \nopportunities.\n  By the way, the only reason I put in my second consent to turn to the \nDefense bill is because that is exactly what the majority leader \narticulated as his desire, his plan, to turn to that as soon as \npossible, to take up amendments.\n  So I am open for any reasonable opportunity this year for this vote. \nAgain, this is a pure disclosure provision. I do not see why it should \nbe partisan or controversial. It has been cleared through the hotline \non my side. So if there are any other suggestions of how this can \nhappen, I am completely open to that.\n  Unfortunately, I had a phone call with the distinguished majority \nleader last week and proposed various options. His response was simply: \nNo. No. No. No. No other ideas, no other options. No. But I am \ncompletely open to those other ideas. It is obviously part of the \ntradition of the Senate that nongermane amendments are considered all \nthe time. In fact, with regard to the Defense bill, that is the norm, \nnot exception. There are usually significant nongermane amendments, \noften by the majority side, sometimes by the majority leadership, which \nare critical votes on the Defense authorization bill. That is not \nunusual at all.\n  I am for more amendment votes, if there are alternative ideas on this \ntopic, more amendment votes there, not fewer. So I look forward to \nmoving forward in a productive, effective way toward getting this \nsimple vote on disclosure and toward moving in an expedited way through \nthis bill and to the Defense bill and whatever else is on the Senate \ncalendar as determined by the majority leader. But, again, so far the \nresponse is no, across the board, not any sort of alternative \nsuggestion.\n  Finally, with regard to the idea of having one vote and one vote \nonly, there is a clear practical problem with agreeing to that. That is \nthe following: For instance, what if there were one vote on my \ndisclosure provision on the Defense authorization bill? That bill is \ngoing to a conference committee, so it would obviously be possible for \nmy amendment to be adopted 100 to 0 and then be dumped in the \nconference committee and stripped from the bill. Then I would have \nforgone the opportunity to ever bring up the subject again this entire \nCongress. I mean that is a fool's agreement. I am not going to agree to \na fool's agreement. I need to be able to protect my right to revisit \nthe issue, particularly when it would pass through a vote under that \nscenario and then be stripped in conference.\n  So I hope we find a productive way forward. Again, this is a pure \ndisclosure provision. I am going for a simple up-or-down vote in \nwhatever context presents itself this calendar year, on this bill or \nany bill. I am open to other suggestions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Condolences to Senator Inhofe\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, before I begin, I would like to offer my \ncondolences to my friend and colleague from Oklahoma Senator Inhofe and \nhis family on the tragic loss of their son Perry. Both my wife and I \nwill continue to keep their entire family in our thoughts and prayers \nduring this very difficult time.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  I rise today to talk about the President's broken promises on \nObamaCare and its effects on the people of Nevada. For more than a \nmonth now, the American people have witnessed how poorly this \nburdensome law has been implemented. People all over the country are \nfrustrated with the problems plaguing healthcare.gov, as they should \nbe.\n  The government spent hundreds of millions of taxpayers' dollars to \noverpromise and underdeliver on the signature legislation of this \nadministration. But there are serious problems in addition to the Web \nsite, and one glaring issue in particular I would like to focus on \ntoday. We have all heard from the law's supporters that ObamaCare would \ngive uninsured Americans access to health insurance. Time and time \nagain they promised that people who already had their health plan could \nkeep it. In fact, President Obama made the exact promise on numerous \noccasions.\n  In a speech to the American Medical Association in June of 2009, \nPresident Obama said:\n\n       . . . no matter how we reform health care, we will keep \n     this promise to the American people: If you like your doctor, \n     you will be able to keep your doctor, period. If you like \n     your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health \n     care plan, period.\n\n  But one of my constituents sent me a letter last week telling me that \nthat was not the case. Sunny from the Las Vegas area wrote, ``I wanted \nto tell you that we have lost our wonderful health insurance plan.'' \nSunny's family received a letter from their insurance company telling \nthem that their existing plan did not qualify under the Affordable Care \nAct. They were automatically reassigned to a new plan that cost about \n$400 more per month.\n  Let's remember what the President said, this time in August of 2009, \nduring his weekly Presidential address about what he called ``phony \nclaims'' regarding health reform:\n\n       If you like your private health insurance plan, you can \n     keep your plan. Period.\n\n  But yet another one of my constituents, Kirk from northern Nevada, \nwas\n\n[[Page S7987]]\n\njust notified that his current health insurance has been cancelled. He \nwent to the exchange to find a new policy and shared his story with me. \nHe wrote:\n\n       . . . despite higher deductibles and higher co-pays, my new \n     insurance under this devastating law will be more than 250% \n     of what I am paying now.\n\n  Again, March 15, 2010, just a few days before the law was passed--\nalbeit unread--by a party-line vote and signed into law, President \nObama said:\n\n       If you like your plan, you can keep your plan. If you like \n     your doctor, you can keep your doctor.\n\n  I wonder how President Obama and the law's supporters would explain \nthat statement to Marc in Reno. Marc received a letter telling him that \nhis current plan was no longer offered. The plan, the letter detailed, \nwas cancelled in order to ``meet the requirements of the new laws.'' \nMarc was given the option to keep his plan for 1 additional year if he \naccepted a rate increase, even though he just saw a rate increase in \nSeptember.\n  Mark goes on to tell me:\n\n       As an individual health care plan holder and a self-\n     employed individual, the ACA appears to punish me for doing \n     the right thing by having a health care plan for the past 10 \n     years and rewards those who did not.\n\n  But yet as recently as this past July, President Obama promised:\n\n       If you already have health care, the only thing this bill \n     does is make sure that it's even more secure and insurance \n     companies can't jerk you around.\n\n  President Obama made this statement more than 2 years after his \nadministration admitted in comments in the Federal Register that 40 to \n67 percent of existing individual policies would lose their \ngrandfathered status. The President knew millions of Americans stood to \nlose their existing policies but he repeatedly told the American public \nin no uncertain terms that they could keep their plan.\n  I think Steven from Washoe County would likely take issue with that \npromise. He told me that he now has health care that costs $293 per \nmonth. However, he just received a letter from his health care provider \ninforming him that the cost of his health care would increase to $546 \nper month on January 1. That means his health insurance costs will \nnearly double next year.\n  There is nothing affordable about that. There is nothing secure about \nthat.\n  On September 26, just days before the exchanges opened to a \ndisastrous rollout, the President repeated yet again what the \nadministration knew was not true:\n\n       . . . the first thing you need to know is this: If you \n     already have health care, you don't have to do anything.\n\n  Well, I have another letter here from a father from Reno. He writes:\n\n       I am writing to tell you that I'm now eating crow. A few \n     weeks back I wrote to you and expressed my support for health \n     reform and my dissatisfaction with the government shutdown. \n     Since then, I've received notification from my insurance \n     company informing me that my current policy is being \n     discontinued. I then began shopping for new policies for \n     myself and my family and have found that rates are two to \n     three times what I am currently paying and that my max out of \n     pocket will double, all for basically the same plan as what I \n     have now. In essence, I've been put into a situation where I \n     can either save for my kid's college education or buy \n     healthcare.\n\n  But this particular letter closes with something that really \nhighlights the tough financial decisions facing the American people in \nthese difficult economic times. This father says:\n\n       I'm unfortunately one of those people who makes too much \n     money to qualify for Federal subsidy, but not enough to sell \n     my house which is still underwater from the housing crisis of \n     2008.\n\n  This is the reality of the health care law. Now, in addition to \ntrying to save for his children's education and attempting to recover \nfrom the housing crisis, a father has been forced off the plan he \nlikes.\n  The options available are two or three times more expensive. These \nstories don't fit with the narrative we have heard for nearly 5 years. \nPresident Obama is now trying to backtrack on the dozens of times he \nmade his promise to the American people. Only last week he said:\n\n       Now, if you have or had one of these plans before the \n     Affordable Care Act came into law and you really liked that \n     plan, what we said was you can keep it if it hasn't changed \n     since the law passed.\n\n  That is just not true. That is not what he promised. Now my \nconstituents are receiving cancellation notices for their existing \nplans.\n  The administration argues that even though many people are losing \ntheir existing plans, those plans were subpar policies and their new \npolicies will be better, but that ignores the promise. My constituents \nliked their plans. They decided what was best for them, what plans fit \ntheir individual and family needs.\n  The President and the administration knew before the legislation \npassed that millions of Americans would lose their current plans. They \nadmitted it in the Federal Register after the bill was signed into law, \nbut the whole time they continued to promote this promise and dismiss \nany concerns as fearmongering or phony claims. That is unacceptable.\n  These personal stories are why I am proud to cosponsor the If You \nLike Your Health Plan You Can Keep It Act, introduced by my colleague \nSenator Johnson of Wisconsin. This is a simple but necessary bill to \ngive Americans the ability to keep their health plans if they like \nthem. The people of Nevada deserve better, and they deserve to have a \ngovernment that keeps its promises.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Gun Violence\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, reports are emerging of another school \nshooting today. Early reports out of Pittsburgh are that three people \nhave been shot at a high school. The police right now are searching for \nthe shooter in the woods surrounding the high school. We hope and we \npray that the three reported victims will survive.\n  This is becoming part of our regular work week in Washington; that we \ncan expect at some point during the week that we are going to turn on \nthe TV to one of the cable news networks and find a live report from a \nschool or a mall or a church somewhere in this country where a shooting \nis in progress. It is happening at a rate I don't think any of us could \nhave expected. This number is growing at a rate I don't think any of us \ncould have expected.\n  I brought this chart to the floor of the Senate for about 6 months \nsince the failure of our commonsense anti-gun violence bill this \nspring. This number represents the number of Americans who have died of \ngun violence since December 14.\n  December 14 means something to everybody in this Chamber but \ncertainly to those of us from Connecticut. That is the day in which 26 \n6- and 7-year-olds and the teachers who protected them died in Sandy \nHook--10,465 additional people have died.\n  I have tried to come down to the Senate floor since the failure of \nthat bill to try to tell the stories of these victims. If statistics \ndon't do the job, if the sheer numbers alone don't convince people that \nsomething should change, then maybe hearing about who these people are \nmight change things. We hope we will not add to this number with some \nnew young victims from the reported shooting in Pittsburgh today.\n  These shootings happen in unlikely places. Schools, now, \nunfortunately, are a likely place for a shooting to happen because they \nseem to happen with some regularity in schools, in part because we do \nvery little, if anything, to stop them with legislation from this \nChamber.\n  They are happening in other unlikely places as well. Clubs--for \ninstance, in New Haven, CT--have been the site four times just this \nyear of major shootings. Only a few weeks ago, on October 26, police in \nNew Haven responded to an early Saturday morning shooting at a place \ncalled the Key Club Cabaret. They arrived and found that 26-year-old \nErika Robinson had been killed in a shooting spree that also injured \n19-year-old Amanda John, 29-year-old Jahad Brumsey, 24-year-old Nijia \nWard, 34-year-old Albert Dickerson, as well as 25-year-old Ivette \nSterling.\n  Officers rushed to the scene as hundreds of patrons were running out.\n\n[[Page S7988]]\n\nThey walked in and found six victims of gun violence--a dispute in a \nclub resulting in the death of Erika Robinson and several more being \ninjured.\n  Only a few days ago, in Cypress, TX, there was another shooting at a \nhouse party in which two high school students were killed and 19 others \nwere injured shortly before 11 p.m. on November 9, 2013. There was a \nhouse party celebrating a young woman's 18th birthday. And because of a \nlocal dispute between two rival groups, Qu'eric Danarius Bernard \nRichardson, 17 years old, was killed, and Arielle Shepherd as well. \nAccording to authorities, Richardson was shot in the head while he was \nrunning away from the house party. When students returned to school on \nMonday, there was a lot of crying as they mourned the death of two of \ntheir classmates.\n\n  School parties celebrating 18th birthdays, clubs in places like New \nHaven and Bridgeport, CT--not places you think of going where you might \nend up being shot at when you walk into them--are now the scenes of \npretty vicious shootings, as are our schools.\n  And shootings are increasingly happening in another way as well--by \naccident. Unfortunately, in preparation for a lot of these speeches, I \nriffle through a lot of pretty grizzly reports and increasingly I am \nseeing more and more accidental shootings ending up in tragedy. In \nWaterbury, CT, again, just a few weeks ago, Dow Kling and Shawn French, \nboth 22 years old, were playing around with their .22 caliber Ruger \ninside an apartment in Waterbury when the gun went off and Dow was shot \nto death. His best friend Shawn French, who shot him, said:\n\n       I'm sorry. I wish it was me and not him. I wish I could \n     trade places with him, I really do.\n\n  A week earlier, in Henderson, NV, another example where Cherish \nPincombe was playing around with a gun with her friend Colin Lowrey. \nThe Remington .45 was loaded. They didn't know it was loaded, and Colin \nshot Cherish dead, 23 years old. She was described as follows:\n\n       An amazing coworker. She was so caring. She was kind. She \n     was always helpful. She always wanted to do something to help \n     you out. She was very generous.\n\n  And just because they didn't understand the gun was loaded, and they \nwere being reckless and playing around with a firearm, Cherish is dead.\n  So that is why people out there don't understand why we can't have an \nhonest conversation about change. Even when those conversations are \nattempting to take place, they get shut down and cut off. A pretty \ninnocent op-ed piece in the Guns & Ammo magazine suggested that maybe \npeople should get a few hours of training before they get a concealed \ncarry permit. As a consequence of running that editorial, the editor of \nGuns & Ammo had to resign and step down, simply because he ran an op-ed \nby an author that suggested maybe people should get some training \nbefore they have a concealed weapon.\n  So even when we try to engage in these discussions, we can't have \nthem because the folks who get their money from the gun industry, \nwhether it be the NRA or these magazines, aren't even allowed to have \nthese conversations, despite the fact that 84 percent of gun owners \nsupport universal background checks, despite the fact that 50 percent \nof gun owners support a restriction on high-capacity ammunition clips, \ndespite the fact that 46 percent of gun owners think it is a good idea \nto ban high-powered assault weapons.\n  Organizations such as Guns & Ammo and the NRA are out of step with \ngun owners who don't want to see this number continue increasing, who \ndon't want to turn on the TV and see another school shooting.\n  The reason I come here to talk about who these victims are is because \nthe conscience of this Nation should be enough to move this place to \naction, and it is about time gun owners and nongun owners alike get \ntogether to do something about this. There is much more agreement than \nthere is disagreement among both people who own guns and people who \nchoose not to own guns. Whether it is background checks or a ban on \nillegal gun trafficking or just a simple requirement that you get a \nlittle bit of training on how to use a gun so you don't fire it \naccidentally and end up shooting your best friend, there are simple \ncommonsense bipartisan things we can do to make sure this number \ndoesn't continue to accelerate at the pace that it has since December \n14.\n  I thank the Chair, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murphy). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here today for now the 50th time \nto urge my colleagues to wake up to what carbon pollution is doing to \nour atmosphere and our oceans. Once a week--50 weeks--every week. Why? \nWhy do I do this?\n  First, because it is real. It is very real. It is happening. Here is \nthe change in average global surface temperature since 1970. It is \npretty hard to deny. Of course, if you are a denier, you will look at \nit and you will see from the same data that it stopped. The denier who \ntells you it stopped won't tell you that it stopped five times earlier \non the way up. In fact, you could say that climate change has stopped \nsix times since the 1970s, and even went down, but it didn't stay \nstopped long.\n  Look at the linear trend for the whole data set from 1970 to 2013. No \none can deny over this period the Earth is warming. This decade was \nwarmer than the last, which was warmer than the one before that, which \nwas warmer than the one before that.\n  Let's look at NASA's entire historic surface temperature record going \nback to the 19th century. Listen to what University of California \nBerkeley physics professor Richard Muller has to say about the \ntemperature record.\n\n       The frequent rises and falls, virtually a stairstep \n     pattern, are part of the historic record, and there is no \n     expectation that they will stop, whatever their cause. . . . \n     [T]he land temperature record . . . is full of fits and \n     starts that make the upward trend vanish for short periods. \n     Regardless of whether we understand them, there is no reason \n     to expect them to stop.\n\n  Here you can see again these short steps in the upward march.\n  One reason we can't expect these upward steps to stop is that we know \nwhat is driving them. What is driving climate change is something even \ncontrarian scientists accept; that is, more carbon dioxide leads to \nmore warming. Simple as that; a 150-year-old established basic \nprinciple of physics.\n  This is the October 1861 edition of the London, Edinburgh, and Dublin \nPhilosophical Magazine and Journal of Science. It includes a manuscript \nby physicist John Tyndall entitled ``Radiation of Heat by Gases and \nVapours.'' He says:\n\n       [T]o account for different amounts of heat being preserved \n     to the Earth at different times, a slight change in [the \n     atmosphere's] variable constituents would suffice for this. \n     Such changes in fact may have produced all the mutations of \n     climate which the researches of geologists reveal.\n\n  The ``variable constituents'' to which Tyndall refers include carbon \ndioxide, methane, and water vapor. That is from 1861. President Lincoln \ntook office that year. Yet here we are today having to explain on the \nfloor of the Senate the physics of what carbon dioxide does in the \natmosphere.\n  It is not just the principle that is established. There are lots of \nmeasurements. The carbon dioxide in our atmosphere now exceeds 400 \nparts per million. For the last 800,000 years--at least 800,000 years, \nand perhaps actually millions of years--we have been in a range of 170 \nto 300 parts per million. That has been the whole of human existence. \nHomo sapiens have been around for about 200,000 of those 800,000 years, \nand it is only now--it is only since the industrial revolution--that we \nhave broken out of that safe window that has protected us through that \nentire history of our species and now we have broken to 400. And that \nis a measurement.\n  Look at the oceans. Oceans have absorbed more than 90 percent of the \nexcess heat caused by greenhouse gases over the last 50 years. \nAbsorbing all that heat makes the oceans rise.\n\n[[Page S7989]]\n\nOceans have absorbed about 30 percent of our carbon emissions, which \nwould otherwise be in the atmosphere causing more warming. Absorbing \nthat carbon makes the oceans more acidic, and that is all stuff we \nmeasure.\n  At the Newport tide gauge, sea level is up almost 10 inches since the \n1930s when we had our catastrophic 1938 hurricane in Rhode Island. You \nmeasure that. It basically takes a ruler.\n  We are about 3 to 4 degrees warmer in the winter in Narragansett Bay \nthan we were 50 years ago when my wife's URI mentor was doing his \ndoctoral thesis--3 to 4 degrees. You measure that. It takes a \nthermometer.\n  And the ocean is acidifying at the fastest rate recorded in 50 \nmillion years. You measure that with a litmus test, which anybody with \nan aquarium does.\n  It is one thing to be against science, it is another to be the party \nagainst measurement. So the polluters and front groups don't talk much \nabout the oceans, but that doesn't change the fact this is real and it \nis past denying.\n  That takes me to the second reason I do this, and that is that it is \nplain old-fashioned wrong when people lie and trick other people, \nparticularly when people are going to be hurt by the lies. And it is \nworse when there is money behind the trickery--when it is purposeful. \nLies cannot go unanswered, and that is another reason that I speak.\n  There isn't just lying going on. There is a whole carefully built \napparatus: phony-baloney organizations designed to look and sound like \nthey are real, messages honed by public relations experts to sound like \nthey are true, payroll scientists whom polluters can trot out when they \nneed them, and the whole thing big and complicated enough to be fooled \ninto thinking it is not all the same beast. But it is. It is akin to \nthe mythical Hydra--many heads, same beast.\n  One day folks are going to look back at this and those behind it are \ngoing to be disgraced for what they did and it is going to be a \nscandal. That is the third reason I speak. We are all going to be \njudged very harshly, with all the dread power that history has to \ninflict on wrong. The polluters and their collaborators will be judged \nharshly. The Republican Party will be judged harshly for letting itself \nbe led astray by them. But--and here is where it truly hurts--the \nfailure of American democracy this is causing will also be judged \nharshly and will stain the reputation of our great American experiment. \nWe in this generation have been passed this precious experiment by \ngenerations before us that fought, bled, and died to put it safely in \nour hands--and we do this. We foul it, by lying and denying for a bunch \nof polluters. Some generation we are going to be.\n  If we believe this world needs America, this matters. Because a world \nfouled and changed by carbon pollution, in ways we could foresee but \ndenied, will not believe it as much of a need for what a lying and \ndenying America has to offer. This episode will darken the lamp America \nholds up to the world. We are a great country but not when we are lying \nand denying it is real. The atmosphere is warming; ice is melting; seas \nare warming, rising, and acidifying. It is time for the misleading \nfantasies to end.\n  Here is how we go forward. First, price carbon right. Make the big \ncarbon polluters pay a fee to the American people, as I have proposed \nwith Representatives Waxman and Blumenauer and Senator Schatz; a \npollution fee to cover the cost of dumping their waste into our \natmosphere and oceans, a cost which they now happily push off onto the \nrest of us. I know at present political conditions do not allow us to \nprice carbon, so we must change those political conditions, and we can.\n  Recently, President Obama changed the calculus for polluters: carbon \npollution standards for new and existing powerplants, no more unchecked \ncarbon dumping. Fifty powerplants emit one out of every eight tons of \nAmerica's carbon dioxide emissions. These 50 dirtiest U.S. powerplants \nemit more than Canada or Korea. When the big polluters see the costs of \ncomplying with those new standards coming down at them, they may take a \nsecond look at an economywide carbon fee. Here is a news flash. When \nthe polluters' calculus begins to change, the political calculus in \nCongress will change too.\n  Nothing says we have to wait for the polluters to figure this out on \ntheir schedule. There are armies on our side. It is not just the \nenvironmental groups such as the Natural Resources Defense Council, \nLeague of Conservation Voters, Environmental Defense Fund, Sierra Club \nor National Wildlife Federation. It is not just virtually every major \nscientific organization, such as the American Association for the \nAdvancement of Science, the American Geophysical Union or the American \nMeteorological Society.\n  We have faith-based groups such as the U.S. Conference of Catholic \nBishops, the National Council of the Churches of Christ, Interfaith \nPower & Light, the Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life, and \nthe Jewish Council for Public Affairs. We have fishing, wildlife, and \noutdoor groups such as Trout Unlimited, Pheasants Forever, and Ducks \nUnlimited. They are joined by major sports leagues such as the National \nFootball League, Major League Baseball, National Basketball \nAssociation, and National Hockey League, as well as the American Lung \nAssociation--which prefer to see kids playing outside in clean, healthy \nair.\n  We have the Joint Chiefs of Staff on our side, joined by NASA, the \nNational Academies, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, even the Government Accountability Office, the \ncongressional watchdog. By the way, about NASA--let's not forget that \nNASA scientists sent an SUV-sized rover to Mars, they landed it safely \non Mars, and they are driving it around on Mars right now. I will put \nNASA scientists up against the polluters' payroll scientists all day \nlong.\n  We have insurers and reinsurers whose business depends on \nunderstanding the mounting risk of natural disasters, folks such as \nMunich Re, Swiss Re, Allianz, and the Reassurance Association of \nAmerica. We have State and local governments that are already active. \nNine Northeastern States, for instance, including my own Rhode Island, \nengage in cap and trade through the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. \nFour Florida counties share resources and strategies for adapting to \nclimate change through the bipartisan Southeast Florida Regional \nClimate Change Compact, and those are just two examples of many from \naround the country.\n  A coalition of investors worth nearly $3 trillion just wrote to 45 \nfossil fuel companies seeking explanation about risks facing their \nfossil fuel investments. Divestment campaigns are popping up at college \ncampuses across the Nation. Major utilities accept the science and are \ninvesting in renewables and improving efficiency. Energy companies \nPG, the Public Service Company of New Mexico, and Exelon all quit the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce after a Chamber official called for putting \nclimate science on trial such as the Scopes ``monkey trial'' of 1925.\n  America's flagship companies such as General Motors, Ford, Coca-Cola, \nPepsi, Nike, Apple, Walmart, and Alcoa all recognize the serious \nimplications of climate change. This support is latent, though, and it \nis unorganized. It is time to wake up and to gather our armies. We have \nto create allied command, assemble our divisions, agree on a strategy, \nand go into action. That will affect the calculus in Congress.\n  Most important, we have the American people. Sixty-five percent of \nvoters support the President taking significant steps to address \nclimate change now. Another poll found that 82 percent of Americans \nbelieve we should start preparing now for rising sea levels and severe \nstorms from climate change. Those in Congress who would deny science to \nprotect the polluting interests increasingly look ridiculous, even to \ntheir own side. Misleading statements in the media, such as the stuff \npurveyed by the opinion page of the Wall Street Journal, are losing \ntheir battle and losing their audience. It is not just time to wake up. \nPeople are waking up. Inevitably, the truth will be fully known.\n  The polls show clearly that climate denial is a losing tactic. Four \nout of five voters under 35 support the President taking action to \naddress climate change. Fifty-two percent of young Republican voters \nwould be less likely to vote for someone who opposed the President's \nclimate action plan. Even a majority of Texans say more should be done \nabout global warming by all levels of government, with 62 percent of\n\n[[Page S7990]]\n\nTexans saying more should be done in Congress. For those last holdout \ndeniers comes this: Fifty-three percent of young Republican voters \nunder age 35 said they would describe a climate denier as ignorant, out \nof touch, or crazy.\n\n  Republicans outside of Congress are trying to lead their party back \nto reality and away from what even young Republicans are calling \nignorant, out of touch, and crazy extremist views. They support a \nrevenue-neutral carbon fee: Republicans such as our former colleagues \nin Congress, Sherwood Boehlert, Wayne Gilchrest, and Robert Inglis; \nRepublicans such as former Environmental Protection Agency \nAdministrators William Ruckelshaus, Lee Thomas, William Reilly, and \nChristine Todd Whitman, who served under Presidents Nixon, Reagan, \nGeorge H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush respectively; advisers such as \nPresident Reagan's Secretary of State George Schultz, Reagan's economic \npolicy adviser, Art Laffer--known as Reagan's economist--and David \nFromm, speech writer for George W. Bush.\n  Here is what the Republican Presidential nominee had to say 5 years \nago:\n\n       [I]n the end, we're all left with the same set of facts. \n     The facts of global warming demand our urgent attention, \n     especially in Washington. Good stewardship, prudence, and \n     simple common sense demand that we [act to] meet the \n     challenge, and act quickly. . . . We have many advantages in \n     the fight against global warming, but time is not one of \n     them.\n       [T]he fundamental incentives on the market are still on the \n     side of carbon-based energy. This has to change before we can \n     make the decisive shift away from fossil fuels. . . . [T]here \n     were costs we weren't counting . . . [a]nd these terrible \n     costs have added up now, in the atmosphere, in the oceans, \n     and all across the natural world. . . . We Americans like to \n     say that there is no problem we can't solve, however \n     complicated, and no obstacle we cannot overcome if we meet it \n     together. I believe this about our country. I know this about \n     our country. And now it is time for us to show those \n     qualities once again.\n\n  It is indeed time for us to show those qualities once again. It is \ntime to wake up. It is time to turn back from the misleading propaganda \nof the polluters, the misguided extremism of the tea party, and the \nmistaken belief that we can ignore without consequence the harm our \ncarbon pollution is causing. It is time to face facts, be adults, and \nmeet our responsibilities.\n  I give these speeches because climate change is real, because the \ncampaign of denial is as poisonous to our democracy as carbon pollution \nis to our atmosphere and oceans, and because I am confident, I am \nconfident we can do this. We can strengthen our economy, we can \nredirect our future, we can protect our democracy, and we can do our \nduty to the generations that will follow us and will look back in shame \nunless we change our program. But we have to pay attention. We have to \nwake up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I come to the floor once again to talk \nabout jobs and economic growth.\n  We are continuing to see signs of a steadily improving economy, with \nmore than 200,000 jobs created last month in the jobs report just \nreleased last Friday. Of those, 19,000 were new manufacturing jobs. We \nhave had 43 straight months of private sector job growth, but the \nunemployment rate remains stubbornly high and sadly particularly for \nthose who are long-term unemployed.\n  Earlier today the Budget Conference Committee met, and we heard from \nCongressional Budget Office Director Dr. Elmendorf. He let us know that \nin his view, the uncertainty--the lack of clarity about the path \nforward for all of us here, for the solutions we need for the budget \nand for the deficit--is one of the greatest drags on job creation and \non competitiveness for our country and our economy.\n  In our Budget Conference Committee, we need to come together and \nreach a balanced budget deal that repeals sequester and allows the \nAppropriations Committee--ably led by Chairman Mikulski--to move \nforward with an Omnibus appropriations bill for this fiscal year. We \ncannot afford, in my view, another long-term continuing resolution at \nthe current sequester levels.\n  As we heard today from Dr. Elmendorf, and as we have heard from other \nsources, the sequester will have killed 750,000 jobs by the end of the \nyear, and next year these ongoing, steady, grinding cuts could kill \nanother 800,000. These are jobs. These are investments by the Federal \nGovernment that could be helping the private sector create jobs in \nrepairing our crumbling infrastructure. In Delaware alone, we have 175 \ndeficient bridges being neglected. These are jobs that help families to \nput food on the table. In Kent County, DE, where Dover Air Force base \nis, sequester has hurt those who serve our Nation who operate the base \nand serve our country valiantly. These are jobs that could be going to \nhelp research a cure for cancer. NIH supported more than 500 jobs in \nDelaware in 2011. Now cuts are costing those jobs and setting us back \nin the fight to find a cure for cancer and many other diseases.\n\n  Sequester has been devastating to Delaware and the whole Nation. We \nneed to replace it with a smarter, more balanced set of spending \nreforms that maintains investments that will allow our country to be \ncompetitive. In particular, if I might, we need to refocus on jobs by \ninvesting in infrastructure and focusing on manufacturing.\n  In my view, the 19,000 jobs in the manufacturing sector that we just \nlearned were created in the last month were a promising development but \nfar from as many as we should be filling. Why? Because manufacturing \njobs are high-quality jobs. They pay more in wages and benefits. They \nhelp create secondary local service jobs. They contribute more to the \nlocal economy. And manufacturers invest more in private R than any \nother sector in our economy.\n  Mr. President, as you know, before I came here to the Senate and \nbefore my service in county government, I spent 8 years with a \nmanufacturing company in Delaware. At one point I was part of a large \nsite location team that went around the country to try to decide where \nto build a new state-of-the-art semiconductor chip packaging \nmanufacturing plant. To make a long story short, in the end we decided \non a location where there was a skilled and reliable workforce, a \nresponsive government that invested in the local infrastructure, and \ncertainly we considered other factors--tax rates and incentives offered \nby the State and local government--but really the skill of the \nworkforce and the quality of the infrastructure were absolutely \nessential to the decision we made--a surprising decision in terms of \nwhere we ultimately located. We invested and were able to get up and \nrunning a state-of-the-art plant in record time and were able to \ncontribute significantly to local employment and the tax base. This \ntaught me a lot about the significance of infrastructure and workforce \nskills.\n  If I could mention this, the World Economic Forum ranked the United \nStates 25th overall in infrastructure, a key drag on our \ncompetitiveness. The American Society of Civil Engineers says we are \nfalling behind by $250 billion a year in deferred maintenance, in \ninvestments not made by Federal, State, and local government. In my \nview, the case for infrastructure investment is a no-brainer. This is \nexactly the sort of thing we should be doing and that the sequester is \npreventing us from doing, making wise, timely, and needed investments \nin improving our infrastructure.\n  Another critical foundation for growth, as we saw, is a skilled and \nadaptable workforce. We can be the world's manufacturing leader again \nbut not without investing in workforce skills and in workforce \ntraining. There are many programs that can help make this possible. One \nI like to point to is the Federal, State, and local partnership called \nthe Manufacturing Extension Partnership that helps make it possible for \nuniversity-based researchers to partner with local manufacturers to \ndeliver skills training that keeps them at the cutting edge, that makes \nthem more productive.\n  In today's modern manufacturing workplace, there are fewer people, \nbut they are more productive because of their skills. Back in August I \nvisited a new facility, the ILC Grayling plastics manufacturing plant \nin Seaford, DE, which is a great example of what it will take for \nAmerica's manufacturing resurgence to continue and grow. This plant has \nalready brought more than 100 jobs to Sussex, DE. These are not the \nmanufacturing jobs of the past. The men and women working on this\n\n[[Page S7991]]\n\nline need to be able to collaborate and communicate, to do advanced \nmath and adequate quality control work and oversee high-tech machinery \nand have an intimate understanding of the products they are working \nwith. In the end, this company looks forward to growing, to probably \ndoubling the number of jobs in this facility in Sussex County. To me, \nin an even more exciting development, these are jobs that had left the \nUnited States to go south to a lower wage country and that have been \nbrought back, brought back from Juarez, Mexico, to Seaford, DE, where \nthere are now Delawareans employed in this newly expanded manufacturing \nfacility.\n  Let me conclude by simply saying that here in Congress we have the \nopportunity, if we work together across the aisle, to find a pathway \ntoward making these investments in the skills of our workforce, in the \ninfrastructure of our country, that will help grow our economy and help \ncreate good manufacturing jobs today and tomorrow.\n  One of the core challenges we face in the budget conference committee \nis to find a path forward that will respond to the call that I hear up \nand down the State of Delaware, and I presume my colleagues hear from \ntheir home States, that we should make principled compromises that \nallow us to invest again, to replace the sequester with a more \nresponsible and balanced package of revenue and cuts that allow us to \nreturn to investing in the skills and infrastructure necessary to grow \nour economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, it has now been more than 6 weeks since \nthe Obama administration launched its health insurance marketplace. \nThis afternoon, the Obama administration finally confirmed how few \npeople have been able to select insurance through the exchange. \nAccording to the White House, only 106,185 people have selected \ncoverage since October 1. This doesn't mean people actually bought \ntheir coverage, it just means they selected a plan.\n  For most of these, it was through the State-based exchanges. People \nmay be wondering how the Washington-run exchange did. Only 26,794 \npeople selected a plan through healthcare.gov. It is safe to say, if \nthis were a commercial Web site, the plug would have been pulled by \nnow. They came, they saw, they did not buy it.\n  Low expectations met with even lower reality. The numbers paint a \nbleak picture of the confidence the American people have in the health \ncare law and the faulty Web site created to sell it. The \nadministration's goal was for a half million people, 500,000 Americans, \nto sign up in the month of October, the month of October alone. \nInstead, we now know that only a little over 100,000 people have \nactually signed up.\n  The reason the numbers are so low and so disappointing is that the \nWeb site is totally broken and the American people are discovering that \nthe coverage offered on the exchange often costs them more than they \ncan afford, and more than they were previously paying. So far, the \nObamaCare exchanges have only succeeded at crashing people's computers \nor lightening their wallets.\n  To make matters worse, for every one person who has selected an \nObamaCare plan--either from the State or Federal exchanges--40 people \nhave received cancellation notices. This is not what the President \nrepeatedly promised and it is not what the American people deserve.\n  Enough is enough. It is time to give Americans what they wanted all \nalong: access to quality, affordable health care. It is time to stop \nthis train wreck and ease the damage being done by this terrible law.\n  To help make that happen, Senator Graham and I will soon introduce a \nbill that lets States opt out of some of the health care law's most \nburdensome provisions. Under the State Health Care Choice Act, States \ncould opt out of the individual mandate that requires people to buy \ngovernment-approved health insurance or face a tax penalty. They could \nopt out of the employer mandate that will force businesses to provide \ngovernment-approved health insurance or pay penalties.\n  Under our bill States could also opt out from the health care law's \nbenefits mandates. These are the requirements that health insurance \nplans provide numerous expensive services that many people may not \nwant, may not need, will never use, cannot afford, and do not want to \npay for. The Obama administration has already issued hundreds of \nwaivers to businesses and it has delayed the employer mandate by a \nyear. States should have the same opportunity to give relief to their \ncitizens.\n  We know the numbers coming out of Wyoming. In Wyoming we see over \n3,000 people have received cancellation notices. Yet only 85 people \nhave been able to select a plan. I was at the Target store in Casper \nthis Saturday. A former patient came up to me, somebody I had operated \non. He told me he had received a cancellation notice. He is a small \nbusinessman, works hard for himself and for his family, and the \ninsurance he had worked for him. It was something he could afford. What \nhe told me is he will now have to pay a higher premium and also more \nout-of-pocket costs in terms of a higher copay and higher deductibles. \nFrankly, he is not sure what he is going to do.\n  The people I talk to tell me about all of the mandates, the higher \ncosts, the bad side effects of the President's health care law, and \nthey tell me this is not what they wanted in health care reform.\n  I got a letter from one woman from Newcastle, WY. She told me she is \nlosing her health insurance plan also. The reason she is losing it is \nit does not meet the President's requirements that she have maternity \ncoverage. As she points out, she doesn't need maternity care, she said, \nbecause she has had a hysterectomy and she doesn't like Washington \ntelling her that she has to pay twice as much to get a plan that covers \nit--something she doesn't want, will never use, doesn't need, cannot \nafford.\n  When it comes to health care and health care coverage, one size does \nnot fit all. States should be free to help the citizens of those States \nget the care they need from the doctor they choose at lower costs. A \nlot of people in this country do not want all these new mandates, all \nthe burdens and the higher costs. All they actually wanted was \nPresident Obama to keep the promises, to allow them to have what the \nPresident promised them: that they could keep the insurance and the \ndoctor they already had. After all, that is what the President said.\n  We have millions of people getting letters from their insurance \ncompany canceling their insurance plans. As of today I know that number \nis over 4.2 million--42 people canceled for every 1 that actually got \ninsurance through the exchange. One of the reasons for all of the \ninsurance plans being canceled, in spite of what the President told the \nAmerican people repeatedly, is something called the grandfather \nregulation that the Obama administration actually wrote. The \nPresident's own people wrote the regulation so that people cannot keep \nthe insurance they want, in spite of the President's repeated promises. \nThis was a rule the Obama administration wrote to force more people off \nthe insurance plans they had before the law was passed, and force them \ninto new Washington-approved plans.\n  Three years ago Republicans saw that this regulation was going to \nlead directly to the millions of cancellation letters that have now \ngone out across the country. My colleague from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, \ntook the lead and he took to the Senate floor to try to stop this \ndestructive rule from the Obama administration. He introduced a bill \nthat would immediately overturn the administration's restrictive \nregulations about people keeping their plans. Senator Enzi pointed out \nback then, 3 years ago, that the administration's rule would have \ncaused millions of people to lose the insurance they had and that they \nliked. He was right, and the Washington Democrats, here on the floor of \nthe Senate, did not seem to care. Every Democratic Member of this body, \nevery Democrat in the Senate, voted to make sure that the restrictive \nregulations stayed on the books. Because of that vote, now we have over \n4 million Americans looking for new insurance plans that satisfy Obama \nadministration mandates, but they have lost their insurance in spite of \nthe President's repeated promises that if\n\n[[Page S7992]]\n\nthey like what they have, they could keep it.\n  Many of them--such as my friend and former patient whom I ran into \nthis past weekend in Casper--are learning that their copays and their \ndeductibles will be much higher than the plans they have lost. Once \nthey get those plans, many of them are going to find out that their \ncosts have increased--but not just that; their choice of doctors has \nshrunk as well. They may not be able to go to their family doctor \nbecause he or she will not be covered by their new plan anymore.\n  Last week President Obama finally admitted he and his administration \nwere not, as he said, ``as clear as we needed to be.''\n  Not as clear as he needed to be? That is what the President regrets, \nthat he was not as clear as he needed to be? For the millions of people \nwho are losing their doctors, they don't want an apology; they don't \nwant a new government handout. What they want is what they had before \nthis law came into effect. They want President Obama to live up to his \npromise and to allow them to keep the coverage they had and they liked \nand that worked for them. Even former President Bill Clinton has called \nfor a change. Remember, the Obama administration has called President \nClinton the so-called ``Secretary of Explaining Stuff.'' They had him \ntraveling the country, trying to convince people that their health care \nlaw was going to work out well for everybody. Now it looks as though he \nis trying to explain to President Obama how badly the President's own \nhealth care law has hurt Americans who are losing access to their \ninsurance plans and to their doctors.\n  Bill Clinton said it just the other day. He said:\n\n     . . . even if it takes a change to the law, the president \n     should honor the commitment the federal government made to \n     those people and let them keep what they got.\n\n  Well, that is exactly right. Not only should President Obama take \nsteps to keep his promise to the American people, he should support \nRepublicans who want to help all Americans who are being harmed by the \nPresident and the Democrats' terrible health care law. Today's \nenrollment numbers show what a disaster that law has been, and the \nPresident should support the Health Care Choice Act so that States can \nserve their citizens and opt-out of this terrible law.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Network For Manufacturing Innovation\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, earlier this afternoon, I appeared with \nSenator Blunt, my Republican friend from Missouri, in front of Senator \nRockefeller's Commerce Committee to talk about our bipartisan \nlegislation with manufacturing hubs. It would promote new technologies \nto make our country a leader in advanced manufacturing.\n  Let me illustrate by saying this: Along the Ohio Turnpike--from \nToledo, to Lorain, to Cleveland, to Akron, to Youngstown--much of the \nauto industry grew, from glass that would go for windshields in Toledo, \nto steel in Lorain and Cleveland for the fenders and the hoods and much \nof the car, to rubber in Akron for tires--the world's leading tire \nmanufacturer--to assembly in Youngstown, where today the Chevy Cruze is \nmade. If you are on the Ohio Turnpike, you will see this huge plant \nwith the big letters ``CHEVY CRUZE.'' If you have not been at an auto \nplant or you are not from Ohio and you may not have seen one, the \nexpansiveness of this plant is pretty remarkable. Autos were assembled \nall along this turnpike.\n  But the reason this matters--in addition to why it matters in the \nPresiding Officer's State of Connecticut and other places--is not just \nthat the auto industry, the supply chain, creates jobs, but what \nhappens when an industry sort of locates with a critical mass in a \ncommunity.\n  Because Toledo, OH, with the auto industry, had huge glass \nmanufacturing, the University of Toledo had scientists who worked in \nmaterial science and in glass manufacturing. Today, as a result, while \nwe do not make quite as much glass in Toledo as we did for autos, \nToledo is one of the top two or three largest centers for solar energy \nmanufacturing.\n  Go to Akron, which used to be the center of the world for tire \nmanufacturing. There is not so much of that now, although Goodyear's \ncorporate headquarters is still there and there is a lot of research. \nBut now, again, in partnership with the University of Akron, the \nscientists who were processing and researching and innovating in rubber \nand tires--now, for polymer development and manufacturing, Akron is one \nof the leaders in the country and in the world.\n  The lesson we learned is what Senator Blunt and I were talking about. \nWe know in Ohio and Missouri manufacturing is a ticket to the middle \nclass. We also know that for too long Washington made choices which \nbiased finance over manufacturing, that left manufacturing behind--bad \ntrade deals, failure to enforce trade laws, taxes that did not work for \nmanufacturing, and a kind of backing off of a focus on innovation and \ntechnology.\n  So we have seen communities such as Lordstown and Cleveland and \nDayton live with the consequences. Between 2000 and 2010, 60,000 plants \nclosed in this country and 5 million manufacturing jobs were lost.\n  Since the auto rescue and the more aggressive trade enforcement from \nPresident Obama--while I do not agree with some of his trade policies, \nhe has been more aggressive on trade enforcement, through the Commerce \nDepartment and through the International Trade Commission, than any of \nhis predecessors in either party.\n  So since 2010, we have seen a beginning of growth coming back in \nmanufacturing--not nearly making up anything close to the 5 million \njobs lost or the 60,000 plants closed. But the importance of \nmanufacturing--not just because it is in my State, where my State is \nNo. 3 in the country in production, in manufacturing; and only Texas, \nwith twice our population, and California, with three times our \npopulation, make more than we do--but the importance of manufacturing \nis the multiplier effect. More than any other industry in our country, \nin manufacturing, for every $1 spent in manufacturing, another $1.48 is \nadded to the economy. We know what that means in the auto supply chain \nor in the wind turbine supply chain or in the chemical supply chain or \nanything we manufacture in this country. But what is holding us back is \nthis--we never consciously follow this--but this sort of ``innovate \nhere, make it there'' syndrome. Yes, we still have the best scientists, \nthe best engineers, the best researchers, the best universities. \nWhether it is storrs at the University of Connecticut or in Cleveland \nat Case Western or in Dayton or in Cincinnati, we have the best \nuniversities, the best researchers, but too often we do the innovation, \nwe do the discovery, we do the experimentation that leads to products, \nand then we offshore and make the products there.\n  Let me give you an example about why that does not work and what does \nwork. There is a small community in Ohio: Minster, OH. It is not far \nfrom Wapakoneta, Neil Armstrong's hometown--the first man who walked on \nthe moon--and just north of Dayton. It is in Auglaize County, where I \nvisited some time ago. It has the largest yogurt manufacturer in North \nAmerica. When I went in that plant, they had just made it more \nefficient. In the past, their supplier had delivered little plastic \ncups to this yogurt manufacturer. In the plant they had these big \nsilver vats of fermented milk with yogurt, and they would squirt this \nyogurt into these plastic cups and seal it and package it.\n\n  A young industrial engineer and a couple of people who had worked on \nthe line for a decade or so said: We can do this better. Instead of \nbringing the plastic cups in from a supplier, they did something simple \nfor an engineer--not so simple for me. They took plastic rolls, and \nthey fed a plastic sheet into a machine--the whole assembly line was \nmaybe 80 feet long--and the plastic\n\n[[Page S7993]]\n\nwould be heated and then extruded and then cooled slowly, and the \nyogurt would be squirted into the plastic cup and sealed and sent.\n  Now, the innovation took place on the shop floor. That is what \nhappens. When you develop a product, wherever you manufacture it, the \ninnovation, the product innovation and the process innovation--the \nprocess innovation meaning how you make it, the process of making it, \nas they did Dannon yogurt in the packaging and the actual improvement \nof the product--it takes place on the shop floor. That is why this is \nso important.\n  This legislation, the Revitalize American Manufacturing and \nInnovation Act of 2013, creates a Network for Manufacturing Innovation \nand would position the U.S. as the world's leader in advanced \nmanufacturing.\n  We have already done something like this in Youngstown, OH, mentioned \nby the President in his State of the Union message, the first ever \nNational Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute. It is called \nAmerica Makes. It is in conjunction with the University of Missouri and \nin conjunction with businesses and universities--Eastern Gateway and \nYoungstown State in the Mahoning Valley and the University of \nPittsburgh. It is sort of this tech belt along there. They do something \ncalled 3-D printing, which is kind of hard to conceptualize, until you \nsee it. But it really is something to look for in the future.\n  We know how to produce in this country. We have seen, with some \nFederal funding matched by $40 million in private funds, it is making \nYoungstown a world leader in 3-D printing manufacturing technology \nalready.\n  We need to build on this momentum. That is why our legislation is so \nimportant. It is supported by manufacturing associations, semiconductor \ngroups. We have seen other countries begin to sort of mimic it and \nparrot it and imitate it. We know we have something here that will help \nAmerica lead the world.\n  In concluding, before yielding to the Senator from Oregon, think of \nthis in terms of a teaching hospital, where you have a great teaching \nhospital at the University of Cincinnati or Ohio State or Case Western \nin Cleveland or the University of Toledo. At these teaching hospitals--\nwhere research and development and innovation are happening with great \nscientists and great doctors and great researchers--often what they \nproduce, what they come up with is commercialized locally, and you \nbuild a critical mass in that field. In some kind of scientific medical \nfield you build that expertise in that region. That is what we want to \ndo with these manufacturing hubs, like NMI in Youngstown, where in \nYoungstown we will see all kinds of job creation that will make \nYoungstown the vital city that it has been in much of its history and \nwe want to see it become in the future.\n  It is good for our country. It is good for manufacturing. It is good \nfor families who earn their living from manufacturing. And it will be \nparticularly good for our communities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Nominations\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise to address an issue that should be \nof concern to all Americans; that is, the advice and consent function \nof the Senate regarding nominations. This is the critical check \nenvisioned by our Founders in which the President has the power to \nnominate for the executive branch positions and for judicial nominees, \nand the Senate is held responsible to provide a check to make sure \nthere are not outrageous nominees that are placed in positions.\n  That is the advice and consent function which throughout our history \nhas basically been a simple majority function with very rare \nexceptions. This issue comes up at this moment because 2 weeks ago the \nminority of this body in the Senate would not allow there to be a vote \non whether to confirm Mel Watt. They did that by preventing there being \nenough votes to close debate.\n  So that blockade was basically put in place without respecting, if \nyou will, the fact that Mel Watt is highly qualified for his position \nat the Federal Housing Finance Agency, a position he would hold, and \ngiving the entire Senate the ability to weigh in about whether they \nagreed with that judgment, the judgment of the President that Mel Watt \nwas well qualified.\n  In the same week, this body also blocked an up-or-down vote on \nPatricia Millett, who was a nominee for the DC Circuit Court. On this \noccasion, it was not because folks said she was not qualified. They \nsaid, instead: We do not want to put any more of President Obama's \nnominees onto the DC Circuit Court because we want it to be dominated \nby the judges who were confirmed when President Bush was President.\n  Then, just yesterday, this pattern of blockading up-and-down votes on \nnominees continued with the minority filibustering, blocking the \nclosing of debate on Cornelia Pillard--again, a highly qualified \nindividual. An argument was not made that there was some exceptional \ncircumstance in her background that left her unprepared for this \nposition. The argument was simply made: We do not want to let the \nPresident put any judges on this DC Circuit Court.\n  That is of extreme concern. I must say that it has caused folks who \nhave been scholars in this area to look at it. Norm Ornstein of the \nAmerican Enterprise Institute basically said: It is ridiculous for the \nminority to block up-and-down votes, not on the basis that there is \nsomething wrong with her qualifications, but just they want to take \naway the President's ability and constitutional responsibility to \nnominate individuals to fill vacancies.\n  So this obstruction, exercised over the last almost 5 years now, has \ndone significant damage to the court. It has done significant damage to \nthe executive branch. It prevents qualified nominees to get a vote on \nthis floor so that they can--if they receive a simple majority vote of \nsupport--work on behalf of the American people either in their \nexecutive branch capacity or addressing the huge backlog in our \njudicial system.\n  The Senate has the advice and consent role which is a treasured \nresponsibility. It is a weighty responsibility. I think everyone in \nthis body--I think all 100 Senators--could agree that under advice and \nconsent the Senate must exercise a significant check on the quality of \nPresidential nominees, whether for the courts or for the executive \nbranch.\n  The Senate should vet nominees. The committees that are related to a \nparticular position should explore their background, they should hold a \nhearing, they should ask tough questions, they should debate the \nnominees, and then once recommended on the floor of the Senate, we \nshould continue that vetting and debating process. Then, having shared \nour insights on their background, we need to vote to confirm or reject.\n  It should be on very rare exceptions, when there are extraordinary \ncircumstances that make someone unworthy that they should be blocked \nfrom having a final vote. Advice and consent must not become ``block \nand destroy.'' But advice and consent has become block and destroy. The \nSenate nomination process is broken.\n  A minority of one branch of government, the Senate, should not be \nable to systematically undermine the other two branches of government. \nYet that is what we see today. President Obama's district court \nnominees have waited, on average, more than twice as long as President \nGeorge Bush's nominees to be confirmed by the Senate after being \nreported out of committee.\n  So we have the challenge of getting up-or-down votes. We also have \nbasically a process of dragging feet in order to make it more difficult \nto actually get to the votes on these individuals in the first place. \nFor the circuit courts, that comparison is even worse. President \nObama's nominees have waited 3\\1/2\\ times longer than the nominees of \nhis predecessor--3\\1/2\\ times longer.\n  The Congressional Research Service notes that of the last five \nPresidents, President Obama is the only one to have his district and \ncircuit court nominees wait, on average, more than 6 months for \nconfirmation. So those delays, in combination with ultimately denying \nthe possibility to hold an up-or-down vote--to hold a final vote on \nwhether to confirm or not confirm--\n\n[[Page S7994]]\n\nthey constitute a systematic undermining of the function of the other \ntwo branches of government.\n  Now, this was not envisioned in any possible way by the creators of \nour Constitution. They argued there should be three coequal branches. \nBut this outcome, in which the Senate minority seeks to undermine an \nexecutive branch nominee, is inconsistent with the constitutional \ndesign of coequal branches. They are not coequal if one branch can \nsystematically undermine another.\n  In regard to the courts, in an outcome in which the Senate minority \nis seeking to ideologically pack the courts by having insisted on up-\nor-down votes for President Bush's nominees and then blocking up-and-\ndown votes on President Obama's nominees, it politicizes our judicial \nsystem. It undermines the integrity of our court system.\n  The Senate has confronted this abuse of advice and consent three \ntimes in recent history. In 2005, the Democratic minority was blocking \nup-and-down votes on a series of President Bush's nominees. They were \ndoing the same thing that we see today. A gang of 14 gathered to debate \nthis, because essentially the Republican majority said: If you do not \nquit blocking up-or-down votes on the President's nominees, we are \ngoing to change the rules and make it a simple majority. Out of the \ngang of 14 came a deal. The deal was that Democrats would, except under \nexceptional circumstances, not block the nominee. The counterpoint \nbeing that the Republicans would not change the rules. So they got what \nthey wanted, which was up-and-down votes without a rule change.\n\n  That pledge the Democrats made was honored when subsequent nominees \ngot their up-or-down votes. Now, in January of this year the Democrats, \nin the reversal of positions, insisted that the Republican minority \nquit blocking up-or-down votes of President Obama's nominees--kind of a \ndeja vu moment, only the two parties were reversed.\n  Out of that conversation, out of that dialogue in January, came a \npromise from the Republican minority leader of this body. He promised a \nreturn to the norms and traditions of the Senate regarding nominations. \nWhat are those norms and traditions? Those norms and traditions are \nsimple up-or-down votes with rare exception.\n  But that promise was barely made and within weeks it was broken, when \nwe saw the first ever filibuster of a Defense Secretary nominee. It \njust so happened, ironically, that the Republican filibuster--the first \ntime in history of a Defense nominee--was against one of their former \ncolleagues, our Republican colleague Chuck Hagel. So the January \npromise was broken. This led to increasing tensions until July of this \nyear when Democratic and Republican Members met in the Old Senate \nChamber to privately share their concerns. A new deal was hammered out, \nwhich is, essentially that executive nominees would get up-or-down \nvotes. That happened for a significant list of nominees.\n  There was an up-or-down vote on Richard Cordray to be the head of the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau; Gina McCarthy to lead the EPA; \nnominees to fill the National Labor Relations Board; nominees to head \nAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; a nominee to lead the Ex-Im Bank; and, \nfollowing shortly thereafter, a nominee to be the U.S. Ambassador to \nthe United Nations, Samantha Powers.\n  So that July deal held through a list of nominees until 2 weeks ago. \nTwo weeks ago this body blocked an up-or-down vote on Mel Watt. So we \nare right back where we were before, right back where we were, the \npromise made in January shattered, the promise made in July shattered, \nand the ability of this body to do its advice and consent \nresponsibility shattered.\n  This should be deeply troubling to all. We must restore the ability \nof the Senate to perform its responsibilities under the Constitution to \nadvise and consent. The Senate with simple up-or-down votes will be a \ncheck on bad nominations from the President. I have voted against at \nleast one of the President's nominees. I was prepared to vote against \nanother here just a few weeks ago. The President withdrew that nominee \nso that vote was not necessary. But that was related to a judgment of \nthe qualifications of the individuals and whether they were a good fit \nfor a particular position. It was not about trying to systematically \nundermine the executive branch and keep them from operating.\n  That is essentially why we have up-or-down votes; it is a check on \nunqualified individuals or a poor fit for a particular position. So in \nthis area, both in the Senate's failure to do its job vis-a-vis \njudicial nominees and to do its job vis-a-vis executive nominees, we \nhave created unequal branches of government. It is time to fix the \nbroken Senate in regard to nominations. It is time to restore the \ntraditional role of the Senate in evaluating nominations so that with \nnominees who are confirmed, they can go to work in the courts, can go \nto work in the executive branch to do the work that the citizens of the \nUnited States of America expect them to do on behalf of our Nation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 15 minutes as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Typhoon Yolanda\n\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Five days ago Typhoon Yolanda devastated the central \nPhilippines. As a category 5 supertyphoon, this was reportedly the \nstrongest storm ever to make landfall anywhere in recorded history, \nsweeping away almost everything in its path.\n  Nearly 10 million people were impacted by this supertyphoon and tens \nof thousands of homes were destroyed. Eighty to ninety percent of the \nhomes in city of Ormoc, the second largest city in the Leyte Province, \nare gone. The stories of loss are shocking and heartbreaking.\n  We do not yet know the full extent of the devastation this typhoon \nhas brought to the Philippines. Local authorities estimate as many as \n10,000 people may be dead in the Leyte Province alone, one of the \nhardest hit regions.\n  The State Department has said roughly 3,000 Americans were impacted \nwhen the storm hit. Our Embassy in Manila is coordinating with U.S. \nagencies to locate these Americans and bring them home.\n  The United States and the Philippines share a special bond, rooted in \nstrong cultural and historical ties between our two countries. In \nHawaii, where more than 197,000 Filipinos have made their home, we know \nthis bond well.\n  Our Filipino community has been a part of the islands for more than \n100 years, and many at home maintain close relationships with family \nand friends in the Philippines. My deepest condolences go to those who \nhave lost family and friends in this tragedy.\n  Although the storm is over, our work has just begun. Millions of \nsurvivors are without clean drinking water, food, shelter or power. \nRescue workers are attempting to reach isolated coastal communities, \nbut debris and downed power lines are blocking road access.\n  The U.S. Government is helping the Philippines to recover. We have \nprovided $20 million in humanitarian aid and deployed a Disaster \nAssistance Response Team to support the Philippine Government. These \nexperts will help to assess the extent of the damage and determine what \nresources remain to be added.\n  The USAID Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance has shipped \nrelief supplies, including shelter materials and hygienic supplies, to \nhelp around 10,000 families. We are partnering with the U.N. World Food \nProgram to provide $10 million for emergency food assistance because \nclose to 2.5 million people will need food assistance over the next 6 \nmonths.\n  This aid will help airlift 55 metric tons in emergency food to feed \nmore than 20,000 children and 15,000 adults, providing immediate relief \nfor the next 4 to 5 days. It will bring more than 1,000 metric tons of \nrice to feed 60,000 people for 1 month.\n\n[[Page S7995]]\n\n  U.S. marines are on the ground. Our military is helping to airlift \nrelief supplies, conduct aerial damage assessments, and coordinate \nsearch and rescue operations.\n  U.S. Pacific Command has forces in Manila to help deliver food and \nwater to the impacted areas. The George Washington Carrier Strike Group \nand its 5,000 sailors are expected in the area soon to provide \nhumanitarian assistance and disaster relief.\n  For those still searching for displaced or missing loved ones, I urge \nyou to contact the Philippine Red Cross or the National Disaster Risk \nReduction and Management Council operations center.\n  Google has also launched the Person Finder: Typhoon Yolanda. \nAmericans can also visit CNN's iReport Web site to upload photos and \ninformation about people you may be looking for.\n  The challenge for the Filipino people is great, but the Philippines \nis a resilient nation and a true American ally. They need our help. \nPlease donate.\n  I am proud of our local organizations in Hawaii collecting donations \nto help survivors and the families of victims. The Philippine consulate \nin Honolulu, Filipino Chamber of Commerce, Filipino Community Center, \nCongress of Visayan Organizations, and Kokua Philippines have all \nstepped up in this time of tremendous need. A full list of \norganizations is available on my Web site schatz.senate.gov. One may \nalso text AID to 80108 to give a $10 donation to the mGive Philippines \nTyphoon Disaster Relief Fund. Text AID to 80108 if you would like to \ngive $10 to the relief efforts.\n  I wish to especially recognize and thank all of the women and men of \nthe U.S. Embassy in Manila, USAID mission in Manila, the State \nDepartment, USAID in the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Pacific \nCommand for their great efforts in coordinating our ongoing response.\n  Today I introduced a resolution expressing the support of the Senate \nfor the victims of the typhoon, along with several of my colleagues. I \nthank Senators Menendez, Durbin, Cardin, Rubio, Hirono, Tom Udall, \nBoxer, and Begich for cosponsoring this resolution.\n  As the Philippines begins the recovery from this tragedy, I ask that \nwe all pledge together to work with them. When they rebuild their \ncommunities, rest assured they will emerge stronger than ever.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Before I make my comments regarding manufacturing and job \ncreation in America and in Alaska, I would like to say I know my friend \nfrom Hawaii was here earlier, Senator Schatz, talking about the \nimportant resolution that has been submitted that I was honored to be \nable to cosponsor regarding the typhoon in the Philippines.\n  Alaska has over 20,000 Filipinos living in our State--an incredible \ngroup of individuals, people I have known in the business world, as \nindividuals, and family members. The devastation is unbelievable as you \nlook at the photos and see the devastation of the typhoon and the \nimpact it has had on families there. Even though it is thousands of \nmiles away, I can tell you, in Alaska, we feel it, we see it. Our \nFilipino friends there have many relatives on the islands, and the \nimpact is just unbelievable.\n  I was in Alaska this weekend and met with members of the leadership \nof the Filipino community, as well as members from the Red Cross and \nothers to see what we can do from an Alaskan perspective, because \nAlaska knows what disasters are like. From earthquakes to floods, we \nseem to have them quite often. We know what type of impact these events \nhave on families, so I was very happy to support the resolution my \nfriend from Hawaii submitted, but also want to recognize the 20,000 \nFilipino community members in Alaska who are suffering and thinking \nabout their families and friends overseas.\n  We want to do everything we can. I know our country is there and \nready and moving a lot of resources to assist. So I wanted to put that \non the record and give my condolences to families who have lost loved \nones, but also to Alaskans who are grieving for family and friends who \nmay have been lost in the typhoon. I know personally I have done my own \ncontributions, whatever I can to assist in moving operations forward \nand bringing resources to the islands.\n\n\n                              Job Creation\n\n  I also came today to talk on the floor about the need for additional \njob creation. Already in the first 10 months of this year we have \ncreated 1.9 million new jobs--higher than last year at this same time--\nwhich is a good start, but more needs to be done. Senators Coons and \nDurbin and others have been discussing our Manufacturing Jobs in \nAmerica initiative. In particular, we are talking about the skills \nnecessary to succeed in today's economy--the skills Americans need to \nland and to keep good manufacturing jobs.\n  There used to be a time when a bright kid in this country could work \nhard in school, graduate with a high school diploma, and go work in a \nfactory. He or she could make a decent living, a living wage, enough to \nraise a family and own a home and think about the future of their kids. \nThose days are long gone. Unfortunately, today's factories and plants \ndon't look like they used to. The level of technical expertise needed \nto operate some new machinery is pretty high. That is why I have made \ncareer and technical education a priority. We need to have options for \nthe bright kids after high school or that mid-career worker looking to \nshift gears.\n  My own State of Alaska is already a leader in career technical \neducation--CTE. As these programs continue to innovate and change \nacross the country, Alaska is in the forefront. I see it when I travel \naround the State. From career pathways in high schools to creative \nprograms through the University of Alaska system, my State is a leader \nin career technical education.\n  To address these issues, I have introduced a bill entitled Investing \nin Innovation, otherwise called i3, which takes a look at what is \nhappening in our local schools and puts resources into what is working. \nIt supports and expands programs that are helping to improve student \nachievement. This bill requires 25 percent of the money to go to local \nrural communities. There are so many programs that sometimes forget our \nsmall and rural communities, not only in Alaska but throughout this \ncountry.\n  I have also introduced the Career Readiness package of legislation \nfocused on career and technical education. One of the bills in this \npackage is the Counseling for Career Choice Act. This bill will help \nfund stakeholders in developing comprehensive career counseling models \nthat emphasize guiding students to productive careers.\n  Our counselors are in unique position to help expose and guide our \nstudents to postsecondary opportunities--to help prepare them for high-\ndemand careers. This bill makes sure our school counselors have the \nresources they need to emphasize all types of postsecondary education, \nnot just the traditional 4-year degree. It focuses on opportunities \nsuch as apprenticeships, certificate programs, associate degrees, and, \nof course, 4-year degrees. It makes sure that business, economic \ndevelopment, and industry leaders are at the table providing \ninformation on available postsecondary training opportunities and \ncareer trends--basically making sure that we match what we are teaching \nto not only what is available in the market today but in the future. \nOur students need the best teachers and the best facilities.\n  I also have legislation that focuses on career technical education, \nCTE, professional development for teachers and principals.\n  Another career readiness bill provides funding to make sure we are \nmodernizing our CTE facilities. We know students who are involved in \ncareer and technical education programs are engaged in their future \ncareers. We have to keep making sure what our students learn is \nrelevant to the real\n\n[[Page S7996]]\n\nworld. We must align our educational system with the in-demand careers \nto fill those jobs in that pipeline, and we must keep our students \nengaged.\n\n  If we are going to compete in the 21st century as we did in the 20th \ncentury, we need to make sure our students have the very best skills--\nskills that are tailored to the 21st century economy. Career and \ntechnical education is the best approach, in my opinion, to give \nstudents those skills.\n  I am a big fan of the Manufacturing Jobs for America initiative led \nby Senator Coons and several of my colleagues. America's manufacturing \nsector has enormous potential to create new jobs and to speed up our \neconomy and economic recovery. These are good jobs and they spin off \ninto even more jobs.\n  According to the National Association of Manufacturers, every \nmanufacturing job we create adds 1\\1/2\\ jobs to the local economy. So \nlet's move forward, let's pass these bills to help with job training, \ncareer facilities and readiness, and let's do everything we can to get \nour manufacturing sector running full speed ahead.\n  Before I conclude my remarks, let me say that I know there is a lot \nof debate on the floor where we talk about health care, we are talking \nabout a national defense authorization bill, and we are going to talk \nabout a compounding bill, but at the end of the day, what Americans, \nwhat Alaskans, come to me to talk about on a regular basis--and \ncertainly it was true in the 4\\1/2\\ days I just spent in Alaska--is \nwhat are we doing to create jobs for the future, not only for people \ntoday in the work environment but the kids of the future who will be in \nthe work environment.\n  This legislation, and many other pieces that have been introduced in \nthis package, help lead this economy and continue to move this economy. \nWe have to remind ourselves where we are: This year, this month, we \ncreated over 200,000 jobs. The first month I came here, when I was \nsworn in, the economy was in a tailspin. We had lost over 700,000 jobs. \nSo we have been in the positive trendline for several months here, but \nwe have more to do. And an area that I think is an incredible \nopportunity not only for Alaska but for all across this country is \nimproving our manufacturing sector and ensuring our young people are \nready for the 21st century.\n  Again, I thank my friend Senator Coons for all the work he is doing \nto bring manufacturing to the forefront, as well as all my colleagues \nwho have been coming to the floor to talk about an important piece of \nlegislation to create jobs and improve our economy for the long term.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I extend my thoughts and prayers to the \nentire Inhofe family.\n  Perry Inhofe was an orthopedic surgeon as well as a licensed pilot \nand flight instructor, with a family of his own. Flying is integral to \nthe Inhofe family--I know that from my service with Senator Inhofe on \nthe Armed Services Committee and as cochair with him of the Army \nCaucus, a caucus he created along with Senator Dan Akaka to support the \nmen and women serving in the Army. I know of his intense involvement in \nflying.\n  I hope, certainly, that the memories and the time he had with his son \nwill help sustain and comfort him in the days ahead. Senator Inhofe is \na man of great integrity, with great dedication to his faith, to the \nNation. Again, at this time of loss, I only hope the memory and the \nexample of his son, his son's service and his courage and faith and \nlove will sustain the Inhofe family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/13/senate-section/article/S7996-3", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7996]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF PATRICIA M. WALD\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend President Obama for renominating \nJudge Patricia M. Wald to serve as a member of the Privacy and Civil \nLiberties Oversight Board, ``PCLOB''. The Senate unanimously confirmed \nJudge Wald to this post on August 2, 2012. The President renominated \nJudge Wald to this position in March, and the Judiciary Committee \nfavorably reported the nomination without objection months ago. During \nher tenure on this important oversight board, Judge Wald has served \nwith great professionalism and dedication. And next week, she will \nreceive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor \nthat the President can bestow.\n  For the past several months, we have been engaged in a national \ndebate about the ever-growing need for limits on the government's \nsurveillance powers. In the coming weeks, the House and the Senate will \nconsider bipartisan legislation to rein in those expansive powers in an \neffort to protect Americans' privacy and to increase transparency and \noversight. While I look forward to that debate and consideration of \nthis important legislation, it is urgent that the Privacy and Civil \nLiberties Oversight Board continue to operate at full strength to \nsafeguard our constitutional rights. The PCLOB has held two all day \nhearings on these surveillance matters in recent months, and plans to \nissue an important report to the President and Congress. Judge Wald has \nbeen a key participant in these proceedings. Should the Senate fail to \nconfirm her nomination before we adjourn, however, Judge Wald would be \nforced to step down from the PCLOB at a critical time when the board is \nconducting its work to evaluate the privacy and civil liberties \nimplications of the Nation's surveillance programs.\n  Democrats, Independents, and Republicans alike have supported the \nimportant work of this nonpartisan board. Unfortunately, a secret \nobjection on the Republican side is needlessly delaying Judge Wald's \nconfirmation. I urge the Senate to promptly confirm this well qualified \nnominee, so that the PCLOB can carry out its important \nresponsibilities. If a single Republican Senator has a concern about \nJudge Patricia Wald's impeccable credentials, they should come forward \nwith the reason they are holding up her confirmation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/13/senate-section/article/S7996-4", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7996-S7997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this month, we commemorate Native American \nHeritage Month. It is an important opportunity to recognize the \nexceptional achievements and contributions of those in the Native \nAmerican community. They are an integral part of this country's \nhistory, which has been both proud and painful. It is important to stop \nand reflect on how we as a nation can learn from the past and plan for \nour shared future as fellow Americans.\n  It is fitting that in this month we also celebrate Veterans Day. For \nover 200 years, Native Americans, including American Indians, Alaska \nNatives, and Native Hawaiians, have served honorably and with \ndistinction in the U.S. Armed Forces. Native Americans have served in \nevery conflict since the Revolutionary War and contribute in \ndisproportionately high numbers to our Nation's defense. No group of \nAmericans has a higher per capita service rate in the military than \nNative Americans.\n  One of the most unique and extraordinary contributions was by the \n``Code Talkers'' during both world wars. Using codes based on their \ndistinct languages, these Native American soldiers transmitted orders \nand communications to troops and allies, which were indecipherable to \nour enemies. Later\n\n[[Page S7997]]\n\nthis month, 33 tribes will be recognized with Congressional Gold Medals \nto celebrate this significant contribution during the Second World War. \nThis recognition is both historic and overdue.\n  Throughout the military history of the United States, Native \nAmericans have served bravely and honorably. We are grateful to these \nsoldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen for their tradition of \nunwavering patriotism.\n  As we celebrate Native American contributions to our country, we must \nalso examine the unique struggles faced by these communities and work \ntogether to find solutions. I am proud of the significant steps we took \nearlier this year to confront the long-ignored epidemic of violence \nagainst Native women through reauthorization of the Violence Against \nWomen Act, a bill I authored with Senator Crapo. Nearly three out of \nfive Indian women have been assaulted by their spouses or intimate \npartners. On some reservations, Native American women are murdered at a \nrate more than times the national average. Those statistics are \nchilling. Native women are being brutalized and killed at rates that \nsimply shock the conscience.\n  The Violence Against Women Reauthorization of 2013 addresses this \nproblem directly and provides landmark protections for Native American \nwomen. These include expanding the jurisdiction of tribal courts in \nseveral ways. First, the law clarifies that tribal courts have the \nauthority to issue and enforce tribal protection orders, a tool that is \nnecessary to stop the escalation of violence. Second, and perhaps most \nimportantly, it recognizes the jurisdiction of tribal courts to \nprosecute non-Indians who abuse Native women on tribal lands.\n  More than 50 percent of Native American women are married to non-\nNative American men. Before the Violence Against Women Act was \nreauthorized this year, tribal courts were unable to prosecute these \nmen if they committed acts of domestic abuse. The Federal authorities \nwho had jurisdiction were often hours away from tribal lands and ill-\nequipped to prosecute these crimes. As a result, countless victims were \nleft without protection and offenders were allowed to prey upon women \nwith impunity. As a former prosecutor, I was appalled, and I am proud \nthat we fixed this glaring problem with the enactment of these historic \nchanges.\n  Beyond resolving jurisdictional issues, VAWA improved the grant \nmaking process to Indian tribal coalitions to ensure tribes are better \nable to respond to domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, \nand stalking. It creates new Federal crimes with tougher penalties for \noffenses often committed against Native American women and encourages \ngreater cooperation between the Federal Government and tribal \ngovernments.\n  The success of VAWA, and the inclusion of these historic provisions, \nwas the result of years of careful investigation and creative problem \nsolving. We worked closely with tribal leaders and the National \nCongress of American Indians and in close consultation with the Indian \nAffairs Committee. I would like to thank the former chairman of that \ncommittee, Senator Daniel Akaka, and current chairwoman Maria Cantwell \nfor their cooperation and persistence on these important measures.\n  Another area of law critical to the protection of civil rights for \nNative Americans is the Voting Rights Act. I am working hard with \nmembers from both sides of the aisle to restore the vital protections \nof this landmark law, undermined by the Supreme Court's recent decision \nin Shelby County v. Holder.\n  The Voting Rights Act is the most successful piece of civil rights \nlegislation in this Nation's history. It has worked to protect the \nConstitution's guarantees against racial discrimination in voting for \nnearly five decades. It has helped minorities of all races--including \nNative Americans--overcome major barriers to participation in the \npolitical process. For example, in 2008, in Charles Mix County, SD, the \nDepartment of Justice found evidence of discriminatory intent by the \nofficials of the county, who had attempted to dilute the voting \nstrength of Native Americans. The Voting Rights Act prevented these \ndiscriminatory actions from taking place. It is imperative that we \nreinvigorate and restore these protections.\n  In addition to our legislative efforts, we are also making strides in \nconfirming Native American judges to our Federal courts. President \nObama nominated Diane J. Humetewa, a Native American woman, to serve on \nthe U.S. district court for Arizona on September 19, 2013. Humetewa, a \nmember of the Hopi Tribe, was the U.S. attorney in Arizona between 2007 \nand 2009, a position to which she was nominated by former President \nGeorge W. Bush at the urging of Senator John McCain. If the Senate \nconfirms her nomination, she would become the only active member of a \nNative American tribe to serve in the Federal judiciary and the first \nNative American woman ever to serve on the Federal bench.\n  This month, let us celebrate the Native American contributions that \nmake this Nation better and stronger. And let us renew our commitment \nto work together with leaders of these sovereign nations to address \nongoing challenges to ensure that all who live in this great country \nare afforded the respect, dignity and opportunities they deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/13/senate-section/article/S7997-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, today I wish to ask my colleagues to \njoin me in recognizing Mr. Gary Ostroske, who retired on July 1, 2013, \nas President and CEO of the United Way of Southeast Louisiana. Mr. \nOstroske has been an integral part of the United Way Worldwide system \nfor 40 years and has served as President and CEO of the Southeastern \nregion for the past 25 years.\n  Throughout his tenure at the United Way, Mr. Ostroske implemented \nimportant changes to a wide breadth of programs to improve the lives of \nresidents of Southeast Louisiana. Mr. Ostroske has worked tirelessly to \nprovide citizens with quality healthcare, education, and human services \nand has undoubtedly provided many opportunities for residents of \nSoutheast Louisiana to succeed and improve their lives.\n  As the President and CEO of United Way of Southeast Louisiana, Mr. \nOstroske worked collaboratively with community organizations and \nGreater New Orleans leaders to create innovative ways to deliver \ncritical services to Southeast Louisiana residents. Through these \ncommunity partnerships, Mr. Ostroske strengthened United Way's impact \nand allowed it to play an integral role in crafting a strong economic \nagenda for our region.\n  Mr. Ostroske's unwavering leadership in the wake of Hurricanes \nKatrina and Isaac and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill was truly \nremarkable.

Mr. President, Senator Wyden and I wish to recognize \nHolt International Children's Services during this year's celebration \nof National Adoption Month.\n  On July 27, 2013 we celebrated the 60th anniversary of the end of the \nKorean war. By signing the armistice agreement, the border between the \nKoreas near the 38th Parallel was established. It was in the wake of \nthis armistice that Holt International Children's Services first began \nits compassionate work, and today continues to be a leader in the field \nof adoption and child welfare issues.\n  Harry and Bertha Holt of Eugene, OR were of humble means--Harry a \nlumberjack and a farmer and Bertha a nurse. In 1954, the Holts went to \na small high school auditorium to view a film about Amerasian children \nliving in South Korean orphanages. Moved by the film, their faith and a \nfirm belief that all children deserve permanent, loving homes, the \nHolts began their lifelong mission in 1955 to revolutionize \nintercountry adoption.\n  At the time, there were no laws allowing children to immigrate to one \ncountry from another for the purpose of adoption. Overcoming legal and \ncultural barriers, Mr. and Mrs. Holt sought families for children \norphaned by the Korean war. The Holts persuaded Oregon U.S. Senator \nRichard Neuberger to introduce legislation titled ``The Relief of \nCertain Korean War Orphans.'' The legislation became law on August 11, \n1955, enabling the Holts to adopt eight Korean war orphans: Joseph Han, \nMary Chae, Helen Chan, Paul Kim, Betty Rhee, Robert Chae, Christine Lee \nand Nathanial Chae. With this act of love and the founding of their \nagency--Holt International Children's Services--two farmers from rural \nOregon became pioneers in international adoption.\n  Today, Holt International strives to uphold Harry and Bertha's vision \nof finding loving homes for children regardless of race, religion, \nethnicity or gender. Holt is committed to finding families for \nchildren, not children for families, an important distinction that sets \nthe tone and priorities for Holt. Since the 1955 act, Holt has placed \n49,630 children from 31 countries with families in all 50 States. As \nthe oldest intercountry adoption agency, Holt is the only organization \nthat has more than three generations of adult adoptees.\n  Holt continues to play an active and vital role in establishing \npolicy and practice for intercountry adoption. In 1993, Holt adoptees \nSusan Cox and David Kim were members of the U.S. delegation to the \nHague Convention on Intercountry Adoption, an agreement which sets \ninternational standards for intercountry adoption that protects the \nchild, the birth family and the adoptive family. Later, in 2008, Holt \nwas a leading advocate in ensuring U.S. ratification of the Hague \nConvention treaty. Holt believes that adoption is a life long \nexperience and has been at the forefront of developing post adoption \nservices to ensure that adoptees grow and develop to their fullest \npotential.\n  In addition to these monumental accomplishments, Holt International \nhas become much more than an adoption agency. When considering a \nchild's future, Holt always keeps the child's best interest at the \nforefront of every decision. For some children adoption is the only \noption, but Holt realizes that it is not the first option for children \nwithout families. Holt believes that it is best if children can stay \nwith their birth family. Over the years, Holt has worked to develop and \nmaintain programs overseas to give orphaned, abandoned and vulnerable \nchildren safe and nurturing environments in which to grow and thrive. \nThese overseas programs include initiatives directed at family \npreservation, nutrition support, child and maternal health, income \ngeneration, assisting children with special needs, and shaping and \nestablishing intercountry child welfare systems. Through these \ninitiatives, Holt impacts approximately 30,000 children each year and \nhelps to ensure that children at all stages of need are provided for in \nan effort to avoid the separation of families.\n  In November, as National Adoption Month is celebrated, it is \nappropriate to recognize Holt International Children's Services for its \ndiligent efforts and accomplishments in the field of child-welfare and \nintercountry adoption that have impacted thousands of children in the \nU.S. and around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/13/senate-section/article/S7998-2", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                             CHARACTERplus\n\n Mr. BLUNT.

As a \nformer classroom teacher, I appreciate the work CHARACTERplus does to \nhelp educators instill positive character traits in students--such as \nresponsibility and respect--by teaching, encouraging and living these \nvalues at school.\n  Created by Sanford N. McDonnell in 1985, CHARACTERplus is the largest \ncommunity-wide character education organization in the country. More \nimportantly, because of the efforts of CHARACTERplus, Missouri leads \nthe Nation in character education.\n  Currently more than 75 school districts across several States are \nmembers of CHARACTERplus, which serves more than 330,000 students and \n29,000 teachers at 645 schools to transform school climate.\n  Member districts and schools have unlimited access to professional \ndevelopment, national experts, the most current research on social, \nemotional and character development, skill training modules, survey \ntools to access school climate and opportunities to network with others \nin the field.\n  Each year, the Character Education Partnership, CEP, recognizes \nschools that have demonstrated a commitment to character education by \nnaming them a National School of Character. In 2013, CEP chose 29 \nschools, 9 of which were members of CHARACTERplus, making Missouri the \nnational leader in character education.\n  Those schools include Independence Elementary in the Francis Howell \nSchool District; Jefferson City Academic Center in the Jefferson City \nSchool District; Beasley Elementary, Bierbaum Elementary, Hagemann \nElementary, and Mehlville High School in the Mehlville School District; \nChesterfield Elementary and LaSalle Springs Middle School in the \nRockwood School District; and Discovery Ridge Elementary in the \nWentzville School District.\n  CHARACTERplus also works closely with the Missouri Department of \nSecondary and Elementary Education on several projects and runs the \nState School of Character Awards.\n  I would like to congratulate CHARACTERplus for all of their hard work \nand commend them for helping the State of Missouri be a leader in \ncharacter education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/13/senate-section/article/S7998-3", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7998-S7999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LARRY WILCOX\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota.

The retirement is effective November 14, 2013.\n  Born in Burke, Larry grew up in Winner, SD. After graduating from \nWinner High School in the mid-1960s, Larry joined the South Dakota Army \nNational Guard. He remained in the National Guard for nearly four \ndecades, including 26 years in the Medical Services Corps. A Gulf War \nveteran, Larry rose to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel before retiring \nin 2003.\n  Larry's service to our State continued when he was named \nsuperintendent of South Dakota's only State Veterans Home in May 2004 \nby Maj. Gen. Michael\n\n[[Page S7999]]\n\nGorman. He has provided excellent stewardship of the State Veterans \nHome, including overseeing plans to construct a new facility. On \nNovember 11, 1889, the cornerstone for the first State Home was laid in \nHot Springs. The much-anticipated groundbreaking for a new South Dakota \nVeterans Home was held in late September 2013. Thousands of veterans \nand their families have enjoyed the services of the State Veterans Home \nover these many years. Aging veterans have found solace on the \nbeautiful, aesthetic grounds of the State Veterans Home and have \nbenefited from the dedicated medical care and support services \nprovided.\n  Larry has played a major role in providing consistent and superior \nlevels of care and comfort to veterans at the State Home during his \ntime as superintendent. He has been passionate about providing the \nhighest degree of compassionate care, understanding and service to the \nresidents. Larry is a strong advocate for the Veterans Home, promoting \nthe importance of the Veterans Home to the general public and making \nsure the congressional delegation is aware of any challenges veterans \nmay face.

Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator \nCrapo, I wish to recognize the 100-year anniversary of Northwest \nNazarene University in the city of Nampa in the great State of Idaho.\n  On September 13, 1913, this education institution began as an \nelementary school--the Idaho Holiness School. With a strong and \nunstoppable vision for the future, the founders quickly developed it \ninto a secondary school and then a university. Highly respected in the \ncommunity and, indeed, all across the great State of Idaho and in \nseveral other States in the region, Northwest Nazarene University has \nconferred degrees upon thousands of college graduates since 1917.\n  Dr. David Alexander, who began his association with NNU as a member \nof the faculty and in 2008 became its 12th president, continues to \ncarry out the early vision of growth, excellence and the Great \nCommission. The university offers a world-class, multi-discipline \neducation, which now serves more than 2,000 undergraduate and graduate \nstudents; more than 6,000 continuing education students; and 2,300 high \nschool students through its concurrent credit program. On its 90-acre \ncampus in Nampa, 60 education disciplines are offered as well as 11 \ngraduate-level programs. The university also offers programs of study \nin other Idaho cities including nearby Boise, Twin Falls and Idaho \nFalls, and works in cooperation with education programs in 10 \ncountries.\n  NNU, a nonprofit Christian school, is affiliated with the Church of \nthe Nazarene and is one of the premiere universities in our State. \nThrough education and spiritual development, students become leaders in \nbusiness, public service, education and in faith-based careers. At NNU, \nthey have become students of scholarship, strong in character and \nrobust contributors to their communities.\n  As Governor, Lieutenant Governor and State Senator, I have had a long \nand good working relationship with NNU, which I tremendously value. I \nmark their achievements and continued growth as terrific highlights for \nthe Treasure Valley and the State of Idaho. Their commitment to their \noriginal vision and the foundations of their beliefs as they recognize \nchanging times has made NNU an institution of stability and a vital \nresource for Idahoans.\n  I remember well participating in the dedication of the Thomas Family \nHealth and Science Center, which further moves NNU into the ranks of a \ncompetitive university with state-of-the-art laboratories and \nresearchers. In addition, I am proud to have had their participation on \nthe Nursing Task Force, which I initiated as governor, and which \ncontinues to make a significant impact on reducing the shortage of \nnurses in Idaho and beyond.\n  For 100 years, Northwest Nazarene University has proved itself a \nstrong asset to our community and state. It is a proverbial shining \nlight, making a positive difference on its campus, in nearby \nneighborhoods and across oceans. We are very proud to have this \ninstitution serving our young people and those continually updating \ntheir skills and education. Our country stands stronger because NNU \ngoes the extra mile, perseveres and stays the course.\n  May God bless Northwest Nazarene University with another 100 years of \nbeing a top-rated institution of higher learning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/13/senate-section/article/S7999-2", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/13/senate-section/article/S7999-3", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/13/senate-section/article/S7999-4", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  At 12:19 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hanrahan, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 2747.

A bill to reauthorize the Second Chance Act of 2007; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I join with Senator Portman to \nintroduce the bipartisan Second Chance Reauthorization Act, a bill that \nbuilds on recent successes and takes important new steps to ensure that \npeople coming out of prison have the opportunity to turn their lives \naround, rather than returning to a life of crime. Investing in \ncommunity-based reentry programs prevents crime, reduces prison costs, \nimproves public safety, and saves taxpayer dollars. It is also the \nright thing to do.\n  This important legislation improves Federal reentry policy and funds \ncollaborations between State and local corrections agencies, \nnonprofits, educational institutions, service providers, and families \nto ensure that former offenders have the resources and support they \nneed to become contributing members of the community. Our bill also \nseeks to expand upon the successes of the original Second Chance Act by \ncontinuing, improving, and consolidating its programs, while \nreauthorizing these important grant programs at reduced levels in \nrecognition of current fiscal constraints.\n  In 2008, I joined with Senators Biden, Specter, and Brownback as an \noriginal cosponsor of the Second Chance Act, and helped to shepherd \nthat legislation through the Senate. I was proud when the Senate \nrecognized the value\n\n[[Page S8002]]\n\nof the Second Chance Act and, after a great deal of work and \ncompromise, passed the bill unanimously.\n  The bipartisan spirit of this legislation also continues in the \nHouse, where today Representatives Sensenbrenner and Davis will \nintroduce an identical version of the Senate bill authored by myself \nand Senator Portman. Together, we have been working hard for the past \nseveral months to reach an agreement that is fair, fiscally \nresponsible, and meets the needs of key stakeholders. As a result, we \nhave the support of faith groups, law enforcement, and community groups \nwho provide services to the mentally ill and those struggling with \naddiction. This broad coalition has one thing in common--we all want to \nsee our justice system work better.\n  In the past few decades, Congress and the states have passed new \ncriminal laws creating longer sentences for more and more crimes. As a \nresult, our country currently incarcerates more than two million \npeople, and more than 13 million people spend some time in jail or \nprison each year. This has resulted in severely stretched budgets and \nwe have fewer resources for programs that actually prevent crime in the \nfirst place. We cannot afford to stay on our current path, and I am \nworking on separate legislation to address the exploding costs of our \nFederal prisons. The Second Chance Reauthorization Act helps support \ninnovative reentry programs at the state and local level which have \nbrought down costs and reduced recidivism, and the federal system \nshould replicate these efforts.\n  More than 650,000 ex-offenders are released from prison each year. \nThe experience inmates have in prison, how we prepare them to rejoin \nsociety, and how we integrate them into the broader community when they \nare released are issues that profoundly affect the communities in which \nwe live.\n  The Second Chance Act funds grants for key reentry programs and \nrequires that these programs demonstrate measurable positive results, \nincluding a reduction in recidivism.\n  The Second Chance Act of 2008 authorized research into educational \nmethods used in prisons and jails. Today's reauthorization bill directs \nthe Attorney General to review that research, identify best practices, \nand implement them in our prisons and jails.\n  The bill also makes nonprofit organizations eligible for grants \npromoting family-based substance abuse treatment and training in \ntechnology careers. It gives priority consideration to applicants that \nconduct individualized post-release employment planning, demonstrate \nconnections to employers within the local community, or track and \nmonitor employment outcomes.\n  This legislation also makes improvements to federal reentry policy \nthat have the added benefit of reducing Bureau of Prison costs. It \ncontinues the successful Elderly and Family Reunification for Certain \nNon-Violent Offenders Pilot Program and expands the pool of inmates \neligible to apply for the program.\n  Finally, the Second Chance Reauthorization Act promotes \naccountability by requiring periodic audits of grantees to ensure that \nfederal dollars are spent responsibly. Grantees who have unresolved \naudit problems will not be eligible for funding in future years.\n  As a former prosecutor, I believe strongly in securing tough and \nappropriate prison sentences for people who break our laws. But it is \nalso important that we do everything we can to ensure that when people \nget out of prison, they enter our communities as productive members of \nsociety, so we can start to reverse the dangerous cycle of recidivism \nand violence. The Second Chance Reauthorization Act helps break this \ncycle.\n  I thank Senator Portman, Representative Sensenbrenner, and \nRepresentative Davis for their hard work and cooperation in leading \nthese efforts. We have come together in a truly exceptional way in this \nbipartisan, bicameral effort. I am proud of the work we have done so \nfar and I look forward to joining with Democrats and Republicans to get \nthis bill passed and signed into law.\n  Mr. President, President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1690\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the establishment of clean technology \nconsortia to enhance the economic, environmental, and energy security \nof the United States by promoting domestic development, manufacture, \nand deployment of clean technologies; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Consortia-Led \nEnergy and Advanced Manufacturing Networks Act.\n  For more than a century, America's innovation community has been the \nfoundation of our high-tech economy and generated broad-based growth to \nsupport a strong middle class. While our innovators remain the best in \nthe world, we have seen a disturbing trend in recent years. When it \ncomes to moving innovations out of the lab and into the factory, we are \ngetting beat. Breakthroughs achieved in U.S. research universities and \nlaboratories are all too often being commercialized and manufactured \noverseas. As recent research by the Massachusetts Institute of \nTechnology and others has demonstrated, innovation and production are \nclosely related. When manufacturing facilities move overseas, we lose \nmore than just those manufacturing jobs. We can lose our ability to \ncontinue to innovate in that industry and lose our hold on those jobs \nforever.\n  At the same time, we have some industries in the United States \ndominated by deeply entrenched companies that are resistant to \ninnovation or adaptation of century-old business models. In those \nsectors, we need to look at ways of partnering with our innovators on \nproof-of-concept and demonstration projects so that more breakthroughs \ncan bridge the so-called ``Valley of Death'' between the lab bench and \ncommercialization of a new technology. That will ensure that innovative \nand potentially disruptive technologies can actually reach the market, \nand provide badly needed competition in industries where incumbents may \nbe failing to innovate. This is what my legislation is intended to \naddress.\n  In order to reach their full market potential, scientific \nbreakthroughs must be translated into commercial applications, \ndemonstrated, connected to appropriate markets, and scaled up. The bill \nI am introducing today would fertilize America's innovation ecosystems \nby making available $100 million to 6 or more consortia to support \nthese types of activities and help shepherd innovations through the \ncommercialization process. Consortia could include a mix of research \nuniversities, large and small companies, national laboratories, venture \ncapital, and state and nonprofit entities with expertise in technology \ncommercialization. The bill includes rigorous cost-share requirements \nto ensure that taxpayers are only partnering on the best ideas in which \nthe private sector also has significant capital committed.\n  We have seen the benefits of regional innovation ecosystems in places \nlike Silicon Valley; Boston, Cambridge and the Route 128 Corridor; the \nResearch Triangle in North Carolina; Austin, TX; and elsewhere. The \ngeographic proximity of institutions in these areas improves the flow \nof information between scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs, and it \nfacilitates the sharing of skilled human resources and facilities. Most \ncritically when it comes to commercializing innovations, these regions \nhave demonstrated a unique ability to pull investor capital off the \nsidelines and channel it into new production. We need to bolster these \nexisting ecosystems and help nurture new ones.\n  America's universities and research institutions are truly national \ntreasures. Our venture capitalists and entrepreneurs are the sharpest \nin the world. When we sprinkle the right mix of scientific brain power \nand capitalist drive, we get something uniquely American and extremely \npotent.\n  This legislation will help link inventors with investors, professors \nwith producers, and get technologies out of laboratories and into \nfactories. It provides the type of responsible and forward-looking \npartnership that we need with the private sector right now. This \nlegislation builds on provisions I included in both the Waxman-Markey \nbill and the America COMPETES reauthorization, bills that passed the \nU.S. House of Representatives in 2009 and 2010, respectively.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/13/senate-section/article/S8006-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8006-S8007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 292--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE \n         TYPHOON IN THE PHILIPPINES AND THE SURROUNDING REGION\n\n  Mr. SCHATZ (for himself, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Cardin, Mr. \nRubio, Ms. Hirono, Mr. Udall of New Mexico, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Begich) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.
