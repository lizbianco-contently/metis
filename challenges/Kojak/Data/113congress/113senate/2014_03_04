Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 309, S. \n1086.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin.)

Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the \nRepublican leader, the Senate will be in a period of morning business \nwith Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  There will be no rollcall votes today because of the inclement \nweather we have had the last 3 or 4 days. The next rollcall vote will \nbe tomorrow at 11:45 a.m.\n\n\n                        Benefitting the Wealthy\n\n  Charles and David Koch are shrewd businessmen. Their wealth is nearly \nunparalleled, not only in America but in the world. The brothers \ninherited a small oil company. They inherited this company from their \ndad. They built it into a multinational corporation. It refines oil, \nmakes carpets, manufactures fertilizers and chemicals, makes paper \nproducts, extracts minerals, produces glass, owns a cattle ranch, and \nlots of stuff.\n  Like most shrewd businessmen, the oil baron Koch brothers are very \ngood at protecting and growing their prodigious future and their \nprodigious fortune. There is nothing un-American about that. But what \nis un-American is when shadowy billionaires pour unlimited money into \nour democracy to rig the system, to benefit themselves and the \nwealthiest 1 percent.\n  I believe in an America where economic opportunity is open to all. \nBased on their actions and policies they promote, the Koch brothers \nseem to believe in an America where the system is rigged to benefit the \nvery wealthy. Based on Senate Republicans' ardent defense of the Koch \nbrothers and the fact that they advocate for many of the same policies \nas the Koch brothers, it seems my Republican colleagues also believe in \na system that benefits billionaires at the expense of the middle class.\n  The Koch brothers are willing to invest billions to buy that America. \nThey are investing billions to buy that America. In 2010 the Supreme \nCourt opened the flood gates of corporate money into electoral \npolitics. That was with the Citizens United decision. Since mega donors \nsuch as Charles and David Koch can launder their huge contributions \nusing shadowy shell groups and so-called nonprofits, it is difficult to \ntell exactly how much they have invested so far.\n  Investigative reporting done by some of the most respected news \noutlets in the country has revealed that the Koch brothers funnel money \nthrough a web of investor groups and advocacy organizations that are \nimmune from disclosure rules, such as the Club for Growth, Heritage \nAction, the NRA, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. We may never know \nhow much money the Koch brothers are spending to rig the system, to rig \nthe system for themselves.\n  But we do know their investments have paid off already. In November \n2010, the petroleum industry walked right through the door the Supreme \nCourt had opened and spent hundreds of millions of dollars to elect a \nRepublican majority to the House of Representatives. That Republican \nmajority has effectively shut down any hope of passing legislation to \nlimit the pollution that has caused climate change.\n  That Republican majority is, in fact, working to gut the most \nimportant safeguards to keep cancer-causing toxins and pollution that \ncause sickness and death out of the air we breathe and the water we \ndrink. Without those safeguards, the Koch brothers would pass on the \nhigher health care costs to\n\n[[Page S1258]]\n\nmiddle-class Americans while padding their own pocketbooks.\n  So the Koch brothers are already seeing a return on their 2010 \ninvestment in a Republican House of Representatives that does what they \nwant done. But they certainly have not stopped there. The Koch-backed \nAmericans for Prosperity alone spent $400 million in misleading attack \nads last election cycle.\n  If you have seen an ad recently maligning the Affordable Care Act or \nObamaCare, chances are, significantly, that these ads are from the Koch \nbrothers or one of the shadow groups paid for by the Koch brothers. \nKoch-backed groups have spent a vast sum trying to elect Republican \nSenate candidates this year, a sum that dwarfs even the National \nRepublican Senatorial Committee's own spending.\n  The Koch brothers and other moneyed interests are influencing the \npolitical process for their own benefit in a way not seen for \ngenerations. Republican Senators have come to the floor to defend the \nKoch brothers attempts to buy our democracy. Once again, Republicans \nare all in to protect their billionaire friends.\n\n  Not only have Senate Republicans come to the floor to defend the Koch \nbrothers personally, they have again and again defended the Koch \nbrothers' radical agenda--and it is radical, at least from a middle-\nclass perspective.\n  Senate Republicans have opened so many different avenues to oppose \nclosing a single tax loophole. Senate Republicans have opposed closing \neven a loophole for these oil companies or corporations that ship jobs \noverseas. This benefits the Koch brothers. Senate Republicans have \nopposed asking billionaires to pay the same higher tax rate as middle-\nclass tax families, as illustrated by Warren Buffett.\n  Senate Republicans have opposed environmental and workplace safety \nstandards that might cause the Koch brothers or their corporate donors \na few extra dimes--a few extra dollars maybe. The Koch brothers are \nreturning the favor with huge donations to Republican Senate \ncandidates, either directly or indirectly.\n  Senate Republicans are addicted to Koch. In fact, Senate Republicans \nhardly need the NRSC any more, which for decade after decade was the \nmain funding tool for the Republican Senate. Not any longer; the Koch \nbrothers take care of that.\n  Aside from that, the NRSC cannot hide its donors' identities like the \nKoch brothers-funded groups can hide their donors' identities. Senate \nRepublicans call this freewheeling spending by anonymous donors nothing \nmore than ``free speech.'' Senate Republicans say that whoever has the \nmost money gets the most free speech. But that is not what America's \nFounding Fathers said. They did not mean that by free speech. The \nFounders believed in a democracy where every American had a voice and a \nvote.\n  This discussion, this fight, is not just about health care or even \nabout a few hundred million dollars in disingenuous ads. This is about \ntwo very wealthy brothers who intend to buy their own Congress, a \nCongress beholden to the money and bound to enact their radical \nphilosophy. Witness this: Senators beholden to wealthy special \ninterests; Republican senators rush to the floor to defend the Kochs \nwhenever I say something negative about the brothers or their radical \nagenda.\n  By the way, the words ``radical agenda'' are not my words. Charles \nKoch proudly told Brian Doherty, an editor of the magazine ``Reason,'' \nabout his self-described--his quote--``radical philosophy'' in 2007. \nThese are the same brothers who have lobbied against the recognition of \nformaldehyde as a cancer-causing carcinogen, because it might be bad \nfor their business.\n  These are the same brothers whose Koch Industries ranks near the top \nof the list of America's worst toxic air polluters. Those are the same \nbrothers whose company, according to a Bloomberg investigation, paid \nbribes and kickbacks to win contracts in Africa, India, and the Middle \nEast.\n  These are the same brothers who, according to the same report, used \nforeign subsidiaries to sell millions of dollars of equipment to Iran, \na state sponsor of terrorism. Let's make sure we understand that. I may \nnot have said it quite right. These are the same brothers who, \naccording to the same report, used foreign subsidiaries to sell \nmillions of dollars of equipment to Iran, a state sponsor of terrorism. \nWe all know that.\n  The Koch brothers already believe they can play by a different set of \nrules. Think about how an America rigged by the Koch brothers would \nlook. The Koch brothers do not care about creating a strong public \neducation system in America. The Koch brothers do not care about \nmaintaining the strong safety net of Medicare and Social Security. The \nKoch brothers do not care about the guarantee of affordable, quality \nhealth insurance for every American.\n  That is obvious from the misleading ads they have paid for all over \nthe country. Why? Because the Koch brothers can afford to buy all of \nthose benefits and more for themselves and their families. Their \nextreme vision for America means abolishing Social Security and \nMedicare. Their extreme vision for America means eliminating minimum \nwage laws. Their extreme vision for America means putting insurance \ncompanies back in charge of your health care and denying coverage for \npreexisting conditions. That is the way it used to be.\n  I guess that is what they want, running all of these ads. Their \nextreme vision for America means stripping tens of millions of people \nof the benefits in the Affordable Care Act today. Their extreme vision \nfor America means allowing the gap between the wages women and men earn \nfor the same work to keep growing. Their extreme vision for America \nmeans giving giant corporations the unfettered right to dump toxins in \nour rivers and streams, on our mountains and our valleys, and to give \nthem even more tax breaks while they destroy our environment.\n  We Democrats have a different vision. Democrats believe the economy \nis strongest when the middle class is vibrant and growing. Democrats \nbelieve world class education leads to world class work. This work is \none where people are ready to take on any challenge. Right now there \nare at least three people for every job available. Democrats believe in \nan even playing field with higher wages, affordable health care, and a \nsecure retirement for every American so that every American can have a \nshot at success.\n  I welcome a debate over these competing visions. Average Americans \nshare our vision for a country whose success is built on a strong \nmiddle class. The Koch brothers know Americans share our vision for a \ncountry where success is built on a strong middle class. That is why, \nrather than having an honest and fair debate, they are pouring hundreds \nof millions of dollars into a massive campaign of deception. They \nmanufacture stories. They make up facts. They are angry that I am \ncalling attention to their campaign of distortion and deceit.\n  I am not oblivious that my comments about the Koch brothers have \ncaused some controversy. Anyone who has turned on FOX News knows that I \nhave gotten under their skin. But I will continue to shine a light on \ntheir subversion of democracy.\n  When I hear my Republican colleagues defending the Koch brothers as \nthey have, I recall the words of Adlai Stevenson:\n\n       I have been thinking that I would make a proposition to my \n     Republican friends . . . that if they will stop telling lies \n     about the Democrats, we will stop telling the truth about \n     them.\n\n  As long as the Koch brothers continue to spend hundreds of millions \nof dollars buying elections, I will continue to do all I can to expose \ntheir intentions.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                        Political Participation\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I noted with interest that the majority leader was \nhammering the Koch brothers again today, and I wondered why he left out \nbillionaire Tom Steyer, who plans to spend as much as $100 million \npushing the issue of climate change in the 2014 election and ``appears \nprimed to rival the deep-pocketed and conservative Koch brothers,'' \naccording to the New York Times. The truth is that these American \ncitizens have a constitutional right to participate in the political \nprocess.\n  It strikes me as curious that if we are going to demonize people for \nexercising their constitutional rights to go\n\n[[Page S1259]]\n\nout, speak, and participate in the political process, we would just \npick out the people who are opposed to us and leave out the people who \nare in favor of us. The truth is that there are many wealthy Americans \nwho feel deeply about the country, who are committed to one side or the \nother, and who are trying to have an impact on the country--as many on \nthe left as on the right.\n  So we ought not to leave out Tom Steyer. I believe he also has a \nbrother, who is also a billionaire, who has similar views and will \nprobably try to impact the fall's election in one way or another \nbeneficial to the things he advocates.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  The release of a President's budget is usually a pretty big deal, but \nPresident Obama's latest budget, released only this morning, hasn't \neven ginned up much excitement. Folks just aren't taking it very \nseriously because it is not a very serious document.\n  First, it could probably never even pass the Democratic-led Senate, \nand in some sense that is the point. Rather than put together a \nconstructive blueprint that the two parties could use as a jumping-off \npoint to get our economy moving and our fiscal house in order, the \nPresident has once again opted for the political stunt--for a budget \nthat is more about firing up the base in an election year than about \nsolving the Nation's biggest and most persistent long-term challenges.\n  It would increase taxes by well over $1 trillion in the worst \neconomic slowdown nearly anyone can remember. It would explode spending \nby $790 billion, forcing us to borrow more money from places such as \nChina. As I indicated, it would do almost nothing to address the most \nserious threats facing our children's future, and it doesn't even come \nclose to balancing this year. No wonder the President thought the left \nwould love it.\n  But this is my question for the President: What about the middle \nclass? What is in it for them? It seems as though the President has \njust about given up on helping folks who are in the middle, folks who \nfeel as if Washington doesn't take their concerns and anxieties into \nconsideration anymore. What hope is he giving them that their medical \nbills won't be as high, that their wages will start going up instead of \ndown? What is in this budget for them except for this nagging feeling \nthat they will just keep getting squeezed?\n  The President is well into his sixth year of trying to fix this \neconomy, his sixth year of trying to tax, spend, and regulate our way \nto prosperity--just as his ideology demands. But this much has to be \nclear by now: This doesn't work. Since 2009 the government has spent \nalmost $18 trillion. Yet millions of middle-class Americans continue to \nsuffer, whether in the unemployment line or in jobs that barely allow \nthem to get by.\n  It is time the President realized that doubling down on the same \nfailed policies is simply not going to work. Yet that is just what this \nbudget proposes to do. We do not need any more election-year gimmicks. \nWhat is needed is a new approach, a positive strategy that focuses on \nhelping the middle class instead of appeasing the far left.\n  President Obama still has 2 years in his Presidency. It is not too \nlate for him to try to make a positive difference for folks struggling \nto pay their bills, but he has to let go of the left and reach to the \nmiddle. He has to decide that bipartisan solutions are worth fighting \nfor. If he does he is going to find significant support on this side of \nthe aisle. We want to work with him to get important legislation done \nfor our country. We always have. We are eager to expand opportunity for \nthe middle class and to build more ladders of opportunity for those who \naspire to it. We are eager to enact policies that can create American \njobs--approving things such as the Keystone Pipeline, medical device \ntax repeal, and important new trade legislation, just to name a few we \ncould do together. We are eager to find ways to control spending and \nput the debt on a path to elimination. We are eager to reform the \nregulatory state so that the rules coming out of Washington actually \nwork for people other than the bureaucratic class who writes them.\n  There are bipartisan solutions to be had on these types of issues if \nonly the President could put the politics aside for a few minutes and \nactually work with us, really work with us, because the kind of \nunserious budget he put out today is just the type of silly politicking \nwe need to get past. After all, why would we want a budget that grows \nthe Federal Government while the middle class continues to shrink? \nWashington is doing just fine in the ObamaCare economy, but real \nAmericans deserve a lot better. We can give it to them if we work \ntogether.\n  What I am saying is this: Mr. President, you have 2 years remaining \nin office. Work with us to make them count.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

First, I associate myself with the remarks of the \nmajority leader. I certainly understand the concerns of those on the \nRepublican side about the individual who has proposed to spend a \ncertain amount of money supporting the global warming cause, but it \npales in comparison to the money that has already been spent by the \nKoch brothers, who have poured hundreds of millions of dollars and will \ncontinue to pour hundreds of millions of dollars into these races, \ncompletely dwarfing any amount of money that is spent on the other \nside.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/04/senate-section/article/S1259-3", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1259-S1260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                UKRAINE\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I am on the floor to talk about the \nongoing crisis in Ukraine. I am pleased to have Senator McCain on the \nfloor because it is very hard to describe the sensation both he and I \nfelt at the end of the last year when we got the chance to travel to \nthe Maidan--Independence Square--in Kiev and speak to about 1 million \npeople. It is even harder to describe the sensation of hearing that \ngroup of people yelling back to us in unison:\n\n       Thank you, U.S.A. Thank you, U.S.A.\n\n  But that was the reality we were able to experience.\n  It is important to note that Senator McCain and I didn't go to the \nMaidan that day to advocate for President Yanukovych's removal even \nthough the end of that process resulted in that fact. In actuality we \nspent 2 hours that night meeting with Yanukovych, pleading with him to \nreverse course on his decision to abandon plans to join the EU so that \nhe could win back the support of the hundreds of thousands of people \nwho had gathered on that square to support our European integration and \ndomestic political reforms. But President Yanukovych didn't listen, and \ninstead he lost his legitimacy as a ruler when he turned his security \nservice on his own people, resulting in the murder of over 100 \nUkrainians who simply wanted to compel their leader to follow the \nwishes of the Ukrainian people.\n  I was proud to author a resolution that passed unanimously in this \nbody that declared our support for the ability of Ukrainians to \npeacefully air their grievances against their government and to oppose \nthe use of force against them. Then, I was equally proud to join \nSenator McCain and some others in a bipartisan call for sanctions \nagainst Yanukovych when he began his murderous crusade against the \nprotesters. I was even prouder of President Obama, who through the \nState Department sent a clear, unwavering message to the Ukrainian \npeople that the United States stood with them in their desire to see a \nbetter future for Ukraine, aligned with Europe and the West.\n  This strong bipartisan approach here in America to the Maidan \nmovement helped the people of Ukraine as they charted their own path \ntoward a new government. We didn't dictate the\n\n[[Page S1260]]\n\nterms of Ukraine's future; we simply supported the right of the people \nto determine it for themselves.\n  But now, despite the success of the Maidan, the crisis in Ukraine has \nchanged its face. It hasn't dissipated. And today Secretary Kerry was \ngreeted in Kiev by Ukrainians pleading for the continued support of the \nUnited States.\n  Having been so clear-voiced in our support of the Ukrainian people \nthus far since the protests began last November, now is the moment when \nDemocrats and Republicans should stand united in this Congress so that \nyears from now, when a group assembles in Kiev marking the anniversary \nof this grave crisis, they will celebrate Ukraine's political \nsovereignty and economic rebirth with more chants of thanks to the \nUnited States.\n  In what shape should this support come?\n  First, we need to stand together in the next week to deliver serious \nfinancial assistance to a Ukrainian economy that is weak and is growing \nweaker as this crisis persists. A $1 billion aid package is a good \nstart, but our real work must happen within the structures of the IMF, \nwhich can provide potentially tens of billions of dollars necessary to \nfully right the Ukrainian economic ship. While Ukraine does need to \nundergo economic and budget reforms from within, I would caution the \nIMF to be gentle in the timing of the conditions applied to this aid. \nDifficult steps need to be undertaken to right-size gas prices and trim \nbudget deficits, but Ukraine should be given a long enough lease so \nthat these necessary reforms don't strangle a nation today dealing with \nthreats to its very existence.\n  Second, Crimea. Russia has invaded Ukraine, make no mistake. They \nhave done so in violation of the United Nations charter and the very \naccord they signed in 1994 guaranteeing Crimea's territorial security. \nNo doubt Vladimir Putin was sore at losing his erstwhile ally in the \nUkrainian President's office. No doubt he didn't like the fact that the \nUnited States voiced its strong support for the right of a sovereign \nUkraine to make independent decisions about its future partnerships. No \ndoubt he is infuriated that the Ukrainian people are now on their way \nto getting their way. But this is not a schoolyard. You don't get to \npush weaker kids around just because you don't like them. This is the \n21st century.\n  The reason we belong to organizations such as the United Nations or \nthe reason we negotiate treaties such as the Budapest memorandum is \nbecause now we understand, after centuries of European war, how \ndestabilizing this kind of behavior is.\n  The irony for Russia, of course, is that this invasion demonstrably \nweakens, not strengthens, their nation's position in the world. Let's \nsay for argument's sake that the end result of this crisis is a Crimea \nthat is more closely aligned with Russia than with Ukraine. What does \nthat accomplish for Russia? Well, it will have won the occupation of 2 \nmillion Ukrainians while the majority of the other 43 million continue \nto orient themselves permanently toward the European Union.\n  If the United States and Europe make good on sanctions threats, which \nI hope we will, it will devastate the Russian economy, leaving millions \nof Russians out of work and adding political instability to Putin's own \nland at a time when he really can't afford much more instability, and \nit will make Russia an international pariah, shunned by the \nindustrialized nations that help form the future path of global, \npolitical, and economic values.\n  Given this reality, why did Putin do it? He didn't do it to protect \nRussians in Ukraine because the only threat to their safety is due to \nthe military crisis of Russia's own making. He did it because, like the \nschoolyard bully, he doesn't see past his own nose. He believes that he \nwins by temporarily flexing his muscles and by capturing the world's \nattention. He doesn't look to the long-term, potentially dire \nconsequences to his own political standing and to his own people. He \npulls punches because it feels good today no matter how bad it will \nhurt tomorrow.\n  But that being said, no matter the irrationality of Moscow's \nbehavior, we need to make sure in the case that Russia does not correct \nits mistake, and correct it soon, the consequences do hurt. I believe \nCongress should authorize broad authority for President Obama to enact \nstrong sanctions on Russia through penalties to its banks, its oil \ncompanies, and its political and economic elite. I believe the \nPresident should only be allowed to use this authority in the case that \nthis illegal incursion into Ukraine continues and that we should give \nMoscow the opportunity to reverse course or join with the international \ncommunity to address their concerns about the safety of Russian \ncitizens in Ukraine.\n  Let's give Russia a chance to make this better and deliver a clear \nmessage of the consequences if they don't. This, of course, can't \nhappen without the support of our European allies. As chairman of the \nForeign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, I will be on the \nphone this week with European Parliamentarians urging them to join us \nin proposing new sanctions on the Russian economy.\n  I know there is hesitance in Europe due to the integration of Russia \ninto the European economies, but this crisis should, frankly, matter \nmore to Europe than it matters to us. Five years ago it was a laughable \nproposition that Russia would invade Ukraine, but it is happening \nnow. It may be unthinkable today that Russia, in 5 years, is going to \nmove on a NATO ally, but if this aggression goes unchecked, then the \nfuture can be very perilous, even for our friends in Europe.\n\n  Finally, a word on the politics of this crisis. I have listened to \nsome of my good friends on the Republican side try to score political \npoints in connection with the Russian move on Crimea, trying to paint \nthis somehow as Obama's fault. This is a ridiculous contention. Putin \nmarched into Georgia in 2008 under a Republican President, who many of \nmy Republican colleagues considered to be strong on foreign policy, and \nnow he is doing it with a Democrat in office. President Obama is \nconsidering steps in response that seemingly weren't even considered in \n2008.\n  What has me feeling even more suspect of the criticisms of President \nObama is there doesn't seem to be any real difference between what the \nRepublicans want the President to do and what he is actually doing. It \nis easy to say it is Obama's fault, but history tells us otherwise, and \nthese political attacks mask the fortunate fact that there is pretty \nsolid bipartisan agreement on what to do next.\n  Ukraine can remain whole and free and it can stay on a path to join \nEurope. When that day emerges from the smoke and the fire of the \ncrisis, if we play our cards right, then they will have America and our \nEuropean allies to thank, in part, for that new day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/04/senate-section/article/S1260-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1260-S1262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                UKRAINE\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleague from Connecticut for his thoughtful \nremarks on events taking place and the tragedies taking place in \nUkraine as we speak. I appreciate his commitment to trying to find a \nway through this very difficult situation.\n  The Senator is dead wrong when he says this is similar to Georgia. In \nfact, this Senator wanted to do a lot more than we did. In fact, we did \na lot more. The fundamental problem, I say to my friend from \nConnecticut, is that this President does not understand Vladimir Putin. \nHe does not understand his ambitions. He does not understand that \nVladimir Putin is an old KGB colonel bent on restoration of the Russian \nempire. It was Vladimir Putin who said: The greatest catastrophe of the \n20th century was the downfall of the Soviet Union.\n  The Senator from Connecticut should understand that. This President \nhas never understood this. This President is the one who ridiculed Mitt \nRomney when Mitt Romney said our great enemy was Russia and its \ngeopolitical threats. This President said the Cold War has been over \nfor 20 years. This President believes the Cold War is over, but \nVladimir Putin doesn't believe the Cold War is over.\n  When the President of the United States is overheard to say to Mr. \nPutin's puppet, Mr. Medvedev: Tell Vladimir that after I am reelected I \nwill be more flexible.\n  Did you get that? The President said: Tell Vladimir after I am \nreelected I will be more flexible. This is the same\n\n[[Page S1261]]\n\nPresident who believed that somehow Vladimir Putin had anything but the \nambitions which he is now realizing in Ukraine. In fact, I think it \nmight be interesting for my colleagues to note that Vladimir Putin \nspoke to the press today and Vladimir Putin, among other things, during \nhis answering questions from the press, said:\n\n       First of all, my assessment of what happened in Kiev and in \n     Ukraine in general. There can only be one assessment: this \n     was an anti-constitutional takeover, an armed seizure of \n     power.\n\n  That was Vladimir Putin's view of what happened in Kiev as Yanukovych \nslaughtered, I believe, 82 innocent civilians as well as wounding \nhundreds.\n  Then he goes on to say:\n\n       I would like to stress that under that agreement Mr. \n     Yanukovych actually handed over power.\n\n  Obviously, Yanukovych did not hand over power. He was driven from \npower by the good people who were tired of his corruption and were sick \nof his nepotism and his crony capitalism. Anybody who believes anything \ngood about Mr. Yanukovych should see the pictures of the home he had \nand the dacha he was building that cost hundreds of millions of \ndollars--truly a man of the people.\n  President Putin went on to say:\n\n       The current acting president [of Ukraine] is definitely not \n     legitimate. There is only one legitimate president, from a \n     legal standpoint. . . . Yanukovych is the only undoubtedly \n     legitimate President.\n\n  Then comes more interesting things. Vladimir Putin now says:\n\n       Now about financial aid to Crimea. As you know, we have \n     decided to organize work in the Russian regions to aid \n     Crimea, which has turned to us for humanitarian support. We \n     will provide it, of course. I cannot say how much, when or \n     how. The government is working on this by bringing together \n     the regions bordering on Crimea by providing additional \n     support to our regions so they can help the people in Crimea. \n     We will do it, of course.\n       Regarding the deployment of troops, the use of armed \n     forces, so far there is no need for it, but the possibility \n     remains.\n\n  Let me repeat that. This is from today. Vladimir Putin said:\n\n       Regarding the deployment of troops, the use of armed \n     forces, so far there is no need for it, but the possibility \n     remains.\n\n  This is a return to the old Russian Soviet doublespeak which was \nabsolute nonsense, but they said it anyway.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       What is our biggest concern? We see the rampage of \n     reactionary forces, nationalist and anti-Semitic forces going \n     on in certain parts of Ukraine, including Kiev. . . . When we \n     see this, we understand what worries the citizens of Ukraine, \n     both Russian and Ukrainian, and the Russian-speaking \n     population in the eastern and southern regions of Ukraine. It \n     is this uncontrolled crime that worries them. Therefore, if \n     we see such uncontrolled crime spreading to the eastern \n     regions of the country--\n\n  We should pay careful attention to these words of Mr. Putin--\n\n     if we see such uncontrolled crime spreading to the eastern \n     regions of the country, and if the people ask us for help, \n     while we already have the official request from the \n     legitimate President, we retain the right to use all \n     available means to protect those people. We believe this \n     would be absolutely legitimate.\n\n  Then he goes on to say, in answer to a question:\n\n       Thus the tension in Crimea that was linked to the \n     possibility of using our Armed Forces simply died down and \n     there was no need to use them.\n\n  I repeat:\n\n       Thus the tension in Crimea that was linked to the \n     possibility of using our Armed Forces simply died down and \n     there was no need to use them. The only something we had to \n     do, and we did it, was to enhance the defense of our military \n     facilities because they were constantly receiving threats and \n     we were aware of the armed nationalists moving in.\n\n  Russia has well trained, well equipped now an additional 16,000 or \nmore, and Vladimir Putin was worried about enhancing the defense of his \nmilitary facilities because they were constantly receiving threats.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       There is something I would like to stress, however. \n     Obviously, what I am going to say now is not within my \n     authority and we do not intend to interfere. However, we \n     firmly believe all citizens of Ukraine, I repeat, wherever \n     they live, should be given the same equal right to \n     participate in the life of their country and determining its \n     future.\n\n  My friends, we are seeing justification for intervention and serious \nintervention in eastern Ukraine. So the article goes on with further \nquestions, and he goes on to take a shot at the United States saying:\n\n       Our partners, especially in the United States, always \n     clearly formulate their own geopolitical and state interests \n     and follow them with persistence. Then, using the principle \n     ``You're either with us or against us'' they draw the whole \n     world in. And those who do not join in get ``beaten'' until \n     they do.\n\n  Then he goes on to say:\n\n       Our approach is different. We proceed from the conviction \n     that we always act legitimately. I have personally--\n\n  I say to my colleagues, I am not making this up. This is what \nVladimir Putin said--\n\n       I have always been an advocate of acting in compliance with \n     international law. I would like to stress yet again that if \n     we do make the decision, if I do decide to use the Armed \n     Forces, this will be a legitimate decision in full compliance \n     with both general norms of international law, since we have \n     the appeal of the legitimate President, and with our \n     commitments, which in this case coincide with our interest to \n     protect the people with whom we have close historical \n     cultural and economic ties. Protecting these people is in our \n     national interests. This is a humanitarian mission. We do not \n     intend to subjugate anyone or to dictate to anyone. However, \n     we cannot remain indifferent if we see they are being \n     persecuted, destroyed and humiliated.\n\n  Here is probably the most interesting part:\n\n       Question: Mr. President, a clarification, if I may. The \n     people who were blocking the Ukrainian Army units in Crimea \n     were wearing uniforms that strongly resembled the Russian \n     Army uniform. Were those Russian soldiers, Russian military?\n       Vladimir Putin: Why don't you take a look at the post-\n     Soviet states. There are many military uniforms there that \n     are similar. You can go to a store and buy any kind of \n     uniform.\n       Question: But were they Russian soldiers or not?\n       Vladimir Putin: Those were local self-defence units.\n       Question: How well trained are they? If we compare them to \n     the self-defence units in Kiev . . .\n       Vladimir Putin: My dear colleague, look how well trained \n     the people who operated in Kiev were. As we all know they \n     were trained at special bases in neighboring states: in \n     Lithuania, Poland and in Ukraine itself too. They were \n     trained by instructors for extended periods. They were \n     divided into dozens and hundreds, their actions were \n     coordinated, they had good communication systems. It was all \n     like clockwork. Did you see them in action? They looked very \n     professional, like special forces. Why do you think those in \n     Crimea should be any worse?\n       Question: In that case, can I specify: did we take part in \n     training Crimea self-defence forces?\n       Vladimir Putin: No, we did not.\n\n  This is the same guy the President of the United States pushed the \nreset button for time and again. This is the same guy whom the \nPresident says we can work with--Vladimir Putin.\n  Then my colleague and former Member of this body on Friday--on \nFriday, as Putin's forces moved into Crimea, and it was very clear to \nanyone the Russians were moving in--Secretary of State John F. Kerry \nspoke Friday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. This is a \nquote from Secretary Kerry.\n\n       We raised the issue of the airports, raised the issue of \n     armored vehicles, raised the issue of personnel in various \n     places. While we were told they are not engaging in any \n     violation of the sovereignty, and do not intend to, I \n     nevertheless made it clear that could be misinterpreted at \n     this moment and that there are enough tensions that it is \n     important for everybody to be extremely careful not to \n     inflame the situation and not to send the wrong messages.\n\n  I am not making that up. So after 5 years of believing that somehow \nVladimir Putin was anything but what he is, we are now paying the \npiper. The chickens are coming home to roost.\n  Do we have a military option? No. But we do have a number of other \noptions.\n  I wish to read one other article that was in USA Today by Jonah \nGoldberg entitled ``Obama In Denial on Russia.''\n  I will not go through a lot of it, about student Obama, but here is \nsome of the quote from the article:\n\n       In 1983, then-Columbia University student Obama penned a \n     lengthy article for the school magazine placing the blame for \n     U.S.-Soviet tensions largely on America's ``war mentality'' \n     and the ``twisted logic'' of the Cold War. President Reagan's \n     defense buildup, according to Obama, contributed to the \n     ``silent spread of militarism'' and reflected our ``distorted \n     national priorities'' rather than what should be our goal: a \n     ``nuclear free world.''\n\n  That is what student Obama said. But the remarkable thing is 2 weeks \nago in response to tensions in Ukraine, the President explained that:\n\n       Our approach . . . is not to see (events in Ukraine) as \n     some Cold War chessboard in which we're in competition with \n     Russia.\n\n\n[[Page S1262]]\n\n\n  This is a horrible way to talk about the Cold War because it starts \nfrom the premise that it all was just a game conducted between two \nmorally equivalent competitors.\n  Similar comments about Cold War rivalries and the like are \ncommonplace of late, especially during the Sochi Olympics, when NBC \ncommentators were desperate to portray the entire Soviet chapter as \nnothing more than a pivotal experience.\n  America surely made mistakes during the near half-century twilight \nstruggle. The fact is there was a right side and a wrong side to that \nconflict and we were on the right side of it. The Soviet Union, of \nwhich Vladimir Putin was a part, murdered millions of its own people, \nstifled freedom in nearly every forum, enslaved whole nations, and \nactively tried to undermine democracy all around the world, including \nin the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent for 5 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. President Putin, a former KGB agent, has said the \ncollapse of the ``evil empire'' was ``the greatest geopolitical \ncatastrophe of the 20th century.'' This alone should have been a clue \nto this White House that misspelled reset buttons weren't going to cut \nit. But they were too stuck in the past to see it.\n  I could go on and on, including the ridicule some of us were \nsubjected to when we pointed this out from time to time, including in \n2008 when I said in a debate with then-candidate Obama: Watch Ukraine. \nWatch Ukraine. Putin will not give up Ukraine.\n  We need to have an economic aid package immediately, and I am glad \nour Secretary of State is over there with initial U.S. loan guarantees, \njoining the EU, and a longer substitute package through the \nInternational Monetary Fund. We have to stabilize the economy of \nUkraine which is near collapse. Financial sanctions, freezing assets, \nvisa bans, trade embargoes--all of those can be accomplished, \nparticularly expansion of the Magnitsky act, so people who are \nresponsible will not have bank accounts, they will not travel, they \nwill not ever get a visa. They need to pay a penalty for orchestrating \nwhat is happening in Ukraine right now.\n  Obviously we should not go to the G-8 summit. He should be thrown out \nof the G-8. It should now be the G-7. They obviously have to suspend \nmilitary-to-military engagements. We need to have a path--and a quick \none--for both Moldova and Georgia to move into NATO. Both countries are \noccupied by Russian troops, Moldova in Transnistria and in Georgia at \nKajian South Abkhazia, and quite often Russians keep moving the fence \nfarther and farther into the sovereign territory of these countries. In \nan attempt to appease Mr. Putin, we abandoned missile defense systems \nin Poland and the Czech Republic. We need to reinstate those and move \nforward as quickly as possible.\n  There are a number of things the most powerful Nation in the world \nneeds to do. I am not counting on our European friends. Already there \nhave been statements by Angela Merkel and the leaking of a memorandum \nfrom the British Government. We may have to do a lot of these things by \nourselves, because they are dependent on Russia for a lot of their \nenergy supplies, and we have seen a significant recession in European \nleadership over the last 10 to 20 years. But we need to act, and we \nneed to speak in favor of the people who are now being overtaken in \nCrimea by Vladimir Putin's army and military. I worry.\n  In conclusion, I say it is time we wake up about Vladimir Putin. It \nis time this administration gets real. It is also time for us to worry \nabout what Vladimir Putin will do in eastern Ukraine on the pretext \nthat somehow disorder and demonstrations might require Russian \npresence.\n  My friends, if we allow Mr. Putin to assert his authority over these \nareas because of Russian-speaking people, that message is not lost on \nPoland where there is a Russian population, on Romania, Latvia, \nEstonia, Lithuania, and Moldova. We are on the verge possibly of seeing \na move to reassert the old Russian empire, which is Mr. Putin's \nlifelong ambition.\n  I have overstayed my time. I thank my colleague from Alabama.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to listen \nto Senator McCain. I think facts have proven him right for many over \nmany years of warning this country about how we have to conduct \ninternational relations in a realistic way.\n  I had the opportunity to be in Georgia and Ukraine about 3 years ago. \nIn Georgia, we went to South Ossetia where the Russians had moved in, \nagainst European international law, and had set in. Last week or so, we \nwere informed by the Prime Minister of Georgia they were building \nbarbed wire fences along that border, digging in even deeper than they \nhad before.\n  In Ukraine, we met with some of the democratic dissidents who were \ntrying to hang on to democracy there. They had beaten Shevchenko, the \nfabulous lady who helped lead the Orange Revolution. She was worried \nabout going to jail. I didn't think she would go to jail, but they put \nher in jail and kept her in jail for years on what EU and NATO \nofficials have all said were bogus charges. They told us some of the \ndemocratic activists were somewhat depressed because Putin, with his \nintel background, was using the Russian intelligence services in \nUkraine to buy up media and buy up television to propagandize the \ncountry. They were hurting, and they didn't know if they would be able \nto successfully resist. It was such a delight for me to see this \nbasically nonviolent revolution in which the people stood up for their \ncountry. Now we see Mr. Putin did not accept the sovereignty, and he is \ngoing to try to utilize military force in a way which is stunning. I \nhave to say, Crimea is far larger and more strategically significant \nthan South Ossetia and Abkhazia, but it is the same actions.\n  I thank Senator McCain for his leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/04/senate-section/article/S1262-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1262-S1264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ADEGBILE NOMINATION\n\n  I will share a few thoughts on the nomination of Debo Adegbile to be \nthe Assistant Attorney General of the U.S. Department of Justice, Civil \nRights Division, a very important position.\n  There is no question he is a bright young lawyer, has a good resume. \nHe spent 13 years with the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, one \nof the advocacy groups of the historic organization. They have been \nchampions for advocacy and defense of civil rights and have done \ntremendous work over the years, and I have seen a lot of it. But they \nhave also used the courts to advance political agendas which haven't \nalways been accepted and have been seen to be improper.\n  While serving as the acting president and director-counsel of the \nLegal Defense Fund, Mr. Adegbile positioned himself at the center of \nmany high-profile cases--cases in the news media, and issues he dealt \nwith. Perhaps most notably as litigation director, he chose, without \nbeing asked or without being even needed, to participate in the case of \nMumia Abu-Jamal, the country's most notorious killer of a police \nofficer. Abu-Jamal was tried at trial and convicted of the murder of a \nyoung 25-year-old Philadelphia police officer, Daniel Faulkner. The \nevidence at trial proved that Abu-Jamal shot Officer Faulkner in the \nback, and then stood over him and shot him three more times before \nfiring a final shot into Officer Faulkner's face. Immediately following \nthe murder, he stated that he hoped the officer died.\n  As noted by Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams, in his \nletter to the Senate Judiciary Committee in opposition to this \nnomination, he said:\n\n       Evidence at the trial established that while this was not \n     some case of random street crime, Abu-Jamal was a supporter \n     of the MOVE organization, an anarchist group that explicitly \n     advocated violence against police.\n\n  This is the district attorney's summary of this case.\n\n       Some members of this body have argued that Mr. Adegbile's \n     choice to involve himself and his organization in this case \n     is irrelevant because it is simply a case of a lawyer \n     representing an unpopular client.\n\n  And lawyers do that. They are called upon to do that. I live in \nMonroe County, AL, the home of Atticus Finch,\n\n[[Page S1263]]\n\nHarper Lee, who wrote ``To Kill A Mockingbird.'' He was asked to defend \nan unpopular defendant in the setting of Macon, which is Monroeville, \nAL. He undertook and did his duty because he knew it was his duty.\n  But I will take a few moments to read from District Attorney \nWilliams' letter to Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley which \npowerfully illustrates why this is not the same thing. We are talking \nabout a lawyer's duty to take on unpopular clients and make sure every \nAmerican who is charged with a crime is entitled to an adequate \ndefense. The district attorney of this very large office goes on:\n\n       Abu-Jamal made every effort to turn the trial into \n     political theater. He repeatedly interrupted the proceedings, \n     insulted the judge, and chanted the name of MOVE leader John \n     ``Africa.'' During the appeals, his supporters attempted to \n     intimidate the judge by massing in front of his home in a \n     residential neighborhood. Worst of all, they have maintained \n     a three-decade-long campaign of verbal abuse against Officer \n     Faulkner's widow, Maureen, who simply wanted justice for her \n     dead husband.\n\n  This is indisputable. I think no one denies it. The D.A. goes on to \nsay:\n\n       His lawyers . . . echoed these tactics in their legal \n     maneuvers.\n\n  In other words, the lawyers defending him used the same tactics that \nthe defendant did.\n  In other words, the lawyers defending him used the same tactics that \nthe defendant did. They were not required to do that. Lawyers are \nofficers of the court. They should never misrepresent anything in court \nor take a position contrary to plain law or misstate facts. Lawyers are \nnot entitled to do that. So District Attorney Williams' letter goes on \nto say:\n\n       Despite the overwhelming evidence of guilt, they have--\n\n  The defendant and the lawyers, he is saying here--\n\n       --they have consistently attempted to turn reality on its \n     head, arguing that Abu-Jamal was framed and that it was he, \n     rather than Officer Faulkner, who was the victim of racism. \n     The LDF perpetuated these allegations when they took over \n     Abu-Jamal's case. Although Abu-Jamal's death sentence was \n     eventually overturned on the basis of new procedural rules \n     invented after his trial, his murder conviction has been \n     upheld, and his lawyers' bogus racial claims have been \n     consistently rejected in both state and federal court.\n\n  That is the D.A.'s continuing summation of it. He goes on to say:\n\n       Aside from being patently false, moreover, these claims are \n     personally insulting to me. As an African-American, I know \n     all too well the grievous consequences of racial \n     discrimination and prejudice. I also know that Abu-Jamal was \n     convicted and sentenced because of the evidence, not because \n     of his race; and I have continued to fight for the jury's \n     verdict because it was the just result.\n\n  So I respect that opinion. I don't think he would be saying that if \nhe didn't believe it. He goes on to say:\n\n       Given all the laudable objectives of the NAACP, it is \n     telling that Mr. Adegbile chose to devote his resources to \n     this particular cause rather than the many legitimate battles \n     that called for his formidable abilities.\n\n  I was a federal prosecutor for 15 years and attorney general of \nAlabama for 2 years. I am a firm believer in the essential integrity of \nthe American criminal justice system. I have seen it too long. I have \ntried too many cases before a jury. I believe they do justice every \ntime. But there are--in a place as large as Philadelphia, and in places \nas large as America and in any state in America, you have poor people, \npeople who are uneducated, people who can be deprived of rights they \ndidn't know they had. Errors by chance could occur in a trial. There \nare needs for groups like the NAACP, the Legal Defense Fund, and other \ngroups to defend people who have been caught up in the system and \nunfairly treated. That is a legitimate thing. So what I hear the \ndistrict attorney saying is: Why choose this one to be so active about? \nHe has good lawyers. The case was on appeal. So he goes on to say:\n\n       Of course, in our system even a radical cop-killer like \n     Mumia Abu-Jamal is entitled to legal representation. That \n     does not mean, however, that those lawyers who elect to arm \n     him in his efforts are suitable to lead this nation's highest \n     law enforcement offices. To select such a lawyer, among all \n     those qualified for the position, speaks volumes to police \n     officers and their families.\n\n  So he is saying: OK, you can do this. You can defend these cases. \nThat is perfectly all right. You can pick that case out of all of them \nin the country and defend it, but you should not necessarily be \npromoted to this high position.\n  So this is not simply a case of a lawyer representing an unpopular \nclient. It was a political cause. There was really no question about \nit.\n  What troubles me more than some of the other issues in the case is \nMr. Adegbile's co-counsel, Christina Swarns, who actually worked for \nhim. He was a supervising attorney. She explained the Legal Defense \nFund motivation for getting involved in this case. Why? She explained \nit at a ``Free Mumia'' rally in 2011. This is what she said at that \nrally:\n\n       It is absolutely my honor to represent Mumia Abu-Jamal. It \n     is my pleasure, it is my honor to have that opportunity, and \n     there is no question in my mind, there is no question in the \n     mind of anyone at the Legal Defense Fund--\n\n  I suppose, surely, that includes the nominee--\n\n       that the justice system has utterly and completely failed \n     Mumia Abu-Jamal and in our view, that has everything to do \n     with race and that is why the Legal Defense Fund is in this \n     case . . . We are acutely aware that the injustices of the \n     criminal justice system are inextricably bound up in race.\n\n  She says the Legal Defense Fund agreed with that. But the district \nattorney, Mr. Seth Williams, an African American himself, said the \nconviction had nothing to do with race but everything to do with the \nplain fact that he murdered a police officer, was observed, confessed \nand admitted it, and said he hoped he died, and the jury found that. A \nbiracial jury convicted him.\n  So while that is just her opinion, that is her statement, and she \nsaid she was speaking for the Fund. I serve on the Judiciary Committee, \nand we asked Mr. Adegbile: What about this statement by Ms. Swarns, and \ndo you agree with it? How do you explain it, and what do you have to \nsay about it?\n  Did he say he didn't agree with it? Did he say she misspoke? Did he \nsay, I wouldn't have used those words? Did he say it was inappropriate, \nI didn't know about it?\n  This is what he said:\n\n       I do not know what Ms. Swarns had in mind when she made the \n     comment.\n\n  That is not satisfactory to me. The question was a very serious one. \nI believe the comments by Ms. Swarns were inappropriate. They were \nfalse. They demeaned the integrity of the legal system of America \nimproperly. As an officer of the court she had no right to do that. She \nreally should have been disciplined, in my opinion. What did he say to \nthe Judiciary Committee's written questions submitted to him? What does \nhe say? All he said was: ``I do not know what Ms. Swarns had in mind \nwhen she made the comment.''\n  I think it is pretty clear what she had in mind. This is a radical \nview of criminal justice in America. It is very wrong. It is not \ncorrect. It is false. I am amazed that he would not at least take this \nopportunity now several years later to correct it.\n  In 2011 a Legal Defense Fund press release at the time that the \nnominee was leading the department declared:\n\n       LDF seeks to sweep the grave injustices embodied in this \n     case into the dust bin of history and, in so doing, give \n     communities of color reason to believe that they can and will \n     receive equal justice in Pennsylvania courtrooms.\n\n  So it is a direct attack on the integrity of the courtroom and the \njury and the judge and the appellate courts and federal appellate \ncourts in Pennsylvania. That is the official press release of the Legal \nDefense Fund.\n  I don't think there is any evidence that there was any grave \ninjustice done. In fact, justice was plainly done in this case. So that \nsame press release, former LDF director, John Payton, is quoted as \nsaying:\n\n       Abu-Jamal's conviction and death sentence are relics of a \n     time and place that was notorious for police abuse and racial \n     discrimination . . . unless and until courts acknowledge and \n     correct these historic injustices, death sentences like Mr. \n     Abu-Jamal's will invite continued skepticism of the criminal \n     justice system by the African American community.\n\n  Mr. Adegbile has not rejected these statements. In fact, he is proud \nof his role in the case, testifying it demonstrates America's \ncommitment to follow our procedural rules even in those hardest cases.\n  I just would say that a chief of the Civil Rights Division of the \nU.S. Department of Justice in Washington,\n\n[[Page S1264]]\n\nDC, holds an extremely important position. He is not a blind advocate \nfor one vision of what some might call civil rights. I do not think it \nis a civil rights position these lawyers are taking. He is supposed to \nbe a neutral observer. If a police officer violates the civil rights of \nsomeone under his custody, then he ought to be prosecuted, dismissed, \nand punished for it. But the Civil Rights Division leader is supposed \nto be somebody that everybody can trust, who people believe does not \nhave an agenda, and who they believe is fair to all. So therein lies \nthe rub.\n  Even someone who murders a police officer deserves legal \nrepresentation. There is no doubt about that. But the Philadelphia \nDistrict Attorney, Mr. Seth Williams, an African American said:\n\n       That does not mean, however, that those lawyers who elect \n     to arm him in his efforts are suitable to lead this nation's \n     highest law enforcement offices. To select such a lawyer, \n     among all those qualified for the position, speaks volumes to \n     police officers and their families.\n\n  It speaks volumes to them that this individual, this nominee for the \nDepartment of Justice, would be perceived as someone who is just \nvoluntarily, aggressively, and improperly, in my opinion, taking the \nside of someone who is tried for murdering a policeman.\n  So the Civil Rights Division must protect the civil rights of all \nAmericans. It must not be used to further a political agenda of any \nspecial interest groups as too often has occurred in this \nadministration, in my opinion. It must be a place where the rights of \nall Americans are protected, regardless of their race and political \nparty.\n  We have seen racial prejudice in the past, and it does need to be \nstamped out, but I do not believe the President's nominee is qualified \nbecause I do not see the required degree of objectivity and balance \nthat will be necessary, and I will oppose the nomination.\n  I don't like to oppose nominees. It is no fun. I am sure this nominee \nhas done many good things in his life. But there are points in time \nwhen we just have to say that as a Senator, I cannot vote for a nominee \nI don't believe is going to be objective and fair in the conduct of \nthat important office.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin).

Mr. President, I want to talk for a few minutes today \nabout health care and more inquiries I have from the people I work for \nin our State about health care. Like we always do, I followed up with \nthem to verify that I understand their account, and they don't mind if \nI at least mention their first name and where they are from as we talk \nabout these problems.\n  This morning I had a chance to speak to the American Federation of \nHospitals about the challenges we face, and I mentioned the comment I \nmade on the floor a few days ago, which was: If we were dealing with \nthis health care debate today, in my view it would be a much different \ndebate. Every Member of the House, every Member of the Senate, and \nalmost every American who has been impacted in any way by the changes \nin health care understands this a whole lot better than we may have \nunderstood it 4 years ago.\n  I was in the House in 2009 and was leading our effort to come up with \nthe alternatives that were clearly out there that I think we could \nhave, and, frankly, should have pursued. But at that time it was clear \na lot of Members had not really thought about this, and in many cases \npeople who worked thought about it even less. We had a situation that, \nin many ways, was an accidental development at the end of World War II \nwhere most people in America who had insurance got their insurance at \nwork. If the people at work liked the insurance they had, of course, \namong other things, they hoped they would be able to keep it. Hopefully \nmany of them will, but clearly many of them won't.\n  The letters I have today are reflective of all kinds of challenges \npeople are seeing. One of the things that was working very well in the \nalmost 40 States that had it was the high-risk pool. The high-risk pool \nallowed people who had preexisting conditions a way to get insurance. \nThey were in a pool that was pretty well defined. Not everybody with a \npreexisting condition had an ongoing cost. You might have a condition \nthat was under control, you might have had a heart problem or cancer \nproblem or another problem that stood in the way of your getting other \ninsurance, but it didn't mean you had a lot of ongoing costs. It did \nmean the high-risk pool was a place you could go.\n  In our State, the premium for the people in the high-risk pool was \n135 percent of what everybody else was paying. So you would take the \naverage rate of what people were paying for insurance and add 35 \npercent to that.\n  Remember, these were people who everybody understood--including \nthem--had a preexisting condition. They had a place to go. If the new \nplan would have reduced that 35 percent back to what everybody else was \npaying, that might have been a worthy goal, but that doesn't appear to \nbe what has happened at all to the 4,000 people who left the Missouri \nhigh-risk pool when it ended because of the new law on December 31 of \nlast year. There was a transition for some of them.\n  I have a letter from Bjorn of Kansas City. He said his wife was \npreviously insured under the Missouri Health Insurance Pool for \npreexisting conditions. In her case she had a back condition. That was \ncanceled in the middle of 2012, and she was put in another high-risk \npool that the law allowed to happen as a transition.\n  The problem that created for them was it reset their $1,000 \ndeductible. They met the $1,000 in the high-risk pool, and they met the \n$1,000 deductible again in the second half of that year.\n  The insurance they have been able to find costs them four times what \nthey were paying before. It is not 135 percent of the old premium. I \nguess four times that would be 550 percent of the old premium. So \nsomebody who was paying 135 percent of what used to be the normal \npremium for an individual is now paying 550 percent of what used to be \nthe premium for the old individual. If that was the way to help people \nwho had a preexisting condition, they better hope the Federal \nGovernment doesn't try to help them any more.\n  Mark, from Parkville, says his two sons--young and healthy as they \nwere, according to him--just had a 20-percent increase in the policies \nthey had. The only reason they were given for the increase was that the \nnew requirements of the Affordable Care Act meant their premium would \ngo up. Mark said he lived out of the country for 2 years and was amazed \nto find upon his return that the cost for the same type of health \ncoverage he had before he left went up from $250 a month to $1,000 a \nmonth.\n  Bill, from St. James, MO, said his deductible went from $1,000 to \n$2,500.\n  In Missouri, West Virginia, and lots of places, you and I know that \nif the individual deductible is $2,500, a family looks at that--that is \njust like not having insurance at all. If a couple of you happen to get \nsick that year, it is suddenly $5,000.\n  I met with some Missouri hospital folks last week in St. Louis. They \nsaid their fastest growing uncollected debt was now among people with \ninsurance. Why would that be? Because people with insurance suddenly \nhave a deductible that is much higher than the average person with \ninsurance used to have.\n  The point they were making was that people can't pay $2,500 or $3,000 \nor $5,000 or an even higher deductible, so that part of the bill \ndoesn't get paid. That is the new growing debt that hospitals have.\n  These people who have the high deductibles are insured for maybe lots \nof things they didn't used to be insured for, but they don't use any of \nthe things they are now insured for that they didn't used to be insured \nfor. Bill from St. James says:\n\n       ObamaCare sure has not helped us.\n       I work for a small business that has renewed my healthcare \n     and my deductible has risen from $1,000 to $2,500. My visits \n     went from a $20 copay to a $30 copay and specialists from $50 \n     copay to $75 copay.\n\n  He says he doesn't understand how he is helped by the new health care \nlaw.\n  Carl, in Lee's Summit, MO, said he has type 1 diabetes and his \ndeductible went up to $7,500. Again, for most families, a $7,500 \ndeductible is like not having insurance at all. If we could go\n\n[[Page S1265]]\n\nback to where we had the health savings account where you had a high \ndeductible and you had your health savings account and that high \ndeductible would kick in only if you had to pay the high deductible--I \nnever saw a health savings account plan that would not be cheaper than \nthese plans that cover a lot of things, but they cover a lot of things \na lot of people don't need.\n  Carl says:\n\n       To keep our premium rates down my employer had to raise our \n     deductible to $7,500 with no prescription benefit until it is \n     met, so now instead of putting away $400 per month for my \n     retirement I have to spend it on insulin and diabetic \n     supply's.\n       How is this ACA helping any honest working American who is \n     trying to take care of themselves and not rely on the \n     government?\n\n  Carl's point is that the money he used to spend to prepare for his \nown retirement he now spends to pay for his insulin and diabetes \nmedicine that used to be covered--until this year--by his policy.\n  Christine, from Kansas City, said her husband's employer was forced \nto make changes in their insurance resulting in a deductible that went \nfrom $1,300 to $6,100.\n  If this had been the way we would explain this, that somehow--let's \nassume we are insuring more people. There is no reason to believe that \nyet, but let's assume we are, but we are insuring more people with what \nI have here today--a $7,500 deductible, a $6,100 and a $2,500 \ndeductible.\n  She says:\n\n       Our deductible went from a manageable $1,300 to a \n     devastating $6,100.\n       I recently sent in scripts for my Dr and I can't imagine \n     how much they will be. We were told they would be between $25 \n     & $200 depending on the cost of the drug.\n\n  Remember, they are all before you get the deductible.\n  I have a letter from Fred from Columbia. He says that a drug company \nthat makes one of his prescriptions no longer offers him a discount. \nThe pharmacy told him it was because of the Affordable Care Act.\n  I am perfectly willing to believe the Affordable Care Act has become \nan excuse for some things, and this may be one of them. I have not \ntalked to the pharmacy in this case, but I do know these are problems \nother individuals are having because their insurance doesn't cover what \nit used to cover.\n  Fred is a retired State employee and he said his plan doesn't offer \nas much coverage as it used to.\n  Houston and Shirley from Peculiar, MO, have a supplemental health \ninsurance. Their supplemental health insurance increased by $330 since \nthe Affordable Care Act was passed. They said their policy increased \n$149--this is their supplemental policy.\n  They say:\n\n       Senator Blunt, we are on Medicare and have a supplemental \n     health insurance. Our monthly premiums were a little less \n     than $165 [prior to the ACA's passage in 2010], and now as of \n     January 1, 2014, is $498.40. Our premium has increased by \n     $149.55 a month.\n\n  That is for their supplemental insurance.\n  Just last week Medicare Advantage, which serves people in underserved \nareas--whether they live in the inner cities or rural communities--has \nhad that competition reduced as well.\n  I will say that if there were ever a time when we should take a \nsecond look at something--and the facts that every one of us have in \nour office suggest we take a look at it, and even demand we take a look \nat it--it is this policy that is hurting Americans and hurting \nfamilies.\n  If we had this debate again, the country, the health care providers, \nand the Congress of the United States would be a whole lot better \nprepared to talk about what needs to be talked about than apparently \nthe Congress was prepared to talk about in 2009 and 2010.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/04/senate-section/article/S1265-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1265-S1267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         EXECUTIVE NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Several weeks ago, February 12, to be exact, as \nWashington, DC, was braced for a snowstorm and the Senate rushed to \nfinish its business before the Presidents' Day recess, the senior \nSenator from Arkansas came to the floor to offer unanimous consent to \nconfirm a district court judge for his State. Before he made the \nrequest, I spoke with that Senator who, to his credit, was one of only \nthree Democrats to vote against the so-called nuclear option in \nNovember.\n  Although I was sympathetic to his desire to see his home State judge \nconfirmed, I objected to his request to bypass the procedure the \nmajority adopted in November, including recorded cloture and \nconfirmation votes.\n  I did so based on principle. I did so because after 52 Democrats \nvoted to strip us Republicans in the minority of our rights, the very \nleast we could do is to ask the majority to utilize the procedure they \nvoted to adopt. After all, the simple fact is that the minority can no \nlonger stop nominees. That is the result of the nuclear option, and \nthat was, of course, the whole point of what the majority did in \nNovember.\n  So the Senator from Arkansas offered his unanimous consent request, \nand I withheld my consent. We had our exchange on the floor, but we did \nso courteously, and that is what Senators should do. Later that evening \nthe majority leader came to the floor and made another unanimous \nconsent. Senator Cornyn objected for the same reason I had objected. \nThereafter, the majority leader exercised the power that he has--he \nalone possesses it--to move these judges and filed cloture on four \ndistrict court nominees. That set up several votes for last Monday \nevening.\n  That evening, during our side's hour of debate time--and that is all \nwe have anymore for Circuit judges; we have 1 hour of debate time on \neach side. That evening I spoke on the current state of the Senate with \nrespect to the legislative process. I spoke about how our Founding \nFathers intended the Senate to operate. I spoke on how the Senate used \nto operate, how it should operate and, sadly, how it does the opposite. \nI spoke about how the majority leader routinely files cloture on bills \nbefore debate has even begun. I spoke about how in today's Senate, in \nwhat is supposed to be the world's greatest deliberative body, the \nSenators from great States all over this Nation are shut out of the \nprocess of legislating and sometimes even debating.\n  As our side's hour of debate time neared its end, the distinguished \nchairman of our committee asked if I would yield him a few minutes of \nour time. I, of course, agreed to extend him that courtesy. I extended \nhim the courtesy even though I knew he would use that time to argue \nagainst everything I just said. I extended him the courtesy because I \nknow he would do the same for me, and, as a matter of fact, he has done \nexactly that same thing for me. That is the Senate. We are courteous to \neach other, even when we disagree.\n  As I said, that was Monday night--eight days ago. On Tuesday morning, \nwe had a series of stacked votes related to those district court \nnominees. We had several cloture votes as well as confirmation votes. I \nvoted against cloture, along with many of my colleagues. I don't \npresume to speak for my colleagues, but I voted against cloture to \nregister my objection to a process arrived at via brute force--in other \nwords, by the action of the nuclear option.\n  But the majority leader wasn't content to simply use the procedures \nhe led his caucus to adopt last November when the nuclear option was \nadopted--when the minority rights on judges were taken away. He wanted \nvoice votes rather than recorded votes on those lifetime appointments--\nand I emphasize lifetime appointments--so they deserve serious \nconsideration. At that point, I objected, and I exercised the right of \na Senator to ask for a rollcall vote of the yeas and nays.\n  I supported each of the nominees on final confirmation. Some of my \ncolleagues opposed them. But even if the votes had been unanimous, the \nright to demand a recorded vote is one of the most basic and \nfundamental rights of any Senator. There is absolutely nothing wrong \nwith exercising that right, especially when it comes to approving \nlifetime appointments to the courts.\n  Before we had that recorded vote, I took the opportunity to remind my \ncolleagues of how well this President is doing with respect to getting \nthe judges he nominates confirmed by the Senate. Specifically, thus far \nin this Congress, we have confirmed 50 of President Obama's judicial \nnominees. By way of comparison, at this point in President Bush's \nsecond term, we had only confirmed 21 judicial nominees. That is 50 for \nPresident Obama and 21 for President Bush. Those numbers\n\n[[Page S1266]]\n\ncompare both district and circuit nominations. That is a benchmark both \nsides typically use.\n  So why are Republicans blamed by Democrats for not approving judges, \nespecially when over the course of 5 years and 2 months now we have \napproved 223 judges and only disapproved two. Those are basic, \nunassailable facts.\n  In response, the majority leader described our request for recorded \nvotes, as I was speaking about eight days ago, as ``a waste of taxpayer \ntime.'' Then he concluded his brief remarks by saying this: ``I would \nsuggest to my friend the senior Senator from Iowa that he not believe \nhis own words because they are simply not true.''\n  That was on Tuesday, a week ago. Two days later, on Thursday evening, \nthe majority leader came to the floor and proffered a unanimous consent \nrequest for several district court judges. Senator Moran was on the \nfloor at the time and objected for our side. Thereafter, the majority \nleader filed cloture on four district court judges and the nominee to \nlead the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. That is a \nright the majority leader has under our rules.\n  A few minutes later the majority leader returned to the floor so he \ncould, as he described, ``say a few words about the man who does all \nthe objecting around here--or a lot of the objecting.''\n  He then proceeded to quote extensively from a speech I delivered in \n2005. He then accused me of violating senatorial courtesy during floor \nconsideration of the immigration bill because I objected to \nconsideration of amendments approved by Democrats, without assurances \nthat we would vote on amendments Members on my side thought we had a \nright to offer, as any Senator should have a right to offer amendments.\n  Even if some of the amendments the Democrats wanted had bipartisan \nsupport, I was the Senator standing up and defending the right of our \nMembers to offer amendments--even controversial amendments. To be \nclear, I was prepared to vote on any Democratic amendment provided the \nRepublican amendments were not restricted.\n  The majority leader then concluded his highly discourteous remarks by \nsaying this:\n\n       The senior Senator from Iowa is talking out of both sides \n     of his mouth, and the people of Iowa should check this out. \n     They should see what he says and what he does.\n\n  Given how inappropriate these remarks were and that they roughly \ncoincided with several other inappropriate comments the majority leader \nmade last week, I feel compelled to respond, and, of course, that is \nwhat I am doing.\n  Let me start by reviewing briefly how we arrived where we are today. \nAs I said, the majority leader quoted from a speech I delivered in \n2005. For the benefit of my colleagues who weren't here at the time, \nthat was back when the Democrats were indiscriminately filibustering a \nhost of President Bush's highly qualified nominees for the circuit \ncourts. Make no mistake. The Democrats were utilizing the filibuster on \njudges at that time to an extent never witnessed before in our Nation's \nhistory.\n  During this time, they were filibustering 10 different circuit court \nnominees. So, as I said, the majority leader quoted from a speech I \ndelivered during the debate of May 23, 2005. What he failed to mention \nis that six days earlier, on May 17, 2005, he said this on the Senate \nfloor regarding the nuclear option:\n\n       It appears that the Majority Leader--\n\n  Referring to then majority leader Senator Frist--\n\n     cannot accept any solution which does not guarantee all \n     current and future judicial nominees an up-or-down vote. That \n     result is unacceptable to me because it is inconsistent with \n     the constitutional checks and balances. It would essentially \n     eliminate the role of the Senate minority in confirming \n     judicial nominations and turn the Senate into a rubberstamp \n     for the President's choices.\n\n  I am not going to relitigate that fight today, except to say this. At \nthe time, Republicans, myself among them, were arguing that those \nnominees should be afforded an up-or-down vote. But as the quotation I \njust read demonstrates, Democrats refused. At the end of the day, our \nside lost that debate. We didn't believe judicial nominees should be \nsubjected to a 60-vote threshold nor did we believe we should play by \ntwo sets of rules. So when the roles were reversed and there was a \nDemocrat in the White House, Republicans utilized the tool as the \nDemocrats did. The only difference was that we used it much more \nsparingly. As I said, we have approved 223 Obama nominees to the courts \nand only disapproved two.\n\n  The Democrats, of course, didn't like being treated to the tactics \nthey pioneered, so they began to threaten to utilize the so-called \nnuclear option.\n  A lot of negotiations ensued between our side and the majority \nleader. That is the way the Senate most often gets things done--\nnegotiating to a consensus. Again, I am not going to review every \ndetail, but as any Member of this body can tell us, the result of those \nnegotiations was this. The minority--this time the Republicans--\nrelinquished certain rights regarding nominations. We did it by \nnegotiation.\n  For instance, district court nominations used to be subject to 30 \nhours of debate. They are now subject to only 2 hours. In exchange for \nrelinquishing those rights, the majority leader of the Senate gave his \nword that he would oppose any effort to use the nuclear option.\n  On January 27, 2011, the majority leader said this on the Senate \nfloor: ``I will oppose any effort in this Congress or the next to \nchange the Senate rules other than through regular order.''\n  Notwithstanding that promise, at the beginning of the next Congress, \nwe were, once again, on the receiving end of threats regarding the \nnuclear option. Once again, on January 24, 2013, after lots of \nnegotiations, the majority leader again gave his commitment. Here is \nwhat he said on the floor of this Chamber: ``Any other resolutions \nrelated to Senate procedure would be subject to a regular order \nprocess, including consideration by the Rules Committee.''\n  That commitment mattered. It mattered to me, and it mattered to my \ncolleagues. We as the minority relinquished certain rights. In exchange \nfor extinguishing those rights, we received a commitment from the \nmajority leader of the Senate.\n  Remember, I say to my colleagues, please: This is the Senate. Not \nonly are we courteous to one another, but we keep our word.\n  Ten months after making that commitment, on November 21, 2013, the \nmajority leader and 51 other Democrats voted to invoke the nuclear \noption. They chose to adopt a new set of procedures for confirming \njudges.\n  So that is how we got to where we are today. Yet three months later, \nwhen the minority has the audacity to insist that the majority utilize \nthe procedures they voted to adopt, the majority leader comes to the \nfloor to level an ad hominem attack.\n  Amazingly, given the commitments he made at the beginning of the last \nCongress, he accuses me of speaking out of both sides of my mouth. The \nfact of the matter is there is absolutely nothing wrong with demanding \ndebate time and rollcall votes, especially on lifetime appointments to \nthe judiciary, and especially after the majority chose to adopt these \nvery procedures just last November. That is not a ``waste of taxpayer \ntime,'' as the majority leader called it. It is representative \ngovernment. While I am on the floor of the Senate and while I am on the \nsubject of floor procedure, let me say this about the legislative \nprocess we have been following on the floor. I spoke at length on this \nsubject a week ago yesterday, just as I have on several other \noccasions. I have been highly critical of the process we follow these \ndays on the floor. But I have always tried to avoid making my \ncriticisms personal. I have always tried to be courteous. But there is \nno getting around this fact. It is nothing short of a travesty that \ngreat Senators from all over the Nation must go to the majority leader \nto ask permission to offer amendments. Proud Senators from proud \nStates, Republican Senators and Democratic Senators, conservative \nSenators, liberal Senators, northerners and southerners, appropriators \nand authorizers, hawks and doves, all of these Senators have been \nreduced to this. They are forced to come before one individual on \nbended knee to ask permission--permission--to offer an amendment. That \nis not as it should be in the world's greatest deliberative body--the \nSenate.\n\n[[Page S1267]]\n\n  So am I highly critical of the legislative process we undergo on the \nfloor? Absolutely, I am. But I didn't criticize the majority leader in \na personal or discourteous way. I didn't accuse him of ``talking out of \nboth sides of his mouth,'' as he did of this Senator. I wasn't \nattacking him personally; I was defending the rights of 99 other \nSenators as well as my own rights as a Senator.\n  What exactly is the majority leader afraid of, anyway? Taking a few \nhard votes? We are paid to take hard votes. We are sent here to \nexercise our best judgment on behalf of our constituents. That is how \nour Republic is designed.\n\n  It does not have to be that way. Consider how amendments are handled \nin the Judiciary committee, as an example--something that ought to be \nfollowed here in the U.S. Senate.\n  Our chairman--I should say the senior Senator of this body, the \nPresident pro tempore, Senator Leahy--our chairman does not tell us in \nthe minority--Republicans--or even the Democrats what we are allowed to \noffer; nor does he tell us how many amendments we are allowed to offer.\n  He controls the agenda, as you would expect a chairman to do. But we \nget to offer amendments. As a result, every single Senator of our \ncommittee--whether they like it or not--contributes to the process.\n  The chairman controls the agenda. The minority offers amendments. And \nthe majority has to vote on those amendments. That happens to be the \nprocess.\n  That is what happens when you have a chairman who respects the rights \nof U.S. Senators. There is absolutely no reason we could not do exactly \nthat same thing right here on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  Let me mention one other thing about what the majority leader said \nthe other night because I found it particularly offensive.\n  Immediately after accusing me of ``talking out of both sides of my \nmouth,'' the majority leader suggested that the people of Iowa, my \nconstituents, should pay attention to what I say and what I do. Well, \nthey do.\n  But let me relate something to my colleagues about how I keep track, \nkeep in touch with Iowans. The people of Iowa know who they elected to \nthe Senate. They know that ever since I was first sworn in in this body \nin January 1981, I have fought all day, every day, to represent them.\n  I know my constituents. They know me. I go to constituent meetings in \nevery county--every one of 99 counties--every year. Multiply that 99 by \n32 years, and you get a fairly large number. I have been in 25 counties \nso far this year. So I talk to my constituents. I read their mail. I \nknow, for instance, how hard ObamaCare has been on families in my \nState.\n  So I find it personally offensive for the majority leader to come to \nthe floor, as he did last Wednesday, and accuse Americans, including my \nconstituents, of telling lies when they share their stories about how \nObamaCare is impacting them.\n  Last Thursday evening the majority leader came to the floor so he \ncould, as he described it, ``say a few words about the man who does all \nthe objecting around here.''\n  Well, Mr. President, do I object? You bet I do. So do the rest of my \ncommittee members on the Judiciary Committee when it comes to things of \nthe Judiciary Committee; so does the rest of our caucus.\n  We object to the authoritarian way this Senate is being run. We \nobject to being shut out of the legislative process. We object to \ndismissing constituent stories of ObamaCare as lies. We object to \ntaking to the floor of the U.S. Senate to attack fellow citizens as \n``un-American'' because they have the audacity to exercise First \nAmendment rights. And, yes, we object to the discourteous ad hominem \nattacks on Senate colleagues because they choose to exercise their \nright to demand rollcall votes on lifetime appointments.\n  It should stop. The Senate should return to being the greatest \ndeliberative body in the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/04/senate-section/article/S1267-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1267-S1268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ADEGBILE NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the nomination of Debo \nAdegbile to serve as Assistant Attorney General for the Justice \nDepartment's Civil Rights Division.\n  Some Americans may vaguely recall Mumia Abu-Jamal from the ``Free \nMumia'' T-shirts and posters that once cluttered college campuses.\n  Maureen Faulkner will forever remember him as a cold-blooded cop \nkiller who left her as a widow at age 24.\n  Maureen Faulkner has endured three decades of endless appeals and a \ndishonest international campaign to turn her husband's killer into a \ncelebrated icon for some on the radical left.\n  Now one of the lawyers who helped promote that campaign, Debo \nAdegbile, has been nominated to lead the Justice Department's Civil \nRights Division. This cannot stand and I hope the Senate will not \nconfirm him.\n  Let's review the facts.\n  At 3:51 a.m. on December 9, 1981, 25-year-old police officer Daniel \nFaulkner pulled over a car in the city of Philadelphia. The car's \nheadlights were off, driving the wrong way down a one-way street.\n  The driver exited the car and began assaulting Officer Faulkner. The \ndriver's brother, Mumia Abu-Jamal, was watching from across the street. \nFour eyewitnesses saw Abu-Jamal race across the street, shoot Daniel \nFaulkner in the back, and while Officer Faulkner was lying helplessly \non the ground, Mumia Abu-Jamal shot several more bullets into \nFaulkner's chest and face.\n  Three other witnesses heard Abu-Jamal brag that he had shot Daniel \nFaulkner and hoped that Faulkner would die.\n  During the trial, when Daniel Faulkner's bloodstained shirt was \ndisplayed, the jury saw Abu-Jamal turn in his chair and smirk at \nOfficer Faulkner's young widow Maureen.\n  So it was no surprise when a Pennsylvania jury took just 3 hours to \nconvict Abu-Jamal of murder, and the next day 2 hours to sentence him \nto death.\n  Instead of allowing Daniel Faulkner's young widow to grieve in peace, \na group of political opportunists decided to use this case to further \ntheir own political agendas. They fabricated claims of racism. They \nspread lies about the trial and the evidence. They organized rallies \nthat, amazingly, portrayed Mumia Abu-Jamal as the victim.\n  Before long, Abu-Jamal was a cause celebre, complete with adoring \nHollywood celebrities, ``Free Mumia'' T-shirts and posters. He had his \nown HBO special, and they even named a street after him in Paris.\n  In 2009, 27 years after Daniel Faulkner's murder, the NAACP Legal \nDefense Fund, or LDF, decided they would join the fray.\n  For decades before Mr. Adegbile assumed his leadership role in the \nLDF, the LDF served as a force for truth and justice for all \nAmericans--a very important and well-deserved reputation for having \ndone that. But, unfortunately, LDF's representation of Abu-Jamal \npromoted neither truth nor justice.\n  It is important to point out this is not a case about every accused \nperson deserving a legal defense. That is a principle upon which I hope \nthere is no disagreement, certainly not from me. The fact is, though, \nAbu-Jamal had multiple high-cost lawyers already volunteering their \ntime.\n  Mr. Adegbile was director of litigation for the LDF. He told the \nSenate Judiciary Committee that he ``supervised the entire legal \nstaff'' at LDF--18 lawyers. Also, he was, in the words of the LDF's own \nWeb site, responsible for LDF's advocacy ``both in the courts of law \nand in the court of public opinion.''\n  This is important to understand because this duty to supervise has \nvery specific implications for lawyers. A lawyer must confirm that the \nlawyers he oversees are honest while presenting facts in a case. The \nlaw backs this up. Supervising lawyers can be sued for malpractice or \nsanctioned by a court for the actions of the lawyers he or she \nsupervises.\n  And how did the LDF's lawyers comport themselves under Mr. Adegbile's\n\n[[Page S1268]]\n\ndirection and leadership and supervision? Well, under Mr. Adegbile's \noversight, LDF lawyers promoted the pernicious myth that Abu-Jamal was \nan innocent man and that he was framed because of his race.\n  There was never any merit to the claims of racism. That was a \nconclusion that was investigated and reached by both State and Federal \ncourts.\n  In fact, the jury that convicted and sentenced Abu-Jamal to death \nincluded two African Americans and would have included one more except \nthat Abu-Jamal himself ordered his lawyer not to seat that third juror.\n  Yet, in February of 2011, Mr. Adegbile's group issued a press release \nstating that ``Mumia Abu-Jamal's conviction and death sentence are \nrelics of a time and place that was notorious for police abuse and \nracial discrimination.''\n  In May of 2011, two of the lawyers supervised by Mr. Adegbile \ntraveled to France. They went there for a rally on behalf of Mumia Abu-\nJamal.\n  One LDF lawyer said she was ``overjoyed'' that Abu-Jamal's death \nsentence was suspended, but she bemoaned the fact that Abu-Jamal would \nnot have a new trial and so could not be set free.\n  The other LDF lawyer described Abu-Jamal as one of the ``people who \nare innocent'' but ``will continue to be put to death in America.''\n  At another event in New York City that same year, a lawyer working \nfor Mr. Adegbile gushed, ``It is absolutely my honor to represent Mumia \nAbu-Jamal.'' She continued: ``there is no question in my mind, there is \nno question in the mind of anyone at the Legal Defense Fund, that the \njustice system has completely and utterly failed Mumia Abu-Jamal'' and \nthat failure ``has everything to do with race.''\n  I agree that the justice system has failed. But it has failed Officer \nDanny Faulkner and his family.\n  No one understands this story of injustice better than Officer Danny \nFaulkner's widow Maureen. Maureen Faulkner pleaded with the Senate \nJudiciary Committee for a chance to tell her story, for a chance to \ntestify before the committee as they were deliberating the candidacy of \nMr. Adegbile. But the Senate Democrats on the committee would not allow \nher to testify. They did not let her tell her story and, instead, they \nvoted to send his name on to the Senate floor for confirmation.\n  I think Maureen Faulkner has a right to be heard. So I hope my \ncolleagues will listen as I read a letter she wrote addressing all of \nus:\n\n       Dear Senators,\n       While I would have preferred to do so personally, I'm \n     writing this letter appealing to your sense of right and \n     wrong, good and evil as you consider the nomination of Debo \n     Adegbile to be the next head of the Civil Rights Division of \n     the Department of Justice.\n       33 years ago my husband, Philadelphia Officer Daniel \n     Faulkner, was violently murdered by a self-professed \n     ``revolutionary'' named Mumia Abu-Jamal. I was 24 years old. \n     While most of my friends spent their summer at the Jersey \n     Shore, I sat in a hot steamy courtroom and watched in horror \n     and disbelief as the man who murdered my husband tried to \n     turn the courtroom into a political stage where he could spew \n     his hatred and contempt for this country and our judicial \n     system.\n       At the moment my husband's blood stained shirt was \n     displayed by the evidence handler, Mumia Abu-Jamal turned in \n     his chair and smirked at me; demonstrating his contempt for \n     law enforcement. Thankfully, a racially mixed jury that was \n     selected by Abu-Jamal while representing himself, found him \n     guilty. The following day they sentenced him to death for the \n     brutal act he committed.\n       That's when my second nightmare began. For three decades, \n     my family and I endured appeal after appeal--each rooted in \n     lies, distortions and allegations of civil rights violations. \n     And year after year, judge after judge, the conviction and \n     sentence were unanimously upheld. Then, thirty years after \n     the fact, my family, society and I were denied justice when \n     three Federal District Court judges who have found error in \n     every capital case that has come before them overturned the \n     death sentence.\n       Today, as my husband lies thirty three years in the grave, \n     his killer has become a wealthy celebrity. He pens books and \n     social commentaries critical of our country. He regularly \n     uses his nearly unlimited access to the prison telephone to \n     do radio programs, has cable TV in his cell and is permitted \n     to hold his wife, children and grandchildren in his arms when \n     they visit.\n       Old wounds have once again been ripped open and additional \n     insult is brought upon our law enforcement community in this \n     country by President Obama's nomination of Debo Adegbile. \n     While publicly demonstrating that he doesn't even know my \n     husband's name, Mr. Adegbile fains sympathy and caring for my \n     family and me.\n       In reality, Mr. Adegbile was a willing and enthusiastic \n     accomplish in Mumia Abu-Jamal's bid to cheat us of the \n     justice we had waited so many years for. Mr. Adegbile freely \n     chose to throw the weight of his organization behind Mumia \n     Abu-Jamal and he has publicly stated that he would get Mumia \n     Abu-Jamal off death row.\n       Mr. Adegbile holds Mumia Abu-Jamal, a remorseless \n     unrepentant cop killer, in high esteem. We know this because \n     attorneys working under Mr. Adegbile's supervision have stood \n     before public rallies held in support of my husband's killer \n     and openly professed that it was ``an extreme honor'' to \n     represent the man who put a hollow based bullet into my \n     husband's brain as he lay on the ground, wounded, unarmed and \n     defenseless. And while Mr. Adegbile and those who support his \n     nomination will undoubtedly argue that he did not personally \n     make such statements, he did nothing to counter or stop them.\n       In the end, like so many attorneys before him, Mr. \n     Adegbile's allegations of civil rights abuse rang hollow. \n     Mumia Abu-Jamal's death sentence was overturned not because \n     of civil right abuse as alleged by Mr. Adegbile, but because \n     three judges with a personal dislike for capital punishment \n     conveniently determined that the wording in a standard form \n     given to the jury might have confused them.\n       While Debo Adegbile may be a well qualified and competent \n     litigator, through his words, his decisions and his actions, \n     he has clearly and repeatedly demonstrated that he is not the \n     best person to fill this important position. Certainly there \n     are others with similar qualifications that would be better \n     choices. I would argue that Mr. Adegbile's decision to defend \n     a cop killer should preclude him from holding any public \n     position.\n       Your decision means a lot to me personally. The thought \n     that Mr. Adegbile would be rewarded, in part, for the work he \n     did for my husband's killer is revolting.\n       Throughout my long ordeal I have frequently been labeled a \n     racist by many who support my husband's killer simply because \n     he is black and I white. I have also been asked to throw my \n     name, my voice and my support behind political candidates \n     from both parties. In each case I have declined. I have \n     always believed that my husband's death and my quest for \n     justice transcends politics and race.\n       From my heart, I'm asking you to do the same thing. Set \n     aside any partisan feelings you have and do the right thing \n     today when you vote on Mr. Adegbile's confirmation. Please \n     spare my family and me from further pain.\n       Sincerely, Maureen Faulkner.\n\n  As the Justice Department's Web site explains, the Civil Rights \nDivision of the Justice Department ``fulfills a critical mission in \nupholding the civil and constitutional rights of all individuals.'' \nClearly, this requires that the head of the Civil Rights Division have \nan absolute commitment to truth and justice. There are many highly \nqualified Americans who can carry out this critical mission. Mr. \nAdegbile's record creates serious doubts that he is among them. For \nthese reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose the nomination of Mr. \nDebo Adegbile to serve as Assistant Attorney General for the Justice \nDepartment's Civil Rights Division.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am here now for the 60th time to ask \nmy colleagues to wake up to the threats of climate change. To see the \ndamage that is being caused by our shifting climate, we need look no \nfurther than the Winter Olympics. The most recent Winter Olympics \nconcluded last month. Over 200 countries broadcast the event to an \nestimated 3.8 billion people worldwide. In Rhode Island, we rooted for \nour very own Marissa Castelli, who brought home a bronze medal in pairs \nfigure skating.\n  But what does the future hold for the Winter Olympics? As global \ntemperatures rise and weather patterns shift, the world's glaciers are \nreceding and snowpack in traditionally snowy regions is declining.\n  A report from the University of Waterloo found that February daytime \nhigh temperatures during the Winter Games have been steadily increasing \nfrom the 1920s and the 1950s to the 21st century. This forced the \nInternational\n\n[[Page S1269]]\n\nOlympic Committee to take drastic measures to ensure adequate \nconditions: ramping up the use of snow-making machines and physically \ntransferring large amounts of snow to the site of the games.\n  This is just the beginning of things to come. If our emissions are \nleft unchecked, as the Republicans and the polluters prefer, the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports we will likely see \nwarming between 4.7 and 8.6 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the \ncentury. The Waterloo report found that only 10 of the 19 cities to \npreviously host the Winter Olympics would be cold enough to host the \ngames by the 2080s. There could be no Sochi Olympics, no Vancouver or \nSquaw Valley or Sarajevo Olympics, and that is if we are able to \nstabilize and ultimately reduce our global carbon emissions before the \nyear 2100. If carbon pollution continues on the current pace, only six \nof these cities could host the games. Forget about Torino and Nagano, \nLake Placid and Lillehammer.\n  Over 100 Olympic athletes from 10 different countries signed a letter \nasking world leaders to take action to curb climate change. They said:\n\n       As winter Olympic athletes, our lives revolve around the \n     winter and if climate change continues at this pace, the \n     economies of the small towns where we live and train will be \n     ruined. Our sports will be forever changed and the winter \n     Olympics as we know it will be a thing of the past.\n\n  Much as we all love the Winter Olympics, we could do without them. We \ncannot very well do without freshwater. Glaciers represent the largest \nreserves of freshwater on Earth. Their freshwater feeds our rivers and \nstreams, waters our farms and ranches, and provides some of our \ndrinking water. Glacier loss is happening all over the world, including \nright here in the United States.\n  Just like atmospheric warming, ocean acidification, and sea-level \nrise, this evidence of climate change is not a theoretical projection. \nIt is not a complex scientific model. It is simply observation and \nmeasurement.\n  This is Grinnell Glacier in Montana's Glacier National Park. On top \nwe see the glacier in 1940. On the bottom is the same spot in 2004. \nGrinnell Glacier has lost 90 percent of its ice in the last century. \nThe glacier has almost disappeared or, as the U.S. Geological Survey \nputs it, ``effects of global climate change are strikingly clear.'' The \nU.S. Geological Survey further explains:\n\n       Glacier recession is underway, and many glaciers have \n     already disappeared. The retreat of these small alpine \n     glaciers reflects changes in recent climate as glaciers \n     respond to altered temperature and precipitation. It has been \n     estimated that there were approximately 150 glaciers present \n     in 1850 and most glaciers were still present in 1910 when the \n     park was established. In 2010 we considered there to be only \n     twenty-five glaciers larger than twenty-five acres remaining \n     in Glacier National Park.\n\n  So there were 150 glaciers 100 years ago, 25 now.\n  Here we see a similar change at Lillian Glacier in Washington's \nOlympic National Park. On the top we see a large healthy glacier in \n1905, and this almost unrecognizable view of the same landscape in \n2010.\n  Of course, this is not just happening in the United States. Countries \nacross the world are seeing rapid glacier loss.\n  A 2013 article published in Nature found clear evidence that the \nTibetan glaciers--the world's third largest ice reservoir behind \nAntarctica and Greenland--are shrinking, even at altitudes above 20,000 \nfeet.\n  South America's Andean glaciers are retreating at an amazing rate. \nClimatologists from Ohio State University and NASA loaned my office a \npiece of a plant that had been preserved under the Quelccaya icecap in \nPeru for at least 5,200 years, a little bitty piece of plant. But under \nthe pressure of the ice and the cold, it had been preserved for 52 \ncenturies. Today, due to glacial retreat, it was exposed and I now have \nthat piece of plant in my office.\n  Glaciers are some of the largest reservoirs of fresh matter on Earth. \nAccording to the U.S. Geological Survey, glaciers store 69 percent of \nthe world's fresh water. Annual spring glacial melt provides a \ndependable source of water for streams, plants, spawning fish, farming, \nand now often hydroelectricity. In Central Asia hundreds of millions of \npeople rely on the Tibetan glaciers to supply drinking water. The same \ngoes for the people of Peru and Bolivia in the Andes.\n  This is a crisis we must take seriously. Unfortunately, Congress \nremains barricaded behind a blockade of polluter influence. Only last \nweek a Republican witness at an Environment and Public Works hearing on \nadapting to climate change argued that we would all be better off if \nthe glaciers just went away--if they just melted away. After all, he \ntold the committee:\n\n       We evolved at the equator in a climate where freezing \n     weather did not exist. . . . It could be said that frost and \n     ice are the enemies of life.\n\n  He continued:\n\n       Obviously if the glaciers stop melting, there will be no \n     more meltwater from them. So my questions . . . are, Are you \n     saying you want the glaciers to stop melting? Then where \n     would the irrigation water come from? . . . I say let the \n     glaciers melt.\n\n  That is the witness the Republicans put up. Let the glaciers melt.\n  I guess he missed the difference between seasonal melting, whose \nannual rhythms fill our streams and rivers for drinking water, fishing \nand farming, and glaciers outright melting away.\n  There is another little trick the deniers like to play when it is \nwintertime. Every time there is a cold snap or a little snow falls in \nWashington, DC, or back in their home States, they say: How can there \nbe global warming when it is cold out? And, yes, we have had a cold \nwinter. But what scientists and other level-headed observers understand \nis the changes occurring in the climate are happening over longer \nperiods than just one winter and across broader regions than only one \nState or even the United States. Moreover, short-term temperature \nanomalies such as a cold snap might be worse because of climate change, \nbecause of changes in the jetstream, for instance. This chart shows how \nworldwide winter temperatures every year since 1880 compare with the \n20th century average.\n  Do you think there is a trend visible there? Over 100 years, yes, \nwinter is still cold, but it is not as cold as it used to be. This \nchange is ravaging winter sports and tourism across the United States. \nThe National Resources Defense Council found that between 1999 and \n2010, a lack of snowfall cost our ski industry $1 billion and up to \n27,000 jobs. Before the end of the century, the number of economically \nviable ski locations in New Hampshire and Maine will be cut in half. \nSkiing in New York will be cut by three-quarters and, the report says, \nthere will be no ski area in Connecticut or Massachusetts. If we know \nour geography, we know if that is true of Connecticut and \nMassachusetts, there goes Rhode Island's Yawgoo Valley ski area and \nslope.\n  The Bicameral Task Force on Climate Change, which I started with \nRepresentative Henry Waxman, asked the National Basketball Association, \nMajor League Baseball, National Hockey League, National Football \nLeague, and the United States Olympic Committee, to tell us what \nclimate change means for their sports.\n  National Hockey League Deputy Commissioner William Daly wrote:\n\n       Hockey's relationship with the environment is unique. Our \n     sport was born on frozen ponds, where--to this day--players \n     of all ages and skill levels learn to skate. For this \n     magnificent tradition to continue, it is imperative that we \n     recognize the importance of maintaining the environment.\n\n  The Park City Foundation in Utah predicts an annual local temperature \nincrease of 6.8 degrees Fahrenheit by 2075, which could cause a \ncomplete loss of snowpack in the lower Park City resort area of the \nRocky Mountains. The foundation estimates that this will result in \nthousands of lost jobs, tens of millions in lost earnings, and hundreds \nof millions in lost economic growth.\n  While we in Congress equivocate and stall, the evidence of climate \nchange relentlessly mounts. The damage is being done in our atmosphere \nand our oceans. The longer it takes us to wake up, the harder and more \nexpensive it will be to fix it.\n  The sickening part is that everyone else is waking up. Sixty-five \npercent of voters support the President taking significant steps to \naddress climate change now. Another poll found that 82 percent of \nAmericans believe we should start preparing now for rising sea levels \nand severe storms from climate change.\n\n[[Page S1270]]\n\n  Even in the party that won't speak the words ``climate change'' any \nlonger--not since Citizens United cleared the way for big spending by \npolluters in Republican primaries--even in the Republican Party, among \nyoung Republican voters 35 and under, the majority of them feel that \nclimate denial is either ignorant, out of touch, or crazy. If that is \nwhat young Republicans feel, that is a very poor foundation for the \nRepublican Party to maintain this denier policy.\n  The campaign of money and denial that imprisons Congress is as \npoisonous to our American democracy as carbon pollution is to our \natmosphere, oceans and, yes, glaciers. It is time to fight back. It is \ntime to wake up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

According to the FBI, in 2012, 95 law \nenforcement officers were killed in line-of-duty incidents and 52,901 \nofficers were victims of line-of-duty assaults--52,901.\n  The New York Times in 2012 observed: ``As violent crime has decreased \nacross the country, a disturbing trend has emerged: rising numbers of \npolice officers are being killed.''\n  In 2008, 41 officers were killed; in 2009, 48 officers were killed; \nin 2010, 56 officers were killed; in 2011, 72 officers were killed; and \nin 2012, 95 officers were killed.\n  Unfortunately, as Byron York noted today, the New York Times has not \nreported on the controversial nomination of Debo Adegbile to head the \nDOJ Civil Rights Division.\n  It is out of respect for all of our Nation's police officers that I \nrise to oppose Mr. Adegbile's nomination. Under Adegbile's leadership \nand supervision, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund brazenly politicized the \nmurder of a Philadelphia police officer, Officer Daniel Faulkner. On \nDecember 9, 1981, 25-year-old Officer Faulkner was murdered by Wesley \nCook, who is widely known as Mumia Abu-Jamal. Officer Faulkner was shot \nseveral times. The fatal shot was when Abu-Jamal pointed the gun inches \nfrom Officer Faulkner's face and pulled the trigger.\n  During the trial it was made known that Abu-Jamal was a supporter of \nthe MOVE Organization, an anarchist group that explicitly advocates for \nviolence against police officers.\n  In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mrs. Faulkner \ndescribed that during the trial, when her husband's bloodstained shirt \nwas displayed by the evidence handler, Abu-Jamal turned in his chair \nand smirked directly at her, the grieving widow. The jury convened for \na matter of hours before they came back with a guilty verdict and a \ndeath sentence. That was 1982.\n  Fast forward 27 years to the year 2009. Adegbile was at the time the \nNAACP's Legal Defense Fund Director of Litigation. In 2009, the Legal \nDefend Fund began advocating for Abu-Jamal--first as an amicus and then \nas cocounsel. To be clear, every criminal defendant is entitled to an \nattorney, but Adegbile's representation of Abu-Jamal was pure advocacy.\n  Abu-Jamal's guilt was not in doubt. Four eyewitnesses saw the \nshooting. Abu-Jamal confessed and stated in front of three witnesses \nthat he hoped Officer Faulkner died.\n  There was significant ballistic and forensic evidence. For example, \nthe murder weapon was registered to Abu-Jamal and found at the scene \nwith spent shell casings.\n  Abu-Jamal already had a team of high-priced lawyers working pro bono, \nwho had filed decades of post-trial petitions and appeals, delaying the \ncarrying out of his sentence.\n  Under Adegbile's supervision, LDF lawyers fanned the flames of racial \ntension. Through rallies, protests, and a media campaign, all portrayed \nMumia Abu-Jamal, an unrepentant cop killer, as a political prisoner.\n  For example, a 2011 LDF press release said: ``Abu-Jamal . . . is \nwidely viewed as a symbol of the racial injustices of the death \npenalty.''\n  That press release also said: ``Mumia Abu-Jamal's conviction and \ndeath sentence are relics of a time and place that was notorious for \npolice abuse and racial discrimination.''\n  LDF lawyers under Adegbile's supervision went farther than that. They \nheld rallies and protests.\n  This is advocacy. This is political advocacy. This is extreme and \nradical advocacy. This is not legal representation. They even went so \nfar as to travel to France to hold multiple rallies for Abu-Jamal. The \nFrench had already named a street after Abu-Jamal in a suburb of Paris.\n  This prompted the House of Representatives in 2006 to vote 368-31 to \ncondemn the murder of Officer Daniel Faulkner and to urge the French \ntown to change that street name.\n  After fanning those flames of racial tension in the court of public \nopinion, Adegbile pressed aggressive arguments on race in our courts of \nlaw. Thankfully, the State and Federal courts rejected those arguments.\n  Under Adegbile, the LDF initially argued in court that Abu-Jamal's \ndeath sentence should be overturned because he believed there should \nhave been more African Americans on Abu-Jamal's jury.\n  During his Senate confirmation on January 8, Adegbile said the LDF \nfiled a legal brief regarding merely jury instructions about the death \npenalty. LDF did make those arguments eventually, but Adegbile's \ninitial arguments had nothing to do with jury instructions. They were \narguments that Abu-Jamal's jury was unconstitutional because it didn't \nhave, he argued, a sufficient number of African Americans serving in \nthe jury.\n  The courts rejected those arguments. The jury that convicted Abu-\nJamal had two African Americans serving on it. It would have had a \nthird African American serving on it but Abu-Jamal instructed his \nlawyers to strike that person.\n  The Fraternal Order of Police vehemently opposes this nomination. \nAccording to a letter written by the president of the FOP, Adegbile's \nnomination only exacerbates the ``growing division and distrust'' \ntoward local law enforcement agencies--a trend that has continued from \nthe time now-Labor Secretary Thomas Perez was leading the Department of \nJustice's Civil Rights Division.\n  Peter Kirsanow, a member on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, \nwrote:\n\n       Responsible people should agree that going out of your way \n     to defend a convicted cop-killer long after it has become \n     unequivocally clear that he was guilty and had suffered no \n     violation of his civil rights disqualifies one from serving \n     as the head of a division of the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\n  The Obama administration's message with the nomination is clear: It \nwants even more politicization of the Department of Justice. This is \ninsulting to law enforcement officers everywhere. I stand with the \nFraternal Order of Police and oppose Adegbile's nomination, and I urge \nmy Democratic colleagues to join the Democratic senior Senator from \nPennsylvania, Mr. Bob Casey, and vote no on this nomination.\n  This is not a matter of leftwing or rightwing. We all should agree \nthat violent criminals should be punished, and we all should agree that \nthose who go out of their way to advocate for, to celebrate, to lionize \nconvicted cop killers are not suitable for major leadership roles at \nthe U.S. Department of Justice.\n  I urge every Member of this body to oppose that nomination.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FLAKE. I rise to discuss the nomination of Mr. Debo Adegbile to\n\n[[Page S1271]]\n\nhead the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice.\n  I attended Mr. Adegbile's hearing in the Judiciary Committee and \nsubmitted additional written questions after the hearing. \nUnfortunately, after hearing testimony and reviewing his responses to \nquestions, I remain concerned with Mr. Adegbile's ability to set aside \nmore than a decade of advocacy on behalf of this and other liberal \ncauses to serve as a neutral enforcer of our Nation's civil rights \nlaws. And it appears I am not the only person who has reached this \nconclusion.\n  His nomination is opposed by numerous law enforcement officers, \nincluding those represented by the Fraternal Order of Police, National \nSheriff's Association, the Major County Sheriffs' Association, the \nNational Association of Police Organizations, the New Jersey State \nPoliceman's Benevolent Association, and the National Narcotics \nOfficers' Association.\n  This widespread opposition is clearly not driven by partisanship but \nby a heartfelt concern that this nominee is not suited for the \nposition.\n  I have no doubt Mr. Adegbile is an intelligent and hardworking lawyer \nwith a commendable record of advocacy, but that does not mean he should \nhead the Civil Rights Division.\n  One of the responsibilities of the Department of Justice's Civil \nRights Division is to handle civil rights violations by law enforcement \nofficers from across the country. However, serious questions have been \nraised about Mr. Adegbile's ability to apply the law fairly in these \ncases, given his advocacy on behalf of a convicted cop killer.\n  As the Fraternal Order of Police stated in its letter of opposition, \nin the decades Mr. Adegbile pushed this effort, he ``falsely disparaged \nand savaged the good name and reputation of a lifeless police officer'' \nin order to further his case.\n  The National Narcotics Association shares this analysis of Mr. \nAdegbile's advocacy, noting that he:\n\n       . . . fabricated a baseless and unproven defense while also \n     defaming the victim, Police Officer Daniel Faulkner, which \n     raises serious questions about the nominee's judgment, \n     especially considering the important position to which he has \n     been nominated.\n\n  There is no doubt as to Mumia Abu-Jamal's guilt. Afterward, he \nbragged about shooting Daniel Faulkner, and four witnesses saw the \nshooting. After being convicted and sentenced, Mumia's lawyers filed \ndozens of appeals on his behalf, which would suggest he had more than \nadequate legal representation. However, almost 28 years after his \nconviction, Mr. Adegbile decided to volunteer his time to assist Mumia. \nIn a series of appeals and press events, Mr. Adegbile's organization \ncalled into question the motivations of the law enforcement officers \nresponsible for Mumia's conviction and distorted the record, calling \nhis conviction and sentence a ``relic of a time and place that was \nnotorious for police abuse and racial discrimination.''\n  As the Philadelphia district attorney's opposition letter states, Mr. \nAdegbile's work on this case ``sends a message of contempt to police \nofficers who risk their lives every day to maintain the peace.''\n  The district attorney concluded that Mr. Adegbile ``is ill-suited for \na pivotal role in the Justice Department.''\n  The appalling facts of this case are well known. In fact, in 2006, \nthe House of Representatives passed a resolution condemning the history \nof this case and recognizing the culpability of Mumia by a vote of 368 \nto 31. There are others, such as myself, now serving in this Chamber \nwho voted in favor of that resolution.\n  It is deeply troubling that we are faced with voting on this nominee \nnow, after Senate rules have been broken and the minority has no say in \nexecutive or judicial nominations. Requiring the support of at least \nsome minority Senators discourages both the nomination and appointment \nof fringe or problematic nominees, something which benefits the country \nas a whole. Those rules ensure the Senate was the cooling saucer that \nGeorge Washington and the other Founders intended. They also ensured \nheads of executive agencies were responsive to both the majority and \nminority parties. That is no longer the case.\n  I do not think we would be moving forward on such a divisive \nnominee--one who elicits widespread opposition from across the \npolitical spectrum--if the majority had not employed the nuclear option \nlast November. I hope we don't move forward with this nomination. I \nhope my colleagues will join me and others in voicing opposition to \nthis nomination moving ahead.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call be \nrescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \njoin me in opposing the nomination of Debo Adegbile to head the Civil \nRights Division of the Department of Justice.\n  The Constitution grants to the President the power to nominate \nindividuals to head the various Federal agencies and departments, but \nit falls to us in the Senate to ensure those nominees are worthy of the \nhonor and are ready for such responsibility. I don't make it a practice \nof opposing nominees. In fact, I generally give the President \ndiscretion there. I have voted to give him wide latitude in filling the \nexecutive branch with individuals of his choice when I believe they are \nqualified. I have voted along with the minority Republicans who \nendorsed and confirmed a number of the President's nominees. But when \nit comes to a nominee who lacks the essential qualifications to fill \none of these high offices, those of us charged with providing advice \nand consent cannot remain silent. Unfortunately, this is one of those \ncases.\n  It takes more than a law degree from a prestigious school and an \nimpressive resume to head an agency to support the Civil Rights \nDivision at the Department of Justice. Most importantly, I think it \ntakes judgment which cannot be measured by test scores or diplomas. It \ncan only be measured over time through someone's actions.\n  If we look at Mr. Adegbile's record, it is obvious to me and so many \nof us in the Senate and around the country, including the Fraternal \nOrder of Police, who have not opposed an executive branch nomination, \nby the way, in 17 years, who are taking a strong stand against this \nconfirmation.\n  First, as some of his colleagues and my colleagues on the Senate \nfloor have noted, Mr. Adegbile has a history of taking positions on \nsome of our fundamental constitutional rights that I think are out of \nstep with the views of the American people, the judgments of our \njudiciary, and our Nation's history.\n  In the case of Hosanna-Tabor v. EEOC, Mr. Adegbile argued that \nreligious institutions do not have the right to hire or fire \nindividuals responsible for conveying a church's teachings, a view \nthat, were it to become law, would severely undermine religious \nliberty. Mr. Adegbile was so out of step with the Constitution on that \nissue that his view was rejected by the Supreme Court 9-0, which in \ntoday's typical 5-4 split in the Supreme Court is quite an \naccomplishment.\n  Mr. Adegbile's view on the First Amendment is troubling. So too are \nhis views of the Second Amendment. He has repeatedly asserted that the \nSecond Amendment does not ``protect an individual's right to keep and \nbear arms.'' If Mr. Adegbile had his way, millions of Americans would \nlose one of their most cherished rights, just like that. Whenever a \npiece of gun control legislation comes to the floor of this Chamber, my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle--and, in fact, my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle--assure us they will always respect a \nfundamental right to bear arms. It is unfortunate that despite the \nwords of the Constitution and its interpretation by the Supreme Court, \nMr. Adegbile cannot give us those same assurances.\n  There is the case of Mumia Abu-Jamal. Abu-Jamal is a murderer. In \n1981 he gunned down a police officer named Daniel Faulkner on a \nPhiladelphia street. In an act of unmatched brutality, Mumia Abu-Jamal \nstood over Officer Faulkner as he lay dying and shot him in the face. A \nmountain of evidence from eyewitness accounts, forensics, to his own \nwords makes it clear beyond any doubt that Abu-Jamal killed Officer \nFaulkner on that day in December 1981.\n\n[[Page S1272]]\n\n  Still, Abu-Jamal deserved his day in court as would any other \nAmerican accused of a crime. He got his day in court. He deserved \ncompetent counsel, and he got that too. He deserved an opportunity to \nappeal, and he got it. In fact, after the matter turned from a criminal \nmatter to an issue of justice and to a political cause, he received \nsome of the best counsel in the country and they filed appeal after \nappeal, all of which were rejected.\n  But that didn't stop Mr. Adegbile from claiming that Abu-Jamal was a \nvictim of racism and a corrupt judicial system. For Mr. Adegbile, Abu-\nJamal's case was apparently an opportunity to focus more on a political \nagenda than the case at hand. Abu-Jamal's guilt or innocence was not \nreally the concern.\n  Debo Adegbile is free to make any arguments he sees fit about the \nFirst and Second Amendments. He is free to turn the murder of a police \nofficer into a cause to advance a political agenda. When he does so, I \nthink it says something about his judgment and it says something about \nhis fitness to lead the Civil Rights Division of the Department of \nJustice.\n\n  The Department of Justice and police forces around our country should \nbe working together to ensure that minority rights are respected and \nthat civil rights abuses are punished. In my view, this nominee would \nonly make that work more difficult. As the Fraternal Order of Police \nwrote in a letter to President Obama, if Mr. Adegbile is confirmed it \nwill serve to ``exacerbate growing division and distrust'' between the \nCivil Rights Division--which is charged with securing our most basic \nfreedoms--and the men and women of law enforcement who defend those \nfreedoms by putting their lives on the line every day.\n  I think we can and should do better with a nominee who can work with \nthe Fraternal Order of Police and other law enforcement around the \ncountry in ensuring that our most basic freedoms are secured through \nthe Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division.\n  For these reasons I oppose the nomination of Mr. Adegbile to this \nposition, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the \nsame.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/04/senate-section/article/S1272-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1272-S1273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             UKRAINE CRISIS\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I have been discussing the Ukraine crisis \nwith my constituents and a number of Indiana media outlets for the last \nfew days. Virtually every interview or conversation on the subject \nincludes this question: What difference does this make to us here in \nIndiana? What American interests are at stake? These are legitimate \nquestions, and they deserve an answer because before we commit America \nto address potential conflicts, we need to describe and define just \nwhat our interest is and why we should be engaged.\n  In this conflict we are not talking about the use of military force, \nbut we are thinking about and talking about and should be examining \nother measures that can influence the outcome of a crisis situation \nthat could have significant consequences for the American people.\n  If we can't answer that question and we can't address that with a \ncompelling answer, then we should not get engaged. But if we can \ndetermine a compelling answer and reason why we should engage in some \nform, then we need to make sure the American people know why it is we \nare renewing this and why this is important.\n  Ukraine is 5,000 miles away. The trade between our two countries is \nminuscule and shrinking. Only 30 percent of the Ukrainian population \nshares our Christian faith or identifies with any faith. Ukraine is the \nsource of no energy or crucial materials. Indeed, the country is a \nsource of instability and corruption. So why should Americans and \nHoosiers care about what is happening to a country 5,000 miles away? \nWell, let me suggest some reasons and then perhaps some suggestions as \nto what would be the best way for us to help influence this crisis \nsituation in a way that is positive for our country and, frankly, for \nWestern democracy and for the world.\n  The first and most obvious reason we should take this seriously is \nthe central lesson of history: Conflicts--even catastrophes--sometimes \ngrow from small beginnings. Most know that the assassination of an \nimperial relative in a Balkan town in 1914 led to the death by violence \nof 37 million people--World War I. We also know that the cataclysm of \nWorld War II began with the stealth invasion of Austria and \nCzechoslovakia in 1938. Despite warnings as to what this might lead to, \nwe saw a tragic loss of tens of millions of people in World War II. \nThis is eerily reminiscent of Russia's moves on Crimea last week.\n  A history lesson closer in time is taught by the Balkan wars of the \n1990s. When Serb gunboats shelled Dubrovnik, a Croatian city, in 1992, \nthe world--and most especially Croatia's European neighbors--did \nexactly nothing. Our own Secretary of State said repeatedly that there \nwere no American interests at stake. Before that view was changed and \nNATO eventually intervened 3 years later, more than 100,000 people had \nbeen slaughtered.\n  If the international community had had the collective wisdom and \nleadership--and, frankly, courage and guts--to simply tell Belgrade \nthat civilian European population centers are no longer shelled in \nmodern Europe, all of that suffering could have been prevented and our \nown Armed Forces could have stayed in their barracks and in their \nhomes.\n  We should draw from such lessons so that we need not confront later \nthe question of whether we should intervene militarily in a Ukrainian \ncivil war or a war between Ukraine and Russia. Instead, we must \nconfront now the choice we have of doing nothing and letting Putin have \nhis way or leading an American and an international response to impose \npenalties on Putin's Russia so that he comes to his senses.\n  A second and related American interest is in the stability of the \nEuropean continent itself. Ukraine is not an obscure sideshow. It is \ncomprised of remnants of two European empires and deeply embedded in \nthe integrated structure, identity, economy, and culture of Europe as a \nwhole. Disaster there threatens a very great deal in Europe, a \ncontinent we have spent 100 years, trillions of dollars, and hundreds \nof thousands of lives to stabilize. European security and stability \nhave been at the very heart of our foreign and defense policy for an \nentire century. If American foreign policy and American strategic \ninterests in the world have any permanent core, it is that interest in \nEurope's well-being.\n  Ukraine's conflict with the remnants of Soviet-style aggression \nportends serious threats to the rest of Russia's border lands, nearly \nall of which were long dominated by Red Army presence and force. The \nBaltic states must be alarmed right now. If we do nothing, they could \npanic.\n  Poland has already summoned NATO councils to consider consequences \nfor its own security and therefore for the security of the alliance. \nGeorgia painfully reflects that the paltry international response to \nits own war with Russia five years ago surely emboldened Putin in this \nlatest adventure.\n\n  In other words, we could be looking at a Sudetenland moment. We hope \nthat is not the case.\n  It is no secret that Putin has imperial ambitions motivated by his \npathological insecurities and a quest to restore lost glories. These \nare dangerous delusions that, if not confronted firmly, could come to \nthreaten us all.\n  Beyond history and beyond the threats to continental security \ninstability, I am even more concerned about America's place in the \nworld and how inaction will further harm it. Abroad, we are \nincreasingly seen as a spent force, exhausted by interminable wars, \npolitically divided and inert, financially strained, and floundering \nwithout firm, articulate, determined leadership. This is a bleak, \nincomplete picture of my country that more than anything else makes me \ndetermined to be part of an effort to correct this perception of \nAmerica.\n  In many ways, we can potentially look at the Ukrainian crisis as an \nopportunity. We have a chance now to summon our collective will and \nimpose costs for Putin's irresponsible behavior. We have many robust \ncapabilities to reward those who join us in responsible, mutually \nproductive cooperation in managing world affairs and in punishing those \nwho do not.\n\n[[Page S1273]]\n\n  This is the moment to demonstrate our return to the leadership role \nthat the realities of this harsh world have long imposed upon us. This \nsituation, this crisis which we now face in Ukraine, can be a moment to \ndemonstrate our return to a leadership role desperately needed by this \ntortured world where the realities of this harsh world have long \nimposed upon us.\n  It is in our national interest, in my opinion, to lead the world \ntoward solutions that we know are best for us all. No other country can \nmanage it. We have seen that. Without that management, we risk things \nthat could harm us in many ways and continue to undermine our role in \nthis world in providing for peace and stability.\n  For these reasons, tomorrow I will introduce a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution articulating some of the steps I think we and the President \nshould consider together. None of these steps involve military force or \nthe preparation for using such force. Now is not the time to add to the \nviolence but, rather, to remove the use of force by all parties as an \noption.\n  I hope the resolution will contribute to the search for both a \nbipartisan, unified government approach to problem-solving and an \ninternational consensus on firm actions that will change Russia's \nbehavior. I am saying that we should stand united as Americans with a \nsingle message and a single voice led by our leader which shows we are \nresolute in standing together--hopefully with our European allies and \nothers who want to join us--in condemning the actions taken by Putin \nand Russia and in offering and proposing meaningful sanctions and \nmeasures that will bring the reality of Russia's actions straight to \nPutin's desk and hopefully cause him to rethink his strategy.\n  The resolution will commit the Senate to work urgently with the \nPresident to identify a package of economic sanctions and other \nmeasures to compel Putin to remove armed forces from Ukrainian \nterritory and return that territory to full Ukrainian sovereign \ncontrol.\n  Further, I will suggest that we construct a complete comprehensive \nplan to isolate Putin's Russia from the community of nations. We seek a \nconsensus on such a plan with our friends and allies--everyone who \nwants to see a sovereign Ukraine, secure within its own border, able to \nseek its own destiny on its own terms. That is the right of every \nsovereign nation.\n  My resolution will also call upon the President to consider a number \nof measures to isolate and sanction Russia.\n  We could reschedule a meeting of the G-8 nations to take place as \nsoon as possible, at which meeting the participating nations should \nseriously consider a U.S. proposal to formally expel Russia.\n  The United States should propose to NATO that the alliance \nimmediately suspend operation of the Russian-NATO council. The Russian \nmilitary and diplomatic representation at NATO should be expelled. A \nclose relationship with Russian's defense officials during a time when \nthat country has invaded and occupied a neighbor contravenes the \nfounding purpose of NATO. How could we possibly meet on a Russian-NATO \ncouncil basis when Russia has invaded and occupied a neighbor?\n  The President should ask the leadership of FIFA to reconsider its \ndecision to place World Cup 2018 matches in Russia and instead award \nthese games to a more worthy alternative country. Russia has just \ncelebrated the Sochi Olympics. I think we got the real measure of \nPresident Putin, a former KGB lieutenant colonel, as to what his real \nintentions are--it is not to bring more good will and more confidence \nin that country.\n  The United States could work with other members of the Organization \nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe--the OSCE--to deploy monitors in \nUkraine to help confirm that the security of the Russian-speaking \npopulation is not threatened. This pretext for Russian aggression must \nbe removed to international satisfaction.\n  Senate leadership could dispatch a congressional delegation led by \nOSCE Commissioners to visit Ukraine and bolster OSCE's involvement in \naddressing this crisis. Another option would be the United States \nworking with OSCE and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to support her \nproposal to create an OSCE contact group to pursue dispute resolution \nand mediate direct negotiations between the Ukrainian and Russian \nGovernments.\n  The United States should not maintain the current status of \ndiplomatic relations with Russia at current levels. We could downgrade \nour diplomatic representation while retaining its efficacy by \nannouncing that we will not send our new Ambassador to Moscow. Instead, \nwe could dispatch an experienced professional diplomat to Ukraine to \nserve as charge d'affaires to handle the crisis. We could also reduce \nthe diplomatic presence to focus exclusively on crisis management, not \nbusiness as usual. We could close consulates general and require Russia \nto make reciprocal steps to close their consulates in the United \nStates.\n  I believe we in Congress should expand the Magnitsky Rule of Law \nAccountability Act to sanction the Ministry of Defense officials in the \nchain of command responsible for this invasion, the Duma leadership \nresponsible for rubberstamping it, and Crimean officials complicit in \nits execution.\n  The United States should also consider sanctions that might serve to \nconvince more segments of the Russian population that their government \nis taking irresponsible steps contrary to the people's interests. To \nthis end, we should suspend and could suspend Russia's eligibility for \nH-2B temporary or seasonal work visas.\n\n  This is just a menu of suggestions of actions we can take, actions \nthat I think would impose upon Russia a cost for their brazen attempt \nto intercede in the affairs of a sovereign nation to, under the most \nflimsiest of pretenses, invade a country under the pretext that its \ncitizens there, or those who favor support for Russia, are under some \ntype of lethal threat. That is not the case. It has not been \ndemonstrated, and it has not been proven.\n  Now is the time to act--to act quickly and act together. Our leverage \nis our leadership. We need to take up that powerful tool and show Putin \nthat he has misjudged us. Now is the time for the United States to \nreassert its leadership in the world by taking direct action--not \nthrough military action but through a menu of measures designed to \nbring Russia to its senses and designed to protect the sovereign \ninterests of those nations that are seeking to align with the West in a \nDemocratic way. We need that leadership from the President. We need \nthat support from this Congress in a bipartisan measure. And we need to \nspeak with a united voice, hopefully with our European partners and \nothers throughout the Western world and the free world, to send a \nmessage that Russia cannot ignore and to impose a measure of costs that \nwill impact that country's economy and impact the decision that has to \nbe made by their President.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley).

It \nis just not that way with Democrats who work in the Senate, it is also \nthe Republicans. When we work together, which we do outside the view of \nmost of the public, we work well together.\n  One of the troubling things for me--I am sure it is for all of us--is \nwhen someone who is a part of the family leaves--especially it applies \nwhen you feel so close to the family member. Today, the Democratic \ncloakroom, the nerve center of the Senate and the entire Senate \ncommunity, says goodbye to a dedicated staffer Tequia Delgado.\n  I and we congratulate her on her new role as a member relations \nadvisor for the White House. After graduating from Southern Illinois \nUniversity in Carbondale, IL, Tequia started her Senate career as a \nstaff assistant in my office.\n\n[[Page S1274]]\n\n  But even before that she spent the summer interning for this brandnew \nSenator Barack Obama. In 2007 Tequia joined Senator Durbin's staff. I \nhave never truly forgiven him for that, for taking her from me. But he \nhas done a lot of nice things, so I guess I will have to try to sweep \nthat under the rug sometime, but it has been very hard. I do not think \nI have ever gotten over that. I have told him often that he stole her \nfrom me. But those things happen.\n  On a serious note, it was the right move for her. It was an \nadvancement for her. She is from Illinois. It has worked out well for \nher. She became director of constituent services and then a legislative \ncorrespondent for Senator Durbin, my dear friend.\n  Despite her hard work in my office and that of the assistant \nDemocratic leader, Senator Durbin, she found time to perform as a \ncheerleader for the Washington Redskins for 3 years. These are \ndifficult jobs. They practice like the football team. It is hard. They \nhave tryouts. It is quite an honor. So we have always recognized her \nfor this accomplishment. That is certainly what it is.\n  When she joined the cloakroom staff in 2010, she brought her warm \npersonality and always a positive spirit to her now role. So for 4 \nyears Tequia has worked in the cloakroom, I repeat, the nerve center of \nthe Senate. She has been an invaluable resource to all Senators. She \nhas been an important mentor for Senate interns and pages. She has been \na valued teammate and friend to our colleagues.\n  Tequia's talent, dedication, and friendly demeanor will be missed by \nme and Members and colleagues alike. I wish her well in this next \nendeavor. I know she will perform admirably. We are fortunate that she \nwill continue to work closely with the Senate community. That is her \njob in her new role as a member of the White House team.\n  Congratulations Tequia and best of luck in everything you do in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/04/senate-section/article/S1274-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I want to speak briefly, as I have several \ntimes over the past year, about the government of Ecuador's President \nRafael Correa, which continues its aggressive clamp down on press \nfreedom. Most recently, political cartoonist Xavier Bonilla was \nreprimanded for a cartoon he drew, and the newspaper he works for, El \nUniverso, was fined for publishing it. El Universal, one of Ecuador's \nmost respected dailies, has been the target of one of the dozens of \nharassing lawsuits filed by President Correa.\n  The cartoon by Mr. Bonilla, who goes by the pen name Bonil, depicts a \npolice raid at the home of an investigative journalist, Fernando \nVillavicencio, who claimed to have documented evidence of corruption in \nthe government. It shows the police knocking down the door to Mr. \nVillavicencio's house and parading out with computers and filing \ncabinets.\n  A government-established media oversight agency, Superintendency of \nInformation and Communication, SUPERCOM, used Ecuador's vague \ncommunications law to sanction both Mr. Bonilla and El Universo for \npublishing an ``institutional position'' over the guilt or innocence of \npeople involved in investigations. It subsequently ordered a major \ninvestigation, required a ``correction'' to the cartoon, and fined the \nnewspaper. In doing so, the Correa administration sent a clear message \nto journalists that criticism of government misconduct will not be \ntolerated.\n  I have spoken several times about President Correa's attacks on press \nfreedom and I will continue doing so as long as these restrictive laws \nare enforced and as long as journalists are threatened for their work. \nMost recently I recognized the efforts of Janet Hinostroza, an \nEcuadoran investigative journalist who was honored by the Committee to \nProtect Journalists, CPJ, for her commitment to fighting for a free \npress. Ms. Hinostroza is continually threatened for her work exposing \ngovernment corruption. Unfortunately, the harassment she and Mr. \nBonilla face illustrates a norm, not an anomaly, when it comes to \nPresident Correa's attempts to intimidate and silence his critics.\n  The absurdity of censoring a cartoonist aside, this latest attack \nfurther erodes what remains of an independent press in Ecuador. It \nexplains why Human Rights Watch and CPJ continually rank Ecuador among \nthe world's worst for press freedom. It is shameful, it is an \nembarrassment for the hemisphere, and the people of Ecuador deserve \nbetter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/04/senate-section/article/S1274-3", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1274-S1276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MARIJUANA LEGALIZATION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the legalization of marijuana is an \nissue that has generated significant media attention in recent months. \nLast year Colorado and Washington State became the first jurisdictions \nin the world to legalize the production, trafficking, possession and \nuse of marijuana for recreational purposes. The consequences of \nlegalization are only beginning to be understood. But one thing is \nclear. Legalizing marijuana does not make it any safer. Marijuana \nremains a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act. \nAccording to that designation, it is a substance that presents ``a high \npotential for abuse.''\n  Colorado's previous experience legalizing medical marijuana suggests \nthat the consequences of full-on legalization could be dire for public \nhealth and safety. From 2006 to 2010, the number of Colorado drivers \ninvolved in fatal car crashes who tested positive for marijuana \ndoubled. The number of Colorado students who have been suspended or \nexpelled for marijuana use has increased considerably. Nearly three-\nquarters of Denver teenagers in drug treatment reported obtaining \nmarijuana from a ``medical marijuana'' user. Colorado has become a \nsource State for the distribution of marijuana throughout the United \nStates. Law enforcement in my home State of Iowa reports that the \npercentage of marijuana interdicted there that originated from Colorado \nhas increased from 10 percent in 2010 to 36 percent in 2012.\n  Against this backdrop, the Obama administration has recently sent \nmixed signals, especially to young people, about the dangers of \nmarijuana use. President Obama recently stated that in his view, \nmarijuana use was no worse than drinking alcohol. The Department of \nJustice declined to challenge State laws that have legalized marijuana, \ndespite the obvious conflict with Federal law. Additionally, the \nDepartment issued guidance to prosecutors concerning the enforcement of \nthe Controlled Substances Act and Federal money laundering laws that is \nplainly intended to permit marijuana businesses in these States to grow \nand flourish. These actions have caused confusion and uncertainty about \nwhether using marijuana is really something that should be discouraged \nbecause it is harmful.\n  However, many community anti-drug coalitions, healthcare \nprofessionals, public health officials, and law enforcement groups are \nspeaking out about the dangers of marijuana use. One such group, Smart \nApproaches to Marijuana--or Project SAM for short--has recently begun \nto confront the marijuana legalization movement head-on.\n  One of Project SAM's cofounders, former Congressman Patrick Kennedy, \nhas been outspoken in his efforts to fight the marijuana legalization \nmovement. He has appeared on numerous television and radio shows, \nincluding ones where audiences may disagree with his views against \nlegalization. He has bared his own struggles with addiction, offering \nhimself up as a cautionary tale about the dangers of becoming addicted \nto marijuana and other substances. And he has broken with many in his \nparty by speaking out against the President's permissive attitude \ntoward marijuana use and the Obama administration's failure to enforce \nthe Controlled Substances Act. Indeed, all former DEA Administrators, \nappointed by Republican and Democratic presidents alike, have joined \nwith Project SAM and others to\n\n[[Page S1275]]\n\noppose the Obama administration's policies in this area.\n  According to a recent article from NBCnews.com, an article I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record, Project SAM recently \nlaunched a serious counter-offensive to the marijuana legalization \nmovement. The organization began by placing a billboard near the Super \nBowl stating that ``Marijuana kills your drive.'' Project SAM launched \na website dedicated to tracking public health incidents linked to \nmarijuana use in Colorado and Washington to highlight the consequences \nof legalization in those States. It is also launching websites that \nwill allow current or former marijuana users to share their stories \nabout how marijuana has damaged their lives.\n  Project SAM has also been active in my home State of Iowa. The \norganization recently co-hosted town hall meetings with local community \nanti-drug coalitions, highlighting the risks of legalizing marijuana. \nProject SAM has also briefed State officials about the dangers of \nlegalizing marijuana.\n  It is not every day that I have the occasion to praise a Democrat. \nHowever, Congressman Kennedy is to be commended for his courage in \ncoming forward and participating in this debate by publicizing the \ndangers of marijuana use and opposing the Obama administration's \nfailure to enforce Federal law in this area. His voice is a welcome one \nfor those of us who believe that the legalization of marijuana is an \nunwise policy that will have a profoundly negative effect on public \nhealth and the lives of many young people.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From NBCnews.com, Feb. 14, 2014]\n\n    Treatment or Jail: Patrick Kennedy Wages Fierce Anti-Pot Crusade\n\n                           (By Tony Dokoupil)\n\n       As a hard-partying teenager, Patrick Kennedy met President \n     Reagan at a fundraiser for the JFK Library, a meeting \n     captured in a photograph that the former Rhode Island \n     congressman now hangs in his home office. He used to think of \n     it as a funny episode, a collision of Camelot's cocaine kid \n     and America's foremost opponent of illegal drug use. But \n     Kennedy took his last hit of anything in 2009, and he's since \n     honed an anti-drug message that sounds a bit like Reagan with \n     a Boston brogue.\n       Kennedy believes there is ``an epidemic in this country of \n     epic dimensions when it comes to alcohol and drugs. He'd like \n     to treat it all, but he's convinced that the single biggest \n     threat to America's mental health is free-market marijuana. \n     So even as Democrats favor the legalization of pot--by a 34-\n     point margin, according to the latest WSJ/NBC News poll--the \n     scion of America's most famous Democratic family has broken \n     ranks, criticized the White House, and aligned with the likes \n     of Newt Gingrich to warn voters against trying to tax and \n     regulate today's psychoactive chlorophyll.\n       ``I don't think the American public has any clue about this \n     stuff,'' says Kennedy, after welcoming guests with a choice \n     of Gatorade or bottled water.\n       The ``stuff'' in question is modern marijuana, of course, \n     which gets pumped into snack foods and candies, and carries \n     more THC (tetrahydrocannabinol, the chemical that gets you \n     high) than the ditch weed used by the hippie generation. \n     Kennedy calls legalization ``a public health nightmare \n     because he believes it will warm more people to a dangerous \n     drug, and lead inevitably to ``Big Marijuana,'' a blood-\n     sucking vice industry dependent on converting kids and \n     selling to heavy users--same as the tobacco and alcohol \n     industries.\n       ``The science tells the story,'' he says, breaking into an \n     attack on the idea that marijuana is safer than alcohol. He \n     ticks through studies showing that smoked marijuana is \n     ``associated with'' or ``linked to'' IQ loss, psychosis, and \n     self-reported dissatisfaction with life. ``It takes you to \n     the same place as cocaine or heroin,'' he often adds. ``It \n     just takes longer.''\n       ``Incarceration is a powerful motivator,'' says Kennedy, \n     who after a prescription drug-addled crash in 2006 spent a \n     year urinating in front of a probation officer three times a \n     week.\n       Last January Kennedy went public with his beliefs, \n     launching Smart Approaches to Marijuana, or Project SAM, a \n     campaign to keep marijuana illegal and address the failings \n     of the drug war through other means. But what other means? \n     Kennedy has sometimes been vague, promising ``a fresh \n     approach that neither legalizes, nor demonizes marijuana,'' \n     but never quite clarifying what makes him different from \n     Reagan-era prohibitionists.\n       Not anymore. In a series of interviews, Kennedy and his \n     cofounder Kevin Sabet--a former senior advisor to the Obama \n     administration on drug policy--previewed SAM's aggressive new \n     posture for 2014. It's not a new War on Pot, but it might be \n     the most potent campaign since Nancy Reagan made marijuana \n     the centerpiece of her ``Just say no'' tour three decades \n     ago.\n       As Kennedy and Sabet cut a path between the poles of \n     legalization and prohibition, they seem to list toward the \n     status quo. They would make the simple possession of \n     marijuana a civil infraction, like jaywalking, which could \n     take 750,000 annual marijuana arrests down to zero, and \n     alleviate the disproportionate burden that prohibition puts \n     on people who are nonwhite and poor.\n       But instead of handcuffs, Kennedy and Sabet propose a \n     mandatory screening for marijuana addiction, according to the \n     ``Legal Reform'' section of their website. That could lead to \n     ``marijuana education,'' and ultimately a year in a \n     ``probation program to prevent further drug use.'' And if the \n     pot smoker still insists on getting high? It's handcuffs \n     time.\n       ``Incarceration is a powerful motivator,'' says Kennedy, \n     who after a prescription drug-related car crash in 2006 spent \n     a year urinating in front of a probation officer three times \n     a week. He faced a jail term if he relapsed. ``That does it \n     for a lot of people,'' he added. ``That's the turning point: \n     hearing that judge say treatment or jail.''\n       ``I think Madison Avenue has proven that it can get around \n     more rules and be more ruthless than any Mexican drug \n     cartel,'' adds Sabet.\n       Kennedy and Sabet can also sound old-school on medical \n     marijuana. As a member of Congress, Kennedy voted in favor of \n     allowing patients access to pot but now says he was wrong. \n     He'd like to repeal every law that treats smoked marijuana as \n     medicine. Instead he hopes to see pharmaceutical-grade \n     cannabis satisfy an FDA approval process and sell as a patch \n     or pill. ``We don't smoke opium for morphine,'' as Sabet \n     explains, ``we don't need to smoke pot for medicine.''\n       SAM's opponents argue that legalizing weed would raise tax \n     revenue, allow law enforcement to chase more serious crime, \n     and undercut Mexico's violent drug cartels. Kennedy and \n     Sabet sharply dispute all this--and so much more--but \n     they're particularly unapologetic about championing the \n     continued existence of a black market. They say it's \n     mostly nonviolent on the American side, and will create \n     fewer public health problems than allowing advertisers to \n     flog for Big Marijuana.\n       ``There is no way to minimize the greed and profit motive \n     in promoting a dangerous substance,'' says Kennedy. When it \n     comes to pushing a product, adds Sabet, ``I think Madison \n     Avenue has proven that it can get around more rules and be \n     more ruthless than any Mexican drug cartel.'' He calls the \n     black market, ``better than having Joe Pot, heir to Joe \n     Camel, on a bus-stop where I'm going to be hanging out with \n     my kids before school.''\n       When Project SAM launched, opponents mocked the effort as \n     foolhardy, and they had a point. Voters had just legalized \n     marijuana by a landslide in Colorado and Washington. Polls \n     showed that a majority of Americans supported doing the same \n     nationwide, and Kennedy could do little at first but appear \n     on TV as the token voice of dissent.\n       Now, however, SAM is poised to launch a serious counter-\n     offensive. It began this month with a billboard outside the \n     Super Bowl.``Marijuana kills your drive,'' read the \n     carefully-calibrated text, which picked up national coverage, \n     spreading on a tide of the opposition's howls and guffaws.\n       It was crafted by Sabet, a 34-year-old prodigy of drug \n     politics, who launched his first anti-drug campaign (Citizens \n     for a Drug-Free Berkeley) while in college and is now, in the \n     opinion of Rolling Stone, the number one national ``enemy of \n     legalization.''\n       ``Yep,'' he emailed after the ad launched. ``Game on.''\n       ``My name is John and marijuana ruined my life,'' begins \n     one entry from a young man who says that marijuana took ``the \n     gifts and potential I was born with.''\n       The game continues this spring, with SAM planning a \n     response to ``We Are the Marijuana Majority,'' a web \n     compendium of legalization's best and most famous friends, \n     launched with a grant from the Drug Policy Alliance, a \n     leading advocate for reform. The SAM answer will be a \n     directory of--you guessed it--the anti-marijuana majority.\n       The precise URL and title is still under discussion, but \n     the webpage will feature opponents of legalization, an \n     infinite scroll of head shots and quotes from the likes of \n     Tina Brown, David Brooks, and Barack Obama (whose tangled \n     statements on the subject appear to have landed him on both \n     sites at once).\n       SAM's second website will take aim at Colorado and \n     Washington, the world's first state-approved markets for \n     marijuana, and to Kennedy and Sabet a slowly unfolding \n     disaster that will prove them right in the end. The Justice \n     Department has said it will shut down the state experiments \n     if the regulations fail or public health falters, which is \n     why SAM will use this site to track every known example of \n     pot gone wrong.\n       The third website is tentatively titled ``The Other Side of \n     Marijuana'' and it will collect stories from people who \n     believe marijuana damaged their lives. It's a counterpoint to \n     the notion that marijuana is a safe, non-addictive substance. \n     Based on a sample of entries, it's also likely to draw more \n     fire than anything SAM has done yet.\n       ``My name is John and marijuana ruined my life,'' begins \n     one note from a young man who says that marijuana took ``the \n     gifts and potential I was born with.'' ``Most of my \n     daughter's former friends are in jail or\n\n[[Page S1276]]\n\n     dead,'' adds the mother of an 18-year-old in residential \n     treatment for marijuana addiction. She is ``sickened'' by the \n     idea that marijuana will be the next big business in America.\n       In another note a therapist quits her practice in despair \n     after a rise in marijuana-related patients. ``I witnessed \n     first-hand too many of the problems,'' she writes, ticking \n     off ``anxiety, depression, irritability and psychosis.''\n       ``This is the stuff of life,'' Kennedy says, trying to \n     explain his passion for drug policy, ``so you bet I'm \n     emotional about it.''\n       Not every pot smoker goes crazy or brainless, as Kennedy \n     admits, but SAM is about minimizing the risk to those who--\n     like him--start drugs young and are predisposed to break bad \n     for life. After he got married in 2011, in his early 40s, he \n     moved to his wife's hometown of Atlantic City, N.J. Now he is \n     the father of three kids under 5 (one is a step-child), and \n     he worries they will inherit his addictions. He can also see \n     the casinos from his backyard.\n       ``The appetite for Americans to lose themselves is just . . \n     . '' Kennedy shakes his head and seems too pained to finish \n     the thought. His six-week-old daughter was fussy the night \n     before, and it was his turn to shush and pace. In the \n     hallway, near a stairway to where his 20-month-old son is \n     napping, there's a toy fire engine and Kennedy's eyes return \n     to it again and again. Suddenly, he seems to be on the brink \n     of tears.\n       ``This is the stuff of life,'' he says, trying to explain \n     his passion for drug policy, ``so you bet I'm emotional about \n     it.''\n       The rollout of the new SAM continued this month at a \n     conference in Washington, D.C., where Kennedy and Sabet held \n     a standing-room-only rally for supporters. They celebrated \n     25,000 media mentions, and 22 states with SAM affiliates. \n     They aired footage of Kennedy telling CNN's Sanjay Gupta that \n     his ballyhooed endorsement of marijuana was ``shameful,'' a \n     ratings ploy that ``history will not remember well.''\n       So far, however, the legalization side seems to have an \n     edge in the war of ridicule. They charge Kennedy and Sabet \n     with 21 st century reefer madness, which the duo bats away as \n     a sign that the opposition is afraid to engage with the \n     facts. But while they can sometimes be unpopular at parties, \n     they keep going, fueled by those letters from the public, and \n     enthusiastic notes from past drug advisors.\n       ``SAM is doing what no one else has done and doing a darn \n     good job of it,'' wrote Robert DuPont, Richard Nixon's head \n     of drug control, in a recent email to Sabet. ``Absolutely \n     brilliant presentation,'' Clinton-era drug czar Barry \n     McCaffrey added in a different note.\n       In a sense, nothing has changed since a teenage Kennedy \n     gave President Reagan a sly smile. To make the world a \n     healthier place, the anti-drug crowd wants to protect people \n     from their most dangerous appetites. The reform side supports \n     the same vision of health but wants to make drug use itself \n     safer, believing that insobriety is normal and indulgence \n     inevitable.\n       Neither side appears to be winning, because there's no such \n     thing as an ``objective'' position on marijuana policy. Would \n     legalization really be so bad? Or is it the panacea its \n     proponents claim? The honest answer is: nobody knows for \n     sure, because no modern nation has ever tried legalization \n     before--until now.\n       ``Life isn't really in our control,'' says Kennedy, as \n     another sober day fades to night. ``There's a mover in the \n     universe, a higher power, so to speak, and we can't imagine \n     what we're going to find in our universe if we let go and \n     just let God lead us.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/04/senate-section/article/S1276-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WORLD WILDLIFE DAY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, in commemoration of World Wildlife Day on \nMarch 3, I rise to bring attention to the catastrophic effects of \nwildlife trafficking on global and economic security and the urgent \nneed to crush this demand for these illegal products.\n  Conserving natural resources is a priority for me, particularly as \nchair of the Water and Wildlife Subcommittee; it is a priority for my \nState of Maryland, and it is a priority for this administration. But \nthe responsibility of protecting natural resources, such as wildlife, \ndoesn't just sit with one State or one country. It requires a \ncoordinated, global effort. Wildlife trafficking is a multibillion-\ndollar-per-year, transnational, sophisticated network of organized \ncriminals. As the demand for elephant ivory, rhino horns, and other \nwildlife products resurges, the trade has become an illicit business \nsimilar to drug and arms smuggling. And as such, we must approach the \nproblem with an equally hard-hitting strategy.\n  The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, CITES, \nreports that in 2012, an estimated 22,000 elephants were slaughtered \nacross Africa. According to the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, \napproximately 2,800 rhinos have been poached in South Africa since \n2008, a more than 7,000-percent increase compared to the previous 17 \nyears, mostly destined for Asian countries. Hundreds of park rangers \nare being gunned down by poachers, leaving behind devastated families \nwith no income. Illegal wildlife trafficking threatens our species and \nis pushing some to the edge of extinction. The illicit trade hurts \ndeveloping communities, damages tourism, risks people's livelihood or \nworse, ends lives.\n  In February, President Obama released the first-ever National \nStrategy for Combating Wildlife Trafficking. I joined colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to urge the administration to produce a bold, \ngoal-oriented, and whole-of-government approach to combat this growing \nproblem of illicit wildlife trafficking. I commend the administration \nfor its aggressive plan, and I hope we see swift implementation in the \nthree areas of enforcement, demand reduction, and partner-building.\n  The image of wildlife trafficking is often tied to the African \nContinent. But the other side--the consumer-demand side, primarily \ndriven in Asia--must be viewed closely as well. With growing wealth in \nthe Asia region, wildlife is being used for traditional and \nnontraditional medicines, trophies, clothing or pets. As the demand \ngrows, the price of these products continues to skyrocket. We must \nleverage our bilateral and regional relationships to educate \ncommunities about the real effects of this trade.\n  As chair of the Subcommittee on East Asia and the Pacific, I am \nparticularly pleased to see the tremendous cooperation between the \nUnited States and China on this issue. At the 2013 Strategic and \nEconomic Dialogue, the two countries committed to cooperate on \nenforcement issues and efforts to end the supply and demand for such \nproducts. On January 6, China destroyed more than 5 tons of ivory, \npublicly demonstrating their commitment to protecting elephant \npopulations. The United States, Kenya, Gabon, and the Philippines have \nheld similar events. In a joint 1-month global operation earlier this \nyear, the United States and China joined with 26 countries, plus \ninternational organizations such as ASEAN, to target wildlife \ntrafficking criminals resulting in over 400 arrests and more than 350 \nmajor wildlife seizures. This type of collaboration is critical and \nmore needs to be done.\n  At the London Conference on Illegal Wildlife Trade February 12-13, \n2014, representatives from over 40 countries joined together and issued \na declaration urging action. There is no doubt that governments \nrecognize the urgency in solving this problem. But we need to build on \nthis momentum, match our words with action, ensure developing countries \nhave the capacity to address enforcement issues, hold criminals \naccountable, and educate communities to look beyond short-term benefits \ntoward the dangerous long-term effects of illegal trafficking.\n  I urge all my colleagues to work together to strengthen existing \nlaws, adopt new laws, and pressure consumers to put an end to this \ndamaging trade before the illegal trade puts an end to our world's most \nprecious wildlife.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/04/senate-section/article/S1276-2", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1276-S1277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SOUTH BERWICK, MAINE\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President. I wish to commemorate the 200th \nanniversary of the town of South Berwick, ME. South Berwick holds a \nvery special place in our State's history, and one that exemplifies the \ndetermination and resiliency of Maine people.\n  While this landmark anniversary marks South Berwick's incorporation, \nthe year 1814 was but one milestone in a long journey of progress. It \nis a journey that began thousands of years earlier with Native American \nvillages on the banks of the Piscataqua and Salmon Falls rivers. In \n1631, barely a decade after the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock, \nAmbrose Gibbens established a settlement at the falls and built the \nfirst sawmill in North America. A manufacturing heritage of textile \nmills and iron works that developed in the 18th century continues \ntoday. The skills and work ethic of the people of South Berwick \ncontribute greatly to the cutting-edge industries in the region, from \nbiotechnology to aerospace and defense.\n  Industry is only part of South Berwick's story. In 1791, the citizens \nof the region recognized the importance of education and established \nBerwick Academy with a charter signed by Massachusetts Governor John \nHancock.\n\n[[Page S1277]]\n\nLocated in South Berwick, the academy is the oldest educational \ninstitution in Maine and now, as a private school, remains true to its \nfounding purpose of promoting ``virtue and useful knowledge among the \nrising generation.'' In addition, the people of South Berwick remain \ntrue to the vision of their forebears by supporting an outstanding \npublic school system.\n  During the Revolutionary War, the growing community provided two full \ncompanies to fight for America's independence, more than many towns of \ngreater size. The courage and character demonstrated by the townspeople \nin standing for liberty echo throughout South Berwick's history. In the \nyears before the Civil War, the many churches in the community were \npowerful voices for the abolition of slavery. During that terrible \nconflict, more than 294 of South Berwick's young men, including 46 \nBerwick Academy students fought, and many died, so that all might live \nin freedom. The town's honor roll of current military personnel \ndemonstrates an ongoing commitment to our Nation's founding principles.\n  This anniversary is not just about something that is measured in \ncalendar years. It is about human accomplishment. We celebrate the \npeople who, through the centuries, have pulled together, cared for one \nanother, and built a great community that is a wonderful place to live, \nwork, and raise families. Thanks to those who came before, South \nBerwick has a wonderful history. Thanks to those who are there today, \nit has a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/04/senate-section/article/S1277-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        AMERICAN RED CROSS MONTH\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and pay \ntribute to the American Red Cross. March is American Red Cross Month--\nthis is a special time to recognize and thank our everyday heroes. The \nRed Cross is on the frontlines every day. They volunteer their time, \ntake lifesaving courses, and provide financial donations to help those \nin need.\n  We would like to remember our heroes in Alaska who help those in \nneed. The Red Cross works tirelessly to help in times of disaster with \nthe comfort of a helping hand. They provide round-the-clock support to \nmembers of the military, veterans and their families, and teach \nlifesaving classes in CPR and first aid.\n  Across the country and around the world, the American Red Cross \nresponds to fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and wildfires--the \ntragedy at the Boston Marathon, and Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines. \nWhen an injured servicemember enters a hospital far from home, the \nAmerican Red Cross offers comfort. When a hospital's patients need \nblood, the American Red Cross blood donors make that happen.\n  We dedicate the month of March to all those who support the American \nRed Cross mission to prevent and alleviate human suffering in the face \nof emergencies. Our community depends on the American Red Cross, which \nrelies on donations of time and money to fulfill its humanitarian \nmission. The American Red Cross reflects all that is right with \nmankind. They make America stronger by their selfless service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/04/senate-section/article/S1277-2", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SISTER LILLIAN MURPHY\n\n Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Sister \nLillian Murphy, who is retiring this June after an astounding 27 years \nas the CEO of Denver-based Mercy Housing, one of the largest and most \neffective affordable housing organizations in the country.\n  Since 1982, Mercy Housing has worked tirelessly to develop affordable \nhousing options in more than 40 States. Sister Lillian took over as CEO \nin 1987 and has overseen enormous growth in Mercy's operations, which \nnow houses more than 135,000 residents in nearly 40,000 homes.\n  Sister Lillian has won a number of awards for her work, including the \nprestigious Non-Profit Housing Association of Northern California's \nAffordable Housing Leadership Award for Lifetime Achievement, and the \nAnnual Housing Leadership Award from the National Low Income Housing \nCoalition. In 2009, she was inducted into the Affordable Housing Hall \nof Fame by Affordable Housing Finance Magazine.

Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to the \nexceptional life of Tom Gola, a Philadelphia basketball legend, who \npassed away on January 26, 2014.\n  Mr. Gola was born on January 13, 1933, to Ike and Helen Gola in \nPhiladelphia, PA. His passion for basketball developed early in life \nand he became a star while playing for La Salle College High School. \nWhile there, he led his team to the Philadelphia Catholic League \nChampionship and won the Markward Award as the league's top player.\n  As one of the most celebrated high school athletes at the time, many \nexpected Mr. Gola to attend one of the big basketball schools in the \ncountry. Instead, he decided to stay close to home in Pennsylvania to \nattend La Salle University, where he once again quickly distinguished \nhimself as a star player. In 1952, he led La Salle to a NIT \nchampionship, earning the championship's Most Valuable Player Award in \nthe process. Two years later, he led the team to its first and only \nNCAA championship, alain earning the honor of tournament MVP. Mr. Gola \ncontinued his exceptional collegiate basketball career with: a second \nplace finish in the 1955 NCAA tournament; Player of the Year Awards in \n1954 and 1955; a place on three consecutive first-team all-American \nsquads, and; achieving the NCAA record of 2,201 career rebounds, a \nrecord which stands today.\n  The familiar cheer of ``Go, Gola! Go!'' still echoes in the memories \nof Philadelphia sports fans of a certain age. Another Philadelphia \nsports legend, the great Wilt Chamberlain once said:\n\n       Growing up, you whispered the name of Tom Gola. He was like \n     a saint.\n\n  Following his extraordinary college career, Mr. Gola entered the NBA \nin 1955 to join his hometown team, the Philadelphia Warriors. He helped \nthe Warriors win an NBA Championship the following year. He is one of \nonly two players who played on NIT, NCAA and NBA championship teams. A \nfive-time NBA All-Star, Mr. Gola was enshrined into the Naismith \nMemorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1976.\n  Following his retirement from the NBA, Mr. Gola focused his \nconsiderable talents on hi community. He was elected to the \nPennsylvania House of Representatives and later served as the city of \nPhiladelphia's Controller.\n  Mr. Gola also returned to his alma mater as the head coach of the La \nSalle Explorers for two seasons. Today, the university's multipurpose \narena bears his name as a testament to the indelible mark he left on \nthe school.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to Tom Gola for his \nremarkable achievements in basketball and his service to Pennsylvania. \nMy thoughts and pray are with his wife Caroline and his son Thomas as \nthey mourn his loss. May he rest in peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/04/senate-section/article/S1277-4", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/04/senate-section/article/S1277-5", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1277-S1278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  (The message received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S1278]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/04/senate-section/article/S1278-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nCONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE \nORDER 13288 ON MARCH 6, 2003, WITH RESPECT TO THE ACTIONS AND POLICIES \n OF CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE AND OTHER PERSONS TO \nUNDERMINE ZIMBABWE'S DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES OR INSTITUTIONS, AS RECEIVED \n      DURING ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE ON FEBRUARY 28, 2014--PM 31\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register  and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date.

Our housing \nmarket is rebounding. Our manufacturing sector is adding jobs for the \nfirst time since the 1990s. We now produce more oil at home than we buy \nfrom the rest of the world. We have cut our deficits by more than half \nsince I took office. And for the first time in over a decade, business \nleaders around the world have declared that China is no longer the \nworld's number one place to invest; America is.\n  We have made great progress, but we must do more to rebuild our \neconomy on a new foundation for growth and prosperity. I believe that \nwhat unites the people of this Nation, regardless of race or region or \nparty, young or old, rich or poor, is the simple, profound belief in \nopportunity for all--the notion that if you work hard and take \nresponsibility, you can get ahead. That belief has suffered some \nserious blows. Over more than three decades, even before the Great \nRecession hit, massive shifts in technology and global competition had \neliminated good, middle class jobs and weakened the economic \nfoundations that families depend on.\n  Today, after 4 years of economic growth, corporate profits and stock \nprices have rarely been higher, and those at the top have never done \nbetter. But average wages have barely budged. Inequality has deepened. \nUpward mobility remains stalled. Even in the midst of recovery, too \nmany Americans are working more than ever just to get by--let alone get \nahead. And too many still are not working at all.\n  Our job is to reverse these trends. We need to return to an America \nwhere our success depends not on accident of birth, but on the strength \nof our work ethic and the scope of our dreams. That is what drew our \nforebears here. Opportunity is who we are. And the defining project of \nour generation is to restore that promise. It will not happen right \naway. But we must continue to strive toward that goal.\n  What I offer in this Budget is a set of concrete, practical proposals \nto speed up growth, strengthen the middle class, and build new ladders \nof opportunity into the middle class--all while continuing to improve \nthe Nation's long-run fiscal position.\n  Earlier this year, thanks to the work of Democrats and Republicans, \nthe Congress produced an agreement that undid some of last year's \nsevere cuts to priorities like education and research, infrastructure, \nand national security. Recognizing the importance of that bipartisan \ncompromise, the Budget adheres to the spending levels agreed to by the \nCongress for fiscal year 2015. But there is clearly much more we can \nand should do to invest in areas like infrastructure, innovation, and \neducation that will create jobs, economic growth, and opportunity. So I \nam including in my Budget a fully paid for Opportunity, Growth, and \nSecurity Initiative that provides the Congress a roadmap for how and \nwhere additional investments should be made in both domestic priorities \nand national security this year.\n  We know where to start: the best measure of opportunity is access to \na good job. With the economy picking up speed, companies say they \nintend to hire more people this year. And over half of big \nmanufacturers say they are thinking of insourcing jobs from abroad.\n  We need to make that decision easier for more companies. Both \nDemocrats and Republicans have argued that our tax code is riddled with \nwasteful, complicated loopholes that make it harder to invest here and \nencourage companies to keep profits abroad. Last summer, I offered a \nproposal to couple business tax reform with critical investments in \ninfrastructure. This Budget includes that proposal, using the \ntransition revenue that will result from a shift to a simpler, more \nefficient tax code to create jobs rebuilding our roads and bridges and \nunclogging our commutes and transporting goods made in America--because \nin today's global economy, first-class jobs gravitate to first-class \ninfrastructure. At the same time, this Budget lays out how my \nAdministration will continue to act on our own to cut red tape and \nstreamline the permitting process for key infrastructure projects, so \nwe can get more construction workers on the job as fast as possible.\n  We also have the chance, right now, to beat other countries in the \nrace for the next wave of high-tech manufacturing jobs. My \nAdministration has already launched four hubs for high-tech \nmanufacturing, where we have connected businesses to research \nuniversities that can help America lead the world in advanced \ntechnologies. The Budget expands on these efforts by providing funding \nfor five additional institutes, and, through the Opportunity, Growth, \nand Security Initiative, supports the goal I announced last summer of \ncreating a national network of 45 of these manufacturing innovation \ninstitutes over the next 10 years.\n  We know that the nation that goes all-in on innovation today will own \nthe global economy tomorrow. This is an edge America cannot surrender. \nThat is why the Budget includes investments in cutting-edge research \nand development, driving scientific and technological breakthroughs \nthat will create jobs, improve lives, and open new opportunities for \nthe American people. The Budget's Opportunity, Growth, and Security \nInitiative will allow us to push our limits even further, supporting \nadditional biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health \nthat will help us fight Alzheimer's, cancer, and other diseases, \nclimate research to develop climate change-resilient infrastructure, \nand agricultural research that will help increase agricultural \nproductivity and improve health.\n\n[[Page S1279]]\n\n  We also know that one of the biggest factors in bringing more jobs \nback is our commitment to American energy. The all-of-the-above energy \nstrategy I announced a few years ago is working, and today, America is \ncloser to energy independence than we have been in decades.\n  The Budget advances this strategy by ensuring the safe and \nresponsible production of natural gas and cleaner electricity \ngeneration from fossil fuels. It creates new incentives to cut the \namount of energy we waste in our cars, trucks, homes, and factories. It \npromotes clean energy with investments in technologies like solar and \nby expanding and making permanent the tax credit for the production of \nrenewable energy. And it continues to strengthen protection of our air, \nwater, land, and communities, and addresses the threat of climate \nchange. Climate change is a fact, and we have to act with more urgency \nto address it because a changing climate is already harming western \ncommunities struggling with drought and coastal cities dealing with \nfloods. That is why I directed my Administration to work with States, \nutilities, and others to set new standards on the amount of carbon \npollution our power plants are allowed to dump into the air, and why \nthis Budget advances new approaches to address the growing cost and \ndamage from wildfires.\n  All of these efforts can speed up growth and create more jobs. But in \nthis rapidly changing economy, we have to make sure that every American \nhas the skills to fill those jobs. The Budget therefore invests in new \nefforts to drive greater performance and innovation in workforce \ntraining, including on-the-job training, apprenticeships, and other \nsteps to equip workers with skills that match the needs of employers.\n  Of course, it is not enough to train today's workforce. We also have \nto prepare tomorrow's workforce by guaranteeing every child access to a \nworld-class education. That is why the Budget builds on the progress we \nhave made with new investments and initiatives to improve all levels of \neducation, from early childhood through college.\n  Research shows that one of the best investments we can make in a \nchild's life is high-quality early education. This year, we will invest \nin new partnerships with States and communities across the country to \nexpand access to high-quality early education, and I am again calling \non the Congress to make high-quality preschool available to every four-\nyear-old child. The Budget also includes funding to provide access to \nhigh-quality infant and toddler care for more than 100,000 children, \nand supports the extension and expansion of voluntary home visiting \nprograms.\n  Last year, I called on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to \nconnect 99 percent of our students to high-speed broadband over the \nnext 4 years. This year, the FCC is making a down payment on this goal \nby connecting more than 15,000 schools and 20 million students over the \nnext 2 years, without adding a dime to the deficit. To ensure students \nreceive the full benefit of this connectivity, the Budget invests in \ntraining for teachers in hundreds of school districts across the \ncountry.\n  The Budget also supports redesigning our high schools, helping them \npartner with colleges and employers that offer the college-level \ncoursework and real-world skills to prepare students for college and \ncareers. And it launches a new Race to the Top competition aimed at \nclosing the achievement gap, so that all children get the high-quality \neducation they need to succeed.\n  And we are shaking up our system of higher education to encourage \ninnovation, give parents more information, and reward colleges for \nimproving quality and reducing costs, so that no middle class student \nis priced out of a college education. Last summer, I directed the \nDepartment of Education to develop and publish a new college rating \nsystem that will identify colleges that provide the best value to \nstudents and encourage all colleges to improve. The Budget supports the \ndevelopment of that rating system and provides bonuses to reward \ncolleges that improve educational outcomes for Pell Grant recipients. \nAnd to help more Americans who feel trapped by student loan debt, the \nBudget expands income-driven repayment options, allowing millions the \nopportunity to cap their monthly student loan payments at 10 percent of \ntheir income.\n  We also must do more to ensure our economy honors the dignity of \nwork, and that hard work pays off for all of our citizens. Americans \noverwhelmingly agree that no one who works full time should ever have \nto raise a family in poverty. I have already acted by Executive Order \nto require Federal contractors to pay their federally funded employees \na fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour. The Congress needs to go \nfurther and raise the minimum wage for all workers to that same amount. \nThis raise will help families, and it will help the economy by giving \nbusinesses customers with more money to spend and by boosting \nproductivity and reducing turnover. The Budget also invests in \nenforcement efforts to make sure workers receive the wages and overtime \nthey have earned.\n\n  There are other steps we can take to help families make ends meet. \nFew policies are more effective at reducing inequality and helping \nfamilies pull themselves up through hard work than the Earned Income \nTax Credit (EITC). The EITC for families with children lifts millions \nout of poverty each year and helps about half of all parents at some \npoint in their lives. But as a number of prominent policymakers, both \nprogressive and conservative, have noted, the EITC does not do enough \nfor single workers who do not have kids. The Budget doubles the value \nof the EITC for workers without children and non-custodial parents, and \nalso makes it available to younger adult workers, so that it can \nencourage work in the crucial years at the beginning of a young \nperson's career.\n  We also need to do more to help Americans save for retirement. Today, \nmost workers do not have a pension. A Social Security check often is \nnot enough on its own. And while the stock market has doubled over the \nlast 5 years, that does not improve retirement security for people who \ndo not have retirement savings. That is why the Budget builds on my \nproposal to create a new way for working Americans to start saving for \nretirement: the MyRA savings bond. To encourage new savers, MyRA \nrequires a low initial contribution and guarantees a decent return with \nno risk of losing what you put in. Separately, the Budget also proposes \nto establish automatic enrollment Individual Retirement Accounts, \noffering every American access to an automatic savings vehicle on the \njob.\n  For decades, few things exposed hard-working families to economic \nhardship more than a broken health care system. With the enactment of \nthe Affordable Care Act, we are in the process of fixing that. Already, \nbecause of the health reform law, more than 3 million Americans under \nthe age of 26 have gained coverage under their parents' plans. More \nthan 9 million Americans have signed up for private health insurance or \nMedicaid coverage. Because of this law, no American can ever again be \ndropped or denied coverage for a preexisting condition like asthma, \nback pain, or cancer. No woman can ever be charged more just because \nshe is a woman. And we did all this while adding years to Medicare's \nfinances, keeping Medicare premiums flat, and lowering prescription \ncosts for millions of seniors. To continue this progress, the Budget \nfully funds the ongoing implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n  We must always remember that economic growth and opportunity can only \nbe achieved if America is safe and secure. At home, the Budget supports \nefforts to make our communities safer by reducing gun violence and \nreforming our criminal justice system.\n  Looking beyond our borders, the Budget responsibly transitions from \nthe completion of our military mission in Afghanistan in 2014 to \npolitical and security support for a unified Afghan government as it \ntakes full responsibility for its own future. When I took office, \nnearly 180,000 Americans were serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, \nall our troops are out of Iraq and more than 60,000 of our troops have \nalready come home from Afghanistan. With Afghan forces now in the lead \nfor their own security, our troops have moved to a support role. \nTogether with our allies, we will complete our mission there by the end \nof this year, and America's longest war will finally be over.\n  In addition to responsibly winding down our operations in \nAfghanistan,\n\n[[Page S1280]]\n\nthe Budget ensures we maintain ready, modern, and capable defense \nforces to address any threats we might face, including threats from \nterrorism and cyber attacks. It funds humanitarian and diplomatic \nefforts in Syria, supports transition and reform throughout the Middle \nEast and North Africa, and advances our strategic rebalancing toward \nthe Asia-Pacific region. It enhances stability and creates new markets \nfor U.S. businesses with investments in Power Africa and promotes peace \nand security by supporting global health care and addressing climate \nchange. And it strengthens oversight of intelligence activities and \nenhances the protection of U.S. diplomatic facilities and personnel \noverseas.\n  The Budget also ensures that we continue to meet our obligations to \nour troops and veterans who have given so much to our country. To \ndeliver on this commitment, it provides significant resources to \nsupport veterans' medical care, help military families, assist soldiers \ntransitioning to civilian life, reduce veterans' homelessness, and \nreduce the disability claims backlog so our veterans receive the \nbenefits they have earned. It also introduces necessary reforms to our \nmilitary compensation system, which our uniform military leadership \ncalled for, to ensure servicemembers and their families receive the \nbenefits that they have earned while making sure that our military can \ninvest in the training, equipment, and support that it needs.\n  In addition to making these critical investments, the Budget outlines \nthe steps my Administration is taking to create a 21st Century \nGovernment that is more efficient, effective, and supportive of \neconomic growth. Our citizens and businesses expect their Government to \nprovide the same level of service experienced in the private sector and \nwe intend to deliver. The Budget includes initiatives that will lead to \nbetter, faster, and smarter services, both online and in-person. It \ncalls on Federal agencies to share services and leverage the buying \npower of the Government to bring greater value and efficiency for \ntaxpayer dollars. It continues to open Government data and research for \npublic and private sector use to spur innovation and job creation. And \nit invests in the Government's most important resource, its workers, \nensuring that we can attract and retain the best talent in the Federal \nworkforce and foster a culture of excellence.\n  The Budget does all of these things while further strengthening the \nNation's long-term fiscal outlook. Over the last 5 years, we have cut \nthe deficit in half as a share of the economy, experiencing the fastest \nperiod of deficit reduction since the demobilization following World \nWar II. The Budget continues this progress, bringing deficits down as a \nshare of the economy to below 2 percent by 2023 and putting debt as a \nshare of the economy on a declining path.\n  Although we have seen a notable and significant decline in health \ncare spending growth over the last few years, in part due to the \nAffordable Care Act, we know that over the long run, the growth of \nhealth care costs continues to be our Nation's most pressing fiscal \nchallenge. That is why the Budget builds on the savings and reforms in \nthe health reform law with additional measures to strengthen Medicare \nand Medicaid and encourage high-quality and efficient health care.\n  We also know that revenue has to be part of the solution to our \nNation's long-term fiscal challenges. Given the aging of our population \nand the declining ratio of workers to retirees, we will need additional \nrevenue to maintain our commitments to seniors while also making the \ninvestments that are needed to grow our economy and expand opportunity. \nThe Budget secures that revenue through tax reform that reduces \ninefficient and unfair tax breaks and ensures that everyone, from Main \nStreet to Wall Street, is paying their fair share.\n  Finally, if we are serious about long-term, sustainable economic \ngrowth and deficit reduction, it is also time to heed the calls of \nbusiness leaders, labor leaders, faith leaders, and law enforcement--\nand fix our broken immigration system. Independent economists say \nimmigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by \nalmost $1 trillion in the next two decades. And for good reason: when \npeople come here to fulfill their dreams--to study, invent, and \ncontribute to our culture--they make our country a more attractive \nplace for businesses to locate and help create jobs for everyone. The \nSenate has acted to pass a bipartisan immigration reform bill that is \nworthy of support. It is time for the House of Representatives to \nfinish the job.\n  We have made progress over the last 5 years. But our work is not \ndone. This Budget provides a roadmap to ensuring middle class families \nand those working to be a part of the middle class can feel secure in \ntheir jobs, homes, and budgets. To build real, lasting economic \nsecurity, we also need to expand opportunity for all so every American \ncan get ahead and have a shot at creating a better life for their kids.\n  None of it is easy. America has never come easy. But if we work \ntogether, if we summon what is best in us, I know it is within our \nreach.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, March 4, 2014.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/04/senate-section/article/S1280-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 899.
