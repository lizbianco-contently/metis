Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the \nRepublican leader, there will be a period of morning business until \n11:45 a.m. today, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes \neach during that time, with the time equally divided and controlled \nbetween the two leaders or their designees. At 11:45 a.m. there will be \na cloture vote on the Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act, as we just had \napproved by the Chair. The filing deadline for all first-degree \namendments to S. 2363 is 10:30 a.m. this morning and the deadline for \nsecond-degree amendments is 11:30 a.m. this morning.\n  Following the vote, the Senate will turn to executive session to \nconsider the nominations of Shaun Donovan to be Director of the Office \nof Management and Budget, Douglas Silliman to be Ambassador to the \nState of Kuwait, and Dana Smith to be Ambassador to the State of Qatar. \nAt 2 p.m. the Senate will proceed to vote on confirmation of the \nnominations in the order listed. I expect a rollcall vote on the \nDonovan nomination and voice votes on the Silliman and Smith \nnominations.\n\n\n                              Nominations\n\n  Mr. President, I was late coming in here today because I just \ncompleted a conversation with John Kerry, the Secretary of State of our \ncountry. Because of his travel schedule and my schedule and the time \ndifference, it has been difficult for us to talk the last 24 hours, but \nwe were able to speak as he was rushing to an airplane, going from \nChina to Afghanistan. He called me to lament what is going on in the \nU.S. Senate about these nominations. He has 53 State Department \nnominations pending--53.\n  We have problems all over the world. We have the Afghan war. We have \nthe problems with Pakistan. We have the Middle East, which every \ncountry there is in some form of difficulty. We have a problem in the \nFar East--all kinds of problems there. It is all over the news today. \nWe have the situation in Israel. The Palestinians--rocket fire coming \nfrom Palestine; nondirected missiles, similar to the Fourth of July. \nThey set them off. They don't know or care where they go. And we are \nbeing held up here as a country from doing the\n\n[[Page S4368]]\n\ncountry's work as a result of this stalling, this obstruction, the \nconstant filibusters we have in the Senate.\n  We have these Ambassadors who have worked their entire lives. They \nare brilliant. It is hard to be a Foreign Service officer, but these \nmen and women work very hard all over the world. They dignify our \ncountry. Then they work their way up to make it to this ``Super Bowl.'' \nThey are selected to be an ambassador, and do you know what happens? \nThey get stalled here--stalled. Who are the Republicans hurting? They \nare not hurting me. Is this some payback for me? What about the \nPresident? He has a country to run, a world to take care of, and we are \nbeing held up here. I truly appreciate today. We get two ambassadors. \nWe only have 27 more to go, plus all the other State Department people.\n  The Secretary of State is a very busy man. He has been trying for 24 \nhours to tell me how bad the situation is around the world. He does not \nhave people to do this country's work. Twenty-five percent of the \nAmbassadors in Africa are not there.\n  So I do not understand this. They want to hold up some of the \nPresident's nominations to be Assistant Secretary of this or Deputy \nSecretary of that. It is unfair. But that is fine. What they are doing \nto these Ambassadors is outrageous.\n\n\n          Measures Placed On The Calendar--S. 2578 and S. 2579\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I understand there are two bills at the desk \ndue for a second reading.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will read the bills by \ntitle for the second time.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2578) to ensure that employers cannot interfere \n     in their employees' birth control and other health care \n     decisions.\n       A bill (S. 2579) to require the Secretary of State to offer \n     rewards totaling up to $5,000,000 for information on the \n     kidnapping and murder of Naftali Fraenkel, a dual United \n     States-Israeli citizen, that began on June 12, 2014.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what is the name of the legislation S. 2578?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. ``To ensure that employers cannot \ninterfere in their employees' birth control and other health care \ndecisions.''\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I object to any further proceedings with \nrespect to both of these bills.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The bills will be placed on the Calendar.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                        Helping The Middle Class\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the ongoing humanitarian crisis at the \nborder seems to be getting worse by the day. Large numbers of foreign \nnationals are unlawfully entering our country, and it is mainly due to \nthe administration's failure to enforce immigration laws and secure the \nborder.\n  This is a real crisis. So we are taking a hard look at the proposal \nthe President sent over, but we want to make sure we actually get the \nright tools to fix the problem, and that is not what we have seen so \nfar from the President. What he appears to be asking for is a blank \ncheck--one that would allow him to sustain his current failed policy.\n  Last night in a speech that attempted to shift the blame from his \nfailed approach, he doubled down on a blank check, which is what he has \nasked for. He led Americans to believe that the problem could be solved \nif only Congress would pass his last-minute request, but it is not that \nsimple. Much more needs to be done, and the President certainly knows \nit. His original letter to Congress called for reforms we all know are \nneeded to address the crisis. Under pressure from the left, he has \nsince backed away from these critical reforms, but lawmakers in both \nparties have not. So he needs to work with us to get the right policy \ninto effect, not just throw money at the problem--get the right policy \ninto effect.\n  He needs to halt this endless campaigning, at least for a moment. \nWith the President actually in the region right now, one would think he \nwould be able to carve out just a few minutes to view the situation on \nthe border for himself. Apparently, though, he has decided there are \nmore important things to do--such as campaigning with Gary Hart and \npracticing his bank shot.\n  All this continues to make the President look detached from the \nongoing crisis on the border. Even a Democratic Congressman has called \nit ``bizarre.'' Honestly, this is just the latest example of a much \nbroader pattern he has displayed, a pattern that makes him appear \ndisconnected from the day-to-day concerns of most Americans.\n  The fact is on issue after issue--but especially on issues affecting \nthe middle class--instead of addressing the huge problems his policies \nhave created, the President keeps retreating into the bubble with his \nfavorite leftwing pals--the kind of folks who always tell him what a \ngreat job he is doing, and of course that is what they do. Unlike most \nAmericans, these are not generally the kinds of people who worry about \ncar payments or utility bills or tuition or medical costs.\n\n  When the President does try to prove he is willing to listen to the \nconcerns of average Americans--as he did this week--it is usually \nlittle more than a photo-op. But if the President is truly serious \nabout helping the middle class, he will stop trying to convince \neveryone of that. He will join Republicans to actually do something \nabout it because we have been asking him to join us for a long time \nnow. It is about time he took us up on the offer.\n  We have already introduced a number of bills aimed squarely at \naddressing the squeeze our constituents are feeling. One of our bills \nwould restore the 40-hour workweek and reverse a pay cut that is built \ninto ObamaCare. Others would do things such as increase educational \nopportunities and put an end to policies that prevent women from \ngetting pay raises when they outperform their male colleagues.\n  One bill I introduced with Senator Ayotte--the Family Friendly and \nWorkplace Flexibility Act--would allow workers to take time off as a \nform of overtime compensation. It is an idea that is tailored to the \nneeds of our modern workforce. It is something a lot of working men and \nwomen say they want, and there is no reason not to provide a little \nmore flexibility to working families.\n  Another bill I introduced would reduce the cost and hassle of \nchildcare for working parents by allowing them to write off a home \noffice, even if they happen to have a crib in the room. Current law \nprevents working moms and dads from taking that deduction if they care \nfor a child while working at home. This is simply unfair.\n  Making that change is just common sense, and so are all of the bills \nwe have introduced.\n  Our middle-class agenda is not built around creating massive \ngovernment bureaucracies or taking from one struggling neighbor to give \nto another. It is about identifying smart, commonsense fixes that can \nhave a significant impact on the lives of the people we represent--\nmiddle-class Americans who have never felt more squeezed.\n  There is no reason the President and his Democratic allies should not \nbe able to embrace such commonsense ideas too. Unfortunately, President \nObama's Democratic majority in the Senate has blocked just about \neverything we have proposed--just as they blocked the dozens of bills \nthat have already passed the House of Representatives.\n  As just about everyone acknowledges at this point, the Democratic-run \nSenate has become the place where good ideas go to die. The Democratic \nleadership will not even listen to its own Members anymore. So it is no \nwonder that one Democratic Senator remarked that he has never \nexperienced a less productive time in his life than right now in the \nSenate. That was a Democratic Senator saying that--never experienced a \nless productive time in his life than right now in the Senate.\n  Well, it is time for Washington Democrats to stop obstructing jobs \nand opportunity for the middle class. They need to understand that \ntheir powerful pals on the left will continue doing just fine in the \nObama economy. It is time to stop worrying so much about them and to \nstart paying more attention to the vast American middle class, to the \npeople who feel Washington has not been listening to them over the past \nfew years.\n  I am talking about people whose wages are stagnant, people who are \neither unemployed or cannot find work\n\n[[Page S4369]]\n\nto match their skills, and people who feel the burden of outdated \npolicies that are diminishing opportunities in the workplace and \nleaving them torn between the demands of work and family.\n  Republicans are committed to doing everything we can to deliver \nrelief and innovative new ideas to help these Americans. I hope \nPresident Obama and Washington Democrats will at some point here \nfinally join us in the effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/10/senate-section/article/S4369-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we are back for another week of work, but \nthe playbook hasn't changed.\n  Once again the majority leader has prevented 98 Senators from \noffering amendments to improve a bill he chose for us to debate. I \nwould like to speak for a few moments about some of the amendments the \nDemocratic leader prevented us from voting on this week.\n  First, I have been working on amendments with Senators Bennet, Flake, \nRisch, Sessions, and Thune to allow bows and archery equipment to be \ntransported through the national parks. This bipartisan effort is \nnecessary because some bow hunters need to travel across national parks \nto get to land where they intend to hunt.\n  It is also important for our archery competitors who currently have \nto go out of their way to avoid national parks to get to their \ntournaments. A lot of people don't realize that Yellowstone National \nPark, which is in the upper left-hand corner of Wyoming, is about the \nsize of Connecticut. To get to Idaho, sometimes you have to go 250 \nmiles out of your way if you can't go through the park. There is a lot \nof competition between Wyoming and Idaho when it comes to archery and \nvice versa. The same can happen getting into Montana.\n  This is just a commonsense amendment because it provides parity for \nbows and firearms. In 2009 Congress passed a law to prevent the right \nof individuals to bear arms in units of the national park system and \nthe National Wildlife Refuge System. This body considered it a \ncommonsense provision before. Language on this issue was included in \nthe Sportsmen's Act of 2012, S. 3525, but now the Senate won't even get \na chance to vote on whether to add this language to the Bipartisan \nSportsmen's Act of 2014. This is the appropriate place for sportsmen's \nissues to be brought up.\n  Second, I offered an amendment with Senators Lee and Thune to ensure \nthat those traveling with a properly secured knife are not prosecuted \nunder local or State laws which banned certain knives. This amendment \nis necessary because there is a broad patchwork of State and local laws \nregulating knife possession.\n  For example, 36 States allow civilian possession of automatic knives \nto varying degrees. But there are no restrictions at all in 22 States, \nand in some States possession is a serious crime. This can be \nincidental, again, just passing through a State.\n  The current situation with knives is similar to the circumstances \nthat existed for gun owners before the passage of the Firearm Owners \nProtection Act of 1986. That law protects law-abiding gun owners from \nan inconsistent patchwork of laws, and my amendment provides parity \nbetween knife and gun owner. This commonsense amendment uses language \nsimilar to that used in the 1986 law.\n  I have also filed an amendment with Senators Barrasso, Crapo, Hatch, \nLee, Murkowski, and Risch to require the Department of Interior to \nsuspend for 10 years the listing decision in States with approved or \nendorsed sage-grouse management plans. Wyoming has an endorsed and an \napproved plan, and sage-grouse is coming back. A new report on numbers \njust showed an increase. The amendment allows States to manage and \nconserve sage-grouse in a manner that protects their jurisdiction over \nState wildlife and takes into account local stakeholders.\n  I believe it is related to the underlying bill because of the \nsubstantial impact a sage-grouse listing would have on sporting and \nrecreation in Western States. Incidentally, even though they say there \nis a sage-grouse problem, the bag limits for hunting them have not gone \ndown.\n  I have also cosponsored some amendments that would improve this bill. \nOne of these amendments by Senator Barrasso would prevent the EPA from \nregulating all bodies of water--even ones that are dried up, even ones \nthat are seasonal--no matter how small and regardless of whether the \nwater is on public or on private property.\n  Mark Twain once said: ``[In the West] Whiskey is for drinking; Water \nis for fighting over.''\n  So for States such as Wyoming, water is scarce, and we try to save \nevery drop. One-size-fits-all Federal control like the EPA wants to \nimpose won't work, but Senator Barrasso won't get a vote on his \namendment.\n  Another amendment by Senator Wicker, which I have cosponsored, would \nallow folks to carry firearms on Corps of Engineers recreational \nproperty. This is another parity amendment. But in this case, we would \nallow law-abiding gun owners to carry firearms on Corps land just as \nthey can carry firearms on national park and National Wildlife Refuge \nlands, but Senator Wicker won't get a vote on his amendment.\n  I am also supporting an amendment from Senator Tester to make cabin \nuser fees more affordable and predictable, allowing families to keep \ntheir cabins on Forest Service land on which some have been for \ngenerations. Wyoming cabin owners shouldn't have to worry about the \nForest Service trying to drive them off with ever-increasing fees--\nsometimes a 300-percent increase in a single year.\n  Incidentally, the Federal Government pays taxes in lieu of private \nownership of the land. Those don't go up by 300 percent. It seems to me \nthat if the value of the land went up by 300 percent, the Federal \nGovernment's payment in lieu of taxes would go up by the same amount. \nIt doesn't happen. Wyoming cabin owners shouldn't have to worry about \nthe Forest Service trying to drive them off with ever-increasing fees.\n  This amendment provides a consistent, fiscally responsible formula \nfor how the fees are calculated so families can spend more time \nenjoying the outdoors instead of worrying about the uncertainty of next \nyear's fees, but Senator Tester won't get a vote on his amendment.\n  These aren't the only good amendments to this bill. There have been \n80 amendments filed on this bill--about a third filed by the majority \nparty. Many of the amendments are bipartisan, but it sounds as if only \nthe one chosen by the majority leader is going to get a vote.\n  I am sad to say no one should be surprised by this because it has \nbecome par for the course. In 2005 and 2006 the Senate voted on almost \n700 amendments on the Senate floor. In 2011 and 2012 it was about half \nthat, around 350 amendments. In the past year the majority leader has \nallowed only 11 Senate Republican amendments. Let me repeat that. In \nthe past year the majority leader has allowed votes on only 11 Senate \nRepublican amendments. Over that same period of time the House has \nvoted on 169 Democratic amendments. How can the House, which has more \nconstraint than the Senate, have that many more votes for the minority \nparty--169 to our 11? The majority\n\n[[Page S4370]]\n\nparty in the Senate isn't faring any better. I am told the majority \nleader has only allowed his own party to have seven amendments voted on \nsince July of last year. In fact, my friends on the other side of the \naisle haven't gotten a vote on one of their amendments in over 100 \ndays--and they are in control.\n  To prevent us from offering amendments, the majority leader has used \na tactic called filling the amendment tree. In the last 8 years he has \nused this tactic 90 times. By comparison, the last six majority leaders \ncombined only filled the tree 40 times in over 16 years. So the last 8 \nyears, 90 times; the previous 16 years, 40 times.\n  Almost half of the Senate has been here less than 6 years. Forty-five \nof the 100 Senators are in their first term, so they may think this is \nthe way the Senate does business. I say to those Senators, there is a \nbetter way. We need to be able to vote on amendments. We need the bills \nto go to committee. We need to have bills come to the floor. We need \namendments both places. All 100 Members of the Senate should have an \nopportunity to improve the bills we consider because each of us looks \nat every proposal from a different point of view and different \nexperience. When all the decisions are made by the majority leader, the \nvast majority of Americans get shortchanged. This won't change unless \nthose who are here exercise our rights.\n  It is time for the 99 Senators who are being denied the opportunity \nto represent their constituents to stand up to the leader and insist on \namendments. We should all demand that we be allowed to do our jobs. \nThat will show up in votes, and it has shown up in votes. When our side \ndoesn't get amendments, we don't let the bill pass. We have that \ncapability, and the minority needs that capability in order to get \ncontrol of situations such as this.\n  We need to be able to vote on amendments. It has been the process of \nthis body for the history of the United States, with unlimited debate \nin the Senate. Occasionally, when the debate has gone on for 2 or 3 \ndays or 2 or 3 weeks, there has been the exercise we see here but not \nat the start of a bill so that no amendments can be voted on.\n  It doesn't take very long to vote if you get to vote. But what we are \ngoing through is a process of negotiations to see if the majority \nleader can pick the votes for the minority party. That is not right. \nThat hasn't happened, and we don't intend to let it happen.\n  It is time that we have our amendments, particularly amendments that \nare relevant to the bill. This is the sportsmen's bill. I am talking \nabout the right to take archery equipment through a national park. We \ncan do that with guns, but we can't do that with bows? Some of those \nparks are pretty big, and you have to go 250 miles out of the way to \nget around them. That shouldn't be imposed on sportsmen. They ought to \nhave the right to do that, and we are going to be denied that vote and \nall of the others that I mentioned this morning.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our \ntime.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I rise to speak about our Nation's broken \ncriminal justice system, a system that has taken an unimaginable and I \nbelieve unsustainable toll on our Nation.\n  The United States remarkably is home to between 4 and 5 percent of \nthe entire globe's population, but we have 25 percent of the world's \nprison population. This phenomenon is unacceptable, that the land of \nthe free would have 25 percent of the globe's imprisoned people. What \nis startling about that is the majority of those people are nonviolent \noffenders. In fact, the majority are nonviolent drug offenders.\n  This phenomenon has largely emerged since around 1980, a period \nduring which the Federal prison population has grown nearly tenfold. \nSince 1980 we have seen a 10-time increase in our prison population. \nAgain, if we were locking up violent offenders, people who are \nterrorizing our streets or inflicting vicious and violent harm on our \ncommunities, then ridding our streets of such dangerous criminals would \nbe understandable and it would be a price worth paying. But that is not \nthe story of this unbelievable explosion of our Federal prisons and our \nNation's incarcerated people. The reality is that nearly three-quarters \nof Federal prisoners are nonviolent and have no history of violence \nwhatsoever.\n  What is worse and what is anguishing is that once they are convicted \nof a crime, American citizens then face daunting obstacles to \nsuccessfully rejoin society, to being able to raise their family, put \nfood on the table, provide for themselves. As a result of that, our \nState and Federal prison exits have now become revolving doors, with \ntwo of every three ex-offenders getting rearrested within 5 years. Two-\nthirds of those nonviolent folks leaving our prisons come back within 5 \nyears.\n  When ex-offenders return to prison again and again, they are not just \npaying a price; we all are paying the price. We are contributing so \nmuch of our national treasure to rearresting the same people over and \nover, to reincarcerating the same people over and over. A recent Pew \nreport concluded that if just 10 States cut their recidivism just 10 \npercent, it would save taxpayers $470 million--money this Nation \nurgently could use either to keep in the pockets of taxpayers or invest \nin things such as lowering the cost of college or in our roads and \nbridges or our crumbling infrastructure.\n  As hard-working, taxpaying Americans have increased the fund for our \nprisons, funding more and more, there have been fewer and fewer \nresources left for these other crucial parts of our society--fewer \nresources for law enforcement, fewer resources for rehabilitative \nprograms, fewer resources for proven investments in children that help \nprevent crime in the first place. The result has been a cycle of \nspending and incarceration that has led to the ballooning of this \nFederal prison bureaucracy, more than one-quarter of a trillion dollars \na year from our economy going to unproductive and even \ncounterproductive uses.\n  Our country's misguided criminal justice policies place an economic \ndrag on local communities and on our Nation's global competitiveness. \nRemember, if we are putting 25 percent of the globe's prison population \nin our American prisons, paying the price for that, our competitive \ndemocracies, our competitive economies aren't paying that price, we are \npaying this egregious price, and it is not making us any more safe. In \nfact, I would say it is making us less safe as a community.\n  Many of my colleagues in this body, I am proud to say, recognize the \nurgent need for reform and have already put forth pieces of legislation \nthat seek to improve various parts of this broken system. I am grateful \nand I applaud the bipartisan efforts that exist in this body amongst my \ncolleagues--Senators Leahy, Flake, Durbin, Lee, Whitehouse, Landrieu, \nFranken, and others--who stand up to say: We have to save taxpayer \ndollars, we have to elevate human potential, and we have to make our \nstreets safer.\n  So to build off the momentum of these leaders in the Senate, I join \nwith Senator Rand Paul to introduce today the Record Expungement \nDesigned to Enhance Employment--or REDEEM--Act. This bipartisan \nlegislation will establish much needed, sensible, pragmatic reforms \nthat keep kids out of an adult system in the first place, protect their \nprivacy so a youthful mistake can remain a youthful mistake and not \nhaunt young people throughout their lives, and help make it actually \nless likely that low-level nonviolent offenders reoffend.\n  Among other measures, our bill incentivizes States to raise the age \nof original jurisdiction for criminal courts to 18 years old. Trying \njuveniles who have committed low-level, nonviolent crimes as adults is \ncounterproductive. They don't emerge from prison reformed and ready to \nreintegrate into a high school. The criminal record they have won't \nhelp them as they try to get a job. We need a system that treats \njuveniles toughly but fairly and with an eye toward a productive \nadulthood, with an eye toward restorative justice.\n  For kids in the dozen States that treat 17- and even 16-year-olds as \nadults, no longer would it be likely that getting into a scuffle at \nschool would result in an adult record that could follow an individual \nfor the rest of their life, restricting access to a college degree, \nlimiting employment prospects, and increasing the likelihood of \nengaging in further criminal activity. It is time that we empower our \nchildren to succeed, not undermine their long-term prospects for life's \nsuccess.\n\n[[Page S4371]]\n\n  The REDEEM Act also enhances Federal juvenile record confidentiality \nprovisions and provides for automatic expungement of records for kids \nwho commit nonviolent crimes before they turn 15 and automatic sealing \nof records for those who commit nonviolent crimes after they turn 15.\n  It will also ban the very cruel and counterproductive practice of \njuvenile solitary confinement that can have immediate and long-term \ndetrimental effects on youth detainee mental and physical health. In \nfact, the majority of suicides by juveniles in prisons happens by young \npeople who are in solitary confinement. Other nations even consider it \ntorture.\n  For adults, this legislation offers the first broad-based Federal \npath to the sealing of criminal records. A person who commits a \nnonviolent crime will be able to petition a court and make his or her \ncase.\n  Furthermore, employers requesting a background check from the Federal \nBureau of Investigation will be provided with only relevant and \naccurate information thanks to a provision that will protect job \napplicants by improving the quality of the Bureau's background check.\n  Think about this: 17 million background checks were done by the FBI \nlast year, many of them for private providers, and upward of half of \nthem were inaccurate or incomplete, often causing people to lose a job, \nmiss an economic opportunity, and be trapped with few options to \naddress the basic economic security that could lead someone to reoffend \nin order to feed a child. The REDEEM Act lifts a ban on receiving \nSupplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits. These \nbenefits were conceived in a way that should empower people when they \nhave to leave, and those convicted of drug use or possession having \npaid their dues now have a path to the reinstatement of those benefits \nso that they can get their lives together so they can be empowered and \nsuccessful.\n\n  Taken together, these measures will help keep kids who get in trouble \nout of a lifetime of crime and help adults who commit nonviolent crimes \nbecome more self-reliant and less likely to reoffend.\n  The time to act is now. We cannot afford to let our criminal justice \nsystem continue to grow at the rate that it is. We cannot afford to sap \nbillions of taxpayer dollars from a broken system that is locking \npeople up and then doing nothing to empower them to succeed. We are \nwasting human potential and human productivity. We are hurting our \neconomy, and by trapping people without options, we often end up making \nour communities less safe.\n  We have seen how other individual States are doing things to address \nthis issue and are actually lowering recidivism and lowering their \nprison population and on top of it lowering actual crime in their \nStates. It is time that the Federal Government act to do the same.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the REDEEM Act so we can make our \ncommunities safer and stronger and truly be a nation that savors and \nvalues freedom and empowers its citizens to live productive, strong \nlives of contribution.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Shifting to a different part of my State where they are \nexperiencing another type of crisis, every day this week I have come to \nthe floor and spoken on President Obama's refusal to travel to the \nsouthern border of Texas where a humanitarian crisis continues to \nunfold. Those aren't just my words; those are the President's words--a \nhumanitarian crisis.\n  As I have said before, the President has been in Dallas; he has been \nin Austin, where he spent the night last night; and he is there this \nmorning speaking, reportedly, on the economy. Why he persists in his \nrefusal to travel to the border really is beyond my imagination. I just \ndon't understand it. The fact that the President has himself described \nit as a humanitarian crisis makes this even more strange.\n  People can infer whatever they want to about his potential \nmotivations. I don't know whether it means he doesn't really understand \nit, whether his handlers have kept him in the bubble so much that \nsimply the facts are not getting through to him or whether he is \nsurrounded by political advisers who say: This is going to be a \npolitical liability for you, Mr. President. Don't travel there. If you \nshow up and have your picture taken with these children who are \ntraveling by the tens of thousands unaccompanied from Central America \nto Mexico, you will own the problem. I don't know whether that is the \nadvice he is getting. Surely it cannot be that he doesn't care.\n  But I will tell you that many of my constituents--Republicans and \nDemocrats alike--and many of my colleagues in the Congress are \nwondering: Why would the President show such little respect for what \nthe communities along the border are experiencing as they try to deal \nwith this humanitarian crisis? Why would the President show such little \nrespect for the Border Patrol, FEMA, and other Federal actors that are \ntrying to help these communities deal with this crisis? It just does \nnot add up.\n  Since the President so stubbornly refuses to visit the border even \nthough he is in Texas and has been there for the last 2 days, people \nhave asked me: Well, if the President showed up, what would he see?\n  First of all, he would learn this crisis is in large part a product \nof the President's own policy judgments, particularly starting with the \nICE memo in 2011, the so-called Morton memo No. 1, then the Morton memo \nNo. 2, and then the deferred action Executive order saying that certain \nyoung people would never be returned to their country of origin but the \nPresident will act alone to defer action against them.\n  Then there is the continued discussion the President has here in \nWashington that says he wants to go even further. So I think one of the \nthings the President would learn is that people actually pay attention \nto what he is saying. The impression is that he is not going to \nfaithfully execute the law.\n  So the children continue to come, and they will continue to come \nuntil we fix the problem. The President has to be an important part of \nthat solution.\n  As I have said before, these young children traveled through some of \nthe most dangerous territory on the planet, because the smuggling \ncorridors are controlled by cartels such as the Zetas and these cartels \nare in the business of crime--smuggling people, drugs, weapons, you \nname it--smuggling women for sex slavery and human trafficking. They \ndon't really care about the human element. They care about the money. \nMigrants who travel across Mexico from Central America are subjected to \nrape and kidnapping--where they are held for ransom so their relatives \nwill pay off the cartels to let them go and continue their journey. We \ndon't know how many of the children that start this long journey from \nCentral America--some 1,200 miles from Guatemala City to McAllen, TX, \nalone--how many of them die in the process and never make it. So the \n52,000-plus so far who have been detained at our southwestern border \nsince October are the ones who made the trip successfully. We don't \nknow how many children and their parents have died in the process.\n  I do know--having traveled to Brooks County, Texas--that I have seen \nsome of the grave sites of unknown migrants who have actually died \ntrying to get through--to get past the Border Patrol\n\n[[Page S4372]]\n\ncheckpoint at Falfurrias, for example. So I am sure, tragically, that \nmany migrants don't make it and die in the process.\n  There is a powerful incentive for people to travel to the United \nStates. Obviously, we understand people who want opportunity, people \nwho are trying to flee violence. But the President has effectively \nencouraged children and their parents to make this treacherous, life-\nthreatening journey by suggesting that he won't enforce the law. The \nPresident himself admits that even under his deferred action order--his \nExecutive order that he issued in 2012--these children wouldn't be \ncovered, but they come because they have the impression that they will \nbe allowed to stay once they make it here.\n\n  The New York Times recently reported the story of one 13-year-old \nHonduran boy who was detained in Mexico trying to reach the United \nStates. The Times reported that this young boy said his mother believed \nthe Obama administration had quietly changed its policy with regard to \nunaccompanied minors and that if he made it across, he would have a \nbetter shot at staying. And, in fact, that is proving to be true.\n  So many of these children are now, because of a 2008 law, placed with \nrelatives here in the United States who themselves may not be legally \npresent. They are given a notice to appear for a subsequent court \nhearing and the overwhelming number of them never show up. Having done \nso, they have made it because we don't have the resources. We certainly \ndon't have the laws on the books necessary to fill this hole that the \ncartels are exploiting and that is what we need to work on together as \npart of this supplemental appropriation to try to fix. We cannot just \nvote for more money when the cause of the problem that needs fixing \nremains unfixed.\n  The cartels are happy to tell parents: Yes, send your kids to \nAmerica, turn them over to us, write us a check for $5,000--or whatever \nthe amount is--and maybe they will be able to escape Central America \nand make it to the United States. For every one of the parents who take \nthe cartels up on that deal, for every one of the children subjected to \nthis horrific journey from Central America to the southern part of the \nUnited States, the cartels are making money. So as long as the hole in \nthe 2008 law remains unfilled--and the President certainly hasn't \nrequested we fix it, but we need to do that--we will keep spending \nbillions of dollars, and we will continue to see the surge of \nunaccompanied minors continue to go up.\n  In 2011 there were about 6,000 unaccompanied minors detained at the \nsouthwestern border. But just since October there have been more than \n50,000. So something is going on here, and this 13-year-old Honduran \nboy interviewed for the New York Times story said: ``Well, my mom \nthought President Obama was changing his policies and I would be able \nto stay if I made it.''\n  Since the President decided not to make the short trip from Austin or \nDallas to McAllen, TX, I wanted to share a few stories about what I saw \nthere when I visited. I had a chance to visit the McAllen Border Patrol \nstation, one of the busiest and most crowded of the facilities which \nare trying to deal with this surge of unaccompanied minors. I met \nanother 13-year-old boy who had just arrived from Central America. We \nasked him to come out of the detention cell that was so jam-packed with \nteenage boys that nobody even had space to lay down and sleep. I hate \nto think about how unhygienic those circumstances are. But this young \n13-year-old boy--we asked him, through a wonderful young woman who \nworks with me in my Harlingen general office in South Texas who asked \nhim in Spanish: ``Where are your parents?'' He said, ``They are both \ndead.'' It was heartbreaking. I think the President would benefit from \nseeing and talking to young victims of this trafficking like this \nHonduran boy.\n  As I said, inside these facilities there are dozens of children \npacked into holding cells, with one toilet, that are meant for just a \nfew people. There were young women only 15 years of age who were \npregnant, some of whom already had babies that they were nursing. The \nbabies were clothed only in diapers and sleeping on cement floors. \nUnless you see it for yourself, I don't think you get a full \nappreciation of the nature and scope of this process. That is something \nI think the President could benefit from.\n  Conditions are so bad they are housing people in a garage at the \nBorder Patrol facility. I don't have to tell the Presiding Officer, but \nit is hot in Texas in July, and you can imagine what the conditions are \nlike in that garage. There must have been 100 people basically sitting \nor standing on that garage floor because they simply don't have the \ncapacity to deal with them. They simply don't have the capacity to deal \nwith them, and they certainly don't have the capacity to deal with the \nnumbers that are coming through.\n\n  I wish to do something that I wish the President of the United States \nwould do in person by traveling to McAllen. I wish to thank the Border \nPatrol and the leadership of Chief Kevin Oaks, who has been doing a \nmagnificent job under very difficult circumstances. I thank all of the \nBorder Patrol--FEMA and other Federal employees--who are down there \ntrying to help the local community and the State of Texas deal with \nthis crisis.\n  Chief Oaks has maybe one of the toughest jobs on the planet these \ndays. He is in charge of Rio Grande Valley sector. It encompasses more \nthan 1,700 square miles in 19 Texas counties. It shares 320 river miles \nwith Mexico and 250 coastal miles. This is the sector through which \nthis flood of humanity is coming. They have detained 418,000 people \nlast year alone. That number is growing, and they are mainly coming \nthrough the Rio Grande sector--418,000 people from 100 different \ncountries.\n  If you go to Brooks County and look at some of the rescue beacons--\nthey have actually put out rescue beacons. If an immigrant is so sick \nor suffering from exposure or dehydrated, they can hit the rescue \nbeacon and a light will go off and the Border Patrol will rescue them. \nIf they are at risk of losing their lives, sure, they may not want to \nbe caught, but they would rather be caught than die due to exposure. \nThose rescue beacons are not just written in Spanish and English, they \nare also written in Chinese.\n  Yesterday I said I don't know a lot of Chinese speakers from Brooks \nCounty, TX. It is a small rural county. The reason that rescue beacon \nis written in Chinese, among other languages, is because people can \ncome from all over the world through the southern border of Mexico into \nthe United States. There were 418,000 people detained from more than \n100 countries. Admittedly, most were from Mexico and Central America, \nbut they also come from nations that are state sponsors of \ninternational terrorism, which is why General Kelly, the head of \nSouthern Command, said this is a national security threat.\n  The President would learn more about this if he took the trouble to \ngo to the border and talk to people such as Chief Oaks and learn of the \nchallenges they dealing with day in and day out. They are doing the \nbest they can, but they simply don't have the resources or the manpower \nto handle this influx, particularly of unaccompanied children.\n  I am told that because the Border Patrol has to deal with these \nchildren and make sure they are taken care of--which they should be--\nthey are not interdicting illegal drugs coming across the border, and \nthat should concern all of us.\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank my colleague from Maine for his courtesy.\n  This is something I hope my colleagues who have not spent as much \ntime thinking about this--and that is logical because they don't come \nfrom a State contiguous to the Mexican border or Central America and \nSouth America, but they need to know the facts, that these areas are \nnow controlled by cartels and transnational criminal organizations.\n  One official from the mayor's office in Ciudad Hidalgo, Mexico, \nreported--when talking about the cartels that control the smuggling--\nthat in his city ``the Zetas control all trafficking, sending men to \nrecruit women in Central America and sometimes even kidnapping migrant \nwomen riding the\n\n[[Page S4373]]\n\nbuses. They sell the women to truck drivers for a night and then throw \nthem away like unwanted scraps.''\n  The bottom line is there is nothing humane and nothing compassionate \nabout encouraging people to travel through cartel-dominated smuggling \nroutes in hopes of reaching the United States only to find out our law \ndoes not permit them to stay. There is nothing humane about that. There \nis nothing compassionate about that. Yet that is the impression. Nobody \nshould be traveling to America this way and especially not young \nchildren.\n  This is something the President of the United States needs to see. If \nit is serious enough for him to call this a humanitarian crisis and ask \nCongress to appropriate more than $3 billion on an emergency basis to \nhelp pay for additional capacity, it is serious enough to warrant his \npersonal attention. I just don't get it. I really don't.\n  I had an occasion to work with President Obama when he was in the \nSenate. I see him less often now that he is over in that big house on \nPennsylvania Avenue, but that doesn't strike me as who he is. I wonder \nwhat in the world could be going on. Is he too wrapped up with living \nin his bubble? I guess all Presidents have experienced that. He needs \nto break out of the bubble and find out what is actually happening on \nthe ground. At the very least, I would think the President would want \nto take the opportunity to say thank you to Chief Oaks, the Border \nPatrol, FEMA, and other Federal agencies that are trying to help local \ncommunities.\n  The invitation still stands. I think the President is still in Austin \nspeaking at the Paramount Theater in my hometown where I live now, but \nhe is talking about the economy instead of talking about this crisis. I \nbet the invitation still stands for him to take the short trip to \nMcAllen and about an hour out of his day to say thank you to the Border \nPatrol and other Federal agencies and see for himself this unfolding--\nand I would say escalating--humanitarian crisis.\n  I thank the Chair and the Senator from Maine for his courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                             Infrastructure\n\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, a few years ago Tom Brokaw wrote a brilliant \nand important book called ``The Greatest Generation,'' and he described \nour fathers and grandfathers and mothers and grandmothers and what they \ndid for this country by coming through the searing fire of the Great \nDepression, fighting and winning World War II, and then rebuilding our \neconomy in the 1950s. We owe that generation everything we have. That \ngeneration sacrificed--I have to repeat that word ``sacrificed''--on \nour behalf. We are literally standing on their shoulders. We are \ndriving on the highways they built. We enjoy our freedoms because of \ntheir sacrifice in World War II and in Korea.\n  If Tom Brokaw writes another book about us, I don't know what it will \nbe called, but it will not have ``greatest'' in the title. Instead of a \ncompliment, it would be more of an epithet. We are leaving our children \na gigantic national debt, crumbling infrastructure, and a changing \nclimate that threatens their well-being and future opportunities in \nthis country.\n  I rise to talk about one of those factors; that is, infrastructure. I \nhad a great insight when I was the Governor of Maine because every year \nGovernors go to New York to go through a ceremony of genuflecting and \nkissing the ring of the rating agencies in order to try to get our \nStates a high bond rating so they will have a low interest rate on \ntheir loans. I was all prepared for my meeting with the rating \nagencies. I had all kinds of data about how prudent Maine was, how low \nour debt level was, how we paid it off in 10 years, and how low our \ndebt level was per capita. I was in the middle of this presentation \nwhen one of the rating agency officials stopped me and said: Governor, \njust because you have low debt, if you are not fixing your \ninfrastructure, that is debt just as if it is debt on the books, just \nas if it is dollars you owe because the infrastructure is eventually \ngoing to have to be fixed. Of course, when it is fixed, the later you \ndo it, the more it is going to cost. That was an insight for me.\n  We have this sort of mental bookkeeping where we have the dollars we \nowe, but we don't think about a bridge being fixed as a form of debt. \nYet that is exactly what we have in this country. We are handing our \nchildren a gigantic debt on all fronts because we are unwilling to pay \nthe bills.\n  I had another exchange once with a fellow who was a clerk in a \nhardware store. This was in the early 2000s, and I said: What do you \nthink of the tax cuts we recently passed? I was just making \nconversation.\n  He said: There haven't been any tax cuts.\n  I said: What are you talking about? You see it all over the news. \nThere are all these tax cuts we just passed in Washington.\n  He said: No. No, we haven't passed any tax cuts.\n  I said: Don't you watch the news?\n  He said: Look, if you pass tax cuts when you are in a deficit \nsituation, all you are doing is borrowing more money and your kids are \ngoing to have to pay for it with interest, so you are merely shifting \nthe taxes from us to them.\n  I had never thought about it that way before. Of course, he was \nexactly right. If we cut taxes and cut expenditures at the same time, \nOK, that is legitimate public policy, but if we cut taxes and borrow \nthe difference, we are just shifting the cost to the next generation, \nand that is what we are doing right now, today, and we are doing it on \nall fronts. We are doing it in our Federal debt and deficit posture, \nand we are doing it in our infrastructure posture.\n  This is going to cost all of us. The subject I am addressing--which I \nneglected to clarify at the beginning--is the fact that the highway \ntrust fund goes broke in just a few weeks.\n  Funding from the Federal Government for highways for infrastructure \naround the country will decline precipitously starting in August, and \naround here we are about a patch, about something that will get us \nthrough 2 or 3 months or maybe 8 months, but nobody is talking about \nsolving the problem. Everybody is talking about all of these convoluted \nways to avoid the reality that we need to pay for what we do. We need \nto pay for our highways, for our roads, for our bridges, and right now \nwe are not doing it.\n  This is really going to hurt Maine. The estimates from our Department \nof Transportation is that it is going to cut our highway funding in our \nState by 17 percent--almost 20 percent. It is particularly going to \nhurt if we don't do something in the next month because we have a short \nconstruction season. If we lose our funding between August and October, \nwe have effectively lost it for the next 8 or 9 months. It is going to \nimpair projects that are ongoing, and it is going to essentially \neliminate--across the country--new highway and infrastructure projects.\n  By the way, if you are the head of the Department of Transportation \nand your funding is going to be cut, what are you going to do? You are \ngoing to maintain, not invest. Maintaining is the bare minimum, but it \nis not investing because investing is where we have our wherewithal to \ncompete in a global economy.\n\n  It is very revealing to me to compare the funding levels of our \ninfrastructure, maintenance, and investment with other countries. That \nis a fair comparison. It sort of tells us how we are doing. It puts it \nin perspective. Right now our infrastructure investment is about 2.6 \npercent of gross domestic product--2.6 percent of GDP. In Japan it is 5 \npercent and in China it is 8.5 percent. It is more than three times the \nlevel in our principal future economic competitor. They are investing, \nand we are disinvesting because the infrastructure is crumbling faster \nthan we are fixing it.\n  The joke in Maine this winter was the potholes were so bad that \ninstead of filling them, we were going to lower the roads. That is a \njoke, but it says something about the seriousness of this issue. Maine \nis no different than any other State. In fact, I would argue we have \nsome of the best roads in the country, particularly given the farflung \nnature of our State, but this is going to hurt us. It is going to hurt \nevery State in the country. Yet we are around here trying to avoid \ntalking about paying for them.\n  There are indirect and direct costs. Not fixing the highways is \ncosting our drivers more than an increase in the gas tax in terms of \ndelay, in terms of maintenance of automobiles, in terms of bent wheels \nfrom potholes.\n\n[[Page S4374]]\n\n  I talked to some people from the United Parcel Service, UPS. As to \ntheir fleet nationwide, a 5-minute delay per vehicle--because of \ncongestion, because of lack of infrastructure investment--costs that \ncompany $100 million a year--a 5-minute delay. Multiply that by \neverybody in the country and we are paying a high price.\n  The point is, we are paying a high price, but it is hidden. We do not \nnotice it. If we increase the gas tax, everybody is going to notice \nthat. But that is called paying your bills.\n  As a young man, I represented a client before the Maine legislature \nthat was an engineering firm that was owed a bill by the State of \nMaine, and for some reason it had not been taken care of. I ended up \nappearing before the appropriations committee. This was 40 years ago. \nBut I remember distinctly going before the committee and saying: Here \nis this bill and it has to be paid, and the members of the committee--\nby the way, the senior members were all Republicans--they looked at \neach other and said: We have to pay our bills. That is called \ngoverning, and right now we are not paying our bills. It seems to me \nthat is what we have to do.\n  One interesting thing about the gas tax is--which, by the way, has \nnot been increased since 1993, 21 years ago; it has fallen in value by \nsomething like 35 percent because of inflation over that period--but \nthe interesting thing about the gas tax is, it is the only tax that is \nnot effectively indexed. By that I mean the sales tax, which many \nStates have--my State does--5 percent. You say: Well, that is fixed \nover time. It is not indexed. But it is because the value of goods to \nwhich the sales tax applies goes up over time. On a hundred-dollar \ntire, the sales tax, at 5 percent, is $5. But 5 years from now, that \ntire is probably going to cost $110, so it is going to be higher \nrevenue. It is the same thing with the income tax. It may be at a flat \nlevel--22 percent or 15 percent or in Maine 5 or 6 percent--but incomes \ngo up, so revenues go up proportionately to the changes in the economy.\n  The gas tax is a fixed number--18.4 cents. That is what it has been \nsince 1993. It does not change at all. Do you think, Mr. President, the \ncost of building a road is the same today as it was in 1993--21 years \nago? The answer is no.\n  We have to grapple with this. To me, what bothers me about this is it \nis part of a pattern. I started with Tom Brokaw and the ``greatest \ngeneration.'' If you think of the legacy that ``greatest generation'' \nleft us--because they were willing to make sacrifices on our behalf--\nand then you say: What is the legacy of our generation? it is debt and \nit is crumbling infrastructure and it is the crippling of our ability \nto compete in a globalized economy. Shame on us.\n  I do not know exactly what the answer is. I do not know whether it is \na gas tax, a mileage tax, a change of the tax to the wholesale level as \nopposed to the retail level. I do not know. But I do know that no \nmatter what we do, and no matter how much we try to avoid it, we are \ngoing to have to pay our bills; and to not pay our bills, we have to \nrealize, is simply passing those bills to our kids. That is unethical. \nIt is immoral, it is wrong, and it is not what our parents and \ngrandparents did for us.\n  I think we owe the same level of consideration, the same level of \nsacrifice, the same level of realism, the same level of paying our \nbills to our children and grandchildren that we have been the \nbeneficiaries of.\n  So I hope, as this debate unfolds in the next several weeks, that we \npay attention to the critical importance infrastructure plays in the \ncompetitiveness of our society and in the future of our children. The \n``greatest generation'' built the Interstate Highway System, and we \ncannot even keep it maintained. That is inexcusable. It is inexcusable, \nMr. President, and I am sorry to be so preachy about this, but I think \nthis is a really important issue, and I think it goes in some ways to \nthe heart of our politics today where we are trying to do things and \naccomplish things but not pay for them. The point of my comments, \nthough, is: They are going to be paid for; it is just going to be \nsomebody else, that is, our children and grandchildren, who are going \nto be paying that bill. I think we ought to stand up and pay the bills \nourselves and maintain the infrastructure this country needs to compete \nand give the same opportunity to our children and grandchildren we were \ngiven by the ``greatest generation.''\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Maine withhold his \nsuggestion?\n  Mr. KING. I withhold my suggestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

And not surprisingly, the list of organizations that \nsupport the Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act is equally long and diverse. \nMore than 40 organizations that span the ideological spectrum have \nactually endorsed this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that six letters and \nstatements of support that I have received on the Bipartisan \nSportsmen's Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      [From the Congressional Sportmen's Foundation, Feb. 4, 2014]\n\n    Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus Co-Chair Introduces Bipartisan \n                        Sportsmen's Act of 2014\n\n       Washington, DC.--Today, in a significant advancement for \n     sportsmen and women across the country, members of the Senate \n     Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus (CSC) introduced the \n     Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act of 2014. Introduced by CSC Senate \n     Co-Chair, Senator Kay Hagan and CSC member Senator Lisa \n     Murkowski, this bipartisan legislative package includes 12 \n     bills that would ensure our sportsmen's traditions are \n     protected and advanced, and addresses some of the most \n     current concerns of American hunters and recreational anglers \n     and shooters.\n       The Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act is cosponsored by CSC Vice-\n     Chair, Sen. Mark Pryor and CSC members, Sens. Mark Begich, \n     John Boozman, Dean Heller, John Hoeven, Mary Landrieu, Joe \n     Manchin, Rob Portman, Jon Tester and David Vitter.\n       Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation (CSF) President, Jeff \n     Crane praised the introduction of this vital legislation. \n     ``We thank CSC Co-Chair Senator Hagan and CSC member Senator \n     Murkowski for introducing this bipartisan package of \n     legislation that includes provisions vital to protecting our \n     hunting and angling traditions in the U.S., which the CSC and \n     organizations within the sportsmen's community have been \n     working on for years.''\n       The Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act contains six bills that are \n     also found in the Sportsmen's Heritage and Recreational \n     Enhancement (SHARE) Act (H.R. 3590), which has been \n     introduced in the House of Representatives by House CSC Co-\n     Chairs, Representatives Bob Latta and Bennie Thompson and \n     Vice-Chairs, Representatives Rob Wittman and Tim VValz. \n     Similar provisions include protecting traditional lead \n     ammunition and fishing tackle from unwarranted regulation \n     under the Toxic Substances Control Act, amending the Pittman-\n     Robertson Act to allocate a greater proportion of funding for \n     shooting ranges, allowing film crews of five or fewer persons \n     on federal lands with an annual permit for $200, and allowing \n     the Secretary of Interior to authorize a permanent electronic \n     duck stamp, among others.\n       ``I am proud to have partnered with Senator Lisa Murkowski \n     to develop the bipartisan Sportsmen's Act of 2014,'' said CSC \n     Co-Chair, Sen. Kay Hagan. ``In North Carolina, hunting, \n     fishing and shooting are a way of life. Many of these \n     traditions have been handed down through my own family, and \n     I'm proud that our bill protects these activities for future \n     generations while ensuring that outdoor recreation can \n     continue to support jobs and local economies across the \n     country. At a time when Washington is stuck in political \n     gridlock, our bill demonstrates that Democrats and \n     Republicans can work together to find common ground, and I \n     look forward to working with Senator\n\n[[Page S4375]]\n\n     Murkowski to advance this package through the Senate and into \n     law.''\n       In addition to the bills shared by H.R. 3590, priorities in \n     the Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act include: reauthorization of \n     the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act, which allows \n     the Bureau of Land Management to sell land to private owners \n     for ranching, community development, and conservation \n     projects; reauthorization of the North American Wetlands \n     Conservation Act; and ``Making Public Lands Public,'' which \n     requires that 1.5% of the Land and Water Conservation Fund be \n     used for ensuring recreational public access to federal \n     public lands that have significantly restricted access to \n     fishing and hunting.\n       ``Senator Hagan and I have been able to combine the best of \n     the bills from our individual packages to support outdoor \n     recreation and created a truly bipartisan package that will \n     improve access to public lands for anglers, hunters, and \n     recreational shooters across the nation,'' Sen. Murkowski \n     said. ``I'm hopeful that the Senate can follow suit and work \n     together to pass a sportsmen's package this Congress, because \n     these are some of the last remaining 'easy' issues that enjoy \n     widespread support here on Capitol Hill.''\n       The SHARE Act is expected to be voted on in the House of \n     Representatives on February 5.

Your ongoing effort to introduce bi-partisan \n     legislation is a monumental step in breaking the deadlock \n     that hunters have felt in previous legislative efforts.\n       Improving hunting opportunities across the U.S., being good \n     role models for other female hunters, and improving funding \n     for wildlife conservation has been a priority goal throughout \n     our lives. We are proud to see your leadership as fellow \n     female hunter-conservationists in the U.S. Senate. \n     Furthermore as leaders of the Congressional Sportsmen's \n     Caucus and of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \n     your colleagues are all looking to you for guidance on good \n     public policy for hunting and conservation. We applaud your \n     efforts and we are anxious to see you reach your legislative \n     goals.\n       Our organization, Safari Club International, has an office \n     in Washington, DC which we trust is working closely with your \n     staffs to see your legislation become law.

On behalf \n     of our over 10,000 members, I would like to express our \n     appreciation to you for your leadership and support in co-\n     sponsoring the ``Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act of 2014'' \n     (S.2363).\n       As you know, S. 2363 is simply the most important package \n     of measures for the benefit of sportsmen in a generation. \n     This package of pro-sportsmen legislation will promote, \n     protect, and preserve our cherished outdoor activities of \n     hunting and the shooting sports.\n       This vital piece of legislation will prevent anti-hunting \n     groups from taking away the right of hunters to use the \n     ammunition of their choice, provide state fish and game \n     agencies with more flexibility to use Pittman-Robertson funds \n     to build and maintain badly needed public shooting ranges so \n     that tens of millions of recreational target shooters will \n     have a place to safely enjoy their sport and hunters will \n     have places to sight in their firearms for the hunting \n     season. The bill will also help facilitate and provide for \n     more access to public lands and waters for hunting, \n     recreational fishing, and shooting. It will also prohibit \n     additional fees for commercial filming on federal lands and \n     waterways.\n       Companies in the United States that manufacture, \n     distribute, and sell firearms, ammunition, and hunting \n     equipment employ as\n\n[[Page S4376]]\n\n     many of 112,000 people in the United States and are \n     responsible for as much as $37.7 billion in total economic \n     activity in the country. In these difficult economic times \n     the firearms, ammunition, and hunting industries are still \n     one of the few domestic industries that has grown its profits \n     while also contributing increased tax revenues. We as an \n     industry appreciate your continued support of legislation to \n     protect the hunting and shooting sports.\n       I want to thank you again for co-sponsoring this important \n     legislation. Thank you for your service on behalf of \n     America's hunting, shooting, and conservation community.\n           Sincerely,\n     Lawrence G. Keane.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       The Wilderness Society,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator, On behalf of The Wilderness Society and our \n     500,000 members and supporters, I am writing to express our \n     support for S. 1996, the Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act of 2014, \n     sponsored by Senator Hagan. We believe that hunting and \n     fishing are important uses of our public lands, and this \n     legislation would advance several vital programs which would \n     both safeguard sportsmen's access to world class hunting and \n     angling opportunities while simultaneously supporting many \n     programs that protect the high quality fish and wildlife \n     habitat upon which sportsmen rely.\n       The Wilderness Society strongly supports several provisions \n     of this legislation, specifically:\n       Reauthorization of the Federal Land Transaction \n     Facilitation Act (FLTFA)\n       This legislation would also renew FLTFA, an important tool \n     allowing federal land management agencies to fund the \n     acquisition of critical conservation areas--Including \n     wildlife refuges, national parks, national forests and more--\n     though the sale of BLM lands with lower conservation values \n     which have been identified for disposal. This common sense \n     ``land for land'' approach not only provides increased public \n     access for hunting and fishing, but also benefits local \n     businesses, counties, economies, private land owners, and \n     other outdoor recreation enthusiasts.\n       Making Public Lands Public\n       This provision would require the Secretaries of Interior \n     and Agriculture to spend at least 1.5 percent of Land and \n     Water Conservation Fund resources each year on parcels, \n     easements or road maintenance projects which increase access \n     to our public lands for hunters, anglers and other \n     recreational users. We support this provision, and further, \n     we support full and permanent authorization of the Land and \n     Water Conservation Fund to ensure continued access to and \n     protection of our public lands and waters.\n       Reauthorization of the North American Wetlands Conservation \n     Act (NAWCA)\n       NAWCA is a proven and popular conservation program with \n     more than 25 years of success in partnering with state, local \n     and non-profit organizations to leverage federal dollars in \n     the restoration and protection of over 27 million acres of \n     wetlands. The reauthorization of NAWCA is essential for the \n     protection and restoration of wetland habitat, which supports \n     an enormous variety of waterfowl, fish and other wildlife.\n       Reauthorization of the National Fish and Wildlife \n     Foundation (NFWF)\n       Since its inception, NFWF has leveraged $576 million in \n     federal funds into $2 billion in on-the-ground conservation. \n     The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation works with public \n     and private partners in all 50 states to protect species and \n     habitats and promote local stewardship of natural places, \n     from community parks to wildlife refuges. Reauthorization of \n     NWFW will ensure continued substantial leveraging of federal \n     dollars in the protection of species and habitats that \n     sportsmen depend on.\n       Permanent Electronic Duck Stamp Act\n       This title gives the Secretary of the Interior authority to \n     permanently authorize electronic duck stamps. For 80 years \n     duck stamps have served a dual role, both as a license to \n     hunt waterfowl and as one of the most effective and important \n     programs to protect wetland and wildlife refuge habitat. For \n     every dollar spent on federal duck stamps, 98 cents goes to \n     acquiring or leasing wetland habitat for protection in the \n     National Wildlife Refuge System. Permanently authorizing the \n     electronic duck stamp will significantly increase both access \n     to hunting licenses for sportsmen and protection of high \n     quality habitat for waterfowl and other species.\n       Further, the legislation does not include any of the \n     provisions included in H.R. 3590, the Sportsmen's Heritage \n     and Recreational Enhancement Act, that would undermine the \n     integrity of America's National Wilderness Preservation \n     system.\n       For these reasons, we urge you to support S. 1996, the \n     Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act.\n           Sincerely,\n     Alan Rowsome,\n       Senior Director of Government Relations for Lands, The \n     Wilderness Society.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     July 9, 2014.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Kay Hagan,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Lisa Murkowski,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid, Minority Leader McConnell, \n     Senator Hagan and Senator Murkowski: The sportsmen and women \n     conservationists who we represent across the Nation deeply \n     appreciate the strong bipartisan leadership that you have \n     shown to bring the Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act of 2014 (S. \n     2363) to the floor this week. S. 2363 includes valuable \n     provisions to conserve fish and wildlife habitat and expand \n     public access for hunters and anglers. We know that time on \n     the floor of the Senate is extremely limited and precious, \n     but we believe that this bill is worthy of expedited floor \n     consideration.\n       It is a rare and splendid occurrence that such a large and \n     diverse coalition of hunting, shooting, angling and other \n     conservation organizations are so united behind a bill. \n     Therefore, we urge you to maximize the value of such a rare \n     opportunity for sportsmen by ensuring that floor \n     consideration of this important legislation and amendments \n     filed to it will be open, transparent and limited to issues \n     that enhance our nation's rich sportsmen's heritage.\n       In particular, we urge you to oppose any amendments that \n     would derail the proposal by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \n     and Environmental Protection Agency to clarify and restore \n     longstanding Clean Water Act protections for headwater \n     streams and wetlands across the country. On June 3, 2014, we \n     and 12 other sportsmen's conservation groups wrote to you and \n     urged you to reject such legislation (attached). Such \n     legislation would severely undermine, not enhance, \n     sportsmen's interests.\n       Please take advantage of the great opportunity that you and \n     the outstanding group of bipartisan cosponsors of S. 2363 \n     have worked so hard to achieve on behalf of sportsmen this \n     week. Pass a strong sportsmen's bill.\n           Sincerely,\n       Collin O'Mara, President and CEO, National Wildlife \n     Federation; Whit Fosburgh, President and CEO, Theodore \n     Roosevelt Conservation Partnership; Scott Kovarovics, \n     Executive Director, Izaak Walton League of America; Chris \n     Wood, President and CEO, Trout Unlimited.\n\n  Mrs. HAGAN. I also want to share some excerpts from these letters and \nstatements.\n  This one is from the National Shooting Sports Foundation. The \nBipartisan Sportsmen's Act ``is simply the most important package of \nmeasures for the benefit of sportsmen in a generation. This package of \npro-sportsmen legislation will promote, protect, and preserve our \ncherished outdoor activities of hunting and the shooting sports.''\n  The CEOs of the National Wildlife Federation, Theodore Roosevelt \nConservation Partnership, Izaak Walton League of America, and Trout \nUnlimited, in one letter, wrote: The Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act of 2014 \n``includes valuable provisions to conserve fish and wildlife habitat \nand expand public access for hunters and anglers. We know that time on \nthe floor of the Senate is extremely limited and precious, but we \nbelieve that this bill is worthy of expedited floor consideration. It \nis a rare and splendid occurrence that such a large and diverse \ncoalition of hunting, shooting, angling and other conservation \norganizations are so united behind a bill.''\n  Then a letter from Jeff Crane, who is president of the Congressional \nSportsmen's Foundation. Senator Murkowski and I both have worked very \nclosely with Jeff Crane, who is president of the Congressional \nSportsmen's Foundation. In his letter he said:\n\n       We thank Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus Co-Chair Senator \n     Hagan and CSC member Senator Murkowski for introducing this \n     bipartisan package of legislation that includes provisions \n     vital to protecting our hunting and angling traditions in the \n     U.S., which the CSC and organizations within the sportsmen's \n     community have been working on for years.\n\n  From the Wilderness Society, in their letter:\n\n       On behalf of our 500,000 members and supporters, I am \n     writing to express our support for the Bipartisan Sportsmen's \n     Act of 2014. We believe that hunting and fishing are \n     important uses of our public lands, and this legislation \n     would advance several vital programs which would both \n     safeguard sportsmen's access to world class hunting and \n     angling opportunities while simultaneously supporting many \n     programs that protect the high quality fish and wildlife \n     habitat upon which sportsmen rely.\n\n  That was from the Wilderness Society.\n  The women of Safari Club International wrote to Senator Murkowski and \nme. This letter was dated in April.\n\n       We are delighted to learn you are working together to \n     introduce bipartisan pro-hunting and pro-conservation \n     legislation. Your ongoing effort to introduce bipartisan \n     legislation is a monumental step in breaking the deadlock \n     that hunters have felt in previous legislative efforts.\n\n\n[[Page S4377]]\n\n\n  The CEO of Ducks Unlimited said:\n\n       More than 140 million Americans participate in outdoor \n     recreation activities, including hunting and fishing. DU \n     appreciates the bipartisan effort of this bill in bringing to \n     light the economic impact and importance of sports men and \n     women to the United States. We are also grateful for its \n     inclusion of the North American Wetlands Conservation Act, \n     which is an ideal model for successful private-public \n     partnerships.\n\n  I agree. We have an opportunity today to take action on a bill that \nadvances critical priorities for a wide range of sportsmen and \nconservation groups across the country, bringing those two groups \ntogether.\n  I am proud of the package Senator Murkowski and I crafted and put \ntogether. I also recognize that Members on both sides of the aisle have \nideas on how to strengthen this bill.\n  It was always my hope we could take up, debate, and vote on \nsportsmen-related amendments to the bill, including amendments on some \ngun issues that are important to sports men and women in my State and \nacross the country. I am disappointed we were not able to reach an \nagreement to do so.\n  However, we should not let partisan politics get in the way of \npassing a good bill that already has strong bipartisan support. It is \nfiscally responsible, and it is endorsed by more than 40 groups and \nstakeholders across the United States--6 of whom I have just made \nstatements about from letters we have received.\n  So here is what I am going to ask all of my colleagues to do today: \nIf you support this bill, vote for this bill. Outdoor recreation \nactivities are a way of life in States across the country. Just as \nimportantly, they are the lifeblood of many of our local communities. \nThese activities actually contribute $145 billion to our economy every \nyear, and they support over 6 million jobs in this country. This is big \nbusiness--and especially at a time when we are looking at jobs and the \neconomic recovery.\n  So at a time when we are desperately trying to help the job market \nand get our economy back on track, I urge my colleagues to please put \npolitics aside and vote to move forward with this balanced bipartisan \nbill that boosts our economy, protects our outdoor traditions, and \npreserves the special places in this country where we hunt, where we \nfish, where we enjoy the outdoors, and to do this for our future \ngenerations.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Bipartisan \nSportsmen's Act, S.2363. This legislation aims to support outdoor \nrecreation by improving access for anglers, hunters, and recreational \nshooters. It would also advance conservation by reauthorizing programs \nthat protect wildlife species and habitats, wetlands, migratory birds, \nand waterfowl.\n  Hunting, angling, outdoor recreation, and conservation are important \neconomic contributors and support jobs in communities across the \ncountry, including many across the State of Maine. The Federal \nGovernment is an important partner in preserving our natural treasures, \nenhancing recreation, promoting economic growth, and helping to protect \nthe environment, which are all components in sustaining our Nation's \noutdoor heritage and traditions.\n  While I understand the concerns that have been raised about the need \nto strengthen the bill's conservation measures, on balance S.2363 would \nbenefit hunting, fishing, outdoor recreation, and conservation. One \nprovision would promote hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting on \nFederal public lands, preventing arbitrary closures. Another would help \nStates construct and maintain public shooting ranges by allowing a \nlarger proportion of Federal funding to be used for this purpose. \nAdditionally, the bill would reauthorize the North American Wetlands \nConservation Act and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, which \nleverage funding for critical wetlands, migratory birds, native fish \nand wildlife species, and habitat projects. A permanent authorization \nof electronic duck stamps, the proceeds of which go to the Migratory \nBird Conservation Fund, is also included in the bill.\n  I am also pleased to be the sponsor of a bipartisan amendment that \nhighlights the many important contributions of the Land and Water \nConservation Fund over the last 50 years. In addition to calling for \nthe reauthorization of this landmark conservation program, the \namendment calls for full, permanent, and dedicated funding, making good \non the promise that was made to the American people in 1964 to take the \nproceeds from natural resource development and invest a small portion \nin conservation and outdoor recreation. I am deeply concerned about the \ncontinued annual diversion of these funds from their original \nconservation intent to other purposes. We will not balance our Nation's \nbooks today by shortchanging our future.\n  Upholding Maine's strong tradition of outdoor recreation, including \nhunting and fishing, and protecting access to the great outdoors for \nthe enjoyment of all Americans continue to be priorities of mine. I \nalso strongly support conservation programs and actions to preserve \nwildlife and natural habitats. The people of Maine have always been \nfaithful stewards of our environment because we understand its \ntremendous value to our way of life. The Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act \nwould have a positive impact on hunting, fishing, outdoor recreation, \nand conservation, and I support its passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/10/senate-section/article/S4377-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, for those students who are out there \ntrying to learn what goes on in the Senate and for those professors who \nteach what goes on in the Senate, this is not totally new, but this is \nin the category of being fairly new.\n  This is an example of the Republicans filibustering not one of our \nbills but their own bill. How about that? There are 26 Republican \ncosponsors, and they filibustered their own bill.\n  We have asked on a number of occasions for what we have done around \nthis body for decades: You come up with a list of amendments, you come \nup with a list of amendments, and we will work through those \namendments.\n  Do you know why we don't do that anymore? The Republicans cannot \nagree among themselves what they want as amendments. They cannot come \nup with a list. They are so tangled up with the tea party here, the tea \nparty there, people running for President, they cannot decide on a list \nof amendments to bring before the body. So what do they do? They block \neverything.\n  I was hoping that with the majority of the Republicans sponsoring a \nbill, we could at least move forward on it. People who sponsored this \nbill voted against it. They are bringing to this body a new definition \nof what it means to sponsor legislation. I mean, who, of the people who \nhave come before us in this body, ever voted to filibuster their own \nbill? That is what they have done. But it is nothing new.\n  I see on the floor the senior Senator from New Hampshire. She worked \nfor more than a year with some Republican colleagues to do something \nthat is so badly needed in this country now; that is, energy \nefficiency. Energy is wasted every day in this country. She and some \nRepublican colleagues worked on a measure to reduce the waste of \nenergy. It is called the energy efficiency bill. Guess what. The \nRepublicans voted to kill their own bill.\n  I was originally told by Republicans: Go ahead and let's just vote on \nit as it is.\n  I thought that was great because they had been working on it in \ncommittee. They had a significant number of amendments that had been \ndealt with before on the floor, and they put them in the bill and they \nbrought it to the floor. But then I am told--and I have said this \nbefore, and I will say it again because we need to repeat something \nthat needs repeating--give us a vote on the Keystone Pipeline. All we \nwant is a sense of the Senate.\n  I didn't like that because we already had an agreement. I came back \nand said: OK, do it.\n  Then we came back after a recess of a few days, and they said: Well, \nwe have a new deal now.\n  What is that?\n  We want an up-or-down vote on Keystone.\n  We cannot do that. We already have an agreement to get this moving.\n  I go back and mostly talk to myself, quite frankly, because it is not \nvery logical what I am being asked to do, but I talk to myself for a \nwhile, and I come back and say: OK, on Keystone, an up-or-down vote \nright here on the Senate floor.\n  They couldn't take yes for an answer even on that.\n  And then--the audacity--Republican Senators have come to the floor \nsince then and said: They won't give us a vote on Keystone.\n  They did it on Shaheen-Portman. We had an economic development \nrevitalization act. One of the Republican cosponsors there voted to \nblock that. Small business innovation--three Republican cosponsors \nvoted to block that.\n  This is a new phenomenon for the professors and the students to \nfigure out. You sponsor a bill and then you vote to kill it before you \neven bring it to the floor. So I guess sponsorship doesn't mean what it \nused to mean anymore. It means ``I am sponsoring this bill, but watch \nout because I may vote against myself.''\n  So we are going to continue to work on this side of the aisle to try \nto get work done, but observers need to look no further than Republican \nsponsors voting against their own bills to see where the problem lies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/10/senate-section/article/S4378-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4378-S4384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   NOMINATION OF SHAUN L.S.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Childcare Tax Credit\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \ndiscuss legislation that I introduced this week with our colleagues, \nBarbara Boxer, Patty Murray and Kirsten Gillibrand. Our legislation \nresponds to the rising cost of childcare in the United States and the \nimpact it is having on millions of working families.\n  Our bill, called the Helping Working Families Afford Child Care Act, \nwould help these working parents. It would help them afford childcare \nso they can go to work and support their families. What it does is \nupdate the child and dependent care tax credit that was passed in 1976 \nand has only been updated once since that time.\n  Access to affordable childcare is a necessity for working parents. I \nraised three daughters and I have seven grandchildren, so I appreciate \njust how important it is for working parents to know their children are \nbeing supervised by quality caregivers.\n\n[[Page S4379]]\n\n  Sadly, I struggled with childcare from the time my first child was \nborn in 1974 until the year my last child finally went off to college \nin 2004. Unfortunately, I am watching my daughters deal with that same \nstruggle of how to find quality childcare for their kids.\n  A working parent can be productive in the workforce only when they \nknow their children are safe. That is why the rising cost of childcare \nis a real burden for millions of families--especially for working \nmothers. Childcare costs are taking up an increasingly larger share of \na typical family's take-home pay.\n  I visited a great NAEYC accredited childcare center in Nashua, NH, \nearlier this week, and I saw their infant room--where they care for \ninfants. The average cost for full-time care for an infant in New \nHampshire in a childcare center was almost $12,000 in 2012, the last \nyear for which we have data. It costs $12,000. For a family trying to \nmake ends meet, this is a huge cost.\n  In fact, in the Northeast the cost of full-time, center-based care \nfor children now represents the highest single expense for a typical \nhousehold. It costs more than housing, more than college tuition, more \nthan transportation, food, utilities or health care.\n  Unfortunately, as the cost of childcare has grown, one critical tax \ncredit that helps defray childcare costs has failed to keep pace. The \nchild and dependent care tax credit was first enacted in 1976 with \nstrong bipartisan. It was supported by both Democrats and Republicans. \nThis credit provides a tax credit to working parents for a portion of \ntheir childcare expenses. However, the limits on the credit are not \nindexed to inflation, and so their value has actually decreased over \ntime. In fact, the limits have been increased just once in the past 25 \nyears. The tax credit simply is not keeping pace with the growing cost \nof childcare.\n  The Helping Working Families Afford Child Care Act would update and \nimprove this tax credit so it responds to the increasing burden of \nchildcare costs. First, the bill would increase the amount of childcare \nexpenses that are eligible for the credit. Right now families can only \nclaim expenses up to $3,000 for one child and $6,000 for two or more \nchildren. That just doesn't make sense in New Hampshire or anywhere \nelse in the country. In New Hampshire the average cost of childcare can \nexceed $12,000 for a single child.\n  This bill increases the tax credit starting in 2015 and indexes the \ncost to inflation so they will continue to keep pace with rising \nchildcare costs. The bill also makes the tax credit fully refundable \nand phases out the credit for families making over $200,000 a year. It \nbetter targets how the money is spent.\n  Right now the tax credit is poorly targeted. It provides zero benefit \nfor too many families who need it the most. By making the credit \nrefundable, the bill better targets the tax credit to families who are \nmost in need of childcare assistance.\n  I have been working on early childcare and education for most of my \npublic career, especially during my years as Governor of New Hampshire. \nOne of the lessons I have learned is that providing access to early and \naffordable childcare and education is not just about helping families \nmake ends meet--although that is an important piece of it--it is also a \nshort-term and long-term issue for our businesses and our economy.\n  As Governor I worked with the New Hampshire business community and \nestablished the Governor's Business Commission on Child Care and Early \nChildhood Education to engage business leaders in addressing the \nState's childcare and early education needs. We did a study that looked \nat the impact of the shortage of quality childcare in New Hampshire \nback in the 1990s. We found that businesses were losing up to $24 \nmillion a year as a result of childcare-related absenteeism, and nearly \none in four employees was forced to change jobs or switch to part time \nas a result of their inability to find satisfactory childcare.\n\n  We have many national studies that show that quality, dependable \nchildcare for employees is vital to a company's productivity. In fact, \nresearchers estimate that childcare breakdowns leading to employee \nabsences cost businesses $3 billion a year because parents are \nconcerned about where their kids are.\n  In addition, a majority of companies report that employee absenteeism \nis reduced when quality childcare services are offered. Employee \nturnover is also reduced, and we know how important employee retention \nis to a business's bottom line.\n  The long-term benefits to our workforce are also clear. Research \nshows that quality childcare and early childhood development are \ncritical to preparing our children for tomorrow's jobs. We know that \nthe first 5 years are the most critical in the development of a child's \nbrain. During these years children develop their cognitive, social, \nemotional, and language skills that form a solid foundation for their \nlives.\n  Research shows that children who received quality childcare do much \nbetter in school; they are less likely to drop out; they are more \nlikely to read at grade level; they are less likely to repeat grades; \nthey are less likely to need special education; and they are less \nlikely to get into trouble. The experiences children have in their \nfirst few years will affect them, their families, and our society for \nthe rest of their lives. I think it makes more sense for us to invest \nin early childhood care and education because we can either spend the \nmoney then or we can spend a whole lot more money later. When kids \ndon't get a good start in life, they wind up getting into trouble and \ncan end up in prison.\n  I used to talk about the cost of early care and education being about \n$1 for $7 that gets spent at the other end if we don't pay for these \ncosts. It is a whole lot cheaper to pay for childcare than it is to pay \nfor prison. That is why we have to respond to the rising cost of \nchildcare. We have to ensure that working families can afford quality \nchildcare.\n  The legislation we introduced this week will help working families in \nthe short term, and it will especially help working mothers as they go \nto work. It will support the early development of our children, which \nis so critical to our future, our economy, and our workforce.\n  I am hopeful we can get a lot of sponsors for this legislation and \nget bipartisan support just as the credit had when it passed in 1976 so \nwe can provide the help that working families need.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I first wish to say to the \ndistinguished majority leader that the recent filibuster was supported \nby a number of Democratic Members, but most importantly it was \nsupported by Members who did, in fact, favor the legislation. The \nreason they refused to go forward with the bill is because Senator \nReid--in a dictatorial manner--has announced that he intends to control \namendments. You don't get an amendment unless you grovel to the \nmajority leader.\n  There is no reference to the majority leader in the Constitution of \nthe United States. He doesn't get to tell an individual Senator they \ncan't have an amendment on a bill. He has been doing that consistently, \nand it is not right. We have been on this bill long enough to cast 10 \nor 15 votes. It is not a question of time as to why he will not allow \namendments.\n  The reason the majority leader will not allow amendments is because \nhe wants to protect his Members from actually being held accountable by \nthe voters of the United States of America by having to cast votes and \nchoose sides. That is what it is all about. It has gone on way too \nlong. It is demeaning to this Senate, and he demeans the loyal \nopposition who are doing the only thing they have as a tool, which is \nrefusing to move forward with a bill because the majority leader is \ngoing to use parliamentary maneuvers to block anybody's amendment. I \nwish it were not true.\n  I will not go quietly and allow him to come down and blame others for \nthe problem he has caused. We could have already had this bill up for \nfinal passage. It is not a question of time. It is a question of \ncontrol and domination of the Senate, and the majority leader is not \nentitled to do that. He is not entitled to do that, and it is not going \nto continue. This will be broken sooner or later.\n  If the majority leader wants to move important legislation, he is \ngoing to\n\n[[Page S4380]]\n\nhave to agree to a process that allows duly elected representatives of \nvarious States in America to be able to at least offer an amendment.\n\n  My remarks today are to discuss the nomination of Shaun Donovan to be \nthe Director of the Office of Management and Budget. This is a very \nimportant office.\n  I voted against Mr. Donovan in the Budget Committee, and I wish to \ntake this opportunity to share with my colleagues my concerns. My \nconcerns are not related to his character or personality or decency but \nhis experience and qualifications to serve as the Nation's chief \nfinancial manager--the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.\n  Alexander Hamilton explained in Federalist 76 why the Senate was \nassigned a role in the confirmation process:\n\n       It would be an excellent check upon the spirit of \n     favoritism in the President, and would tend greatly to \n     prevent the appointment of unfit characters from State \n     prejudice, from family connection, from personal attachment, \n     or from a view to popularity.\n\n  The President has the right to nominate, and his nominations should \nbe given deference, but as Hamilton made clear, when the President's \nnominee does not have the fitness necessary for a critical position, \nthe Senate should not provide its consent.\n  The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is one of the \nmost important positions in the entire government, entrusted to oversee \nour massive Federal bureaucracy and budget process during a time when \nthe Nation is facing tremendous financial danger.\n  Only weeks ago the Director of the Congressional Budget Office \nreaffirmed in testimony before Congress that the debt of this country \nis on an ``unsustainable path,'' and he meant exactly that. He went on \nto say that America faces the ``risk of a fiscal crisis.'' He means \nGreece when he says ``a fiscal crisis.''\n  Whoever holds the job of budget director must be one of the toughest, \nstrongest, most able, and disciplined managers in America. We ought to \nbe looking for the very best. We need someone who already understands \nthis massive Federal Government, the financial stresses we are under, \nwhere the problems arise, and how to manage it.\n  We need somebody with the capability and credibility to deal with \nstrong-willed cabinet people who, as history shows, always want to \nspend more and need to be told no by the Office of Management and \nBudget.\n  Sadly, what has become clear is that the President did not choose Mr. \nDonovan because he met those criteria. That was not what he was looking \nfor. Mr. Donovan does not come close to meeting those qualifications. \nHe just does not. I enjoyed meeting with him, but I asked him questions \nthat deal with fundamental issues everybody in Congress understands but \nhe doesn't understand because he hasn't had experience with them. \nInstead, it would seem Mr. Donovan, as with the President's past Budget \nDirectors, was chosen because he has good people skills and personality \nand is politically loyal and would defend the administration's goals \nand priorities even when the result might be unfavorable to the \npublic's fiscal health.\n\n  We have seen this time and again in the President's Budget Office. \nHis past Budget Directors have done more to conceal financial problems \nthe Congressional Budget Office has told us we face than to illuminate \nthose problems. They have steadfastly sought to avoid serious \ndiscussions about the unsustainable debt course we are on and to lay \nout any credible policies to fix that problem. They have been \nunresponsive to congressional inquiry. They make false statements about \nwhat their budget would actually do. Indeed, they have repeated--Mr. \nLew did when he was Director--that our budget would pay down the debt \nwhen, in fact, there was not a single year in his 10-year budget that \nthe deficit was less than $500 billion. They have tried to break \nspending caps that are agreed to by the President and are in law, and \nthey refused to comply with legal requirements to submit a plan to \nprevent Medicare's insolvency--an edict the law requires him to do, and \nPresident Bush did.\n  The Office of Management and Budget should be one of the least \npolitical departments in government. Instead, the President has made it \none of the most political. Shouldn't the American people be able to \nlook to their Budget Director with confidence, knowing their tax \ndollars have been entrusted to someone with great wisdom and experience \nand independence? Shouldn't they be able to know their Budget Director \nwill look the American people in the eye and tell them squarely what \nthe true facts are we are facing today, and is someone who could lay \nout a plan that would actually work to fix the debt course we are on?\n  The President had the ability to scour the country for the most \nskilled, talented, disciplined, and gifted manager he could find for \nthis office. Very few people of prominence would turn down a request \nfrom the President to fulfill that duty. A renowned manager of great \nfinancial acumen and recognized independence is what we are looking \nfor--someone with a track record, a proven record of saving taxpayers' \ndollars, developing new efficiencies, taking on entrenched interest in \nthe service of the public good, not the special interest good. They \nhave to be capable of meeting with someone such as Paul Ryan, chairman \nof the House Budget Committee, to meet with members of the Budget \nCommittee such as Senator Rob Portman who was also a former OMB \nDirector; Senator Pat Toomey, Senator Chuck Grassley, Senator Ron \nJohnson, a businessman and an accountant. They know about these \nmatters. They have been working on them. They have been negotiating and \nproducing plans. Mr. Donovan has no knowledge of them. He cannot \ndiscuss it with them intelligently. He has no background in that. He \nhas shown no interest in it. I suspect Mr. Donovan was stunned when he \nwas offered this job. He certainly has not prepared himself for it. I \nam not criticizing him specifically as a person; I am saying this is \nnot the kind of person we need today. There is nothing in his \nbackground to suggest he is up to the task this urgent hour requires.\n  More troublingly, Mr. Donovan himself has a poor record of financial \nmanagement at HUD. He is the Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment. During his tenure HUD has received repeated and stark \ncriticism from his own agency's inspector general. They appoint, within \nthese Cabinet positions, an inspector general who analyzes and acts \nindependently to advise the Secretary and the Congress if something is \nwrong. Well, I would suggest what I am going to say evidences that Mr. \nDonovan's skill is in spending money and making investments rather than \nsaving dollars and managing money.\n  His record at HUD shows he spent money illegally, violating the \nAntideficiency Act--a very important act. On the great financial issue \nof our time--our Nation's crippling debt burden--I asked Mr. Donovan at \nthe hearing in the Budget Committee about what he would propose to fix \nthe unsustainable debt course. Shouldn't he do that? He offered no \nserious ideas to get our debt under control. Clearly, he has no \nintention of providing the leadership needed to reverse our disastrous \ncurrent debt course.\n  For instance, the President's most recent 10-year budget plan he \nsubmitted would break the in-law spending limits he agreed to and \nincrease our Nation's total debt by an average of $800 billion a year. \nOver the next 10 years, under his budget plan, we could be expected to \naverage deficits of $800 billion a year, almost $1 trillion. Indeed, in \nthe 10th year, it is virtually $1 trillion.\n  I asked Mr. Donovan about this and he replied:\n\n       The President's . . . budget includes fully-paid for, \n     fiscally responsible investments that will create jobs, grow \n     the economy, and expand opportunity for all Americans.\n\n  That is the answer we got. I submit that is not responsible. That is \nnot serious. He is not in touch with reality.\n  When Mr. Donovan was forced to admit in follow-up written questions \nthat the President's budget plan would add $6 trillion to the public \ndebt over the next 10 years, he called the increase ``nominal.'' It is \nprecisely this cavalier attitude from government elites that is leading \nour Nation to financial catastrophe. CBO says these deficits put us on \na path to a fiscal crisis. Last year we paid $220 billion in interest \non our $17 billion debt. But the \n\n[[Page S4381]]\n\nCongressional Budget Office projects that interest rates are going to \nreturn to more normal levels in a few years and we continue to add more \ndeficits every year. They project that in 10 years, interest on the \ndebt will be $800 billion. It will pass the defense budget--interest in \n1 year will pass the size of the defense budget by 2019. This is \ndangerous. We cannot continue on this course.\n\n  I would also share that in talking to my colleagues about their \ndiscussions with Mr. Donovan, they expressed concern that when he met \nwith them individually, he lacked basic knowledge about the \nfundamentals of the Federal budget. Consider the written testimony he \nlater provided to the committee about his specific plans for \nentitlement reform--mandatory spending reform. He said:\n\n       I have not . . . written any papers or given any talks or \n     lectures that specifically lay out a comprehensive plan for \n     Medicare or Social Security.\n\n  So this is the person who is supposed to coordinate the effort to \nrein in spending and put us on a sound path. I would say not only has \nhe not written any papers or given any lectures, I am not aware he has \ngiven any thought at all to fixing Medicare and Social Security, two of \nthe biggest challenges this Nation faces. I don't think he has ever \nexpressed a serious thought about these issues.\n  In response to one question about Medicare data, Mr. Donovan told me \nthe data did not exist. But the data does, in fact, exist. And his \nresponse cited the very report from which the data was found. At his \nhearing, Mr. Donovan could not answer fundamental questions from \nSenator Johnson about the Social Security trust fund. That is very \nimportant. With only 2 years left in the President's Administration, \nthe Nation needs to have someone at OMB who can hit the ground running, \nwho knows these issues.\n  I asked him about defense. I am a senior member of the Armed Services \nCommittee. He didn't understand the F-35 program. He is not able to \nconverse intelligently about the troop levels we are talking about \nhaving to reduce. He couldn't talk about aircraft carriers--something \nhe has never had any experience with whatsoever. That is why he \ncouldn't talk about it, and he has never given any thought to it.\n  This lack of basic knowledge and professionalism is evidenced in the \ninspector general reports about his tenure at Housing and Urban \nDevelopment. Here, for instance, is a representative example from an IG \nreport issued on February 19 of this year about his multifamily project \nrefinances program. They came up with a plan that supposedly refinanced \nhousing loans and saved money. This is what the inspector general said:\n\n       HUD did not have adequate controls to ensure that all \n     Section 202 refinancing resulted in economical and efficient \n     outcomes.\n\n  They went on to say:\n\n       Specifically, (1) HUD did not ensure that at least half the \n     debt service savings that resulted from refinancing were used \n     to benefit tenants or reduce housing assistance payments, (2) \n     consistent accountability for the debt service savings was \n     not always maintained, and (3) some refinancing were \n     processed for projects that had negative debt service \n     savings--\n\n  In other words, instead of saving money, the refinancings cost money.\n\n     --which resulted in higher debt service costs than before the \n     refinancing.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       These deficiencies were due to HUD's lack of adequate \n     oversight and inconsistent nationwide policy implementation \n     regarding debt service savings realized from Section 202 \n     refinancing activities. As a result, millions of dollars in \n     debt service savings were not properly accounted for and \n     available, the savings may not have been used to benefit \n     tenants or for the reduction of housing assistance payments, \n     and some refinanced projects ended up costing HUD additional \n     housing assistance payments because of the additional cost \n     for debt service.\n\n  That is not the kind of glowing review one would hope to accompany a \nnominee to an office who would oversee the entire Government of the \nUnited States of America.\n  But the problems get worse. Every year, the HUD inspector general \nconducts an audit to determine if HUD's financial statements are in \norder. When an agency's financial statements are in order, that agency \nis awarded an unqualified or clean audit, meaning there are no material \ndefects in the way the agency is managing its books. For the years 2012 \nand 2013, under Secretary Donovan's leadership, HUD received failing \ngrades or a qualified audit, which means material problems were found \nwith HUD's financial statements. Twenty-four agencies undergo the audit \nprocess every year. Only two failed in 2013: HUD and DOD. And we all \nknow DOD has never yet reached the kind of accounting the government \nrequires in that massive agency. So HUD is the only non-DOD agency that \nfailed last year.\n  Whereas DOD has historically had problems with financial statements, \nHUD had, prior to Mr. Donovan, received clean reports. The inspector \ngeneral, in failing Mr. Donovan, noted that HUD had improper budgetary \naccounting and lacked proper accounting for cash management. HUD, under \nMr. Donovan's watch, was also recently charged with an Antideficiency \nAct violation by the inspector general--a big problem, in my opinion. \nIt is serious.\n  The Antideficiency Act essentially prohibits government employees or \nagencies from spending money that has not been appropriated by \nCongress. No President, no Cabinet Secretary can spend money under the \nConstitution that has not been appropriated for that purpose by \nCongress.\n  So according to information received from the HUD inspector general, \nHUD, under Mr. Donovan's watch, has at least seven instances of \nviolating the Antideficiency Act. These violations include \noverobligation of personnel or payroll funds, making student loan \npayments in excess of the funds allowed for that purpose, and \nobligating funds that were no longer available, and some of these were \ndone after clear warnings to stop it.\n  In one of the most recent violations, HUD paid more than $620,000 to \na senior adviser to Secretary Donovan--personally his adviser, his \nstaff--but they paid for it not from Mr. Donovan's budget for that \npurpose--to hire staff with--they paid for it out of the Office of \nPublic and Indian Housing funds even though Mr. Donovan's adviser in \nhis office was not employed in the Office of Public and Indian Housing \nsection. This adviser's pay was required to come from the funds in the \nsecretary's office, his budget.\n  The inspector general found that HUD had ignored the advice of its \nown legal counsel and disregarded concerns that had been previously \nexpressed by the House Appropriations Committee on antideficiency \nmatters at HUD.\n  I do not see how he could not be aware of this. This is his own \nadviser. His own lawyer said: You should not pay for it out of the \nOffice of Public and Indian Housing funds. But he did it anyway.\n  Congress had specifically addressed HUD's salary funding for the \nSecretary's senior advisers--it had been a subject of House discussion, \nwhich is unusual--and previous ADA violations. According to a July 26, \n2010, House of Representatives report, ``all senior advisors to the \nSecretary should be funded directly through the Office of the \nSecretary.'' Of course. In addition, a HUD appropriations attorney in \nthe HUD staff wrote in a January 13, 2011, email that a special adviser \nto the Office of the Secretary would need to be paid by that office--\nthe Secretary's office--and not another office within HUD. Despite the \ndirection in the House report and guidance from his own appropriations \nattorney, HUD paid this adviser for his services from the Office of \nPublic and Indian Housing program.\n  Subsequently, in June 2012, Congress again admonished HUD for the \nlack of staffing data it provided and had available internally. \nCongress wrote:\n\n       This lack of essential information led to multiple Anti-\n     Deficiency Act violations in fiscal year 2011, in which HUD \n     hired more people than it had resources to pay. To date, HUD \n     has not even tried to address these problems and thus the \n     Committee has no faith in HUD's ability to appropriately \n     staff its operations.\n\n  It is a very serious criticism of the management ability of the man \nnow put in charge of managing an entire government. It is not the kind \nof activity that warrants a promotion.\n  Finally, I have to say this. I have to mention this little matter: \nMr. Donovan's membership in the Owl Club at Harvard--an item many of \nour Democratic colleagues found most reprehensible when Justice Alito \ncame up for\n\n[[Page S4382]]\n\nconfirmation for the Supreme Court. This is a club the late Senator Ted \nKennedy, resigned from because it did not admit female members. Indeed, \nHarvard kicked the club off campus in 1984, but that was the very year \nMr. Donovan became a member and remained so until 1987. I have heard no \ncomplaints from my colleagues about Mr. Donovan's membership in the Owl \nClub even after it was kicked off campus, but they howled mightily when \nJustice Alito was found to be a member of a similar club at Princeton.\n  So I would ask my colleagues, in conclusion, does this sound like the \nbackground of someone who really is the right man for the job at this \ntime? That is my fundamental concern. I do not believe his background, \nskills, and record indicate he is ready for one of the toughest jobs in \ngovernment.\n  This President, even more than most Presidents in their second term--\nand they all tend to do this--is surrounding himself closer and closer \nwith a small group of political loyalists--Secretary Lew, Secretary \nJohnson, Secretary Perez. So do we need another loyalist who protects \nhim better? Wouldn't the American people and the President himself be \nbetter off with a strong, capable manager who can see through all the \nfog and the political falderal and make good decisions, preserving the \ntaxpayers' resources?\n  We need someone who will act independently on behalf of the President \nand the American people, who will respect the jurisdiction of Congress \nand legitimate congressional powers, who will follow the law and submit \na Medicare plan, as the law requires, because it is going into default. \nThe law says if it goes into default and the Medicare trustees send a \nnotice--and they have--the President is supposed to submit a plan to \nfix it. OMB is the place that has always come from. It has come from \nthere previously. And shouldn't he tell the White House no if he is \nasked to do something that is improper for the financial future of \nAmerica?\n  Well, I do not like having to oppose Mr. Donovan. He seems like a \nnice person. But he is the wrong man for this important job. I think he \nhas been chosen for the wrong reasons, not for the right reasons. I \nwill oppose his nomination. The President himself, I truly believe, and \nthe Nation would benefit from the most capable, strong, and competent \nnominee the country can produce at this critical time. That's not Mr. \nDonovan.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kaine and Mr. Portman pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 2584 are printed in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, the committee which I am privileged to \nchair, the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and on \nwhich Senator Portman serves is responsible for working with the \nadministration and others to help make sure that Federal agencies work \nbetter and more efficiently with the resources we entrust to them.\n  During my years of public service, I have learned that an essential \ningredient in enabling organizations of any type to work well is \nleadership. It is what they say about integrity: If you have it, \nnothing else matters; if you don't have it, nothing else matters. In an \norganization, if you have great leadership, that is most important.\n  That is the case both in government and the private sector and in \norganizations large and small. Part of our responsibility here is \nensuring that we have effective leaders in place across our Federal \nGovernment.\n  It is every Senator's constitutional role to provide advice and \nconsent on the President's nominations in a thorough and timely manner \nas part of the Senate's confirmation process.\n  Today we have an important nomination before us. It is the nomination \nof Shaun Donovan to be Director of the Office of Management and Budget. \nI wish to express my sincere gratitude, not just to Secretary Donovan \nfor his willingness to take on this critical role, but also I wish to \nthank his wife. I would like to thank his two boys who joined him at a \nhearing, and I want to say if my son were that age, there is no way he \ncould sit through that: attentive, listening, thoughtful. What a \ntribute to their dad. It is all well and good what the rest of us \nthink, but to have that kind of show of support from teenagers is \npretty amazing these days.\n  While Shaun has very large shoes to fill left by Sylvia Mathews \nBurwell, I believe he is up to the task and, maybe more importantly, \nshe believes he is up to the task. Sylvia is somebody who we admire \ndeeply around here. She did a great job as OMB Director. She is now the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services.\n  She has known Shaun Donovan since they were undergraduates together \nat Harvard. She knows what he is made of, she knows his values, she \nknows just how smart, how bright, and also just how hard-working he is, \nand she has known him for a long, long time.\n  Secretary Donovan's nomination was successfully reported out of both \nthe Senate Budget Committee and the Senate Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. I am hopeful that we will be able to do \nour part today and vote to fill this key vacancy.\n  We know that Secretary Donovan is a strong leader who can take on and \nsolve tough problems. As Secretary of the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development for the past 5 years, he has guided our Nation \nthrough one of the worst housing crises in our lifetime.\n  We also know that Secretary Donovan is someone who can cut through \nred tape and work together with agencies more effectively. That is \nprecisely why the President asked him to chair the Hurricane Sandy \nRebuilding Task Force--and boy did he do a job.\n  He has also had high-level experience in local government, as \ncommissioner of the New York City Department of Housing Preservation \nand Development, and has worked in the private sector and the nonprofit \nsector. He knows this job. He knows his governing responsibilities from \nall angles. He knows how the Federal budget is impacted not only by \nFederal agencies but communities, businesses, and individual Americans \nand their families.\n  I believe he has the diverse experience, strong work ethic, and \nleadership skills to get the job done and successfully continue his \npublic service as Director of OMB.\n  As Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Secretary Donovan \nwill be faced with helping to lead our country back to a more fiscally \nsustainable path. Let me just say, 5 years ago when this administration \ntook office, they inherited a deficit that was $1 trillion. After the \nstimulus package, it was $1.4 trillion. This year we expect it to have \nbeen reduced by two-thirds. Is that good enough? Should we be satisfied \nand pat ourselves on the back? No, but we are headed in the right \ndirection. Under Shaun's stewardship we will continue to do just that.\n  I believe that the grand budget compromise that we need, though, must \nhave three essential ingredients:\n  No. 1, we need entitlement reform that saves money, saves those \nprograms for our children and grandchildren, and does not savage old \npeople or poor people.\n  No. 2, we need tax reform, and not only to lower--in my view--the \ncorporate rates to be competitive with the rest of the world. We can \nforget all this inversions mess--the nonsense that is going on. We need \nto do that but also do tax reform and do it in a way that actually \ngenerates some additional revenues, and then we use those revenues for \ndeficit reduction.\n  No. 3, we need to look at everything we do in government and ask this \nquestion: How do we get a better result for less money--everything we \ndo from A to Z--and act accordingly.\n  OMB is critically involved in all three of those approaches, whether \nit is entitlement reform that is consistent with the values for the \nleast of these in our society or tax reform that generates some \nadditional revenues and lowers corporate rates. We are actually getting \nmore for our money in everything we do.\n  OMB is essential and critical, and the OMB Director is going to be \nthe point person for making sure we continue to make progress in each \nof those three areas.\n  I know from my own conversations with Shaun Donovan--which now \nstretch over 5 years--he will be a strong voice for fiscal \nresponsibility and effective government management.\n\n[[Page S4383]]\n\nAs Senator Collins and I pointed out in introducing Secretary Donovan \nbefore our committee just a couple of weeks ago, he is known for using \nrigorous data analysis to demand better results from government \nprograms and to save taxpayer money. She also pointed out he will be a \nleader of integrity and intelligence in a critical job.\n  I mentioned the word ``integrity'' before, and I will say it again: \nIntegrity, if you have it, nothing else matters; if you don't have it, \nnothing else matters.\n  He has integrity. He is a bright guy, a very smart guy, hard-working, \na wonderful family, and a great track record--not just in government \nbut in the private sector, nonprofits, local, State, and Federal \ngovernments.\n\n  He has demonstrated what he can do leading a big agency such as \nHousing and Urban Development and how he can lead in a cross-agency way \nwhen we were suffering under Superstorm Sandy, which came right through \nour part of the country.\n  I think he is well qualified for the position for which he is \nnominated. I am pleased the President nominated him, and I am pleased \nSylvia Mathews Burwell is still around over at HHS.\n  Sean has done a wonderful job at HUD, and he will do a great job at \nOMB. I am pleased to support his nomination, and I hope all my \ncolleagues will as well.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the vote on confirmation of the Donovan \nnomination occur at 2:05 p.m. and that Senator Murray be in control of \nthe final 2 minutes prior to the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                     Unaccompanied Border Children\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise today to discuss the growing \ncrisis of unaccompanied alien children streaming across our southern \nborder. It has been called a mounting crisis, including the security \ncrisis it is. There are some 52,000 who have come across in the last \nseveral months, according to recent reports--up from just a few \nthousand 1 year ago--and the threat is that will grow significantly. It \nis continuing to grow.\n  This has been called a humanitarian crisis, and it is. These are, in \nmost cases, vulnerable children who were taken through by human \nsmugglers, by drug cartels, by other folks who do not--absolutely do \nnot--have their best interests in mind. These children are often \nmistreated in all sorts of despicable ways through that journey.\n  How do we address this crisis? It seems to me we need to get our core \nresponse right, and the only way to stop this increasing flow is to \nmake clear this activity will not be successful.\n  The only way to do that is to detain these illegal aliens in our \ncountry and keep them under our supervision until we quickly deport \nthem to their countries of origin.\n  That is the only response, the only message, the only visual that \nwill stop this mounting flow from continuing to grow. That is the most \nhumanitarian response that will stop more and more of these Central and \nSouth American children from being put in this illegal trade and being \nvictimized along the way.\n  Now, unfortunately, so far, that is not the response President Obama \nhas made.\n  After speaking for weeks about the 2008 change in immigration law as \na factor in this scenario, when President Obama presented a request to \nCongress on this issue, he did not request any change in that law. He \ntalked about it. He pointed to that law for weeks saying this was the \nroot cause of the problem. Yet in his request to Congress he is not \nproposing we change that law.\n  Instead, all he is proposing is more money--a lot more money--$3.7 \nbillion. Now, some more response and some more resources are \nundoubtedly necessary, but the lion's share of that, again, doesn't go \nto enforcement, doesn't go to deportation, doesn't go to sending these \nillegals back to their home country quickly, humanely, and efficiently. \nIt goes to feeding them and housing them in this country for an \nextended, indefinite period of time.\n  That is not what we need again.\n  What we need, instead, is whatever changes to the law are necessary \nto allow us to detain these folks in a proper, humane way and quickly \nmove them back to their home countries. We need the will and the \nresources to get that done in a quick, efficient way. That is what I \nwill be proposing with many others in both the House and the Senate.\n  For this to work we also need the will and the cooperation of the \nadministration, and I am concerned that there isn't that real focus, \nreal determination, and real will. It is great to have the right law \nwritten down on a piece of paper, the right words on a page, but it is \nequally as important--perhaps more important--to have the right \nadministration, the right spirit, the right execution, the right \nfollow-through on those words on a page.\n  Unfortunately, we haven't had that in the Obama administration \neither.\n  The Los Angeles Times, not exactly a right-leaning publication, has \nnoted that deportations of illegals has plummeted from the high in \n2008, plummeted every year since then, to an absolute low in 2013 of \nabout 1,669--from a high of 8,100, down each and every year to 1,600.\n  This first drop probably had a lot to do with the change in the law \nto which President Obama has alluded. We need to fix that. But these \nother drops have to do with the spirit, the focus, and the \ndetermination--or lack thereof--of the present administration.\n  Similarly, about 600 minors--all illegals--were ordered deported each \nyear from nonborder States a decade ago--a decade ago 600 and last year \nonly 95. Again, this is the same plummeting trend, the same absolutely \nplummeting trend. That is what we need to fundamentally reverse.\n  To reverse that I have joined with other Members, as I suggested, to \nget the right solution in Congress, both changes in the law we need to \nmake and the resources we need to hold these illegal aliens and quickly \nturn around the flow and send them back to their home countries. That \nis why I have joined already with Senator Flake in his amendment, which \nhe was trying to propose on the Senate floor this week, to repeal the \ntroublesome part of the 2008 law.\n  That is why I am going further and drafting additional legislation to \ngive this administration the mandate, the ability, the directive it \nclearly needs to change that practice and to change that policy--not to \nallow these illegals to be released into the country simply on the \nhonor system that they might show up for a court date--we know that \nwell over 90 percent never show up--and not simply send more money to \nHHS to properly care for these illegal aliens with no end in sight.\n  Of course, they need to be properly treated and cared for when they \nare in this country and beyond, but we should not just write a blank \ncheck to keep them here forever but change the law and have the \nprocedure in place to detain them--not to release them--and to quickly, \neffectively, bring them back to their home country.\n  That is what happens in a much more routine way for illegal aliens \nfrom border countries such as Mexico and Canada. That is what happens \neffectively in those situations. We need to mirror that. We need to \ncopy that and make sure that happens effectively when the illegal alien \nis from a border State.\n  I wrote a letter to DHS Secretary Johnson back in January of this \nyear regarding this very issue, before it became the current crisis, \nregarding reports detailing actual DHS assistance in the completion of \nsmuggling illegal alien minors.\n  In that case, a smuggled child in many cases was transferred to \nillegal alien parents actually by DHS--by HHS's Office of Refugee \nResettlement. So actually, in those cases, the Federal Government was \nnot completing the object of the criminal conspiracy--was not stopping \nthe smuggling, not punishing the smugglers, but completing the \noperation. Again, it is another classic case of sending the wrong \nmessage--a message that will increase the flow and increase the \nproblem, not decrease it.\n  Ultimately, that goes back to the humanitarian issue too, because \nencouraging human smuggling enriches drug cartels, allows them to \ncontinue using violence as a means to an end, and wages war on Mexican \nand American citizens alike as well as the folks involved from Central \nand South American countries.\n  We need to change that basic message. We need to turn around those\n\n[[Page S4384]]\n\nbasic incentives. The only way to do that is to have a law and the \nexecution of the law that is reversing that flow, that is apprehending \nthese folks, that is treating them humanely, that is not releasing them \nout into American society, and that is quickly and effectively \nreturning them to their home countries.\n  That is the only message, that is the only visual, that will stop \nthis mounting wave and will address the horrible humanitarian problems \nthat flow directly from it.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I come to the floor for the last minute \nof this debate to support Sean Donovan's nomination to be Director of \nthe Office of Management and Budget.\n  I have worked very closely with Secretary Donovan over the last 5 \nyears, and I know he has the skills and experience to work with \nCongress on creating jobs and tackling our long-term budget challenges \nfairly and responsibly.\n  In his role as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Secretary \nDonovan has proven time and again that he is focused first and foremost \non strengthening our middle class by expanding opportunities for \nfamilies and communities.\n  From his work on stabilizing the housing market following the \nfinancial crisis, to reinforcing the agency's role in providing access \nto affordable housing and building strong, sustainable neighborhoods, \nto ensuring communities hit hard by natural disasters have the \nresources they need to get back on their feet, Secretary Donovan has \nbeen a highly effective and responsive leader and a great partner to us \nin Congress, Democrats and Republicans alike.\n  Secretary Donovan's nomination passed through the Budget Committee \nwith bipartisan support. I am confident he will bring these strengths \nand many more to the OMB. His leadership will be critical, because \nwhile we have made progress on our budget challenges, there is a lot of \nwork yet to be done.\n  I look forward to working with Secretary Donovan to strengthen our \nfiscal outlook over the long term and ensure we can make critical \ninvestments in jobs and opportunities to support our families, workers, \nand the economy. I know Secretary Donovan will be a great partner in \naddressing these challenges, and I urge my colleagues to support his \nnomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Shaun L.S. Donovan, of New York, to be \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget?\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             FOREIGN POLICY\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, now that the results are in, I think it \nis time to talk again--as we did 5 years ago--about what is happening \non what I consider to be the greatest failed foreign policy we have \nexperienced.\n  When we look around the world and we see what happened and what is \ngoing on now--and this may be a narrow opinion--it is a result of the \napology tour President Obama took immediately after becoming President \nof the United States.\n  I remember standing at this podium at that time and saying you don't \ngo to the Muslim world and say: I will not make a speech until we have \nthe Muslim Brotherhood coming with their required numbers. That was not \ngood. This is a deviation from what we always stood for and that was \ncertainly a slap in the face of our best friends in the Middle East, \nIsrael.\n  Two weeks ago, three Israeli teenagers were found dead in shallow \ngraves in a West Bank village, and it was such a tragedy, and, of \ncourse, reciprocity has taken place since then. Hamas has launched over \n365 rockets indiscriminately into the Israeli civilian population. I \nhave to say that when I look at some of the things we have worked on \ntogether with Israel--for example, the iron dome has performed very \nwell during that period of time. Also, I will say that Prime Minister \nNetanyahu responded with some 700 or so airstrikes primarily using F-\n16s and doing it very well. This started 5 years ago, and we have had \nunrest in that area ever since then.\n  The Israeli Defense Minister said this week: ``We are preparing for a \nbattle\n\n[[Page S4385]]\n\nagainst Hamas which will not end within a few days.''\n  Obviously, I strongly support our greatest ally in the Middle East, \nand so often we do what we can to directly and indirectly continue that \nsupport. There has been unrest in Israel for the past 5 or 6 years.\n  We sent letters to the President some time ago regarding Iraq in \n2013. We said when you leave Iraq, be sure to leave the intelligence \nand the logistics. You cannot just walk out. Yes, we have great trained \nfighters in the Iraqi security force, but they cannot be totally on \ntheir own. They needed to have ISR support. ISR is intelligence and \nreconnaissance. We have to learn a lesson from this so we don't make \nthe same mistake in Afghanistan. But nonetheless, we did. So now Al \nQaeda-inspired terrorists have returned and have overtaken key cities.\n  ISIS is the most terrifying terrorist group out there. They have \ntaken over towns such as Mosul, Tikrit, Ramadi, and Fallujah.\n  I have a guy who works for me as a field representative in my State \nof Oklahoma. His name is Brian Hackler. Prior to the time he came to \nwork for me, he was in the Marines. He was actually deployed twice to \nFallujah. If you will remember, Fallujah was the closest thing we had \nto door-to-door combat like we had in World War II, and we lost a lot \nof lives.\n  When I called him, he had not yet heard that we lost Fallujah after \nthey took it over. He actually physically cried. He said, the blood, \nthe sweat, and the tears of all of my friends. He said, we had that \nsecured, and we have now lost it.\n  We are doing everything we can now to rectify that situation. I am \nglad the Obama administration is doing what we asked them to do 2 years \nago. While we will lose lives, hopefully we can keep the terrorists \nfrom having a safe haven in that area.\n  I am very much concerned about what has happened in Iraq. While the \nPresident continues his assessments, it leads me to wonder what the \npeople in our embassy have been doing over there. We are empowering \nRussia and Iran to lead and become key influences in the region.\n  Iran reportedly has two battalions of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard \nCorps, the IRGC, in Iraq. It is kind of funny. Right now a lot of \npeople are saying Iran is our friend. Let's keep in mind that our \nintelligence determined quite a number of years ago that Iran will have \nthe weapon and the delivery system for that weapon by 2015. Well, 2015 \nis on us now, so I think if anyone out there is naive enough to think \nwe can depend on Iran to help our situation, they are sadly mistaken.\n  We have a very serious problem now in Iraq. While the United States \nhas most recently provided some equipment intelligence, this is what we \nshould have been doing and preparing for 2 years ago. Since January, \nPrime Minister Maliki has asked for help, and the President waited \nuntil it became a dire crisis.\n\n  Then there is Afghanistan. We know what is happening in Afghanistan. \nCurrently the Presidential election in Afghanistan has taken place. The \nprimary took place and the runoff took place, but the problem is it is \nobviously a sham. The election is not an honest, transparent election. \nI believe there is no greater threat that can be imposed on us than by \nallowing the people of Afghanistan to look at an election and find out \nit is a rigged election.\n  I will give an example. While we have not taken sides in this country \nbetween Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani, I personally would fall \ndown on the side of Abdullah. It seems as though all of the real \nproblems in that election ended up benefiting Ghani as opposed to \nAbdullah.\n  For example, in one province--it was Wardak Province--17,000 votes \nwere cast in April. Now the runoff came along and 170,000 votes were \ncast. If you stop to think about it, that is mathematically impossible, \nso we know that is rigged. While everyone agrees that Ghani's support \nis in the rural areas, I would defy anyone to come down to the Senate \nfloor and point out an election that has ever taken place where you \nhave a much larger percentage of rural votes as opposed to urban votes. \nThere is a logical reason--rural voters have to walk a long way to get \nto the polls and some voters can't get there as easily.\n  The results of the runoff: There was a 75-percent turnout from the \nrural areas as opposed to a 24-percent turnout in the urban areas. That \ncouldn't happen. We have to have an audit. I think everybody agrees we \nhave to have an audit, but it has to be a thorough and transparent \naudit. We have to be sure the Afghan people, when they determine the \noutcome of this election, know it was a legitimate election so they can \nrejoice in it.\n  I think most everyone knows a few hours ago Abdullah declared victory \nin spite of the fact that the first count I described showed him as \nlosing.\n  We have this problem right now. It is a problem I hang on President \nObama and his administration because we told them in advance what \nneeded to be done to avoid this type of situation from happening.\n  We are now looking at a situation there that is one where we can act \nnow and preclude something from happening there and is happening as we \nspeak in Iraq.\n  Remember what took place in terms of the five Taliban terrorists who \nwere released. We thought--and I felt all the time--that was a very \ncontroversial issue. A lot of people wanted to close Gitmo, and I have \nstrong feelings against that. We need to have that facility and that \nresource, which I will explain in a moment.\n  When the President turned the five Taliban leaders loose--these were \nthe most brutal and heinous of all the terrorists who were in Gitmo. \nThere were five of them. When they found out, they were celebrating. \nOne of the terrorists released was referred to as the toughest of all \nof them. One of the top people who was on the other side of the Taliban \nsaid in response to the release of the terrorists that this is the \nTaliban rejoicing that the President has turned loose five of the \nterrorists who were incarcerated in Gitmo. They said it is like putting \n10,000 Taliban fighters into battle on the side of jihad. Now the \nTaliban have the right to lead them into the final moments before \nvictory in Afghanistan.\n  We all knew the President should not have done it. Anticipating that \nthe President was going to do this, the last bill we passed before the \ncurrent one, which is on here, we put language in there anticipating \nthat the President, in order to reach his goal and ultimately close \nGitmo, might take some of the worst individuals and turn them loose. We \nput language in there from section 1035(d) of the Defense Authorization \nAct. He said the President had to notify us 30 days in advance if he \nwas going to release or make any transfers from Gitmo. He blatantly \nbroke that law and did not do it. Everyone was on our side in terms of \nwhy we should not let this, what they referred to as the ``Taliban \ndream team,'' be turned loose. Right now, supposedly, there is some \nkind of a deal made where they are in Qatar for a period of a year, but \neven if they were able to enforce that--stop and think about the theory \nbehind this. The President is saying in essence we are going to turn \nyou guys loose but you have to promise not to kill Americans for a \nperiod of a year. Because it says for 1 year they have to remain under \nsome level of control by a country that hasn't even told us how they \nare going to do that. Consequently, I have no doubt they are free to go \nanywhere they want.\n\n  We had reviews conducted by the Department of Defense, Department of \nState, the Department of Justice, Homeland Security, the National \nIntelligence, and all the rest of them saying these five people are too \ndangerous to release. Leon Panetta, who was the Secretary of Defense at \nthat time, made the same statement. He said these people are too \ndangerous, as did General Dunford. By the way, General Dunford, who is \nthe commander in Afghanistan, was not even notified in advance this was \ngoing to take place.\n  So we have all of these circumstances that are going on right now. We \nhave the law that was broken. My feeling has always been, as we are \ngetting down midway into the President's second term, looking at what \nhe is going to have for a legacy, one of his desired legacies would be \nto close Gitmo. He has talked about that for a long period of time. I \nthink the American people have now caught on, because there is a poll \non June 13 by Gallup that shows 66 percent of Americans oppose the \nclosing of Gitmo. So this has changed now.\n\n[[Page S4386]]\n\n  Why is it important? There is no place else anywhere in the world \nwhere we can put these enemy combatants. These guys are not criminals; \nthey are enemy combatants. They are terrorists. And when the President \ncame up with the original idea of putting them into our prison system, \nwe had to go and make sure everyone was aware they are terrorists and \nnot criminals. By definition, they teach other people to be terrorists. \nIf there is anything we don't want in our prison system, it is for all \nof those criminals to learn how to become terrorists.\n  We have had Gitmo since 1903. It is one of the few good deals we have \nwherein we pay a little over $4,000 a year for that facility. We should \nstop and see the advantages we have in Gitmo as opposed to putting them \nsomeplace else where they can either get out through jail breaks, as \nhas been happening, or if they were to be intermingled in the United \nStates with our prison population.\n  One of the places, incidentally, that the President first wanted to \nsend the Gitmo inmates was to Fort Sill in my State of Oklahoma. I went \nto Fort Sill and they said, We don't have the capability here to get \nthis done. So what we want to do is--in fact, the lady who runs the \nfacility at Fort Sill said, I don't know what it is that individuals \ndon't understand. She said she had three deployments to Gitmo. It is \nthe perfect institution for these people. They are well taken care of. \nThe Red Cross and everyone who goes down there says, Yes, the health \nfacilities are better than they have ever had before, the food is the \nbest they have ever had. So it is a facility we need to continue to \nuse.\n\n\n                                Benghazi\n\n  Lastly, before I completely run out of time, I want to jump ahead a \nlittle bit and mention Benghazi. I think it is important for us to \nunderstand there are four people in our system who advise the President \nof the United States. We have the CIA Director who, at the time this \nhappened in Benghazi, was John--anyway, the CIA Director; the Director \nof National Intelligence, that was James Clapper; the Secretary of \nDefense, who was Leon Panetta; and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, General Dempsey. All of those people said they knew \nunequivocally, in Benghazi, when they bombed the annex, it was an \norganized terrorist activity. I think right now people are realizing \nthat was the real issue. It is not who is responsible for it; it is the \nfact that we knew it was going to happen. Our Ambassador, who was \nkilled, gave us ample warning for well over a month and a half before \nit took place that it was going to take place.\n  So I think we understand now why Gitmo is important and we understand \nthe whole reason this is taking place. I am certainly hoping we can \nstick together and make sure we don't end up losing one of the most \nvaluable facilities we have in this day of terrorists by having to \nclose it down.\n  We have a serious problem. I think if there is anything we should \nlearn from this, it is, No. 1, we have a valuable institution called \nGitmo. No. 2, what is important is that we don't let happen this year \nwhat happened last year. Last year we didn't get the NDAA bill until \nDecember. If we had gone to December 31, there would not have been \nhazard pay and a number of bad things would have happened, but we ended \nup finally at the last minute getting it done. I have talked to both \nthe majority and minority leaders about the advisability of bringing \nthe NDAA to the floor of the Senate, and consequently we now have \ninvited Members to send their amendments down. We have almost 100 \namendments already on the floor. So I am hoping during the next week, \nwe can come down with a specific date--hopefully before the August \nrecess--where we can bring up the NDAA and let the people know who go \nover there risking their lives that we are going to be here to support \nthem. We are going to be putting together an NDAA bill.\n  I know my time has expired. I will not suggest the absence of a \nquorum quite yet because no one has arrived.\n  Going back to Benghazi, everybody had the information on Benghazi. I \nneglected to mention we also had General Hamm come in and testify \nbefore us, again, that he was one of several who was fully aware of \nwhat happened.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Minnesota Flooding\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I come to the Senate floor today to \nspeak about the recent heavy rain storms in Minnesota that have caused \nsignificant flooding in our State. This was not a one-day disaster. \nThis was not a sudden flash flood such as we saw in Duluth a few years \nago or a tornado coming in. This was, in fact, a disaster that occurred \nover a series of weeks where we had rainfall after rainfall after \nrainfall. From International Falls on the Canadian border down to \nLuverne, MN, on the Iowa border, torrential rains have washed out \nroads, bridges, and culverts, damaged infrastructure and caused \nsignificant crop damage. In some of our counties, 40 percent of the \nfarmlands are under water.\n  These storms have led to states of emergency being declared for 51 of \nMinnesota's 87 counties. We have not seen anything like this for a \nwhile. It tended to be, in the past, that we had a corner of our State \nthat would see trouble, but here we have 51 of Minnesota's 87 counties \nbeing declared a state of emergency.\n  Over the past few weeks I have visited many of these affected areas \nand seen the damage firsthand.\n  The city of Norwood Young America saw nearly 9 inches of rain in one \nnight that caused more than $1 million in damage to its wastewater \ntreatment facility. I saw how water-covered roads strained rural \ncommunities, how washed-out rail beds have caused another setback for \nour already-strained rail system, and how closed township bridges have \nfurther delayed shipments of agricultural products.\n  In southwest Minnesota, along with Senator Franken and Governor \nDayton, I met with farmers who were among those hardest hit by the \nstorms. Up until a month ago, the same crop and pasture land in \nsouthern Minnesota that is now completely under water had been under \ndrought conditions since 2011. And now not only are these farmers \ndealing with damage to crops, buildings, and fences due to the \nflooding, they also experienced losses in the past from a devastating \nhail storm.\n  In Rock County in southwestern Minnesota initial estimates indicate \n100,000 acres of corn and soybeans are damaged, and the official U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture number will likely be even greater. The \nextent of the crop damage is really not yet known. Excessive moisture \ncan kill crops altogether or stunt their growth or put them at risk of \ndiseases at lower yields. This disaster has repercussions that will be \nfelt for months to come.\n  I talked with farmers in Luverne and in Mankato who are worried about \nhow they will recover these losses and make ends meet. Farmers who were \ntrying to finish planting now may have no hope of getting a crop into \ntheir flooded fields at all this summer, and those who did get a crop \nin are now watching their fields fill with water.\n  U.S. Department of Agriculture officials are still assessing the \ndamage, and crop insurance adjusters are out in full force so that \naccurate reports can be filed with county FSA offices. This is a \ncritical step to ensure that farmers and ranchers are not left out of \nthe disaster assistance process.\n  Farmers operate at the mercy of the weather. Listening to stories of \nthe great financial risk these small business owners face every single \nday--our State is a State of many small farms--it makes me proud of the \nwork we did in the Senate and the work I did as a member of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee and conference committee to fight for permanent \ndisaster programs with mandatory funding in the farm bill that we \nreauthorized earlier this year. If that were not in place, these \nfarmers and, as a result, our food supply would be facing--Minnesota \nbeing one of the top agricultural producers in the country--a very \nuncertain future. These programs, in addition to the farm bill's \nimprovements to crop insurance, will help provide a safety net for the \nfarmers and the ranchers affected by the flood.\n\n[[Page S4387]]\n\n  Last week Secretary Vilsack visited our State. He was up in the \nMoorhead area, and Senator Hoeven, Senator Heitkamp, Congressman \nPeterson, and I met with him about some conservation issues up there \nwith flooding. They are one of the areas of the State that have some \nflooding, but not as much right now; they usually have the most \nflooding. But when he was there he committed to me that the Farm \nService Agency will do everything they can to provide any necessary \nresources and support for our farmers and ranchers.\n  Just yesterday the Minnesota FSA executive director informed me that \nshe has directed county FSA offices to immediately begin holding \ncommunity meetings to ensure that farmers and ranchers impacted by \nthese floodwaters have the information they need. Because here we have \na new farm bill, and while it is very similar to the last one, there \nare new rules in place. They have to make critical decisions about if \nthey replant, if they can get emergency loans; what they should plant, \nif their fields have been devastated, including cover crop; and what is \ngoing to be happening in the next few months. They need the \ninformation.\n  Floods have a devastating impact not only on farmers but also on \nfamilies and small businesses. The damage that these storms caused will \nnot be undone overnight. There is still a lot of hard work ahead of us, \nand the long cleanup process has already begun. But we have already \nseen a swift and efficient response on the part of State and local \nofficials. And in our State, FEMA may be a four-letter word, but it is \na good four-letter word. When we saw what had happened in Grand Forks, \nthe Nation was riveted many, many years ago by the flooding in North \nDakota and Minnesota. That has recovered. Those are booming areas now. \nFargo-Moorhead also experienced significant funding, and FEMA was \ninvolved and helped us there. We appreciate the work they are doing in \nassessing the damage now and the help we know will be coming.\n  It is critical that the Federal Government do its part to ensure that \nthe resources these families, businesses, and communities need are \nthere to get them back on their feet. Two weeks ago I spoke directly \nwith the President in the White House about the flood damage across the \nState, and he assured me there would be an immediate Federal response.\n\n  That is why the action by Governor Dayton yesterday to formally \nrequest that the President issue a major disaster declaration was so \nimportant. That is why we sent a letter to the President--our entire \ncongressional delegation; all of the eight House Members and the two \nSenators--urging swift approval of this request.\n  Although work to assess the damage remains ongoing, so far nearly $11 \nmillion in eligible damages has been documented in just eight counties. \nThat is just eight counties. One county alone, we know, has $9 million \nin damage. This is well above the $7.5 million threshold that Minnesota \nhas to meet to get the 75-percent Federal match for those counties that \nhave $3.50 per capita damage. So we imagine that a lot of these \ncounties will be getting Federal help for infrastructure damage at that \n75-percent mark.\n  Believe me when I say Minnesotans just are not sitting around waiting \nfor help. The hard work of assessing the damage continues this week and \nis even expected to extend into the following week. Even though the \ndamage across the State has reached a level high enough to trigger \neligibility, each county is doing its damage assessment.\n  In some States, as I say, they have had problems with FEMA, but in \nour State for the most part we have been happy with the work they have \ndone. In my time as a Senator, I have seen the 35W bridge collapse, I \nhave seen the Federal Government step in with inordinate help to get \nthat bridge rebuilt in less than a year.\n  I saw a tornado come into Wadena, MN, and literally pick up a high \nschool like it was in the ``Wizard of Oz,'' the bleachers landing a \nmile away. In that town--because of Federal assistance in alerting \nthose citizens about how to use their emergency systems--because of an \nalarm system and a siren that worked, despite the fact that their high \nschool looked like a bomb had hit it, a major, large high school--not \none person was killed. There was a high school lifeguard watching over \n40 little kids at a swimming pool. The sirens went off. The parents got \nthere within 10 minutes and had them all gone, and the few kids that \nwere left ran over with the lifeguard, who had the presence of mind to \nstay in a neighbor's basement who they did not even know. Not one \nperson died because that siren system worked, because people had \npracticed, because they knew what to do, and because we had the \nemergency system in place.\n  That high school is now rebuilt. Along with that high school being \nrebuilt, there is a beautiful new company that was rebuilt that is in \nthe farming area, in the farm financing area. Their company was \ndevastated. They did not have a basement. All they had was one safe \nthat the man had bought, and he had joked that it was big enough to \nhold a few employees. That day when that tornado hit, there were four \nemployees on duty. They went into that safe. That was the only thing \nthat remained of that business. When that man rebuilt, he bought a big \nenough safe for all 20 of his employees--a true story.\n  But this is how Minnesota responds to disasters. Few things are more \nhumbling than standing in those kinds of wreckages. Natural disasters \nare humbling because they remind us that nature is still more powerful \nthan all the technology we have. But they are also humbling because \nthey bring out the best in our communities. From what I have seen in \nour State--from those emergency responders diving into the Mississippi \nRiver over and over to look for survivors in the 35W bridge disaster or \nwhat I saw in Fargo-Moorhead, where a man was volunteering to give out \nfood and lunches at the emergency center and I said to him: Oh, thank \nyou for volunteering. What brings you here? He said: I lost my entire \nhouse. I said: And you came to volunteer? He said: It is the best thing \nI could do with my time--those are the things that I remember.\n  What I remember from these floods across the State--where, again, \ndespite this incredible damage not one person died in our State from \nthis flooding--I remember, again, those first responders and the normal \ncitizens who just got up and helped their neighbors.\n  We saw this spirit of solidarity when a 911 call came in from a woman \nwho was driving home to Anoka, MN, from Sioux Falls, SD, when her car \nspun out of control and was swept away. Water was inching up to the \nwindows.\n  State Trooper Brian Beuning pushed through the rushing water when she \ncalled for help. He got her out of the car and held on to her until \nhelp arrived. The car ended up in a field a quarter of a mile away. A \nboat tried to rescue them, but the current was too swift. Finally, two \nfirefighters from Luverne, MN, tied themselves to a semitruck and got \nthe woman and the trooper to safety. Rather than running from disaster, \nthose first responders bravely ran toward it; and that is my State for \nyou.\n  In the face of ice storms, historic floods, tornadoes, even the \ncollapse of that bridge, Minnesota does not fall apart. Minnesota comes \ntogether. When disaster hits our State, we hit the ground running and \ndo not stop until we have the resources in place to ensure our \ncommunities are made whole. That means local and State help, but that \nalso means Federal help.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed for the next 30 minutes to engage in a colloquy between myself, \nSenator McCain, and Senator Barrasso.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hoeven, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Barrasso pertaining \nto the introduction of S. 2592 are printed in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n[[Page S4388]]\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is S. 2363, the \nsportsmen's bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 5 \nminutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Preserving an Open Internet\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, last week I chaired a field hearing of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee in Burlington, VT, on an issue of \ncritical importance: preserving an open Internet. Our committee heard \ntestimony about the need for concrete, fundamental protections to \nensure that the Internet is not abused by those who control how we \nconnect to the Internet.\n  The timing of the hearing was not a coincidence. I convened it during \na week when Americans were gathering to celebrate what our Founders put \nin motion more than 200 years ago. While no one then could have \nimagined how important the Internet would become, the sentiment and \npriorities expressed at the hearing would have made our Founders proud. \nWe heard from hard-working business owners and consumers about the role \nof the Internet in enhancing free expression, and also as a free and \nopen marketplace where competition drives innovation.\n  I brought the Judiciary Committee to Burlington to show the Federal \nCommunications Commission and Congress that the decisions we make on \nthis issue will have deep and wide impact far outside of the Nation's \ncapital, and in the economies of our local communities.\n  Witnesses at this field hearing warned of how the FCC's proposed \napproach to new Net neutrality rules would actually harm small \nbusinesses, community institutions, and consumers--the people we have \nin every one of our States whom we represent. I will give an example. \nCabot Orton, the proprietor of the Vermont Country Store, testified \nthat they started off as just a local general store in Vermont and now \nhave an e-commerce site that accounts for 40 percent of their overall \nrevenue. One-third of their 450 employees support those Internet \ntransactions. These are a lot of people hired in our little State of \nVermont because they have open access to the Internet.\n  Mr. Orton was clear about his concerns. He said:\n\n       We're not asking for special treatment, incentives or \n     subsidies. All the small business community asks is simply to \n     preserve and protect Internet commerce as it exists today, \n     which has served all businesses remarkably well.\n\n  I have to agree with him.\n  Another Vermont small business owner, Lisa Groeneveld, explained that \nher company Logic Supply spent money building a quality product, not \npurchasing preferential Internet access. She said that ``without an \nOpen and Fair Internet based on the equal access, our business wouldn't \neven exist today.'' This successful company is an amazing example of \nhow the Internet can help grow small businesses in Vermont.\n  Both of these witnesses testified that the success they have achieved \nwith their online businesses would have been difficult to accomplish if \nthe Internet had been a pay-to-play world when they initially launched \ntheir sites.\n  Think of all the companies, whether in Vermont, Massachusetts, or any \nother State, next year or the year after that want to launch online if \nsuddenly the rules were different for them than for a company that has \na lot of money.\n  We heard other perspectives too. Vermont's State librarian, Martha \nReid, testified about the need to ensure equal access for those who \nrely on public libraries for their Internet access, which includes many \npeople in rural areas.\n  Vermonters know of my love for the library I frequented growing up, \nthe Kellogg Hubbard Library. I received my first library card there, in \nMontpelier, when I was 4. I went there to learn, not just to read.\n  Ms. Reid testified that ``all Americans--including the most \ndisenfranchised citizens, those who would have no way to access the \nInternet without the library--need to be able to use Internet resources \non an equal footing.''\n  Ms. Reid's testimony was supported by former FCC Commissioner Michael \nCopps, who explained that ``an Internet controlled and managed for the \nbenefit of the `haves' discriminates against our rights not just as \nconsumers but, more importantly, as citizens.''\n\n  The testimony from these individuals offers a relevant selection of \nthe real-world experiences that have to be heard by the FCC and \nCongress as this debate continues. That is why I took the hearing 500 \nmiles from the Senate--so they could be heard.\n  I don't want to see an Internet that is divided into the haves and \nhave-nots. I agree with the Vermonters who testified: I don't want to \nsee an Internet where those who can afford to pay muffle the voices of \nthose who cannot.\n  An online world that is split into fast lanes and slow lanes, where \npay-to-play deals dictate who can reach consumers, runs counter to \neverything on which the Internet was founded.\n  Last month I joined Congresswoman Doris Matsui to introduce the \nOnline Competition and Consumer Choice Act that requires the FCC to ban \nonline pay-to-play deals. Open Internet principles are the bill of \nrights for the online world. We must get this right. If we fail to get \nit right, I guarantee that we will not get another chance and we will \nnot have these companies growing and starting up throughout all our \nStates.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Montana here. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                        Constitutional Amendment\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, back in 2012 the people of Montana stood \nup against the influence of corporations and big money in elections. By \na 3-to-1 margin, they called on their congressional delegation to \nintroduce a constitutional amendment overturning the Supreme Court's \nCitizens United decision. That ruling paved the way for more secret \nmoney in politics. It allowed corporations to make contributions to \npolitical campaigns on the grounds that corporations should have the \nsame right to freedom of speech as any individual.\n  In response to the overwhelming vote by the people of Montana, I \nproudly introduced this amendment, which affirms what we all know: \nCorporations are not people, and they do not have the same rights as \nyou or I.\n  Two years later Americans are realizing that Montanans were pretty \nforward-looking. That is because in Montana we value independence. We \nvalue our individual rights. And we don't think a faceless entity \nshould be able to tell us what to do. We don't like it when secretive, \nshadowy groups try to tell us how to vote, and we don't like it when \ncorporations dictate our health care decisions. But that is exactly \nwhat happened with last week's Hobby Lobby decision. The Supreme Court \ndecided corporations can limit their employees' health care options, \nthereby restricting our individual freedoms. That is un-American. \nAffording corporations the same constitutional rights to speech--and \nnow to religion--that Montanans and all American people cherish is the \nexact opposite of what our Founding Fathers envisioned. This is not \nfreedom. It is a slippery slope to granting large corporations greater \npower over everyday Americans' lives.\n  With the Hobby Lobby decision, the Supreme Court found that \ncorporations can hold religious-based objections to providing insurance \ncoverage for certain medical care. The corporations do not have \nreligions; people do. The First Amendment was meant to protect \nindividuals' religious freedoms, not those of corporations. Now, the \nreligious beliefs of corporations will dictate the health care options \nof people. It starts with contraceptive care, but where does it end?\n  It is clear that the Supreme Court is putting the rights of \ncorporations over the rights of people. So much for treating all \nAmericans equally. If you are a corporation with money, you could \ninfluence our elections to a far greater extent than ever before. Now, \nif you have a corporation, you can influence our access to health care \ntoo.\n\n  Justice Ginsburg said in her dissent:\n\n       The decision would deny legions of women who do not hold \n     their employers' beliefs access to contraceptive coverage.\n\n\n[[Page S4389]]\n\n\n  Let me say that again. These are Justice Ginsburg's words:\n\n       The decision would deny legions of women who do not hold \n     their employers' beliefs access to contraceptive care.\n\n  Where will this end?\n  Being a woman cannot be a preexisting condition. Contraception is \nbasic health care, and 99 percent of American women currently use or \nhave used birth control at some point in their lives. But now a \nmanless, faceless corporation can stand between women and their access \nto this basic care, all because an activist Supreme Court thinks \ncorporations have the same rights as people.\n  This Supreme Court continues to redefine individual rights as \ncorporate rights: freedom of speech, freedom of religion. We have to \nask ourselves, where will this end? It seems as if anything is possible \nwhen it comes to this Supreme Court, where five men can determine a \nwoman's health care. But it doesn't need to be this way. My \nconstitutional amendment makes it 100 percent clear that the rights \nenshrined in our Constitution are meant for the American people--real \nfolks who work day in and day out to put food on the table--not \ncorporate entities.\n  My amendment also allows the American people to once again regulate \ncorporations through the representatives they elect in State and \nFederal government.\n  I encourage all my colleagues to join me and Senators Murphy, Begich, \nWalsh, Markey, and Whitehouse in supporting this commonsense step. But \nit is going to take a comprehensive approach to make sure real people, \nnot corporations, are in charge. Whether it is elections or health \ncare, people should be free to make their own choices without the undue \ninfluence of corporate entities.\n  Montanans voted in 2012 to limit constitutional rights to individual \npeople, but it was 100 years earlier that we also voted to limit \ncorporate influence in elections after wealthy mining companies bought \ninfluence and even paid for a U.S. Senate seat. We recognized the \nnegative impact wealthy corporations were having on our electoral \nprocess. But this Supreme Court, using its Citizens United decision as \njustification, overturned our century-old law just 2 years ago, \ncreating the same kind of election-spending free-for-all in Montana \nthat we are witnessing nationwide.\n  Before the Hobby Lobby decision, the fight against corporate \ninfluence was mainly about making sure real people and their ideas were \nin charge of elections. But now it is no longer just about a democracy; \nit is about keeping corporations out of our private lives, out of our \nbedrooms, and out of our religious decisions. It is an even bigger \nfight now.\n  If you don't want to find out where corporate influence and the \nSupreme Court will go next, I would encourage you to join me and fight \nback with smart, responsible measures that will put real people back in \ncharge of our lives. Our democracy has been under attack before but \nnever to this extent.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I would suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Executive Power\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the great pamphleteer of the American \nRevolution, Thomas Paine, famously characterized our Nation at its \nfounding by asserting that in America the law is king. This sentiment \nhas undergirded centuries of our Nation's political culture: The rule \nof law protects us from arbitrary government actions. It is what \nguarantees our liberties, it is what fosters our prosperity and our \nflourishing as a free people, and it is a source of our Republic's \nlegitimacy. For as the Declaration of Independence teaches, governments \nderive their just powers from the consent of the governed.\n  For these reasons, when drafting the Constitution, the Framers \nobligated the President to take care that our laws be faithfully \nexecuted, but they were careful not to give the President the authority \nto make or change the law on his own.\n  Our Nation's Founders knew, in the sage words of Montesquieu, that \n``in all tyrannical governments . . . the right both of making and of \nenforcing the laws is vested in one and the same man, or . . . body of \nmen; and wherever these two powers are united together, there can be no \npublic liberty.''\n  To safeguard our liberties as the Constitution requires, the \nConstitution vests Federal legislative powers in the Congress--the \nHouse of Representatives and the Senate--which were designed to engage \nin a particularly thorough and deliberative legislative process. By \nratifying the Constitution, the American people established this system \nas the supreme law of the land applying to all of us--including the \nPresident.\n  Despite these Constitutional foundations, President Obama has simply \ndecided that he ``won't take no for an answer'' when Congress refuses \nto go along with his far left agenda. In direct opposition to our \ncenturies-old system of legislation and the binding authority of the \nConstitution, the President has audaciously declared that ``when \nCongress won't act, I will.'' And he has followed up these threats with \na variety of unilateral executive actions, many of which are flatly \ninconsistent with the law and the Constitution.\n  Over the past weeks and months I have come to the Senate floor to \nspeak out about a series of specific instances that exemplified the \nbrazen lawlessness of this administration. This pervasive and \nillegitimate outreach has come in many different forms. We have seen \nthe President regulate contrary to the plain text of the law, simply \nignoring the clear commands of duly enacted Federal statutes. For \nexample, a hallmark of the President's so-called pen-and-phone strategy \nhas been an Executive order forcing contractors to raise their minimum \nwage. He issued this directive despite the fact that a Federal statute \nalready governs the minimum wage for Federal contractors.\n  Although a different statute gives the President some discretion in \nthe area of Federal procurement, its plain language demands, as courts \nof law have upheld, that there be a sufficient nexus between the \nPresident's orders and the statute's stated goal of efficiency and \neconomy in Federal procurement. President Obama's order increasing \ncontractors' labor costs by hiking their minimum wage is thus wholly \ninconsistent with the law.\n  We have seen the Obama administration seek to rewrite existing law \nand thereby usurp Congress's legislative authority through the use of \nconditioned waivers. Consider how the Department of Education has \nissued waivers of No Child Left Behind's requirements to 43 of the 50 \nStates and the District of Columbia.\n  Even when Democrats had large majorities in both the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate, President Obama refused to pursue \nlegislative reauthorization of the statute to set realistic goals going \nforward. Apparently, he wanted to avoid spending his energies and \npolitical capital on a legislative process that might expose divisions \nwithin his own party or force him to compromise.\n  The President chose simply to establish an entirely different set of \neducation policies by attaching his own conditions to the waivers that \nStates need to receive Federal money. His administration has not been \nshy about enforcing conditions that bear little resemblance to \nprovisions of the law itself.\n  The State of Washington learned this recently when it became the \nfirst to lose its waiver and much of its Federal funding primarily \nbecause it did not meet the administration's mandate for teacher and \nprincipal evaluation--a mandate that has no grounding in the actual \nstatute.\n  We have seen President Obama and his subordinates stretch what lawful \nauthorities the executive branch does have beyond recognition to \nadvance its preferred policies. Take, for example, the Nation's drug \nlaws, an area in which the Obama administration decided it disagrees \nwith the criminal statutes on the books and wants to implement a \ndifferent policy. The President has demonstrated an eagerness to do so \nunilaterally, no matter the governing Federal law, and no matter the \nbroad and bipartisan support for sentencing reform in Congress. The \nadministration's new clemency push for drug\n\n[[Page S4390]]\n\noffenders seeks to employ the President's specific constitutional \npower--one limited to relieve individual instances of injustice--to \nprovide relief to large swaths of criminals who fit a few broad \ncriteria. The President has also directed major changes over which \nFederal drug crimes are charged and at what level to do this. His \nadministration has cited prosecutorial discretion--a limited authority \nderived from the power to adapt enforcement for an individual's \nspecific circumstances--to implement what are, in fact, broad standards \naffecting thousands upon thousands of prosecutions.\n  Given the scope of these actions, compared to the Executive's \nnarrowly tailored authorities, the administration's invocation of \nprosecutorial discretion and the clemency power have become transparent \nexcuses to justify flouting existing Federal law.\n  We have seen President Obama claim the power to gut the law by \nunilaterally creating gaping enforcement carve-outs, thereby \neffectively rewriting policy set by legislation. Take immigration, an \narea in which many of us--myself included--support reform but which is \ncurrently governed by existing law. For years the Obama administration \nhas advanced a growing number of enforcement carve-outs for \nincreasingly expansive classes of illegal immigrants. First, it \nexempted those brought here as children, then veterans, then their \nfamilies. Now the administration is contemplating excluding from the \napplication of duly enacted immigration law anyone who has not \ncommitted serious felonies. While nearly everyone agrees that violent \ncriminals should be our highest priority, the administration has gone \nmuch further and essentially declared its intention to make current \nimmigration law a dead letter in virtually every other case.\n  We have seen the Obama administration openly ignore its statutory \nobligations without meaningful justification. Consider the President's \ndecision to release the top five Taliban leaders in U.S. custody \nwithout notifying Congress, as required by Federal law. The \nadministration's excuses for delaying notification could not stand up \nto scrutiny under the President's own rationales. Indeed, the \nadministration's own statements demonstrate that it deliberately \nwithheld advance notification of the release from Congress for the \nillegitimate purpose of minimizing congressional opposition.\n  We have seen some of the Obama administration's worst abuses of \nexecutive power in creating and implementing its signature legislative \nprograms. In Dodd-Frank, for example, the administration created a new \nagency with unprecedented and unchecked power--no meaningful \nadministrative controls on its power, no congressional control over its \nbudget, and no effective judicial review of its far-reaching decisions.\n\n  And of course, any discussion of executive overreach by this \nadministration must include ObamaCare. Back when the administration was \nwriting that 2,000-plus page monstrosity, the bill's proponents argued \nthat its length and complexity were necessary evils--that its many \nintricate parts were essential to achieving the bill's promised \nobjectives.\n  The individual mandate, the employer mandate, the minimum coverage \nrequirements, the cuts to Medicare Advantage, and the limits for \nsubsidies to State-run exchanges--we were promised these provisions and \nothers were both critical and carefully timed to expand coverage and \nrein in costs. Yet, when the time came to implement the law, the \nadministration's tune changed. To justify violating a number of clear \nstatutory mandates, the administration has mustered a weak and \nunconvincing hodgepodge of legal acrobatics--all for the purpose of \nallowing the administration to avoid enforcing the central provisions \nof its own signature law.\n  Consider some of these particularly egregious justifications: \nclaiming that limited transition authority exercised by one agency \njustified another agency exerting that power even more broadly; or \nasserting that subjective impressions of excessive cost could justify a \nhardship exemption, when the statute specifically defines excessive \ncosts in objective terms; or defining explicit, carefully timed \ndeadlines written into the law by Congress, the timing of which is \nsupposed to anchor the whole statutory scheme; or abusing a small pilot \nprogram to mitigate the law's vast cuts to Medicare Advantage; or \nsimply ignoring a critical provision limiting how billions of dollars \nin tax subsidies are to be spent.\n  These are only a few examples of this administration's lawlessness in \nimplementing ObamaCare. I could continue on about the significant legal \nconcerns surrounding this administration's abusive handling of high-\nrisk pools, its dubious actions involving the small business exchange, \nits sweetheart deals granting unauthorized exemptions for labor unions, \nand many other similarly problematic actions.\n  But the point is clear: Time and again, the Obama administration has \nflouted its constitutional responsibilities, exceeded its legitimate \nauthority, ignored duly enacted law, and sought to escape any \naccountability for its unilateralism.\n  Today I have simply scratched the surface of the Obama \nadministration's legally dubious actions. I could also discuss the way \nthe administration is manipulating the Endangered Species Act to assert \ncontrol over private property, or the EPA's many abuses: its existing \nsource rule, its cross-State air pollution rule, its waters of the \nUnited States rule, and its CAFE standards. Or I could catalog the \nillegal actions of the President's appointees to the National Labor \nRelations Board, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or the Federal \nCommunications Commission.\n  In each of these areas, the Obama administration's executive \noverreach simply cannot stand--and it won't. The President is rightly \nfacing increased scrutiny and criticism in a range of areas for his \nillegitimate approach. Over the past two weeks, the Supreme Court \nstrongly rebuked the President's lawlessness in three key cases.\n  The Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA case involves one of the most \ncontroversial issues debated today: regulating carbon dioxide emissions \nin an effort to stop global warming. Americans and their elected \nrepresentatives have been seriously debating whether and how to pursue \nthat, just as we should when weighty matters of national policy are \nconsidered. Congress has considered various pieces of legislation over \nthe years to grant Federal authority to regulate carbon dioxide \nemissions, most notably President Obama's 2009 cap-and-trade bill. Each \ntime we have considered such legislation, the majority of us have made \nthe careful choice that the purported benefits are not worth the \nundeniably massive costs: hundreds of thousands of jobs destroyed and \ngas and electricity prices sent soaring.\n  President Obama, though, told us again that he ``won't take no for an \nanswer''--or, in other words, that he refuses to accept that the \nConstitution delegates to the people's representatives in Congress--and \nnot to him alone--the power to make or change the law. Defying Congress \nand the law, he claimed authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate \ncarbon emissions from powerplants. But the Clean Air Act plainly does \nnot provide him that authority.\n  In attempting to provide a shred of legal justification for its \nactions, the Obama administration took a detailed provision of the law, \ncomplete with precise numerical thresholds, and unilaterally rewrote it \nthrough regulation to claim power Congress never, in fact, gave.\n  The Supreme Court rightly struck down the administration's abuse of \nauthority in this instance, as it has done in past cases. But, \nunfortunately, such regulatory overreach has become so common in the \nObama administration that Federal bureaucrats have become experts in \nmanufacturing supposed legal authority out of thin air. And the courts \nare simply unable to keep up with the explosion of executive overreach \nby President Obama's administration.\n  Perhaps the most extreme example of such executive abuse was at issue \nin the Burwell v. Hobby Lobby case. Under the auspices of ObamaCare, \nthe Department of Health and Human Services issued a regulation \nrequiring employers to pay for a full complement of birth control \nmethods for every employee. The Obama administration applied this \nmandate to almost all employers--even those who run small, closely-held \nbusinesses and whose deeply-held religious beliefs conflict with the \nmandate.\n\n[[Page S4391]]\n\n  Some media outlets have focused on the conflict between this latest \nObamaCare abuse and the principles enshrined in the First Amendment's \nprotection of the free exercise of religion. Others have focused on the \nObama administration's argument that corporations are not people--as if \nthe particular form of how individuals organize themselves to do \nbusiness somehow allows the Federal Government to trample their \nreligious liberties.\n  But in all of the sound and the fury, a central point has been lost: \nThe Hobby Lobby case was actually about a direct threat to the \nseparation of powers. It pitted the Obama administration's unilateral \nmandate against a law passed by Congress.\n  In issuing this regulation, the Obama administration completely \ndisregarded a duly enacted Federal statute, the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act, which specifically bars such government infringement \non Americans' right to exercise their religious beliefs. The ObamaCare \ncontraception mandate flies in the face of the law's requirement that \nthe government not substantially burden the exercise of religion unless \nit is the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling government \npurpose. I know. I was the prime sponsor of that bill in the Senate, \nand I got my friend Senator Kennedy to go along with me. The President \nsaid it was one of the most important bills in history, that religious \nfreedom may be the most important of all of our freedoms.\n  As a lead author of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, it has \nbeen particularly frustrating to see the Justices of the Supreme Court \nwrongly criticized for supposedly limiting access to birth control. In \nreality, all the Court did was hold the Obama administration \naccountable to the law--specifically, a law that passed Congress with \nnear unanimity and was signed by President Clinton, who lauded the law. \nI was there. I was on the south lawn when he signed that. So were many \nothers.\n  In the NLRB v. Noel Canning case, by contrast, the administration \nviolated one of the Constitution's central checks on Presidential \npower, the requirement that nominations of principal officers receive \nthe advice and consent of the Senate except during the recess of the \nSenate.\n  Concern about Executive appointment abuse was on the minds of our \nFathers when they devised the Senate's role in the process. Their fears \nwere strikingly similar to what President Obama has sought to make \nreality: a radical set of National Labor Relations Board appointees who \npromised to tip the balance of the Board toward an extreme and divisive \nagenda and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director nominee \nendowed with unprecedented power--no checks on his removal, no \ncongressional control over his budget, and no effective judicial review \nof his actions.\n  But President Obama again proclaimed he would not take no for an \nanswer and claimed the power to use the recess appointment power to \ninstall these four nominees, even though the Senate had completely \ndifferent rules. But even the Department of Justice admitted that a 3-\nday adjournment was too short to give the President lawful authority to \nbypass the Senate.\n  Instead, the President audaciously claimed the power to decide that, \nin his opinion, our so-called pro forma sessions during this period did \nnot count as sessions of the Senate, even though they had always \ncounted, and the Senate should decide its own rules, and that has \nalways been the rule around here.\n  Not only, as Hamilton explained in Federalist 69, did the Framers \nspecifically deny our President the King's power to deem the \nlegislature out of session, but during these sessions the Senate was \nfully capable of engaging in its business. In fact, during similar \nsessions the previous fall, the Senate had twice passed legislation \nthat President Obama himself signed.\n  So extreme were the administration's arguments that the Supreme Court \nunanimously held President Obama's actions unconstitutional. In doing \nso, the Court confirmed that the Constitution does not create in the \nPresident an endlessly flexible power to bypass Congress when he \nhappens to disagree with us--as if our advice-and-consent role were \nmerely an inconvenience to be avoided, rather than the organizing \nprinciple of how the constitutional process is designed to work.\n  Taken together, these three cases represent a resounding victory for \nthe rule of law and the Constitution over the President's \nunilateralism, and they are far from unique examples. The Court has \nruled unanimously, by a vote of 9 to 0, against the Obama \nadministration 20 times--20 times, 9 to zip. These include many \nsignificant cases, such as the Hosanna-Tabor case, in which the Obama \nadministration tried to control a religious organization's hiring of \nits ministers; the Sackett case, in which the Obama administration \ntried to take away the lawful right to challenge unlawful EPA fines of \nup to $75,000 a day on a poor couple who were just trying to improve \ntheir property; and the Arizona case, in which the Obama administration \ntried to displace State law with mere Federal enforcement priorities.\n  But instead of taking these rebukes to heart, the President has \ndoubled down on his go-it-alone attitude. He has vowed more Executive \norders of questionable legality, he has reaffirmed his commitment to an \nextreme anti-energy agenda and a willingness to abuse his legal \nauthorities to unleash an onslaught of new regulations, and he has used \nthe mistrust he created by refusing to enforce existing immigration law \nto justify further nonenforcement.\n  President Obama's shameful defiance in the face of the Supreme \nCourt's rulings means our fight against his lawless overreach has only \njust begun. While we should applaud the Court's recent decisions, we \nshould also realize the limits of courtroom litigation to check \nexecutive branch abuse. Indeed, the Obama administration has gone to \ngreat lengths to shield its lawlessness from judicial review by \nsurreptitiously crafting many of such actions to prevent any plaintiff \nfrom having legal standing to launch a challenge in court, by \naggressively challenging the legitimacy of suits that have been filed, \nby significantly curtailing the availability of judicial review, and by \nbrazenly packing the DC Circuit--the Nation's most important court for \nmost regulatory cases--with compliant judges.\n  The Speaker of the House has announced plans to vote on a measure to \nauthorize a lawsuit against President Obama for his unfaithful \nexecution of the law. While I support the legislative branch using \nevery tool at our disposal to hold this President accountable to his \nconstitutional obligations, we should also be mindful of our decades-\nlong fight to limit the judicial power to its proper role under the \nConstitution. We should not seek to replace one constitutional \ntravesty--the lawlessness of this President--with another by breaking \ndown the structural limits on the judicial power. On the other hand, \nthe House may very well succeed because of the actions of this \nPresident because something has to be done to curtail these \ninappropriate, unilateral, illegal actions.\n\n  In the end, we cannot rely on the courts alone. With such a powerful \nand aggressive President, all of us must stand and fight back against \nthis executive lawlessness. I urge all my colleagues--both Democratic \nand Republican--to use the rightful and legitimate constitutional \nauthorities the Framers gave us to stand and resist the President's \nrecklessness.\n  But whether blinded by partisan loyalty to the President or too \ninexperienced to understand this body from any other perspective than \nhaving a like-minded Senate majority and President, my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle have allowed--even facilitated--this \nadministration's attempts to break down the constitutional checks on \nExecutive power.\n  I urge them to change course. That is the tradition of some of the \ngreatest Senators on both sides of the aisle--of Mike Mansfield, Howard \nBaker, and Robert Byrd. That is the purpose of the Constitution's \ndivision of powers, for as Madison counseled in Federalist 51, \n``. . . the great security against a gradual concentration of the \nseveral powers in the same department consists in giving to those who \nadminister each department the necessary constitutional means and \npersonal motives to resist encroachment of the others.''\n  If this body is to maintain a meaningful role in preserving liberty \nand prosperity, we must dutifully fulfill\n\n[[Page S4392]]\n\nour constitutional obligation of checking the President's unlawful \nattempts to assert illegitimate power.\n  I began my service here in 1977. Bob Byrd was the newly elected \nmajority leader. R.C. Byrd was one of the alltime procedural experts in \nthis body. He was a very strong personality. He would not be putting up \nwith what this President is doing. He would not be putting up with the \nusurpation of the Senate's power or of the legislature's power, the \nCongress's power.\n  I call on my Democratic friends on the other side to start standing \nup. If they do not start standing up, I think the people are going to \nhold them accountable because these are separated powers and the \nlegislative body is supposed to handle these matters and not some \nPresident unilaterally changing the law at his whimsy.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp).

Madam President, I wish to take a moment to congratulate \ntwo long-time friends.\n  Sixteen years ago, after moving to America, Billy Lawless and Anne \nO'Toole Lawless today became citizens of the United States of America. \nThis is a cause for celebration, not just for Billy and Anne but for \nthe entire city of Chicago. You see, the Lawless family is part of the \nrestaurant royalty in Chicago.\n  Billy and Anne and their four grown children--Billy, Jr., Amy, John \nPaul, and Clodagh--own and operate three of the best-loved--and my \nfavorite--restaurants and pubs in Chicago. They are going to open \nanother set very soon. Good food, good fun, great people, that is what \nthe Lawless restaurants are all about. Billy Lawless is also a tireless \nand eloquent advocate for immigration reform.\n  One of the great heroes of Irish mythology is a benevolent giant by \nthe name of Finn McCool, a great defender of Ireland.\n  In his younger days, Billy Lawless was a championship rower. At 6-\nfoot-2, with a broad rower's chest and strong arms, he looks a little \nbit like Finn McCool. And he is chairman of the group called Chicago \nCelts for Immigration Reform.\n  But it is not just Irish immigrants Billy cares about. Billy Lawless \nunderstands that America's history of welcoming immigrants from across \nthe globe--and he knows; he is part of it--is what makes our Nation \ngreat. He is a great defender not just of the rights of Irish \nimmigrants but all immigrants. So it was perfect that he and Anne swore \ntheir citizenship oaths today with 137 other new Americans from 39 \ndifferent countries and 5 continents.\n  Billy grew up on a dairy farm in Galway, a city in the west of \nIreland. In the late 1970s, he sold the farm and went into the pub \nbusiness. Over the next 20 years, Billy and Anne had four children, and \nthey owned and operated several well-known pubs and restaurants in \nGalway. Life was good.\n  Then their daughter Amy--an excellent athlete herself in rowing--won \na full college scholarship to Amherst College in Massachusetts.\n  For years, it had been Billy's dream to open a business in America. \nAt the age of 48, when his daughter headed off to America, he decided \nto give it a shot. His friends thought he was crazy. Anne waited \nseveral months before she followed Billy to the States for this \nventure. She wanted to make sure this wild idea had a possibility of \nsuccess.\n  Billy looked at opportunities in Boston and Philadelphia. But on \nDecember 31, 1997, New Year's Eve, Billy arrived in Chicago. He knew he \nhad found a new home.\n  Today, Chicago is home to Billy and Anne Lawless, all four of their \nchildren, and their seven American-born grandchildren. As Billy says:\n\n       I can think of no other place in the world where our family \n     could have achieved what it has in America.\n\n  Billy and Anne, thank you and all your family for what you have given \nto Chicago, to Illinois, and to our Nation. You have waited a long time \nand worked hard for this day. Now it is here. I am proud to call you \nnot only my friends but my fellow Americans. Congratulations on \nbecoming citizens of the United States.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Agreement--S. 2244\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be \ndetermined by me, after consultation with Senator McConnell, the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 438, S. 2244; that the \ncommittee-reported amendments be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, \nbe considered original text for the purposes of further amendment; that \nthe only amendments in order to the bill be the following: Coburn No. \n3549, Vitter No. 3550, Flake No. 3551, and Tester No. 3552; that each \namendment have 1 hour of debate, equally divided between the proponents \nand opponents; that there be 1 hour of general debate on the bill, \nequally divided between the two leaders or their designees; that upon \nthe use or yielding back of that time, the Senate proceed to votes in \nrelation to the amendments in the order listed; that there be no \nsecond-degree amendments in order to any of the amendments prior to the \nvotes; that upon disposition of the Tester amendment, the bill be read \na third time and the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill, as \namended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. So, Mr. President, we understand that in getting this \nagreement, Senators should expect a rollcall vote in relation to the \nCoburn amendment and another rollcall vote on passage of the bill, as \namended. The other amendments in this agreement are expected to be \nsubject to voice votes.\n  Mr. President, we have whipped right through this very quickly, but \nit is an extremely important piece of work that was done on a \nbipartisan basis on a very, very important piece of legislation. We \nhave to do this, this terrorism insurance. With all the things going on \nin the world, if we do not finish this, there will be no construction \nin America. We went through this a number of years ago. Construction \ncame to a screeching halt. It was bad enough, but with this not being \nable to be done, it made it even worse. So we are very fortunate we \nwill complete it next week--with this UC agreement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/10/senate-section/article/S4392-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4392]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, Father O'Donovan is one of the dearest \nfriends I have from my association with Georgetown past or present. \nMarcelle and I were privileged to help him celebrate his 80th birthday \nand join him for church the next day. His homily is truly reflective of \nthe wonderful human he is and I wanted to share it with my fellow \nSenators. I ask unanimous consent that Father O'Donovan's April 27, \n2014 homily be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           A Jesuit's Journey\n\n\n                       Homily in Dahlgren Chapel\n\n                     On the Second Sunday of Easter\n\n                             27 April 2014\n\n       Dear Friends: I beg your indulgence this morning to speak \n     more personally than the Second Sunday of Easter would \n     ordinarily suggest. You may permit me to do so, however, \n     since you have come to the Hilltop not\n\n[[Page S4393]]\n\n     only to help me celebrate a very ``round'' birthday but also \n     to give your support to the education of young Jesuits. And \n     so the story of this one Jesuit's journey will be linked to \n     that of my fellow Jesuits as well as to you, my very dear \n     friends.\n       When yesterday, it seems--I entered the Society of Jesus, I \n     was setting forth on a journey for which there were indeed \n     words--the love of God, the service of our fellow human \n     beings, a vowed life in the Church--but only a fairly shallow \n     grasp of what they might mean. Yesterday, with other newly \n     entered Jesuits, we were young, vigorous, some had great \n     dreams, others cherished a blessed sense of duty, all sensed \n     that somehow the life they gave to the esteemed Society of \n     Jesus would also be found, truly, in that least Society.\n       And now, suddenly, I find myself . . . 80 years old. When I \n     entered the Novitiate during the presidency of Dwight D. \n     Eisenhower, under the papacy of Pius XII, and with John \n     Baptist Janssens as General Superior of the Society of Jesus, \n     order was a relative constant in our experience. Soon the \n     constant became change. In our formative years our nation was \n     shaken, for good and ill, by the civil rights movement, the \n     Vietnam War, Watergate. The Second Vatican Council, with \n     roots, we learned, in the liturgical, patristic, theological \n     and ethical scholarship of many Jesuits among others, \n     convened in a miraculous rush of time between 1962 and 1965. \n     New hope dawned for the Church in the world, most of us \n     thought, just when the world seemed most to need such a \n     beacon. Within a decade, the journey on which we had embarked \n     seemed to have mysteriously changed--to have become, in fact, \n     far more an adventure. We were invited to change, too, if we \n     were really to live in the time we were being given. Many \n     other friends had experiences somewhat similar, not least \n     because children change everything.\n\n\n                            The God of Time\n\n       The time we were being given: through it all there was this \n     constant: the patience and fidelity of God. In the Society of \n     Jesus we wanted liturgical participation, social renewal, a \n     newly intimate community life. Indeed, as the Society began \n     remarkably to appropriate the aggiornamento of the Council in \n     its General Congregations from the 31st onward, under the new \n     and (I deeply believe) sainted leadership of Pedro Arrupe, we \n     were called officially and authoritatively to recognize that \n     a community of loved sinners can only be faithful if it seeks \n     the unloved, stands with those who have been shunned, lives \n     but also learns in solidarity with the poor.\n       How clumsily, how unrealistically, with what a rush we \n     often sought our new goals and discovered that God, the Holy \n     Mystery who is our Absolute future, was patient with our \n     straining time, was even taking it into God's own life. (Some \n     of us became aware of what can only be called God's sense of \n     humor before the human spectacle.) The love of neighbor which \n     had seemed like the love of God, a moral imperative and \n     recommended pattern of behavior, proved to be far more: the \n     discovery of and entry into God's own life. God was not just \n     pleased if we could be healing, or encouraging, or messengers \n     of justice. God was there, in the care and hope and justice, \n     taking our time into God's own.\n       For if God is eternal but also offers divine life and grace \n     to a freely created world, then that world's time and \n     history, our time and history, becomes God's time and history \n     truly, too.\n       We had set off on a journey to a goal--and discovered that \n     we were already, however and even desperately unworthily, \n     already living in it. Through the patience of the Great Tutor \n     we were learning that incarnation was specific to a certain \n     time and place--but also calls all time and space to union \n     with it.\n\n\n                          The God of Suffering\n\n       Incarnation, however, means becoming fully human, and \n     sooner or later, one learns the cost of the endeavor. There \n     were ghastly events in political society such as the Balkans \n     war or the Rwanda genocide. There were what many of us \n     considered retreats from the ``aggressive fidelity'' of the \n     Council. Our own nation's struggles with racism, sexism, and \n     the serious poverty of many Americans seemed to fail as often \n     as they succeeded.\n       But there were more personal losses as well. We lost \n     parents and friends. We struggled with alcoholism and other \n     addictions. Cherished projects all too often failed. The \n     social legislation we favored did not pass. The promotion we \n     hoped for went to someone else. Anxiety became a nearer \n     neighbor. Many fellow Jesuits, a Provincial and not a few \n     best friends among them, left our company. The symphony's \n     scherzo proved to be a threnody.\n       But God was patient, was indeed perhaps most patient with \n     our suffering. The cross of Christ before which we had been \n     encouraged to ask: ``What have I done for Christ? What am I \n     doing for Christ? What shall I do for Christ?'' became \n     something not imagined but rather our immediate experience. \n     His suffering was ours, and ours his, because he had given \n     himself for and to us, and had claimed us to and for him.\n       And so, even more miraculous than life itself, there Christ \n     is--in the illiterate village, the anguished schizophrenic, \n     the solitary death row, all the battlegrounds of the world--\n     the whole Christ to whom all belong and they to him, the \n     crucified and risen one who is never a stranger but the \n     patient one who waits for us always--and from whose love \n     nothing, nothing, nothing can separate us.\n\n\n                           The God of Beauty\n\n       If the cross of Christ seals our time and shares our \n     suffering, revealing the patience of God, it awakens us also, \n     in ways I scarcely could have imagined all those years ago on \n     this Hilltop--yesterday--to the beauty of God. Darwin wrote \n     toward the end of his life and without apparent regret that \n     his scientific studies had led him no longer to be able to \n     enjoy Shakespeare. Dostoevsky, on the other hand, let Prince \n     Myshkin speak his hope: Beauty will save the world.\n       For many young people, ``the beautiful'' is a preoccupation \n     for an elite few. But with fellow Jesuits and so many of you \n     here today, I have learned how wonderfully various and \n     compelling God's world is. My Jesuit classmates included a \n     poet, historians, literary critics, high school and college \n     administrators, journalists and prolific authors, theologians \n     and philosophers, spiritual directors and retreat masters, \n     ethicists. We have served in North America, South America, \n     Europe, Africa and Asia. And if beauty is what arrests and \n     compels human attention, whether in the splendor of a sunset \n     or the sorrow of a scar, a Frederick Edwin Church landscape \n     or a character such as August Wilson's King Hedley II, we \n     have seen too much marvelous variety not to have become more \n     alert to the beauty of the artisan of it all.\n       It was easy enough to appreciate the harmonious, the \n     splendid, the musical moments of our experience. Harder to \n     recognize what distortion, darkness, dissonance reveal. But \n     the same Spirit that establishes order can comfort tears; the \n     Spirit that illumines can guide through the night; the Spirit \n     that teaches song can interpret discord. The beauty of God \n     can come in the mode of fulfillment, in achieved form and \n     luminous color and delicate balance, but also in the mode of \n     hope, in protest against violence, in fury at injustice, in \n     conscientious objection.\n       To say that the Spirit of God teaches us to see again and \n     to hope to see wholly is not to claim completion. I find \n     myself at 80 each year happier and more blessed to be a \n     Jesuit priest--but journeying still. This too: beauty is \n     always fresh, new, surprising. And if a patient God has made \n     our time God's own, and our suffering God's own, then how can \n     we not hope that in today's liturgy indeed but one day \n     finally and forever, God's Spirit will teach each of us the \n     most beautiful words of all:\n           Take me. I am yours.\n     Leo J. O'Donovan, S.J.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/10/senate-section/article/S4393-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4393-S4394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is always good to have someone in the \nmedia with a sense of history. Walter Pincus demonstrates that time and \nagain. His June 19 column in The Washington Post is a prime example and \nI ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 19, 2014]\n\n     Dick Cheney Wants To Forget History and Write His Own Version\n\n                           (By Walter Pincus)\n\n       Why should anyone take seriously what Dick Cheney says \n     about President Obama's policy in Iraq?\n       In their Wall Street Journal op-ed this week, Cheney and \n     his daughter Liz began by cherry-picking Obama quotes from \n     over three years about the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria \n     (ISIS).\n       That warmed-over technique is what Cheney, President George \n     W. Bush and other top aides cleverly used with intelligence \n     reports in the fall of 2002 as they drummed up public support \n     for their invasion of Iraq. That, of course, set the stage \n     for today's terrible events.\n       ``Rarely has a U.S. president been so wrong about so much \n     at the expense of so many,'' the Cheneys chortled. ``Too many \n     times to count, Mr. Obama has told us he is ending' the wars \n     in Iraq and Afghanistan--as though wishing made it so.''\n       Let's return to a Dick Cheney speech on Aug. 27, 2002, in \n     Nashville, before the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) and see \n     how many times a vice president could be ``so wrong about so \n     much at the expense of so many.''\n       He told his audience: ``In Afghanistan, the Taliban regime \n     and al-Qaeda terrorists have met the fate they chose for \n     themselves. And they saw . . . the new methods and \n     capabilities of America's armed services.''\n       Here's another applause line: ``In the case of Osama bin \n     Laden--as President Bush said recently--`If he's alive, we'll \n     get him. If he's not alive--we already got him.''\n       The Bush team never got him. Obama did.\n       When Cheney was speaking, bin Laden was very much alive. \n     Al-Qaeda terrorists and the Taliban had just retreated, but \n     they were able to regroup as the Bush team, satisfied with \n     its ``victory'' in Afghanistan, had turned its attention and \n     U.S. military forces toward Iraq.\n       It was in this speech that Cheney began what a former Bush \n     chief of staff, Andrew Card, would describe as the fall 2002 \n     public-relations plan to ``educate the public'' about\n\n[[Page S4394]]\n\n     the so-called threat from Iraq. That effort would lead to a \n     congressional joint resolution authorizing the president to \n     use U.S. armed forces to ``defend the national security of \n     the United States against the continuing threat posed by \n     Iraq'' and ``enforce all relevant United Nations Security \n     Council resolutions regarding Iraq.''\n       Cheney told the VFW: ``The Iraqi regime has in fact been \n     very busy enhancing its capabilities in the field of chemical \n     and biological agents. And they continue to pursue the \n     nuclear program they began so many years ago.''\n       He added: ``We've gotten this from the firsthand testimony \n     of defectors--including Saddam's own son-in-law, who was \n     subsequently murdered at Saddam's direction. Many of us are \n     convinced that Saddam will acquire nuclear weapons fairly \n     soon.''\n       A former White House deputy press secretary, Scott \n     McClellan, would later write that a White House Iraq Group \n     (WHIG) was ``set up in the summer of 2002 to coordinate the \n     marketing of the [Iraq] war,'' and will continue ``as a \n     strategic communications group after the invasion had toppled \n     Saddam [Hussein]'s regime.''\n       It was Cheney at the VFW convention who first said: \n     ``Regime change in Iraq would bring about a number of \n     benefits to the region. When the gravest of threats are \n     eliminated, the freedom-loving peoples of the region will \n     have a chance to promote the values that can bring lasting \n     peace.''\n       He also said: ``Extremists in the region would have to \n     rethink their strategy of Jihad. Moderates throughout the \n     region would take heart. And our ability to advance the \n     Israeli-Palestinian peace process would be enhanced, just as \n     it was following the liberation of Kuwait in 1991.''\n       Show me a better example of ``as though wishing made it \n     so.''\n       The Cheneys also cavalierly forget that the status of \n     forces agreement with Iraq that Bush signed Dec. 14, 2008, \n     made way for the withdrawal of all U.S. combat troops by the \n     end of 2011. That agreement protected U.S. forces on duty \n     from prosecution by Iraqi courts. It was the Iraqis' desire \n     to modify this that led Obama--on the advice of his military \n     chiefs--to not leave a residual force of military trainers.\n       One more sign of the Cheneys' convenient amnesia: They said \n     of Obama's initiative toward involving Tehran in the effort \n     to put down ISIS advances in Iraq, ``Only a fool would \n     believe American policy in Iraq should be ceded to Iran, the \n     world's largest sponsor of terror.''\n       In November 2001, the Bush White House, despite icy \n     relations, approved talking directly to Iran diplomats before \n     and during the Bonn conference called to try to establish a \n     post-Taliban government in Afghanistan. As a result, U.S. \n     Ambassador James Dobbin got what he described as Tehran's \n     ``major contribution to forge a solution'' among various \n     Afghan groups, which in turn led to a unified temporary Kabul \n     government under Hamid Karzai.\n       On Dec. 5, 2001, a White House spokesman described Bush as \n     ``very pleased'' with the Afghan agreement. However, in his \n     Jan. 29, 2002, State of the Union speech, Bush described \n     Iran, Iraq and North Korea as the ``axis of evil'' at the \n     same time there were meetings underway between U.S. and \n     Iranian diplomats to see whether talks could go beyond \n     Afghanistan.\n       In contrast to the Cheneys, people should listen to former \n     secretary of state James Baker III, who in Thursday's Wall \n     Street Journal called on the United States to organize an \n     international coalition of regional countries, including \n     Iran. Recalling Iran's cooperation on Afghanistan, Baker said \n     today's ``reality is that Iran is already the most \n     influential external player in Iraq and so any effort without \n     Iranian participation will likely fail.''\n       Baker has a successful track record and a memory. The \n     Cheneys have neither.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/10/senate-section/article/S4394-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4394-S4395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NEVADA TRIBAL LANDS TRANSFER\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this week the Senate Committee on Indian \nAffairs held a hearing to address five important pieces of legislation. \nTwo of these bills, the Moapa Band of Paiutes Land Conveyance Act--S. \n2479--and the Nevada Native Nations Land Act--S. 2480--will transfer \nland into trust for a total of eight Indian tribes in Nevada for \nheritage preservation and economic development.\n  Nevada's Great Basin has always been home to the Washoe, Paiute and \nWestern Shoshone Peoples. The First Nevadans have long been a voice for \nprotecting our wild landscapes and enriching our State through their \nlanguage and cultural heritage. I take the many obligations that the \nUnited States has to tribal nations seriously. Land is lifeblood to \nNative Americans and these bills provide space for housing, economic \ndevelopment, traditional uses and cultural protection. I would like to \ncommend the tribes, whose immense work and collaboration made these \nbills possible, and I look forward to continuing to work with our First \nNevadans on protecting homelands.\n  The Moapa Band of Paiute Indians have been in Nevada and the West \nsince time immemorial and suffered great land losses through Federal \nIndian policy. When the Moapa River Reservation was established in the \nlate 1800s, it consisted of over 2 million acres. In its lust to settle \nthe West, Congress drastically reduced the reservation to just 1,000 \nacres in 1875. It wasn't until 1980 that Congress restored 70,500 acres \nto the reservation. Today the reservation is approximately 71,954 \nacres.\n  The Moapa Band of Paiutes Land Conveyance Act, S. 2479, would direct \nthe Secretary of the Interior to take more than 26,000 acres of land \ncurrently managed by the Bureau of Land Management--BLM--and the Bureau \nof Reclamation into trust for the Moapa People who live outside of Las \nVegas, NV. This legislation would provide much needed land for the \ntribe's housing, economic development and cultural preservation.\n  Located on I-15, the tribe runs the Moapa Paiute Travel Plaza. The \ntribe is the first in Indian Country to develop utility-scale solar \nprojects on tribal lands. Since southern Nevada has critical habitat \nfor the desert tortoise, a species listed as threatened under the \nEndangered Species Act, the tribe works closely with Federal, State, \nand local partners, members of the conservation community and \ninterested stakeholders to develop their community in an \nenvironmentally responsible manner.\n  The Nevada Native Nations Land Act, S. 2480, would transfer land into \ntrust for seven northern Nevada tribes--the Elko Band of the Te-Moak \nTribe of Western Shoshone Indians, the Fort McDermitt Paiute and \nShoshone Tribe, the Duck Valley Shoshone Paiute Tribes, the Summit Lake \nPaiute Tribe, the Reno-Sparks Indian Colony, the Pyramid Lake Paiute \nTribe and the South Fork Band of the Te-Moak Tribe of Western Shoshone \nIndians. As does S. 2479, the Nevada Native Nations Land Act would \nallow these seven tribes to build housing for their members, preserve \ntheir cultural heritage and traditions, and provide opportunities for \neconomic development.\n  Since time immemorial, the Western Shoshone have been living in what \nis now known as southern Idaho, central Nevada, northwestern Utah, and \nthe Death Valley region of southern California. The Elko and South Fork \nBands are two of four bands that comprise the Te-Moak Tribe of Western \nShoshone Indians.\n  The Elko Band's reservation, or colony, is landlocked by the growing \nCity of Elko, where band members have been coming for mining and \nrailroad jobs for decades. The colony needs additional lands for \nhousing and economic development. My legislation would expand the Elko \nBand's reservation by transferring 373 acres of BLM-managed land into \ntrust for the tribe.\n  S. 2480 would also convey 275 acres, just west of the City of Elko, \nto Elko County to provide space for a BMX, motocross, off-highway \nvehicle, and stock car racing area.\n  The South Fork Reservation, home to the South Fork Band, is comprised \nof 13,050 acres. The Band was one of the groups of Western Shoshone \nthat refused to move to the Duck Valley Reservation and stayed at the \nheadwaters of the Reese River, near the present Battle Mountain Colony. \nEstablished by Executive order in 1941, the colony was originally 9,500 \nacres of land purchased under the Indian Reorganization Act. In \naddition to rugged high desert terrain near the foothills of the Ruby \nMountains, the reservation has open range which is used for open cattle \ngrazing and agricultural uses. The Nevada Native Nations Land Act would \nplace 28,162 acres of BLM land into trust for the tribes and release \nthe Red Spring Wilderness Study Area--WSA--from further study.\n  The Northern Paiutes made their homes throughout what is now known as \nIdaho, California, Utah and Nevada. Due to westward expansion, our \ngovernment pushed some Western Shoshones and Northern Paiutes into the \nsame tribe and onto the same reservation where their descendants \nremain.\n  The Fort McDermitt Paiute and Shoshone Tribe now make their home \nalong the Nevada-Oregon border. Starting as a military fort in 1865, \nthe military reservation was turned into an Indian Agency in 1889 then \nestablished as an Indian reservation in 1936. The reservation is \ncurrently made up of 16,354\n\n[[Page S4395]]\n\nacres in Nevada and 19,000 acres in Oregon. The Nevada Native Nations \nLand Act would add 19,094 acres now managed by the BLM in Nevada to the \nlands already held in trust for the tribe.\n  The Duck Valley Indian Reservation is the home of the Shoshone-Paiute \nTribes who live along the State line between Nevada and Idaho. The \nreservation is 289,819 acres, including 22,231 acres of wetlands. The \ntribes have limited economic opportunities and tribal members have made \ntheir way farming and ranching. This bill would place 82 acres of U.S. \nForest Service land into trust for the tribes. The tribes plan to \nrehabilitate structures that were used by Forest Service employees into \nmuch-needed housing on the parcel.\n  The Summit Lake Reservation is one of the most rural and remote \nreservations in Nevada along the Oregon and California borders. \nEstablished in 1913 for the Summit Lake Paiute Tribe, the reservation \ntoday is 12,573 acres. The tribe seeks land to maintain the integrity \nof its reservation, protect Summit Lake and restore the Lahontan \nCutthroat Trout. S. 2480 would transfer 941 acres of BLM-managed land \ninto trust for the tribe.\n  The Reno-Sparks Indian Colony has a very small 28-acre reservation in \nReno, NV. The colony has 1,100 Paiute, Shoshone and Washoe members some \nof whom live on a 1,920 acre reservation in Hungry Valley, which is 19 \nmiles north of Reno. The Hungry Valley Reservation is surrounded by \nshooting and ATV activities and tribal members have requested a buffer \nzone to ensure the safety of their community. The legislation would \ntransfer 13,434 acres of BLM land into trust for the tribe.\n  The Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe have made their homelands around \nPyramid Lake, a unique desert terminal lake. Pyramid Lake is one of the \nmost valuable assets of the tribe and is entirely enclosed within the \nboundaries of the reservation. S. 2480 would expand the reservation \nwith an additional 30,669 acres of BLM-managed land.\n  This legislation is so important to me and the Indian tribes in \nNevada. Throughout the history of our country, Native Americans have \nbeen removed and disenfranchised from their homelands. They have been \ntreated so poorly. One of the first pieces of legislation I worked on \nwhen I came to Congress was the historic Pyramid Lake/Truckee-Carson \nWater Rights Settlement. This involved two States, several cities, a \nlake, a river, endangered species, and two Indian tribes. These Indian \nwater rights needed to be protected, just as tribal lands need to be \nrestored especially in Nevada where tribal landbases are smaller and \nmore rural and remote than any other parts of Indian Country. During my \ntime in the Senate, I will continue to do what I can to right some of \nthe many wrongs and help tribes restore their homelands.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/10/senate-section/article/S4395-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REMEMBERING HOWARD BAKER AND ALAN DIXON\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Nation recently lost two distinguished \nformer members of this body. I join those who mourn former Senate \nmajority leader Howard Baker of Tennessee, and former Senator Alan \nDixon of Illinois. And I am reminded by their passing of the passing of \nan era they helped forge, one in which elected officials of strong \nopinions but good will sought to accommodate the diverse viewpoints of \nthis great Nation, rather than using them to divide our people and \nobstruct the operations of government.\n  Howard Baker became known as ``the Great Conciliator.'' I am one of \nthe few members of the current Senate who served alongside him. We came \nfrom different places, and from different political traditions. We saw \nthe world differently. But I knew him, as all who worked with him knew \nhim, as someone who would fight for his positions but also work to \nunderstand the positions of others.\n  He described himself as a moderate at a time when that word wasn't \nout of fashion. And that moderation and sense of fairness are what \nguided him as he helped guide the Nation through one of the most \nsearing experiences in our history, the Watergate scandal. As the \nranking Republican on the Senate committee investigating the scandal, \nhe was a calm, collected, comforting presence at a time of great \ntumult. By placing the good of the Nation and the need to protect our \ndemocracy ahead of his own party's interests, he provided a powerful \nexample for us to follow, just as he did in helping to build bipartisan \nsupport for important civil rights and environmental legislation.\n  Alan Dixon, too, was shaped by, and helped to shape, a different era \nin politics. In his memoir, Senator Dixon wrote: ``Generally speaking, \nmy political career was built on goodwill and accommodation.'' Too few \npolitical figures can make such a claim today. As an elected official \nin Illinois, as a Senator, and as a valued member of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, Senator Dixon gained a reputation for fairness, \nbalance and understanding. I remember this well-earned reputation made \nhim a great help to Senator Sam Nunn, the Democratic leader on the \nArmed Services Committee, during debate on the annual Defense \nAuthorization Act. It is also why he was chosen for the difficult and \nimportant responsibility of leading the base closure commission.\n  Senator Dixon showed that a fairness and accommodation need not \ncontradict fighting strongly for your beliefs. He often told the story \nof how during committee debate on a defense bill during the 1980s the \ncommittee was poised to sign off on buying a new anti-aircraft system. \nDixon had read that system had serious problems, and though he was then \nrelatively junior on the committee, he objected to its inclusion in the \ndefense bill. The powerful chairman at the time, Senator Goldwater, \ntold Dixon that if he thought there was a problem, he should go down to \nFort Bliss, TX, that weekend, check it out, and report back to the \ncommittee. Dixon did, and when he asked, somewhat to the chagrin of his \nmilitary tour guides, for a demonstration of the system, it fired at 88 \ntargets and missed 87. When he reported back to the committee on his \nfindings, it quickly decided to cancel the program, a decision even the \nPentagon had to support.\n  Now, some might see that story as an illustration of the need to \nchallenge authority, an argument against going along to getting along--\nAnd it is--But it is important to note that Alan Dixon didn't try to \ndemonize his opponents, didn't portray them as enemies. He honestly \ndisagreed, raised his objections, pursued the facts, laid them before \nhis colleagues, and trusted in their good judgment.\n  Our Nation is no less diverse than it was when Howard Baker and Alan \nDixon practiced the principled politics of accommodation. Our \nchallenges are no smaller. The need to bridge gaps rather than widen \nthem is just as urgent for us as it was for them. We can, and I hope we \nwill, learn from their examples as we confront the challenges we face \nand the needs of the Nation we serve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/10/senate-section/article/S4395-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4395-S4396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     Army Sergeant James E.

James died March 31, 2012 in Logar province, Afghanistan, in \nsupport of Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  James was born December 25, 1986 in Weleetka, OK. He graduated from \nWeleetka High School in 2006 and later moved with his parents to \nChecotah, OK where he served as a firefighter for the Lotawatah Rural \nFire Department and worked for Winkle's Hardware until joining the \nArmy.\n  After completing basic combat training at Fort Jackson, SC, James was \nassigned to the 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum, NY where he worked \nas a firefighter and mechanic. In 2008, James had a son, William Tyler \nAnderson and in 2009, shortly after the birth of his son, he was \ndeployed to Afghanistan.\n  He returned to Fort Drum in 2010 and in October of 2011 he was \nreassigned to the 125th Brigade Support Battalion, 3d Infantry Brigade \nCombat Team, 1st Armored Division, based at Fort Bliss, TX. He deployed \nfor his second tour to Afghanistan in December 2011.\n  James loved the U.S. Army and planned on a long career serving his \ncountry. He believed in and loved what he was doing and that is where \nhe wanted to be.\n  On April 23, 2012, the family held a funeral service at First Baptist \nChurch in Checotah, OK and James was laid to rest in Fort Gibson \nNational Cemetery in Fort Gibson, OK.\n\n[[Page S4396]]\n\n  James was preceded in death by his sister Kimberly Ann Dutton, \ngrandfather James H.

Ozbat\n\n  Mr. President, it is my honor to also pay tribute to the life and \nsacrifice of a remarkable young man, Army CPT Jesse A. Ozbat. Jesse \ndied May 20, 2012 in Tarin Kowt Province, Afghanistan, in support of \nOperation Enduring Freedom.\n  The son of a retired Army first sergeant, Jesse was born February 21, \n1984 in Caro, MI. He was a member of the Prince George High School \nJunior Reserve Officer Training Corps in Virginia and graduated in \n2002. He then enrolled in Virginia State University's Reserve Officer \nTraining Corps program where he earned his commission on May 13, 2006, \nfinishing in the top 10 percent of all cadets nationwide.\n  Upon entering active service, Jesse attended Basic Officer Leaders \nCourse, BOLC II at Fort Benning, GA, and BOLC III at Fort Sill, OK. He \nwas then assigned as the fire support officer for the C/1--4 Stryker \nInfantry Company, Schofield Barracks, HI, where he deployed to the 1st \nand 14th Infantry, 2nd Stryker Brigade in support of Iraqi Freedom in \n2009. He then returned to Fort Sill where he graduated from the field \nartillery captain's career course and was assigned to Headquarters \nHeadquarters Batter, HHB, 214 Fires Brigade as the fire controller \nofficer and Current Operations Office. From Sept. 2010-March 2012, he \nserved as the commander of the HHB, 214th Fires Brigade.\n  ``He was a soldier. That's all he ever wanted to be . . . a soldier. \nHe died doing what he wanted to be,'' said his grandmother Shirley \nScott.\n  A funeral service was conducted on June 2, 2012 at Fort Lee, VA. \nInterment with full military honors followed the service at Blandford \nCemetery in Petersburg, VA.\n  He is survived by his wife Danielle T.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and honor the \nextraordinary service and ultimate sacrifice of Tipton County sheriff's \ndeputy Jacob Calvin. Dedicated, loyal, and above all compassionate to \nthose in need, Deputy Calvin served with the Tipton County Sheriff's \nDepartment since 2012.\n  On Saturday, June 28, 2014, Deputy Calvin responded to reports of an \ninjured motorist involved in a car crash. While driving to the scene of \nthe crash, Deputy Calvin's patrol car left the road and was involved in \nan accident. Sadly, despite the best efforts of his fellow officers, \nEMTs and medical personnel, Deputy Calvin, 31, succumbed to his wounds.\n  ``He was doing what he was supposed to do . . . I take a lot of \ncomfort knowing that he was going to help someone.'' said his father, \nDan Calvin.\n  An Indiana native, Deputy Calvin lived in the town of Kempton. Jacob \nlearned at an early age the importance of community and possessed a \nservant heart. After graduating from Carroll High School, Jacob \nenlisted in the U.S. Air Force in 1999 at the age of 17. He served as a \nstaff sergeant with the security police in the Air Force for 6 years \nand was stationed in Iraq for a tour of duty which he completed in \n2005. During his time serving in the Air Force, Jacob was recognized on \nmultiple occasions for his outstanding performance as a soldier. After \nhis discharge, Jacob graduated from Lincoln Technical Diesel Mechanic \nSchool and would later start his own business, Infinity Diesel.\n  In addition to his service with the Air Force and the sheriff's \ndepartment, Jacob was a member of the Kempton Volunteer Fire Department \nand was a trained EMT. He was a member of the Future Farmers of \nAmerica, a Brother of the Free and Accepted Masons Mulberry Lodge, 10-\nyear member of 4-H, Civil Air Patrol receiving the ``Billy Mitchell \nAward'' and a devoted congregant of the Flora First Christian Church. \nKnown for his tenacious spirit and concern for others, Jacob was well \nknown and respected by those in the Tipton County community.\n  ``I'm very honored that I had Jake Calvin work for me for two and a \nhalf years.'' said Tipton County Sheriff John Moses.\n  Deputy Calvin is survived and deeply missed by his parents Dan Calvin \n(Carla) and Penny Williams Visser (John), his fiancee Ms. Samantha J. \nHawkins, paternal grandparents Robert and Anna Marie Calvin, step-\npaternal grandparents Richard and LaVerne VonAhrens, brother Luke \nCalvin (Lea-Anndra), stepbrother Zach Visser, stepsister Victoria \nVisser, his three nephews: Dakota, Evan and Emmett, as well as other \nrelatives, friends, the Tipton County Sheriff's Department family, the \nKempton Volunteer Fire Department family and Hoosiers across the state.\n  Deputy Calvin loved his work, and he gave his life to serve and \nprotect the citizens of Indiana. Although he would have never thought \nof himself as a hero, Deputy Calvin demonstrated his character daily by \nconducting himself with courage, bravery, compassion, honor and \nintegrity. Thus, he was a\n\n[[Page S4397]]\n\ntrue American hero--in his everyday life as a police officer, as a \nmember of the U.S. Air Force, a son and friend to so many--and in his \nfinal call to duty. Let us always remember and treasure the memory of \nthis stalwart, brave man and honor him for his selfless commitment to \nserving his fellow citizens. May God welcome him home and give comfort \nto his family and friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/10/senate-section/article/S4397-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  MOUNT CHASE MAINE SESQUI-CENTENNIAL\n\n Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President. Today I commemorate the 150th \nanniversary of the town of Mount Chase, ME. Mount Chase was built with \na spirit of determination and resiliency that still guides the \ncommunity today, and this is a time to celebrate the generations of \nhard-working and caring people who have made it such a wonderful place \nto live, work, and raise families.\n  While this sesquicentennial marks Mount Chase's incorporation, the \nyear 1864 was but one milestone in a long journey of progress. For \nthousands of years, the land surrounding Mt. Katahdin, Maine's highest \npeak, was the hunting and fishing grounds of the Penobscot and Maliseet \ntribes. In the 1830s, the first white settlers were drawn by the \nfertile soil, vast stands of timber, and fast-moving streams, and the \nyoung village became a center of the Maine North Woods lumber industry. \nThe wealth produced by the forests and saw mills was invested in \nschools and churches to create a true community. The incorporated town \nthat followed was named for the prominent mountain peak, Mt. Chase, \nwhich towers more than a half-mile above the farms and forests below.\n  The arrival of the railroads in the aftermath of the Civil War \nfurther secured Mount Chase's prominence in the lumber industry, and \nthe town was home to the largest cold-storage plant on the line for \nwild game and other perishable food products. By the end of the 19th \ncentury, modern transportation and the region's spectacular scenery and \nabundant wildlife combined to create a new economic opportunity--great \nsporting camps and lodges that drew outdoor enthusiasts from around the \nworld. Today, the people of Mount Chase continue to honor the strong \nland use traditions and love of the outdoors that have helped make such \nplaces as Shin Pond a favorite recreation destination for residents and \nvisitors.\n  In the early 20th century, the history, industry, and beauty of the \nMount Chase region were made immortal by the great Swedish-born artist \nCarl Sprinchorn, who spent many years at Shin Pond. From his paintings \nof the strenuous daily life of lumberjacks to his evocative landscapes, \nthe artist recorded a very special time in Maine history and a place \nthat remains special today.\n  This 150th anniversary is not just about something that is measured \nin calendar years, it is about human accomplishment, an occasion to \ncelebrate the people who for generations have pulled together, cared \nfor one another, and built a community. Thanks to those who came \nbefore, Mount Chase has a wonderful history. Thanks to those who are \nthere today, it has a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/10/senate-section/article/S4397-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING DR. ROBERT COPE\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, my colleague Senator Jim Risch joins \nme today in honoring Lemhi County commissioner Dr. Robert Cope, who is \nretiring from the Lemhi County Commission after 14 years of exemplary \nservice.\n  Cope is not one to shy away from challenges; he faces them head on. \nHe recognizes a problem and works diligently to fix it. This \ncharacteristic has been instrumental in his ability to address critical \nnatural resources and environmental challenges. The common sense, \nwisdom, and humor he brings often to contentious issues have been \ninvaluable in achieving solutions. He is truly a pleasure to work with \nand know. Throughout his time as commissioner, we have greatly valued \nhis input and approach. Through his efforts with the Idaho Roadless \nRule, addressing noxious weed control and many other land management \nconcerns, he has helped bring about solutions important both locally \nand nationally. He is well-respected as a problem solver and consensus \nbuilder.\n  His public service is shaped by his deep personal knowledge and \ninfluenced by his distinguished career. Cope, a U.S. Presidential \nScholar and Kansas State University College of Veterinary Medicine \ngraduate, thankfully fell in love with Idaho and made Salmon, Idaho, \nhome. He has spent nearly 40 years in veterinary practice, a critical \npart of the community, working with Lemhi cattle ranchers. He has been \ncounted on to work cattle at all hours of the day and night, often in \ndifficult conditions. The respect many have for his work and \nunderstanding of natural resources issues has inevitably led to his \nservice in leadership roles on numerous boards and commissions, \nincluding the National Association of Counties, the U.S. Forest \nService's National Planning Rule Implementation Committee and the Idaho \nRoadless Commission.\n  We have greatly valued your insight, Dr. Cope, and thank you for your \nhard work and outstanding service. We are fortunate that you chose to \nbe an Idahoan. Congratulations on your retirement from the commission. \nWe hope it provides you with more time to spend with your many friends \nand family, including your wife, Terrie.

Cooper, who is retiring from the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy, DOE, where he was a great asset to Idaho during \nhis tenure with the Idaho Operations Office.\n  Jim is retiring as deputy manager for the Idaho Cleanup Project. His \nresponsibilities have included management of spent nuclear fuel and \nhigh-level radioactive waste and the exhumation and disposal of cold-\nwar era buried transuranic waste. His work advancing the environmental \ncleanup mission at the site has helped reduce risk to workers, the \npublic, and the environment. It has also continued protection of the \nSnake River Plain Aquifer. Through his leadership, environmental \ncleanup projects have been finished ahead of schedule and under cost, \nwhich has enabled resources to be reinvested into furthering the \ncleanup efforts. Jim's commitment to timely and cost-effective \nmanagement is commendable.\n  Prior to his position with the Idaho Cleanup Project, Jim worked as \nthe facility and material disposition program manager and was \nresponsible for ensuring the safe and compliant deactivation and \ndecommissioning of nuclear test reactors and other retired nuclear \nfacilities at the Idaho National Laboratory. During this time, he \nhelped lead the cleanup team in successful deactivation and \ndecommissioning projects at the Idaho Site. This included a visionary \nchange in the approach of cleanup at the site.\n  Under Jim's management Idaho crews decontaminated and decommissioned \nmore than 200 facilities. Recognizing this hard work, the Idaho \ncontamination and decommissioning project was awarded the 2013 \nSecretary's Excellence and Achievement Award for completion of the \nproject's work scope ahead of schedule and under budget. Jim is well \nrespected for his strong leadership and ability to develop \nrelationships and communications that are instrumental in advancing \ncleanup.\n  Thank you, Jim, for your more than 30 years of service, including 22 \nyears of project management within DOE. You made great progress in the \ncritical effort of cleanup. As you retire, you are truly leaving our \nState and Nation in better condition. Current and future generations \nwill benefit from your hard work. You have much to be proud of for a \njob well done. Congratulations on your retirement.

His public service included time \nas an Idaho State Senator, a member of the Idaho State House of \nRepresentatives, Power County commissioner, and American Falls City \ncouncilman and mayor. He was part of numerous Idaho State Senate \ncommittees, including on the Health and Welfare and Local Government \nand Taxation Committees, and interim committees.

Additionally, during his time \nas Power County commissioner, he was the legislative chair for the \nIdaho Association of Counties.\n  He had numerous other leadership roles, and he has been widely \nrecognized for his outstanding leadership. This includes his tenure as \nthe president of the Idaho Cities Association. Moon also served on the \nIdaho State University Alumni Board and on the Dean's Advisory Board \nfor the College of Pharmacy. He earned the College of Pharmacy's 1999 \nProfessional Achievement Award. In 1998, he was recognized with \nAmerican Falls High School Education Foundation's first Outstanding \nAlumna Award, and Moon and his wife Ann were honored with the school's \nHeritage Award in 2009. These are just a few of his many achievements \nthroughout his well-respected career and community involvement.\n  His considerable personal experience helped shape his public service. \nHis family homesteaded in Idaho. He attended the University of Idaho \nand earned a pharmacy degree from Idaho State University. He utilized \nhis degree as manager and owner of Rockland Pharmacy for more than 30 \nyears.

He is remembered as usually having at least one of \nhis children--Caleb, Maryanne, Henry, and Timothy--by his side as he \nworked on a variety of projects that included building rockets and \ncars, stargazing and landscaping. He is known as someone who worked \nhard and enjoyed the outdoors, spending time with family and friends, \nhiking, gold panning, camping and flying. Bryce encouraged those around \nhim, he was uplifting and liked to help others. Bryce was an Eagle \nScout who mentored Boy Scouts and helped advise in the Lewiston High \nSchool Skills USA program. He was also a member of the Nez Perce County \nSheriff's Air Posse.\n  Bryce is greatly missed in his hometown of Lewiston, where he was \npart of the heart of the community.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and \ncongratulate Ms. Lammiman for being awarded the National Association of \nAgricultural Educators Agriscience Teacher of the Year award. Ms. \nLammiman will receive her award at the NAAE convention in Las Vegas on \nDecember 5, along with a grant to purchase supplies and equipment for \nher classes. I am humbled and honored to congratulate her on being \npresented this prestigious award.\n  The National Association of Agricultural Educators named only six \neducators throughout the United States this year, and Ms. Lammiman, who \nis a teacher at Douglas High School in Minden, NV, is among the select \nfew chosen. The National Agriscience Teacher of the Year award \nrecognizes teachers who have inspired and enlightened their students \nthrough engaging and interactive lessons in the science of agriculture. \nMs. Lammiman, who has taught at Douglas High School for the past 9 \nyears, exemplifies these qualities. During her tenure, she has created \nseveral hands-on courses that allow students to apply in-class lessons \nto real-life situations in agricultural science.\n  Her mission to teach her students to think, rather than what to \nthink, is displayed in the courses that she has available for students. \nMs. Lammiman's students are truly receiving a hands-on education \nthrough her classes in floriculture, where children learn to operate a \nself-sufficient floriculture business; equine science, where they aided \nin the training and care of an adopted, orphaned foal named ``Flash;'' \nand natural resources, where the students create trails, raise Lahontan \nCutthroat trout, and collect data on Nevada's wild horse population. \nMs. Lammiman is not only an advocate for agriculture in the classroom, \nbut is also a co-advisor for the local Future Farmers of America \nchapter. Through her role as a co-advisor, she recruits volunteers from \nthe community to coach FFA teams, teaches the students to train horses, \nprovides placements for the individualized work experience internship \ncourses, and helps the students to raise livestock. The FFA serves to \nprovide students the opportunity to become well-educated, skilled, and \nproductive citizens through agricultural education.\n  It is no secret that teaching is one of the hardest jobs in the world \nand one of the most important. As a father of four children who \nattended Nevada's public schools, and as the husband of a lifelong \nteacher, I understand the important role that teachers play in \nenriching the lives of Nevada's students. Ensuring that America's youth \nare prepared to compete in the 21st century is critical for the future \nof our country. The State of Nevada is fortunate to be home to an \neducator like Ms. Lammiman, whose mission to educate children extends \nfar beyond the walls of the classroom.\n  I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in thanking Ms. \nLammiman for dedication to enriching the lives of Nevada's students and \ncongratulating her on this great achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/10/senate-section/article/S4398-3", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4398-S4399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DAVIS COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State. It has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful farm bills. But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and\n\n[[Page S4399]]\n\nresidents of Davis County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to successfully acquire financial assistance from \nprograms I have fought hard to support, which have provided more than \n$30 million to the local economy.\n  Of course, my favorite memory of working together has to be the \ncommunity's success in earning grants for fire safety equipment and \nfacilities through FEMA, working with Bloomfield to renovate the Davis \nCounty Courthouse, and the J.H. Leon Building through Main Street Iowa \nchallenge grant funds.\n  Among the highlights:\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as, \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Davis County's \nfire departments have received over $1.9 million for firefighter safety \nand operations equipment.\n  Main Street Iowa: One of the greatest challenges we face--in Iowa and \nall across America--is preserving the character and vitality of our \nsmall towns and rural communities. This isn't just about economics. It \nis also about maintaining our identity as Iowans. Main Street Iowa \nhelps preserve Iowa's heart and soul by providing funds to revitalize \ndowntown business districts. This program has allowed towns such as \nBloomfield to use that money to leverage other investments to jumpstart \nchange and renewal. I am so pleased that Davis County has earned \n$63,000 through this program. These grants build much more than \nbuildings. They build up the spirit and morale of people in our small \ntowns and local communities.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Davis County has received $659,000 in Harkin grants. Similarly, \nschools in Davis County have received funds that I designated for Iowa \nStar Schools for technology totaling $35,000.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Davis County has received more than $3.1 million \nfrom a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Disability Rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf.

Nearly a quarter century since \npassage of the ADA, I see remarkable changes in communities everywhere \nI go in Iowa--not just in curb cuts or closed-captioned television, but \nin the full participation of people with disabilities in our society \nand economy, folks who at long last have the opportunity to contribute \ntheir talents and to be fully included. These changes have increased \neconomic opportunities for all citizens of Davis County, both those \nwith and without disabilities.

Mr. President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State. It has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful farm bills. But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Delaware County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to successfully acquire financial assistance from \nprograms I have fought hard to support, which have provided more than \n$9 million to the local economy.\n  Of course, my favorite memory of working together has to be working \ntogether to mitigate and prevent damage from natural disasters. In \n1993, when historic floods ripped through Iowa, it became clear to me \nthat the national emergency-response infrastructure was woefully \ninadequate to meet the needs of Iowans in flood-ravaged communities. I \nwent to work dramatically expanding the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency's hazard mitigation program, which helps communities reduce the \nloss of life and property due to natural disasters and enables \nmitigation measures to be implemented during the immediate recovery \nperiod. Disaster relief means more than helping people and businesses \nget back on their feet after a disaster, it means doing our best to \nprevent the same predictable flood or other catastrophe from recurring \nin the future. The hazard mitigation program that I helped create in \n1993 has provided critical support to Iowa communities impacted by the \ndevastating floods of 2008. Delaware County has received over $5 \nmillion to remediate and prevent widespread destruction from natural \ndisasters.\n  Among the highlights:\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and\n\n[[Page S4400]]\n\nrepair efforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to \nbuilding new schools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served \nas the needed incentive to leverage local public and private dollars, \nso it often has a tremendous multiplier effect within a school \ndistrict. Over the years, Delaware County has received $458,158 in \nHarkin grants. Similarly, schools in Delaware County have received \nfunds that I designated for Iowa Star Schools for technology totaling \n$27,650.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Delaware County has received more than $6.5 \nmillion from a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as, \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Delaware \nCounty's fire departments have received over $1 million for firefighter \nsafety and operations equipment.\n  Disability rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf. But I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the ADA \nAmendments Act, I have had four guiding goals for our fellow citizens \nwith disabilities: equal opportunity, full participation, independent \nliving and economic self-sufficiency.

Mr. President, I wish to honor the remarkable \nlife of a young West Virginian, Michael Carroll, who sadly lost his \nlife to cancer on July 3. Although he said goodbye to family, friends \nand loved ones far too early, Michael led a tremendously accomplished \nlife during his 17 years, and he truly touched the lives of so many \nwith his heartfelt and inspirational efforts to help other children \naround the world battle cancer. Although we are all heartbroken about \nMichael's passing, it is a privilege to celebrate his extraordinary \nachievements.\n  A Wheeling native, Michael Paul Carroll was diagnosed with leukemia \nin 2003. After 3 years of treatment, he won his battle with cancer. \nUnfortunately in 2013, after years in remission, Michael was diagnosed \nwith a glioblastoma grade IV brain tumor due to the radiation from \nprevious treatment.\n  Yet, even though he was once again fighting for his own life, \nMichael's illness never stopped him from making a difference in the \nlives of other children suffering from cancer. While battling his brain \ntumor, Michael came up with the idea to design a stress relief toy that \nhelps kids cope with cancer. The idea is that anytime young cancer \npatients feel frustrated with their treatment or have a bad day, they \ncan exert their anger into these toys. After some thought and help from \nthe community, he created Michael's Meanies so ``a child with cancer \ncan give it back to their sickness,'' he said. Michael invented three \nbeanies after the three types of childhood cancers: Terry the Terrible \nTumor, Lily Lymphoma, and Lousy Louie Leukemia.\n  Michael once said:\n\n       I wanted to give something to the kids that they could take \n     their anger out on. I thought of making these into a stress \n     ball-like toy that the kids can squeeze hard, punch or even \n     throw them. My ultimate goal is for every child diagnosed \n     with cancer to get one during their treatment.\n\n  Although his ultimate goal has yet to be achieved, Michael's reach \nknows no bounds and he was able to help children around the world. With \n15,000 meanies made, it is not rare to see a child holding one of \nMichael's Meanies in a children's hospital in all 50 States, Puerto \nRico, Canada, England, Australia, and New Zealand. Through his meanies, \nMichael continues to make children's daily battle with cancer a little \neasier.\n  While making a difference throughout West Virginia, the United States \nand the world, Michael also made a significant impact in his hometown \nof Wheeling. He truly touched each person he met. Michael attended \nWheeling Park High School, and also volunteered at the Ohio Valley \nMedical Center and St. Alphonsus Catholic Church. He often visited \nchildren's hospitals to spread laughter and joy while meeting with \ncancer patients. Michael said, ``I take everything with humor,'' and \nwisely stated that laughter is the best medicine.\n  The strength that Michael mustered every day should inspire not only \nour sick young, but his resilience and goodwill should inspire all of \nus. His legacy and influence will live on through his meanies as they \ncomfort children fighting for their lives around the world. Michael, \nthank you for the gift you have left for us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/10/senate-section/article/S4400-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4400-S4401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING FLORIDA ALZHEIMER'S CAREGIVERS\n\n Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I wish to recognize two exceptional \nFloridians who have sacrificed to serve as caregivers for Alzheimer's \npatients. Their stories were recently published in the latest edition \nof ``Chicken Soup for the Soul: Living with Alzheimer's & Other \nDementias.'' The book, a compilation of 101 short stories, has \npreviously discussed a range of other medical issues and diseases. For \nthis latest publication, ``Chicken Soup'' partnered with the national \nAlzheimer's Association to tackle the difficult topic of Alzheimer's \ndisease and dementias and to share the stories of the families who face \nthe challenges of this disease. The heartbreaking stories that Laura \nSuihkonen Jones, of Lighthouse Point, and Jean Salisbury Campbell, of \nFort Lauderdale, shared of their families' experience with Alzheimer's \nwere chosen for inclusion from nearly 4,000 entries.\n  Today, Laura serves the Alzheimer's Association's Southeast Florida \nChapter as its liaison to Congresswoman Lois Frankel, and coordinates \nan Alzheimer's support group at Calvary Chapel in Fort Lauderdale. She \nwrote her story, ``Fear and Self-Pity Are My Mortal Enemies,'' to share \nboth the pain and joy of caring for her husband, Jay, who received his \ndiagnosis 7 years ago at age 50 when their daughter was just 3 years \nold. Laura strives every day to be a message of hope, particularly for \nthose families who receive Alzheimer's diagnoses at younger ages. \nAlzheimer's disease is growing rapidly, and recently 5.2 million people \nage 65 and older, as well as 200,000 individuals under age 65 were \ndiagnosed.\n  Jean, a retired Broward County school psychologist, shares her \npersonal testimony of caring for her elderly mother, the late Elizabeth \nSalisbury. Her essay, ``The Bird,'' recounts\n\n[[Page S4401]]\n\nan experience in an early stage of her mother's disease. In the middle \nof the night, her mother frantically woke up her family insisting that \na bird had flown into the house. Those caring for her insisted there \nwas no bird and that she was suffering from a hallucination common of \nthe disease until they escorted her back to her room, where they found \na large black bird in the room. This particular incident serves to \nremind of the importance of treating Alzheimer's patients with dignity \nand listening to what they have to say regardless of their disease.\n  As chairman of the Aging Committee, I want to recognize these two \nexceptional caregivers, whose heart-wrenching stories will become all \ntoo common among American families in the coming decades. This new \nedition of ``Chicken Soup'' is particularly timely as our Nation \ngrapples with a significant increase in Alzheimer's disease, with the \nnumber of diagnoses expected to rise to 16 million by 2050. In Florida \ntoday, nearly half a million Floridians over the age of 65 are living \nwith Alzheimer's disease, and this number is projected to continue \nrising in the coming years.\n  As we recall our recent observance of Alzheimer's and Brain Awareness \nMonth in June and recognize the stories of these two Florida women, it \nis important that we take the time to focus our resources to address \nthis disease and remember that an Alzheimer's diagnosis impacts not \nonly the patient, but the whole family. As the number of American \nfamilies facing similar and equally difficult circumstances increases, \nwe must ensure that those living with the disease are guaranteed the \nbest quality care and their loved ones, like Laura and Jean, are \nsupported as much as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/10/senate-section/article/S4401-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4:43 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagrees to the amendment of the Senate to the text of the bill (H.R. \n803) to reform, and strengthen the workforce investment system of the \nNation to put Americans back to work and make the United States more \ncompetitive in the 21st century, and that the House agrees to the \namendment of the Senate to the title of the aforementioned bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/10/senate-section/article/S4401-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bills were read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 2578.

A bill to require the Consumer Product Safety Commission to \npromulgate a rule to require child safety packaging for liquid nicotine \ncontainers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, we all recognize the danger that many \nhazardous chemicals and over-the-counter drugs pose to children. That's \nwhy we require child-resistant packaging for these substances to \nprevent accidental poisonings that could result in serious injury or \ndeath.\n  Unfortunately, there is no child-resistant packaging required for \nconcentrated liquid nicotine, which can be toxic if ingested or even \nabsorbed through skin in large amounts. According to the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics, AAP, some small 15 mL bottles of liquid nicotine \ncontain as much as 540 mg of nicotine. At the estimated lethal dose \nrange of nicotine, AAP notes that this small bottle contains enough \nnicotine to kill 4 small children. And even a very small amount of the \nliquid splashed on a child's skin can make the child very ill.\n  The American Association of Poison Control Centers, AAPCC, reports \nthat local poison control centers had already received 1,571 calls \nbetween January 1 and May 31 of this year related to liquid nicotine \nexposure. According to some experts who study nicotine exposure, it's \nonly a matter of time before an accidental nicotine ingestion results \nin death.\n  Today I am introducing the Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act \nwith Senators Pryor, Bennet, Blumenthal, Boxer, Brown, Durbin, Harkin, \nMarkey, Merkley, and Schumer to prevent these unnecessary tragedies. \nThis common-sense legislation gives the U.S. Consumer Product Safety \nCommission, CPSC, authority and direction to issue rules requiring \nsafer, child-resistant packaging for liquid nicotine products within 1 \nyear of passage.\n  The CPSC already requires child-resistant packaging for many \nhousehold products, including over-the-counter medicines and cleaning \nagents. These rules have prevented countless injuries and deaths to \nchildren. There is no reason that bottles of liquid nicotine should not \nalso be required to have child-resistant packaging as well.\n  I invite my colleagues to join us to support the Child Nicotine \nPoisoning Prevention Act. Working together, we can take simple steps to \nprevent accidental child nicotine poisonings.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2581\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical \nEducation Act of 2006 to raise the quality of career and technical \neducation programs and to allow local eligible recipients to use \nfunding to establish high-quality career academics; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Educating \nTomorrow's Workforce Act of 2014. This is a bipartisan bill with \nSenator Portman, who will follow me on the floor today. Senator Portman \nand I are working together as cochairs of the Senate Career and \nTechnical Education Caucus.\n  Let me first explain why career and technical education is important \nto me.\n  I grew up in a household in Kansas City where my dad ran a union-\norganized ironworking shop. He was the owner. Ironworkers and welders--\nin a good year, eight employees; in a bad year, five employees. My \nmother and my brothers and I worked in my dad's shop, and I came to \nappreciate working in that ironworking shop, the tremendous \ncraftsmanship and skill that went into being an ironworker. That lesson \nhas stuck with me for the rest of my life, and I really credit my dad \nwith my work ethic. In a manufacturing welding shop, you get up and you \ngo to work early because you want to get the work done before it gets \ntoo hot in the middle of the day.\n  I then had the experience in 1980 to take a year off from Harvard Law \nSchool and go to Honduras, where I was the principal of the Instituto \nTecnico Loyola, which was a school that taught kids to be welders and \ncarpenters. I was able to use the trades I had learned in my dad's \nshop, and what I saw in Honduras was the same thing: that the \nacquisition of skills--whether it be welding or carpentry or other \nskills--is a great path to life's success.\n  But one thing I noticed about the education system in my country--\neven\n\n[[Page S4407]]\n\nas I was working in my dad's shop, even as I was a principal of the \nschool in Honduras--was in the United States we sort of downgrade \ncareer and technical education. When I was a kid, it was called \nvocational education. Often, in high schools especially, students who \nwere thought to be kind of problems or not college material would kind \nof get trapped into vocational education curricula, and that would \nusually not be a good sign.\n  In fact, a friend of mine, who is a middle school teacher in \nsouthwest Virginia, told me that she would often see her students after \nthey had gone to the high school and ask, ``Hey, tell me what you are \nup to.'' And when a student said ``I am in the vocational education \nprogram,'' the student would almost slump their shoulders, like ``I \nknow you are going to be disappointed to hear this: I am in the \nvocational education program.''\n  Career and technical education is a very important pathway for life's \nsuccess, and there should be no stigma surrounding career and technical \neducation programs. But whether it is in our K-12 schools or in the \nhigher ed world or in the mindset of parents or guidance counselors or \neven in the military--in the military today, our military members can \nget tuition assistance benefits, but they can only be used for college \ncourses. You can get up to $4,500 a year in the military as a tuition \nassistance benefit, but you cannot use even $500 of it to take the \ncertification exam from the American Welding Society to get your \nwelding certificate. We still have a stigma against career and \ntechnical education, and we should not.\n  CTE integrates numerous aspects of liberal arts degrees for practical \nand applied purposes. CTE prepares students with industry-recognized \ncredentials, professional certificates, occasionally college credits, \nand, most importantly, training for careers as varied as nursing, \nphysician assistant, business administration, manufacturing, oil and \nnatural gas exploration, automotive maintenance, agriculture, welding, \nsoftware programming, culinary arts, and many other careers.\n  CTE happens in interesting places. CTE happens in K-12 school \nsystems. It happens on community college campuses. It happens in 4-year \ncolleges. It happens in stand-alone institutions such as the Newport \nNews Shipbuilding apprenticeship program, where people learn to \nmanufacturer the largest items on planet Earth: nuclear aircraft \ncarriers and submarines in Newport News, VA. It happens online. It \nhappens anywhere where there is somebody who wants to attain a skill \nand there is a qualified teacher or program that can convey and educate \na student in that skill so they can get a good job.\n  CTE programs are proven solutions for creating jobs, for retraining \nworkers, older workers who need to find new skills so they can be \nsuccessful and fill open jobs in the market, and ensure that students \nof all ages and walks of life are ready for a successful career.\n  When I was Governor, I worked on a number of educational issues, but \none I was very proud of was starting Governor's Career and Technical \nAcademies. We had 17 in Virginia--Governor's schools--that were college \nprep, academic, regional, magnet public high schools. It started in the \n1970s. But when I was running for Governor, I realized, wow, we do not \nhave a single school in the State that is a career and technical \neducation program that we have deemed fit to hang the Governor's label: \nThis is a Governor's career and technical academy. I said this has to \nbe just as important as college prep. So when I was Governor, we \nstarted Governor's Career and Technical Academies. By the end of my one \nterm--and that is all you get in Virginia--we had nine. The Republican \nGovernor who followed me liked the idea. By the end of his term, we had \n22. The Democratic Governor who has followed him is continuing to \nexpand it, and we now have academies around the Commonwealth, developed \nat partnerships among schools, employers, business organizations, and \npostsecondary institutions looking for these skills.\n  Last week, during our break week, I traveled in Virginia, and I heard \nthe same message from employers and educators: Education has to be job \nrelevant. It has to start at earlier grades. Completion rates need to \nbe maximized. We need to make sure all of our students have the skills \nthey will need to be able to build successful careers throughout their \nlives.\n  One entrepreneur even said to me: I am so glad I ended up going to \nthe Valley Career and Technical Education Program in the Shenandoah \nValley and went into CTE because it has enabled me to be my own boss.\n  I said: What do you mean by that?\n  He said: If I had gone to college, I would have gotten a good job \noffer from a good company and would have taken it, and I probably would \nstill be there. I would have been having a good career, but somebody \nelse would have been by boss. But by going to a career and technical \nprogram and learning a skill, it also encouraged me to be \nentrepreneurial. So I did not join somebody else's company; I started \nmy own company. CTE promotes entrepreneurial activity.\n  It is essential for the United States to invest in creating a world-\nclass system of education across the spectrum to ensure the technically \nskilled and well-trained workforce we need. That is why we are \nintroducing this bill--Senator Portman and I--the Educating Tomorrow's \nWorkforce Act.\n  Here is what the legislation does.\n  It takes the existing Carl D. Perkins career and technical education \nprogram, which is the major source for Federal funding for programs \nthat connect education to real-world careers, and it amends it by doing \na couple of things.\n  First, it ensures that students have access to high-quality CTE \nprograms in their schools so they can prepare to be college and career \nready. Second, it defines what a rigorous program of study for CTE \nstudents is that links secondary and postsecondary education, to \nculminate in a degree or a credit or a credential or a license or an \napprenticeship or a postsecondary certificate.\n  It emphasizes the opportunities for secondary students to earn \ncollege or postsecondary credits while they are in high school. I was \nable to graduate from college in 3 years because of credits I earned in \nhigh school. That was at a time when it was critically important \nfinancially for my family that I was able to get through college in 3 \nyears.\n  This dual enrollment piece of our bill is a piece that Senator \nPortman worked very hard to make sure was included. The legislation \nallows the Perkins funding to be used by States that want to establish \nCTE academies as we did in Virginia and ensures that the academies are \nof a high quality.\n  Finally, the bill promotes the kinds of partnerships we need between \nbusinesses, industries, postsecondary and other community stakeholders. \nPartnerships are important to connect people to the workforce. The \nSouthern Regional Education Board cites that students with highly \nintegrated CTE programs, where the CTE programs and the academic \nprograms are integrated together, that those schools have significantly \nhigher achievement rates in reading, mathematics, and sciences than \nstudents at schools that do not have integrated programs.\n  In closing, and then I defer to my colleague from Ohio, I noticed \nsomething when I was mayor of Richmond and Governor that was a change \nin the kind of economic development world. As mayor, I was often trying \nto get a business to come to Richmond. I was competing against Savannah \nor against the county next door. What I found was in these \ncompetitions, the closing factor was always the incentive package: Mr. \nMayor, how much money can you put on the table? What kind of tax \nincentives can you put on the table?\n  Oh, you either beat the other guy or you don't. But by the time I--5, \n6, 7 years later I was Governor, the last issue now was not the \nincentive package anymore. The deciding issue for companies that were \nchoosing whether to come to Virginia or South Carolina or Singapore was \nnot the tax incentives, it was the workforce.\n  Tell me, Governor, that we will have the kind of people we need when \nwe open the door tomorrow. Give me confidence that we will have the \nkind of people we need 20 years from now. Long after the ribbon has \nbeen cut and the photos have been taken, are we still going to have the \nkinds of people we need to do to the kind of work that has to be done?\n  In today's world, talent is the most precious asset--more than oil, \nmore\n\n[[Page S4408]]\n\nthan water, more than rare Earth minerals. It is talent and human \ncapital that is precious. Recently we did something good in this body, \nDemocrats and Republicans together. We passed the Workforce Innovation \nand Opportunity Act. It was passed in the House yesterday.\n  This looks at the Nation's workforce programs and makes them \nstronger. Now we have to make the policy changes that go into our \neducation programs and match what we did in the WIOA reauthorization to \nprepare our students for a 21st century workforce. I very much hope the \nSenate moves forward on the Carl D. Perkins Act this year. I look \nforward to promoting this bill as part of that reauthorization. I am \nhonored to have Senator Portman, my cochair on the CTE caucus, as the \ncosponsor of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2584\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

I know we have seen some \nimprovement recently in the job numbers, but in fact unemployment \nremains way too high. If we take into account folks who have dropped \nout of the workforce altogether as compared to 4 or 5 years ago, we \nhave unemployment rates at over 10 percent.\n  Among young people coming out of school it is far higher. It is \ndouble digits, about 12 or 13 percent for 18 to 25 year olds, we are \ntold. Again, the real numbers are worse than that when we take out the \nfolks who have dropped out of the workforce altogether.\n  Our GDP growth, the growth of our economy, is too low. So there are a \nnumber of things we ought to do, in my view. One is, we have to deal \nwith ensuring that we have a workforce that is trained for these 21st \ncentury jobs that are out there. We also need to reform our Tax Code. \nWe need to put regulatory relief in place that is sensible. We need to \ndo much more to take advantage of the energy resources we have in this \ncountry. We need to get back in the business of exporting and trade.\n  There are some things relatively quickly we could do to get the \ncountry back on track, but none is more important than having that \nworkforce. Because we can have a great environment--which unfortunately \nwe do not have now for many businesses because we have not created the \nclimate for economic growth with good policy in Washington.\n  But if we had that--if we do not have the workers in this \nincreasingly competitive global economy we are in, jobs will be created \nsomewhere else. That is happening right now. It is happening partly \nbecause we do not have the skilled workers to be able to attract those \njobs here, those businesses here, and to fill the jobs here in America.\n  Four and one-half million jobs are open right now, they say. That \nmight surprise some people listening because they are thinking: Wow. I \ncannot get a job or my son or daughter cannot get a job or my neighbor \ncannot get a job. As I said, unemployment is high. Yet there are 4\\1/2\\ \nmillion jobs open. When we look at those jobs and what is available out \nthere--and Senator Kaine talked some about this, a lot of them require \nskills that young people and workers who are shifting careers, maybe \nthey have lost a job, are in their forties or fifties, skills they do \nnot have.\n  So it is IT, it is high-tech jobs, it is health care jobs, it is \nbioscience jobs. Yes, it is manufacturing jobs. My own State of Ohio is \na big manufacturing State. We are particularly sensitive to this. There \nare lots of manufacturers in Ohio who are saying: If we had the \nworkers, we could add new jobs, new opportunities, grow this economy. \nThe spinoff from that, all of the other jobs that are created through a \nsuccessful manufacturing company that makes something is the backbone \nof our higher economy, international economy.\n  This is exciting for me to work with Senator Kaine and others who \nsay: Let's take a piece of this, which is career and technical \neducation, to encourage young people to get these skills, to be able to \naccess these great jobs. Some of them, by the way, will do it right out \nof high school.\n  I was in Ohio on Monday. We had a roundtable on this. We had a bunch \nof employers there. We had some educators there. We had some students \nthere. One was a senior in high school who is currently in career and \ntechnical school. For those who do not follow this closely, you \nprobably are more familiar with the word ``vocational'' school, because \nthat is typically what it has been called over the years. That is the \nsame thing as the career and technical schools.\n  Again, Senator Kaine and I have cofounded this Career and Technical \nEducation Caucus in the Senate over the last couple of months. We have \na number of our colleagues now joining and so on. We are trying to \nraise this, let people know about this great opportunity out there.\n  This young man is a senior. He is going back to his high school and \nsaying: You Guys are crazy not to do this CTE stuff because I am \ngetting great skills, where I can get a great job, and I am getting \ncollege credit because they have one of those dual credit programs in \nthis particular CTE program.\n  Then there were two students there who graduated earlier this year. \nThey both have been in the CTE program. They both have been taking \nadvantage of it to get the skills but also working part time as \napprentices or interns--19 years old, two young men. Both of them are \nnow out in the workforce, working for these manufacturers. One of their \nbosses was there, one of the executives from one of the small \nmanufacturing companies.\n  These young men at 19 years old are making $50,000 a year. They have \nbenefits on top of that. They have the opportunity now to run very \nsophisticated machines. Both of them started off learning as \napprentices. Now they are both running machines. These machines are \nworth over $1 million apiece. These are in CNC machines. In one case it \nis a plastic injecting molding machine. It is very exciting. By the \nway, they now have been encouraged to go back to their high school and \nsay: Hey, 4-year college or university, that is great if you want to do \nthat, but here is another opportunity.\n  By the way, they may go back to school. They both have some credit \nwhere they could go back and maybe get an associate's degree or a 4-\nyear degree or maybe a graduate engineering degree someday, but in the \nmeantime they are providing the opportunities for these companies in \nOhio to have skilled workers so they can compete globally. For them and \ntheir families, they are providing a tremendous opportunity, rather \nthan graduating with a bunch of debt. The average debt is $20,000, \n$30,000 a year now. Instead of having debt, they are making money.\n  For the next 4 years, even if they are not promoted 0--0 which I \nthink they will be, having met these two young men--that is $200,000 \nthey are going to be making and spending and investing in our economy.\n  I am very excited about this opportunity to hold this up to say there \nis a way for us to help get this economy moving by helping to fill this \nskills gap. In Ohio alone, if you go on ohiomeansjobs.com right now, go \non their Web site, you will see about 140,000 jobs open. Yet we have \nabout 400,000 people out of work. If you look at these jobs, again, you \nwill see a lot of them require skills that simply are not out there in \nthe workforce now.\n  Help provide these skills and we are going to see some of these jobs \nget filled. That helps our economy, keeps businesses here, and expands \nbusinesses here. We did, as Senator Kaine said, just pass the Workforce \nInnovation and Opportunity Act, so-called WIOA. I was very pleased \nabout that. The House just passed it this week. The Senate passed it 2 \nweeks ago.\n  In that there is something called the CAREER Act that Senator Bennet \nand I have been promoting the last few years. We were able to include a \nnumber of our provisions in there to add more accountability, to add \nmore performance measures to improve that legislation. I am happy that \nwas done. That helps on retraining. That is critically important. We \nspend about $15 billion a year on that at the Federal Government level.\n  What we are talking about is starting with the career and technical \neducation even before we get into the WIOA programs and the retraining \nmoney that is necessary when somebody loses a job and needs to move to \nanother job. We are talking about young people coming up and having \nthis opportunity. According to the U.S.\n\n[[Page S4410]]\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics, Ohio is gaining jobs in manufacturing. That \nis great news. But we also hear, in the latest skills gap report by the \nManufacturing Institute, 74 percent of manufacturers are experiencing \nworkforce shortages or skill deficiencies that keep them from expanding \ntheir plant and operations and improving productivity--74 percent.\n  We could be doing much more to close that skills gap. The legislation \nthat Senator Kaine and I talked about that we are introducing today is \na very important step toward that. It is going to help open \nopportunities for the next generation of workers by ensuring that they \nhave these skills to participate in the 21st century economy.\n  We were talking a moment ago, some of us, about high school \ngraduation rates. Unfortunately, we have unacceptably high numbers of \npeople who do not graduate from high schools in this country. So there \nwas a lot of discussion about postsecondary and so on. But we have a \nreal problem: Our high school graduation rate is way too low. According \nto the U.S. Department of Education, 81 percent of high school dropouts \nsay real-world learning opportunities would have kept them in school. \nThat is interesting. The average high school graduation rate is now \nabout 80 percent--way too low. In fact, it is closer to 50 percent in \nsome of our great cities and in some of our poorer rural areas. But \neven 80 percent is the average--way too low for high school graduation.\n  But what they say is they would have been more likely to stay in \nschool if they had real-world learning opportunities. That is why the \ngraduation rates for kids involved in CTE--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I would ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. For kids in CTE concentrations, it is a 90-percent \ngraduation rate. That is because they are getting that real-world \nexperience. So I think a good place to start, again, is with this \nlegislation we are introducing today. This is legislation that begins \nwith reforms to the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act. \nIt needs to be reauthorized. The reauthorization ought to include these \nreforms that Senator Kaine and I have talked about.\n\n  This is the major source of Federal support for the development of \nCTE skills. It was last reauthorized in 2006. So it has to be \nmodernized to meet the demands of this workforce today to ensure that \nstudents have access to these programs.\n  It does a few different things. Senator Kaine has talked about it. It \nrequires a more rigorous CTE curriculum, requiring Perkins grant \nparticipants to incorporate key elements into the programs; that is, \nthings such as academic and technical skill assessments to measure \nstudent achievement, making sure they are actually accomplishing what \nthey are supposed to be based on industry standards, making sure the \nCTE curriculum is in alignment with whatever the local and regional \nneeds are in the workforce, what the demands are. Employers are looking \nfor kids who have specific skills. We have to be sure we are providing \nthem.\n  It also increases flexibility for States and localities, allowing \nthem to use these Perkins grant funds to establish academies such as \nthe one Governor Kaine started when he was in Virginia.\n  It also improves the link between high school and postsecondary \neducation to ease the attainment of industry-recognized credentials, \nlicensing, apprenticeship, postsecondary certificates. We do a lot of \nthat in Ohio, the dual credit programs I talked about earlier.\n  It promotes partnerships between local businesses, regional \nindustries, and other community stakeholders to create pathways for \nstudents through more internships, service opportunities, and so on.\n  I believe this legislation is urgently needed, and we have to move \nforward with it. If we do, we are going to be able to provide more \nopportunity for our young people and more jobs in this country because \nwe will be filling that skills gap and we will be able to have more \nyoung people who will able to have this experience, such as these two \nyoung men I met earlier this week, where they are able to go out on \ntheir own, get a good job, good benefits, help themselves and their \nfamily, and help create a stronger economy for all of us.\n  I thank my colleague from Virginia for his hard work on this \nlegislation, and I look forward to working with him toward its passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. \n        Brown, and Mr. Franken):\n  S. 2589.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Business bankruptcies have increased sharply in recent \n     years and remain at high levels. These bankruptcies include \n     several of the largest business bankruptcy filings in \n     history. As the use of bankruptcy has expanded, job \n     preservation and retirement security are placed at greater \n     risk.\n       (2) Laws enacted to improve recoveries for employees and \n     retirees and limit their losses in bankruptcy cases have not \n     kept pace with the increasing and broader use of bankruptcy \n     by businesses in all sectors of the economy. However, while \n     protections for employees and retirees in bankruptcy cases \n     have eroded, management compensation plans devised for those \n     in charge of troubled businesses have become more prevalent \n     and are escaping adequate scrutiny.\n       (3) Changes in the law regarding these matters are urgently \n     needed as bankruptcy is used to address increasingly more \n     complex and diverse conditions affecting troubled businesses \n     and industries.\n\n        TITLE I--IMPROVING RECOVERIES FOR EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES\n\n     SEC. 101. INCREASED WAGE PRIORITY.\n\n       Section 507(a) of title 11, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (4)--\n       (A) by striking ``$10,000'' and inserting ``$20,000'';\n       (B) by striking ``within 180 days''; and\n       (C) by striking ``or the date of the cessation of the \n     debtor's business, whichever occurs first,'';\n       (2) in paragraph (5)(A), by striking--\n       (A) ``within 180 days''; and\n       (B) ``or the date of the cessation of the debtor's \n     business, whichever occurs first''; and\n       (3) in paragraph (5), by striking subparagraph (B) and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(B) for each such plan, to the extent of the number of \n     employees covered by each such plan, multiplied by \n     $20,000.''.\n\n     SEC. 102. CLAIM FOR STOCK VALUE LOSSES IN DEFINED \n                   CONTRIBUTION PLANS.\n\n       Section 101(5) of title 11, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``or'' at the end;\n\n[[Page S4411]]\n\n       (2) in subparagraph (B), by striking the period at the end \n     and inserting ``; or''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(C) right or interest in equity securities of the debtor, \n     or an affiliate of the debtor, held in a defined contribution \n     plan (within the meaning of section 3(34) of the Employee \n     Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1002(34))) \n     for the benefit of an individual who is not an insider, a \n     senior executive officer, or any of the 20 next most highly \n     compensated employees of the debtor (if 1 or more are not \n     insiders), if such securities were attributable to either \n     employer contributions by the debtor or an affiliate of the \n     debtor, or elective deferrals (within the meaning of section \n     402(g) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986), and any \n     earnings thereon, if an employer or plan sponsor who has \n     commenced a case under this title has committed fraud with \n     respect to such plan or has otherwise breached a duty to the \n     participant that has proximately caused the loss of value.''.\n\n     SEC. 103. PRIORITY FOR SEVERANCE PAY.\n\n       Section 503(b) of title 11, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (8), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (2) in paragraph (9), by striking the period and inserting \n     a semicolon; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(10) severance pay owed to employees of the debtor (other \n     than to an insider, other senior management, or a consultant \n     retained to provide services to the debtor), under a plan, \n     program, or policy generally applicable to employees of the \n     debtor (but not under an individual contract of employment), \n     or owed pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, for \n     layoff or termination on or after the date of the filing of \n     the petition, which pay shall be deemed earned in full upon \n     such layoff or termination of employment; and''.\n\n     SEC. 104.

PRIORITY FOR WARN ACT DAMAGES.\n\n       Section 503(b)(1)(A)(ii) of title 11, United States Code is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(ii) wages and benefits awarded pursuant to a judicial \n     proceeding or a proceeding of the National Labor Relations \n     Board as back pay or damages attributable to any period of \n     time occurring after the date of commencement of the case \n     under this title, as a result of a violation of Federal or \n     State law by the debtor, without regard to the time of the \n     occurrence of unlawful conduct on which the award is based or \n     to whether any services were rendered on or after the \n     commencement of the case, including an award by a court under \n     section 2901 of title 29, United States Code, of up to 60 \n     days' pay and benefits following a layoff that occurred or \n     commenced at a time when such award period includes a period \n     on or after the commencement of the case, if the court \n     determines that payment of wages and benefits by reason of \n     the operation of this clause will not substantially increase \n     the probability of layoff or termination of current employees \n     or of nonpayment of domestic support obligations during the \n     case under this title;''.\n\n           TITLE II--REDUCING EMPLOYEES' AND RETIREES' LOSSES\n\n     SEC. 201. REJECTION OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS.\n\n       Section 1113 of title 11, United States Code, is amended by \n     striking subsections (a) through (f) and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(a) The debtor in possession, or the trustee if one has \n     been appointed under this chapter, other than a trustee in a \n     case covered by subchapter IV of this chapter and by title I \n     of the Railway Labor Act, may reject a collective bargaining \n     agreement only in accordance with this section.

A bill to promote energy production and security, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. We are here today to talk about energy--energy for our \ncountry but also energy for our allies. This is a discussion not just \nabout energy, it is about jobs, good-paying jobs. It is also about \neconomic growth. It is about generating tax revenues to help reduce the \ndebt and the deficit without raising taxes. It is about national \nsecurity--not only our national security but also working with our \nclosest friend and ally, Canada, as well as our allies in Europe, the \nEuropean Union, and working to help countries such as the Ukraine that \nvery much need energy supply from sources other than Russia.\n  With the current events going on in the Ukraine, it is very clear \nthat we need to play a long-term game, a long-term strategy--deploy a \nlong-term strategy when it comes to helping our allies, not only in \nterms of our national security but working with our allies to make them \nstronger, their strength, their national security. The national \nsecurity of allies also contributes to our strength and our security \nhere at home. So that is what we are here to talk about. We are here to \ntalk about the North Atlantic Energy Security Act, legislation we are \nintroducing today--myself, Senator Barrasso, Senator McCain, and \nSenator Murkowski.\n  I am going to take a few minutes to talk about energy production, \ntransportation, and export in terms of building our energy future in \nthis country and working with our allies. Senator Barrasso is here, and \nhe will be talking about the specific legislation. Senator McCain will \njoin us as well to talk about the national security issues and \nimplications.\n  I will start with the first chart.\n  Very simply, what we want to do is continue to produce more energy in \nour Nation, in the heartland of our Nation and throughout our country. \nWe want to transport that increased production to market. That includes \nnot only markets domestically but also markets where we can export it \nto our friends and allies in the European Union, to the Ukraine, and to \nJapan. That is the simple equation we are working on. Again, it is \nabout energy. It is about jobs. It is about a growing economy. It is \nvery much about national security.\n  That gas is produced throughout our country, more and more all the \ntime. Right now we produce 30 trillion cubic feet of natural gas a \nyear. We only use 26 trillion cubic feet of natural gas a year, so we \nare already producing more than we consume, and that number is growing.\n  What happens when you produce more than you consume and you do not \nhave a market for that gas? In places such as North Dakota, we are \nflaring off that gas. Right now, just in my State alone, we flare $1.5 \nmillion a day of natural gas--$1.5 million a day. That is natural gas \nthat we need to capture, that we need to get in gathering systems, that \nwe need to transport to markets, and we need markets for that gas. This \nis just common sense.\n  How do we move gas from North Dakota to places such as Ukraine, where \nthere is much need for a market? Well, we need both interstate and \nintrastate pipeline systems. On this chart, you can see that the purple \nis the interstate. That is how we move gas across State lines. But we \nalso need intrastate gathering systems. A lot of oil wells produce \nnatural gas as a byproduct; other wells are just gas wells. But you \nneed gathering systems, the blue systems that go to all those wells so \nthat gas can be gathered, put in the interstate system, and moved to \nmarkets--markets throughout the United States and markets overseas.\n  As I said a minute ago, we produce 30 trillion cubic feet a year, \nStates such as North Dakota, Wyoming, and many others. That number is \ngrowing. We produce 30 trillion cubic feet a year, but we only consume \n26 trillion, so we are flaring off that gas.\n  We need markets. As we work to build those gathering systems and \nthose interstate pipelines, how do we get markets? Well, we move that \nproduct to overseas as liquefied natural gas, LNG. It is cooled and \ncondensed, put on ships, and moved to other markets--the European \nUnion, Ukraine, Japan--by ship. But we need the LNG facilities to do \nit. We do not have them. So that is a problem, right? Well, it is, \nexcept we have many companies that are not only ready and willing but \nanxious to build the facilities. Here are 16 right here, 16 \napplications.\n\n  Of the 26 applications that are pending, many of them have been \npending for over a year waiting to get approval from the Department of \nEnergy and from the FERC. So here we are flaring off natural gas, as I \nshowed a minute ago--$1.5 million a day in my State--flaring it off \nbecause we produce more than we consume. We need markets. These \napplications are just sitting there and have been for more than a year.\n  If they get approved, what happens? Let's take an example. Here is \none by a company everybody has heard of--Exxon. Exxon has an \napplication. As you can see here, they have had an application in for \nover a year waiting to get approved at Sabine Pass, TX, which is right \ndown in that gulf area. They are ready, willing, and able to spend $10 \nbillion right now, today, to build that facility.\n  Where are they going to move the gas? They are going to move it to \nthe United Kingdom so it can go right into the European system. We will \ntouch on that European system and how it gets to places such as the \nUkraine in a minute. But if they can get approval--\n\n[[Page S4415]]\n\nI have already talked to their CEO, Mr. Rex Tillerson. He indicates \nthat within 36 to 40 months of approval, they can be moving gas into \nthe European markets. Does that sound realistic? It certainly does. \nObviously that is a very large company with the capabilities to do what \nthey say they are willing and want to do.\n  Here is another example. Here is Cheniere. Same place--Sabine Pass. \nThis is one that did get approved. This is one that did get approval. \nThey intend to be delivering gas into the European market by the middle \nof next year--middle of next year. So this is not something that is \ngoing to take forever to happen.\n  We not only have the fact that we can start moving natural gas over \nhere in a very reasonable amount of time, but think of the impact on \nthe markets in Europe and the impact on Russia and gas prices when they \nknow it is coming.\n  I am going to ask Senator McCain to step in here. I mentioned a \nminute ago that application I showed you that is pending from Exxon. \nThey want to move that natural gas to market right here in the UK.\n  What this chart shows is the pipeline network throughout Europe that \nwill enable them to move that product throughout Europe and even into \nEastern Europe, including places such as Ukraine.\n  Right now where is all that gas coming from? Russia, Gazprom. All \nthese pipelines are coming down from Russia and providing that gas to \nthe European countries, to the European Union, and to the Ukraine. Of \ncourse, that makes them dependent on Russia and that enables Russia to \nengage in the kind of activity we have seen and we can't always be \nreacting short term. We need a long-term strategy to break that hold.\n  Here are some of the numbers. This shows not only Ukraine but look at \nthe impact on other NATO countries, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, 100 \npercent of their gas coming from Russia. Think of the leverage that \ngives Russia in this situation.\n  The last chart is the North Atlantic Energy Security Act. Quite \nsimply, we are going to cut the redtape that is holding up production \nand infrastructure, we are going to reduce flaring, and we are going to \nexpedite LNG to our friends and allies, to countries such as the \nEuropean Union, to Ukraine, to Japan. We reduce the redtape that is \nholding up production. We are producing 30 trillion cubic feet of \nnatural gas, and we can produce a lot more, but we have to cut through \nthe redtape. We also enhance and expand our ability to build the \ngathering systems that move that natural gas to market, and we allow \nexport.\n  We have an expedited process so we can export that gas to the markets \nwe need, to our friends, and to our allies. Again, this is about \nenergy, but it is about creating jobs, it is about growing our economy, \nit is about the national security of our country and our allies, and it \nis about having a long-term strategy that works, not going from crisis \nto crisis.\n  With that, I turn to my colleague, the senior Senator from Arizona, \nto comment on some of the national security implications.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent the colloquy between the three of \nus be allowed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my two colleagues from North Dakota and Wyoming. \nThere are no two Members of the Senate who know more and have worked \nharder on this energy issue. There are no two Senators who have worked \nharder to try to bring to the American people the fact that if we could \nexport energy to these countries, it could literally change the world. \nThis is not only when it actually arrives, but when Vladimir Putin gets \nthe message, within 3 years--as I understand the Senator from North \nDakota's context--we could be sending energy to the living rooms.\n  If you would put the numbers back up with the countries and their \ndependence on Russian energy.\n  Within 3 years the people within Latvia, Estonia, members of NATO, \nwould no longer be reliant--and it gets very cold up in those Baltic \ncountries as well. It can have a significant effect on the entire \nworld.\n  I would also point out if that energy--and I would ask my colleagues \nfrom Wyoming or North Dakota--could get to the living room of Kiev--\nwhich the Senator showed the different pipelines that cross Ukraine--\nthat has a huge effect.\n  I would ask my friend from Wyoming to comment.\n  We have threatened Russians time after time after they absorbed \nCrimea in violation of an agreement they made in Budapest to respect \nthe territorial integrity of Ukraine. They absorbed Crimea. They \ncontinue to provoke unrest in Eastern Ukraine.\n  They have been threatened time after time by the United States and \nEurope, and I would argue that the handful of sanctions on individuals \nhas had very little effect whatsoever on Russian behavior.\n  I ask the Senator from Wyoming as well, this is not only about the \nfact that the United States of America would be an energy exporter--\nwhich is a huge effect on our economy--but this could have a huge \neffect on the entire European Continent, because if Vladimir Putin \nunderstands that this energy is coming from a friend of the ally of the \nUnited States America, as opposed to them being dependent on Russian \noil and energy, I would argue that it could change the entire shape of \nthe world as we know it.\n  I thank both of the Senators who have been involved in this issue for \nmany years. I don't know how many times both Senators have come to the \nfloor--and I might just say I don't claim to be an expert on energy as \nmy two colleagues are--but I will say the presentation the Senator from \nNorth Dakota just made should be understandable and I believe is \nunderstandable to every American citizen how we can, within 3 years as \nI understand it, achieve a level of energy independence and that for \nEurope that could literally change the entire equation in Europe and in \nthe United States.\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. My friend and colleague from Arizona is absolutely \nright. The three of us have traveled together to Ukraine. We have \ntraveled together to Latvia and Lithuania.\n  What we hear everywhere we go is: Please sell us natural gas. Please \nsell us energy. Please help us undermine what Putin is doing to us.\n  Energy should be used as a geopolitical weapon, and it is the \nadvances in technology in just the last decade that have made all of \nthis possible. The Senators from Arizona and North Dakota are both \ncorrect. We are producing more now than ever. They are well aware of \nthat throughout Europe and throughout the Baltics--to the point that \nLithuania is even in the middle of acquiring an at-sea platform to \nchange liquefied natural gas into natural gas--to warm it up, if you \nwill, for use--and it is called the Independence. That is the name of \nthis platform. It is to give them independence from Russia.\n  That is what they are investing in, and now they are saying to us: \nPlease send it our way.\n  The technology has changed so much that in 2005 a book came out \ncalled ``Beyond Oil,'' and it was sent to every University of Wyoming \nfirst-year student coming in. They were invited to read it, and there \nwas a whole section on liquefied natural gas.\n  At the time the technology wasn't developed enough for us to be so \nblessed in the United States to produce it, so that they were talking \nabout actually building terminals in Louisiana, Texas, to import \nliquefied natural gas from other places.\n  Now we have reversed it. We are now in a position where we have such \nan abundance of liquefied natural gas, as my colleague from North \nDakota said, we are flaring it off, burning it to the point of $1.5 \nmillion a day. That is the value of that gas, and there is also tax \nrevenue that is not being collected because this isn't being sold, so \nour States could use the revenue. The Federal Government would benefit \nfrom us selling this rather than burning it, but yet we don't have the \nopportunity to do so because of the specifics of the laws with which we \nare faced.\n  We need to change the law. We need to be able to export. We need to \nbe able to have permits to export, and we are seeing a lot of foot-\ndragging by this administration, which is why there are bills on this \nfloor, bipartisan pieces of legislation, to help us use our energy \nabundance as a geopolitical weapon to\n\n[[Page S4416]]\n\nundermine Vladimir Putin's ability to use energy as a weapon of his \nown, a club against, as we have said, Ukraine, Moldova, Latvia, \nLithuania, Estonia--all of these areas that are so dependent upon \nRussia for their gas, when they would rather buy it from us.\n  It would be an opportunity for us in America to become a net exporter \nin a way that would help balance our trade and balance our payments. It \nwould bring cash back into the United States and we would be so much \nless dependent on the Middle East for sources of energy. We should be \nrelying on that at home.\n  I look to my colleague from Arizona and say he is absolutely right in \nhis leadership, in his direction, and in his global view that he has \nseen in his incredible service to our country. He has seen the shift. \nHe has seen the future, and he knows the future success for our country \ncomes in exporting liquefied natural gas to Europe, to our NATO allies, \nto Ukraine.\n  That is why we bring to the floor today the North Atlantic Energy \nSecurity Act, which we believe will help our country, help globally, \nand help us not just economically but help us geopolitically as well.\n  I turn to my friends from either Arizona or North Dakota to continue \nin this discussion, and then I will get back to some specific things \nthat are happening around the world.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to both of my colleagues, the Senator from North \nDakota, Americans understand, I believe, that we need to do what we can \nto help our European friends become independent of Vladimir Putin as a \nsource of energy.\n  They also are beginning to understand the United States of America is \ngoing to be an exporter of energy, which will obviously change our \ndependence on Middle Eastern energy and on other forms of energy, but \nthe way the Senator from North Dakota described this, I think every \nAmerican, if they saw it, would ask: Why don't we move in that \ndirection? Why don't we believe the major energy companies that say \nwithin 3 years--and beginning, I understand, next year with some of \nthem--we could be supplying these countries with energy which would \nthen give them not only the ability to have energy without dependency, \nbut it also sends a huge message to Vladimir Putin and to Europe that \nthey are no longer dependent on his largesse. There have been times in \nthe past where Vladimir Putin has shut off the energy in the \nwintertime, and it gets very cold in some of these countries in the \nwintertime.\n  It might also send a message to Vladimir Putin himself that he is not \ngoing to get away with the kind of behavior that he has.\n  I would ask the Senator from North Dakota, what does it require--\nsuppose I am just an average citizen--to capture that natural gas that \nis being burned for $1 million-plus a day? What does it require to \ncapture that and then get it to that port where it is going to be \nexported?\n\n  I would finally say I intend to go every place I can in America in \nthe next few months and give the same presentation the Senator from \nNorth Dakota did and help the American people understand that we don't \nhave to do a lot.\n  The energy is there. The question is, Do we have the national will \nand legislative will to take the action necessary to get that energy to \nthe people who need it so badly, who are literally under the threat of \nfreezing cold this coming winter?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I thank the Senator from Arizona for his comments, his \nleadership, and for his willingness to work on this vitally important \nissue.\n  In terms of responding to his question: OK. What needs to happen--I \nwish to take a minute to give an overview of the legislation and then \nask the Senator from Wyoming to comment in more detail.\n  As I said at the outset, and I actually have said several times, this \nis about more energy, it is about job creation, it is about growing the \neconomy, and it is about national security.\n  It is also very much about environmental benefits. I showed you gas \nbeing flared off a well. This gas is just being flared.\n  Not only is that wasting a natural resource which we can capture and \nget value for, but when we capture that, we also create environmental \nbenefits.\n  Nationally, we flare or vent, burn off, 212 billion cubic feet of gas \na year--212 billion cubic feet of gas a year now being burned off.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Which is roughly how much money?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Oh, boy. To convert it, it is billions, right, it is in \nthe billions of dollars. I don't have the exact number, but it is a \nhuge amount. It is $1.5 million a day in my State alone so the Senator \ncan see we are talking billions of dollars. There are also tremendous \nenvironmental benefits as well.\n  But let's go to the legislation for a minute because I think this is \nresponsive to the question asked by the Senator from Arizona about: OK. \nHow do we make it happen?\n  The reality is we are producing the energy now, we can produce more, \nand this doesn't cost taxpayer money.\n  This creates revenues without raising taxes. This is going to create \nrevenues to help address the debt and the deficit. This is enabling and \nempowering the private companies to make investments to create jobs, \nmake investments to produce the energy.\n  Going back to this chart, Exxon wants to invest $10 billion today, \ncreating thousands of jobs and a tremendous amount of revenue for the \nFederal Government to reduce the deficit and debt. It doesn't cost a \npenny. That is not what it is about. It is about streamlining the \nregulation, cutting the redtape. That means making sure we streamline \nand expedite the process to get wells approved. That is the first area \nof legislation that increases our production onshore. We can do it \noffshore as well. But we are talking about more production. As I say, \nwe are already producing more than we consume.\n  Second, it is about building those gathering systems. It requires \npermits and approvals to build gathering systems, so we are not able to \nbuild those gathering systems. If you can't build a gathering system, \nwhat happens? You burn off the gas because you can't get it to market. \nSo that process is being held up. Again, it is about cutting through \nthe redtape, reducing the regulation and bureaucracy. It doesn't cost \nanything.\n  The final piece, the same thing--getting approval to export LNG. \nRight now there is one that has final approval from the DOE and FERC. \nThere are 26 applications pending. One has final approval from the \nDOE--Department of Energy--and the FERC. Six have conditional approval \nand 26 are pending. It is as simple as getting the approvals and \ncutting through that redtape. This is not about spending taxpayer \ndollars; it is about generating revenues.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If I could ask the Senator from North Dakota one \nadditional question, and maybe the Senator from Wyoming would comment \non it too. What about the environmental aspects of using natural gas as \nopposed to other forms of energy, whether it be coal or oil or other \nforms of energy?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I would respond briefly to the Senator from Arizona and \nthen turn to the Senator from Wyoming on that issue as well for more \ndetail on the legislation. He has tremendous expertise in this area and \nhas been working on it for a long time.\n  Clearly, it is a double win because not only are we no longer burning \noff or flaring that natural gas, but we are using natural gas, which is \na very clean resource, for a whole range of energy uses, whether it is \npowering homes or many other uses. So it is a huge environmental win.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So I would think the EPA would be out there in front \narguing for this legislation.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Absolutely an environmental win.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. It is interesting. The Senator from South Dakota, the \nSenator from Arizona, and I were reviewing this article in today's Wall \nStreet Journal, Thursday, July 10.\n  The headline is ``In the Arctic, Shipping Route Is Set to Supply LNG \nto Asia,'' and there is a map of the globe. It says:\n\n       Shipping companies in China and Japan said they would start \n     a regular service to carry Siberian natural gas across the \n     Arctic Ocean to East Asia, showing how Asian demand for the \n     fuel is reshaping global shipping routes.\n\n  So with the forces at play--Asia's demand for natural gas, Japan's \nmove\n\n[[Page S4417]]\n\naway from nuclear power, China's struggle with pollution--this is an \nopportunity for us to use a resource we have in the United States and \nexport it in a very profitable way for our country, put people to work, \nincrease tax revenues to the States, increase tax revenues to the \nNation, and improve our balance of trade. The technology is now \nallowing us to do it, but the government is not. That is the biggest \nproblem we have--a bureaucratic Federal Government that is not allowing \nwhat we have and what we have learned to use. The government is \nblocking it, and that is why we have come to the floor today to try to \nencourage additional exports to Europe and support the North Atlantic \nEnergy Security Act.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I turn to the good Senator from Arizona \nfor any final comments. Seeing that he doesn't have any, I thank him.\n  I also thank the good Senator from Wyoming and ask if there are any \nfinal comments he might have on the legislation. He has been an author \nof much of this legislation. I thank him for that tremendous work and \nfor being part of this effort.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. The legislation is bipartisan. We have Republicans and \nDemocrats alike who realize there are incredible values to us as a \nnation to be exporting liquefied natural gas.\n  At a time when the technology is there, the will is there, we need to \nget a vote on the Senate floor.

Supp. 41 (D.D.C. \n     1987)), the Court determined that Secretary Aldridge had \n     failed to ``articulate clear and intelligible criteria for \n     the administration'' of the application approval process.\n       (10) During World War II, women were repeatedly denied \n     issuance of official documentation affirming their merchant \n     marine seamen status by the War Shipping Administration.\n\n[[Page S4427]]\n\n       (11) Coast Guard Information Sheet #77 (April 1992) \n     identifies the following acceptable forms of documentation \n     for eligibility meeting the requirements set forth in GI Bill \n     Improvement Act of 1977 (Public Law 95-202) and Veterans \n     Programs Enhancement Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-368):\n       (A) Certificate of shipping and discharge forms.\n       (B) Continuous discharge books (ship's deck or engine \n     logbooks).\n       (C) Company letters showing vessel names and dates of \n     voyages.\n       (12) Coast Guard Commandant Order of 20 March, 1944, \n     relieved masters of tugs, towboats, and seagoing barges of \n     the responsibility of submitting reports of seamen shipped or \n     discharged on forms, meaning certificates of shipping and \n     discharge forms are not available to all eligible individuals \n     seeking to document their eligibility.\n       (13) Coast Guard Information Sheet #77 (April 1992) states \n     that ``deck logs were traditionally considered to be the \n     property of the owners of the ships. After World War II, \n     however, the deck and engine logbooks of vessels operated by \n     the War Shipping Administration were turned over to that \n     agency by the ship owners, and were destroyed during the \n     1970s'', meaning that continuous discharge books are not \n     available to all eligible individuals seeking to document \n     their eligibility.\n       (14) Coast Guard Information Sheet #77 (April 1992) states \n     ``some World War II period log books do not name ports \n     visited during the voyage due to wartime security \n     restrictions'', meaning that company letters showing vessel \n     names and dates of voyages are not available to all eligible \n     individuals seeking to document their eligibility.\n       (b) In General.--For the purposes of verifying that an \n     individual performed service under honorable conditions that \n     satisfies the requirements of a coastwise merchant seaman who \n     is recognized pursuant to section 401 of the GI Bill \n     Improvement Act of 1977 (Public Law 95-202;

actions by any state to prevent \n     any other state from exercising its sovereign rights to the \n     resources of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and \n     continental shelf by making claims to those areas that have \n     no support in international law; declarations of \n     administrative and military districts in contested areas in \n     the South China Sea; and the imposition of new fishing \n     regulations covering disputed areas, which have raised \n     tensions in the region;\n       Whereas international law is important to safeguard the \n     rights and freedoms of all states in the Asia-Pacific region, \n     and the lack of clarity in accordance with international law \n     by claimants with regard to their South China Sea claims can \n     create uncertainty, insecurity, and instability;\n       Whereas the United States Government opposes the use of \n     intimidation, coercion, or force to assert a territorial \n     claim in the South China Sea;\n       Whereas claims in the South China Sea must accord with \n     international law, and those that are not derived from land \n     features are fundamentally flawed;\n       Whereas ASEAN issued Six-Point Principles on the South \n     China Sea on July 20, 2012, whereby ASEAN's Foreign Ministers \n     reiterated and reaffirmed ``the commitment of ASEAN Member \n     States to: . . . 1. the full implementation of the \n     Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea \n     (2002);

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to Calendar No. 447.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1104) to measure the progress of recovery and \n     development efforts in Haiti following the earthquake of \n     January 12, 2010, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill, \nwhich had been reported from the Committee on Foreign Relations with an \namendment to strike all after the enacting clause and insert in lieu \nthereof the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Assessing Progress in Haiti \n     Act of 2014''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On January 12, 2010, a massive earthquake struck near \n     the Haitian capital city of Port-au-Prince, leaving an \n     estimated 220,000 people dead, including 103 United States \n     citizens, 101 United Nations personnel, and nearly 18 percent \n     of the nation's civil service, as well as 300,000 injured, \n     115,000 homes destroyed, and 1,500,000 people displaced.\n       (2) According to the Post Disaster Needs Assessment \n     conducted by the Government of Haiti, with technical \n     assistance from the United Nations, the World Bank, the \n     Inter-American Development Bank, the Economic Commission for \n     Latin America and the Caribbean, and the European Commission, \n     an estimated 15 percent of the population was directly \n     affected by the disaster and related damages and economic \n     losses totaled $7,804,000,000.\n       (3) Even before the earthquake, Haiti had some of the \n     lowest socioeconomic indicators and the second highest rate \n     of income disparity in the world, conditions that have \n     further complicated post-earthquake recovery efforts and, \n     according to the World Bank, have significantly reduced the \n     prospects of addressing poverty reduction through economic \n     growth.\n       (4) According to the World Food Programme, more than \n     6,700,000 people in Haiti (out of a population of about \n     10,000,000) are considered food insecure.\n       (5) In October 2010, an unprecedented outbreak of cholera \n     in Haiti resulted in over 500,000 reported cases and over \n     8,000 deaths to date, further straining the capacity of \n     Haiti's public health sector and increasing the urgency of \n     resettlement and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) \n     efforts.\n       (6) The international community, led by the United States \n     and the United Nations, mounted an unprecedented humanitarian \n     response in Haiti, with donors pledging approximately \n     $10,400,000,000 for humanitarian relief and recovery efforts, \n     including debt relief, supplemented by $3,100,000,000 in \n     private charitable contributions, of which approximately \n     $6,400,000,000 has been disbursed and an additional \n     $3,800,000,000 has been committed as of September 30, 2013.\n       (7) The emergency response of the men and women of the \n     United States Government, led by the United States Agency for \n     International Development (USAID) and the United States \n     Southern Command, as well as of cities, towns, individuals, \n     businesses, and philanthropic organizations across the United \n     States, was particularly swift and resolute.\n       (8) Since 2010, a total of $1,300,000,000 in United States \n     assistance has been allocated for humanitarian relief and \n     $2,300,000,000 has been allocated for recovery, \n     reconstruction, and development assistance in Haiti, \n     including $1,140,000,000 in emergency appropriations and \n     $95,000,000 that has been obligated specifically to respond \n     to the cholera epidemic.\n       (9) Of the $3,600,000,000 in United States assistance \n     allocated for Haiti, $651,000,000 was apportioned to USAID to \n     support an ambitious recovery plan, including the \n     construction of a power plant to provide electricity for the \n     new Caracol Industrial Park (CIP) in northern Haiti, a new \n     port near the CIP, and permanent housing in new settlements \n     in the Port-au-Prince, St-Marc, and Cap-Haitien areas.\n       (10) According to a recent report of the Government \n     Accountability Office, as of June 30, 2013, USAID had \n     disbursed 31 percent of its reconstruction funds in Haiti, \n     the port project was 2 years behind schedule and USAID \n     funding will be insufficient to cover a majority of the \n     projected costs, the housing project has been reduced by 80 \n     percent, and the sustainability of the power plant, the port, \n     and the housing projects were all at risk.\n       (11) GAO further found that Congress has not been provided \n     with sufficient information to ensure that it is able to \n     conduct effective oversight at a time when most funding \n     remains to be disbursed, and specifically recommends that a \n     periodic reporting mechanism be instituted to fill this \n     information gap.\n       (12) Donors have encountered significant challenges in \n     implementing recovery programs, and nearly 4 years after the \n     earthquake, an estimated 171,974 people remain displaced in \n     camps, unemployment remains high, corruption is rampant, land \n     rights remain elusive, allegations of wage violations are \n     widespread, the business climate is unfavorable, and \n     government capacity remains weak.\n       (13) For Haiti to achieve stability and long term economic \n     growth, donor assistance will have to be carefully \n     coordinated with a commitment by the Government of Haiti to \n     transparency, a market economy, rule of law, and democracy.\n       (14) The legal environment in Haiti remains a challenge to \n     achieving the goals supported by the international community.\n\n     SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to support the \n     sustainable rebuilding and development of Haiti in a manner \n     that--\n       (1) promotes efforts that are led by and support the people \n     and Government of Haiti at all levels so that Haitians lead \n     the course of reconstruction and development of Haiti;\n       (2) builds the long term capacity of the Government of \n     Haiti and civil society in Haiti;\n       (3) reflects the priorities and particular needs of both \n     women and men so they may participate equally and to their \n     maximum capacity;\n       (4) respects and helps restore Haiti's natural resources, \n     as well as builds community-level resilience to environmental \n     and weather-related impacts;\n       (5) provides timely and comprehensive reporting on goals \n     and progress, as well as transparent post program evaluations \n     and contracting data;\n       (6) prioritizes the local procurement of goods and services \n     in Haiti where appropriate; and\n       (7) promotes the holding of free, fair, and timely \n     elections in accordance with democratic principles and the \n     Haitian Constitution.\n\n     SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that transparency, \n     accountability, democracy, and good governance are integral \n     factors in any congressional decision regarding United States \n     assistance, including assistance to Haiti.\n\n     SEC. 5.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto immediate consideration of Calendar No. 380, S. Res. 412.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 412) reaffirming the strong support \n     of the United States Government for freedom of navigation and \n     other internationally lawful uses of sea and airspace in the \n     Asia-Pacific region, and for the peaceful diplomatic \n     resolution of outstanding territorial and maritime claims and \n     disputes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution, which had been reported from the Committee on Foreign \nRelations, with amendments and an amendment to the preamble.\n  (The part of the resolution intended to be stricken is shown in \nboldface brackets and the part of the resolution intended to be \ninserted is shown in italic.)\n  (The part of the preamble to be inserted is shown in italic.)\n\n                              S. Res. 412\n\n       Whereas Asia-Pacific's maritime domains, which include both \n     the sea and airspace above the domains, are critical to the \n     region's prosperity, stability, and security, including \n     global commerce;\n       Whereas the United States is a longstanding Asia-Pacific \n     power and has a national interest in maintaining freedom of \n     operations in international waters and airspace both in the \n     Asia-Pacific region and around the world;\n       Whereas, for over 60 years, the United States Government, \n     alongside United States allies and partners, has played an \n     instrumental role in maintaining stability in the Asia-\n     Pacific, including safeguarding the prosperity and economic \n     growth and development of the Asia-Pacific region;\n       Whereas the United States, from the earliest days of the \n     Republic, has had a deep and abiding national security \n     interest in freedom of navigation, freedom of the seas, \n     respect for international law, and unimpeded lawful commerce, \n     including in the East China and South China Seas;\n       Whereas the United States alliance relationships in the \n     region, including with Japan, Korea, Australia, the \n     Philippines, and Thailand, are at the heart of United States \n     policy and engagement in the Asia-Pacific region, and share a \n     common approach to supporting the maintenance of peace and \n     stability, freedom of navigation, and other\n\n[[Page S4437]]\n\n     internationally lawful uses of sea and airspace in the Asia-\n     Pacific region;\n       Whereas territorial and maritime claims must be derived \n     from land features and otherwise comport with international \n     law;\n       Whereas the United States Government has a clear interest \n     in encouraging and supporting the nations of the region to \n     work collaboratively and diplomatically to resolve disputes \n     and is firmly opposed to coercion, intimidation, threats, or \n     the use of force;\n       Whereas the South China Sea contains great natural \n     resources, and their stewardship and responsible use offers \n     immense potential benefit for generations to come;\n       Whereas the United States is not a claimant party in either \n     the East China or South China Seas, but does have an interest \n     in the peaceful diplomatic resolution of disputed claims in \n     accordance with international law, in freedom of operations, \n     and in the free-flow of commerce free of coercion, \n     intimidation, or the use of force;\n       Whereas the United States supports the obligation of all \n     members of the United Nations to seek to resolve disputes by \n     peaceful means;\n       Whereas freedom of navigation and other lawful uses of sea \n     and airspace in the Asia-Pacific region are embodied in \n     international law, not granted by certain states to others;\n       Whereas, on November 23, 2013, the People's Republic of \n     China unilaterally and without prior consultations with the \n     United States, Japan, the Republic of Korea or other nations \n     of the Asia-Pacific region, declared an Air Defense \n     Identification Zone (ADIZ) in the East China Sea, also \n     announcing that all aircraft entering the PRC's self-declared \n     ADIZ, even if they do not intend to enter Chinese territorial \n     airspace, would have to submit flight plans, maintain radio \n     contact, and follow directions from the Chinese Ministry of \n     National Defense or face ``emergency defensive measures'';\n       Whereas the ``rules of engagement'' declared by China, \n     including the ``emergency defensive measures'', are in \n     violation of the concept of ``due regard for the safety of \n     civil aviation'' under the Chicago Convention of the \n     International Civil Aviation Organization's Chicago \n     Convention and thereby are a departure from accepted \n     practice;\n       Whereas the Chicago Convention of the International Civil \n     Aviation Organization distinguishes between civilian aircraft \n     and state aircraft and provides for the specific obligations \n     of state parties, consistent with customary law, to ``refrain \n     from resorting to the use of weapons against civil aircraft \n     in flight and . . . in case of interception, the lives of \n     persons on board and the safety of aircraft must not be \n     endangered'';\n       Whereas international civil aviation is regulated by \n     international agreements, including standards and regulations \n     set by ICAO for aviation safety, security, efficiency and \n     regularity, as well as for aviation environmental protection;\n       Whereas, in accordance with the norm of airborne innocent \n     passage, the United States does not recognize the right of a \n     coastal nation to apply its ADIZ procedures to foreign state \n     aircraft not intending to enter national airspace nor does \n     the United States apply its ADIZ procedures to foreign state \n     aircraft not intending to enter United States airspace;\n       Whereas the United States Government expressed profound \n     concerns with China's unilateral, provocative, dangerous, and \n     destabilizing declaration of such a zone, including the \n     potential for misunderstandings and miscalculations by \n     aircraft operating lawfully in international airspace;\n       Whereas the People's Republic of China's declaration of an \n     ADIZ in the East China Sea will not alter how the United \n     States Government conducts operations in the region or the \n     unwavering United States commitment to peace, security and \n     stability in the Asia-Pacific region;\n       Whereas the Government of Japan expressed deep concern \n     about the People's Republic of China's declaration of such a \n     zone, regarding it as an effort to unduly infringe upon the \n     freedom of flight in international airspace and to change the \n     status quo that could escalate tensions and potentially cause \n     unintentional consequences in the East China Sea;\n       Whereas the Government of the Republic of Korea has \n     expressed concern over China's declared ADIZ, and on December \n     9, 2013, announced an adjustment to its longstanding Air \n     Defense Identification Zone, which does not encompass \n     territory administered by another country, and did so only \n     after undertaking a deliberate process of consultations with \n     the United States, Japan, and China;\n       Whereas the Government of the Philippines has stressed that \n     China's declared ADIZ seeks to transfer an entire air zone \n     into Chinese domestic airspace, infringes on freedom of \n     flight in international airspace, and compromises the safety \n     of civil aviation and the national security of affected \n     states, and has called on China to ensure that its actions do \n     not jeopardize regional security and stability;\n       Whereas, on November 26, 2013, the Government of Australia \n     made clear in a statement its opposition to any coercive or \n     unilateral actions to change the status quo in the East China \n     Sea;\n       Whereas, on March 10, 2014, the United States Government \n     and the Government of Japan jointly submitted a letter to the \n     ICAO Secretariat regarding the issue of freedom of overflight \n     by civil aircraft in international airspace and the effective \n     management of civil air traffic within allocated Flight \n     Information Regions (FIR);\n       Whereas Indonesia Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa, in a \n     hearing before the Committee on Defense and Foreign Affairs \n     on February 18, 2014, stated, ``We have firmly told China we \n     will not accept a similar [Air Defense Identification] Zone \n     if it is adopted in the South China Sea. And the signal we \n     have received thus far is, China does not plan to adopt a \n     similar Zone in the South China Sea.'';\n       Whereas over half the world's merchant tonnage flows \n     through the South China Sea, and over 15,000,000 barrels of \n     oil per day transit the Strait of Malacca, fueling economic \n     growth and prosperity throughout the Asia-Pacific region;\n       Whereas the increasing frequency and assertiveness of \n     patrols and competing regulations over disputed territory and \n     maritime areas and airspace in the South China Sea and the \n     East China Sea are raising tensions and increasing the risk \n     of confrontation;\n       Whereas the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \n     has promoted multilateral talks on disputed areas without \n     settling the issue of sovereignty, and in 2002 joined with \n     China in signing a Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in \n     the South China Sea that committed all parties to those \n     territorial disputes to ``reaffirm their respect for and \n     commitment to the freedom of navigation in and over flight \n     above the South China Sea as provided for by the universally \n     recognized principles of international law'' and to ``resolve \n     their territorial and jurisdictional disputes by peaceful \n     means, without resorting to the threat or use of force'';\n       Whereas ASEAN and China committed in 2002 to develop an \n     effective Code of Conduct when they adopted the Declaration \n     on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, yet \n     negotiations are irregular and little progress has been made;\n       Whereas, in recent years, there have been numerous \n     dangerous and destabilizing incidents in waters near the \n     coasts of the Philippines, China, Malaysia, and Vietnam;\n       Whereas the United States Government is deeply concerned \n     about unilateral actions by any claimant seeking to change \n     the status quo through the use of coercion, intimidation, or \n     military force, including the continued restrictions on \n     access to Scarborough Reef and pressure on long-standing \n     Philippine presence at the Second Thomas Shoal by the \n     People's Republic of China; actions by any state to prevent \n     any other state from exercising its sovereign rights to the \n     resources of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and \n     continental shelf by making claims to those areas that have \n     no support in international law; declarations of \n     administrative and military districts in contested areas in \n     the South China Sea; and the imposition of new fishing \n     regulations covering disputed areas, which have raised \n     tensions in the region;\n       Whereas international law is important to safeguard the \n     rights and freedoms of all states in the Asia-Pacific region, \n     and the lack of clarity in accordance with international law \n     by claimants with regard to their South China Sea claims can \n     create uncertainty, insecurity, and instability;\n       Whereas the United States Government opposes the use of \n     intimidation, coercion, or force to assert a territorial \n     claim in the South China Sea;\n       Whereas claims in the South China Sea must accord with \n     international law, and those that are not derived from land \n     features are fundamentally flawed;\n       Whereas ASEAN issued Six-Point Principles on the South \n     China Sea on July 20, 2012, whereby ASEAN's Foreign Ministers \n     reiterated and reaffirmed ``the commitment of ASEAN Member \n     States to: . . . 1. the full implementation of the \n     Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea \n     (2002); . . . 2. the Guidelines for the Implementation of the \n     Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea \n     (2011); . . . 3. the early conclusion of a Regional Code of \n     Conduct in the South China Sea; . . . 4. the full respect of \n     the universally recognized principles of International Law, \n     including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of \n     the Sea (UNCLOS); . . . 5. the continued exercise of self-\n     restraint and non-use of force by all parties; and . . . 6. \n     the peaceful resolution of disputes, in accordance with \n     universally recognized principles of International Law, \n     including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of \n     the Sea (UNCLOS).'';\n       Whereas, in 2013, the Republic of the Philippines properly \n     exercised its rights to peaceful settlement mechanisms with \n     the filing of arbitration case under Article 287 and Annex \n     VII of the Convention on the Law of the Sea in order to \n     achieve a peaceful and durable solution to the dispute, and \n     the United States hopes that all parties in any dispute \n     ultimately abide by the rulings of internationally recognized \n     dispute-settlement bodies;\n       Whereas China and Japan are the world's second and third \n     largest economies, and have a shared interest in preserving \n     stable maritime domains to continue to support economic \n     growth;\n       Whereas there has been an unprecedented increase in \n     dangerous activities by Chinese maritime agencies in areas \n     near the Senkaku islands, including between 6 and 25 ships of \n     the Government of China intruding into the Japanese \n     territorial sea each month since September 2012, between 26 \n     and 124 ships entering the ``contiguous zone'' in the same \n     time period, and 9 ships intruding into the territorial sea \n     and 33 ships entering in the contiguous zone in February \n     2014;\n\n[[Page S4438]]\n\n       Whereas, although the United States Government does not \n     take a position on the ultimate sovereignty of the Senkaku \n     Islands, the United States Government acknowledges that they \n     are under the administration of Japan and opposes any \n     unilateral actions that would seek to undermine such \n     administration;\n       Whereas the United States Senate has previously affirmed \n     that the unilateral actions of a third party will not affect \n     the United States acknowledgment of the administration of \n     Japan over the Senkaku Islands;\n       Whereas the United States remains committed under the \n     Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security to respond to any \n     armed attack in the territories under the administration of \n     Japan, has urged all parties to take steps to prevent \n     incidents and manage disagreements through peaceful means, \n     and commends the Government of Japan for its restrained \n     approach in this regard;\n       Whereas both the United States and the People's Republic of \n     China are parties to and are obligated to observe the rules \n     of the Convention on the International Regulations for \n     Preventing Collisions at Sea, done at London October 12, 1972 \n     (COLREGs);\n       Whereas, on December 5, 2013, the USS Cowpens was lawfully \n     operating in international waters in the South China Sea when \n     a People's Liberation Army Navy vessel reportedly crossed its \n     bow at a distance of less than 500 yards and stopped in the \n     water, forcing the USS Cowpens to take evasive action to \n     avoid a collision;\n       Whereas the reported actions taken by the People's \n     Liberation Army Navy vessel in the USS Cowpens' incident, as \n     publicly reported, appear contrary to the international legal \n     obligations of the People's Republic of China under COLREGs;\n       Whereas, on May 1, 2014, the People's Republic of China's \n     state-owned energy company, CNOOC, placed its deepwater semi-\n     submersible drilling rig Hai Yang Shi You 981 (HD-981), \n     accompanied by over 25 Chinese ships, in Block 143, 120 \n     nautical miles off Vietnam's coastline;\n       Whereas, from May 1 to May 9, 2014, the number of Chinese \n     vessels escorting HD-981 increased to more than 80, including \n     seven military ships, which aggressively patrolled and \n     intimidated Vietnamese Coast Guard ships in violation of \n     COLREGS, reportedly intentionally rammed multiple Vietnamese \n     vessels, and used helicopters and water cannons to obstruct \n     others;\n       Whereas, on May 5, 2014, vessels from the Maritime Safety \n     Administration of China (MSAC) established an exclusion zone \n     with a radius of three nautical miles around HD-981, which \n     undermines maritime safety in the area and is in violation of \n     universally recognized principles of International Law, \n     including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of \n     the Sea (UNCLOS);\n       Whereas China's territorial claims and associated maritime \n     actions in support of the drilling activity that HD-981 \n     commenced on May 1, 2014, have not been clarified under \n     international law, including as defined by the 1982 United \n     Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, constitute a \n     unilateral attempt to change the status quo by force, and \n     appear to be in violation of the 2002 Declaration on the \n     Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea;\n       Whereas, on January 19, 1998, the United States and \n     People's Republic of China signed the Military Maritime \n     Consultative Agreement, creating a mechanism for consultation \n     and coordination on operational safety issues in the maritime \n     domain between the United States and the People's Republic of \n     China;\n       Whereas the Western Pacific Naval Symposium, inaugurated in \n     1988 and comprising the navies of Australia, Brunei, \n     Cambodia, Canada, Chile, France, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, \n     New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the People's Republic of \n     China, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, the Russian \n     Federation, Singapore, Thailand, Tonga, the United States, \n     and Vietnam, whose countries all border the Pacific Ocean \n     region, provides a forum where leaders of regional navies can \n     meet to discuss cooperative initiatives, discuss regional and \n     global maritime issues, and undertake exercises to strengthen \n     norms and practices that contribute to operational safety, \n     including protocols for unexpected encounters at sea, common \n     ways of communication, common ways of operating, and common \n     ways of engagement;\n       Whereas, Japan and the People's Republic of China sought to \n     negotiate a Maritime Communications Mechanism between the \n     defense authorities and a Maritime Search and Rescue \n     Agreement and agreed in principle to these agreements to \n     address operational safety on the maritime domains but failed \n     to sign them;\n       Whereas the Changi Command and Control Center in Singapore \n     provides a platform for all the countries of the Western \n     Pacific to share information on what kind of contact at sea \n     and to provide a common operational picture for the region;\n       Whereas 2014 commemorates the 35th anniversary of \n     normalization of diplomatic relations between the United \n     States and the People's Republic of China, and the United \n     States welcomes the development of a peaceful and prosperous \n     China that becomes a responsible international stakeholder, \n     the government of which respects international norms, \n     international laws, international institutions, and \n     international rules; enhances security and peace; and seeks \n     to advance relations between the United States and China; and\n       Whereas ASEAN plays an important role, in partnership with \n     others in the regional and international community, in \n     addressing maritime security issues in the Asia-Pacific \n     region and the Indian Ocean, including open access to the \n     maritime domain of Asia; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       The Senate--\n       (1) condemns coercive and threatening actions or the use of \n     force to impede freedom of operations in international \n     airspace by military or civilian aircraft, to alter the \n     status quo or to destabilize the Asia-Pacific region;\n       (2) urges the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     to refrain from implementing the declared East China Sea Air \n     Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), which is contrary to \n     freedom of overflight in international airspace, and to \n     refrain from taking similar provocative actions elsewhere in \n     the Asia-Pacific region[; and];\n       (3) commends the Governments of Japan and of the Republic \n     of Korea for their restraint, and commends the Government of \n     the Republic of Korea for engaging in a deliberate process of \n     consultations with the United States, Japan and China prior \n     to announcing its adjustment of its Air Defense \n     Identification Zone on December 9, 2013, and for its \n     commitment to implement this adjusted Air Defense \n     Identification Zone (ADIZ) in a manner consistent with \n     international practice and respect for the freedom of \n     overflight and other internationally lawful uses of \n     international airspace; and\n       (4) calls on the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China to withdraw its HD-981 drilling rig and associated \n     maritime forces from their current positions, to refrain from \n     maritime maneuvers contrary to COLREGS, and to return \n     immediately to the status quo as it existed before May 1, \n     2014. \n\n     SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to--\n       (1) reaffirm its unwavering commitment and support for \n     allies and partners in the Asia-Pacific region, including \n     longstanding United States policy regarding Article V of the \n     United States-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty and that \n     Article V of the United States-Japan Mutual Defense Treaty \n     applies to the Japanese-administered Senkaku Islands;\n       (2) oppose claims that impinge on the rights, freedoms, and \n     lawful use of the sea that belong to all nations;\n       (3) urge all parties to refrain from engaging in \n     destabilizing activities, including illegal occupation or \n     efforts to unlawfully assert administration over disputed \n     claims;\n       (4) ensure that disputes are managed without intimidation, \n     coercion, or force;\n       (5) call on all claimants to clarify or adjust claims in \n     accordance with international law;\n       (6) support efforts by ASEAN and the People's Republic of \n     China to develop an effective Code of Conduct, including the \n     ``early harvest'' of agreed-upon elements in the Code of \n     Conduct that can be implemented immediately;\n       (7) reaffirm that an existing body of international rules \n     and guidelines, including the International Regulations for \n     Preventing Collisions at Sea, done at London October 12, 1972 \n     (COLREGs), is sufficient to ensure the safety of navigation \n     between the United States Armed Forces and the forces of \n     other countries, including the People's Republic of China;\n       (8) support the development of regional institutions and \n     bodies, including the ASEAN Regional Forum, the ASEAN Defense \n     Minister's Meeting Plus, the East Asia Summit, and the \n     expanded ASEAN Maritime Forum, to build practical cooperation \n     in the region and reinforce the role of international law;\n       (9) encourage the adoption of mechanisms such as hotlines \n     or emergency procedures for preventing incidents in sensitive \n     areas, managing them if they occur, and preventing disputes \n     from escalating;\n       (10) fully support the rights of claimants to exercise \n     rights they may have to avail themselves of peaceful dispute \n     settlement mechanisms;\n       (11) encourage claimants not to undertake new unilateral \n     attempts to change the status quo since the signing of the \n     2002 Declaration of Conduct, including not asserting \n     administrative measures or controls in disputed areas in the \n     South China Sea;\n       (12) encourage the deepening of partnerships with other \n     countries in the region for maritime domain awareness and \n     capacity building, as well as efforts by the United States \n     Government to explore the development of appropriate \n     multilateral mechanisms for a ``common operating picture'' in \n     the South China Sea that would serve to help countries avoid \n     destabilizing behavior and deter risky and dangerous \n     activities; and\n       (13) assure the continuity of operations by the United \n     States in the Asia-Pacific region, including, when \n     appropriate, in cooperation with partners and allies, to \n     reaffirm the principle of freedom of operations in \n     international waters and airspace in accordance with \n     established principles and practices of international law.\n  Mr. REID.

declarations of \n     administrative and military districts in contested areas in \n     the South China Sea; and the imposition of new fishing \n     regulations covering disputed areas, which have raised \n     tensions in the region;\n       Whereas international law is important to safeguard the \n     rights and freedoms of all states in the Asia-Pacific region, \n     and the lack of clarity in accordance with international law \n     by claimants with regard to their South China Sea claims can \n     create uncertainty, insecurity, and instability;\n       Whereas the United States Government opposes the use of \n     intimidation, coercion, or force to assert a territorial \n     claim in the South China Sea;\n       Whereas claims in the South China Sea must accord with \n     international law, and those that are not derived from land \n     features are fundamentally flawed;\n       Whereas ASEAN issued Six-Point Principles on the South \n     China Sea on July 20, 2012, whereby ASEAN's Foreign Ministers \n     reiterated and reaffirmed ``the commitment of ASEAN Member \n     States to: . . . 1. the full implementation of the \n     Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea \n     (2002);

Res. 412\n\n       Whereas Asia-Pacific's maritime domains, which include both \n     the sea and airspace above the domains, are critical to the \n     region's prosperity, stability, and security, including \n     global commerce;\n       Whereas the United States is a longstanding Asia-Pacific \n     power and has a national interest in maintaining freedom of \n     operations in international waters and airspace both in the \n     Asia-Pacific region and around the world;\n       Whereas for over 60 years, the United States Government, \n     alongside United States allies and partners, has played an \n     instrumental role in maintaining stability in the Asia-\n     Pacific, including safeguarding the prosperity and economic \n     growth and development of the Asia-Pacific region;\n       Whereas the United States, from the earliest days of the \n     Republic, has had a deep and abiding national security \n     interest in freedom of navigation, freedom of the seas, \n     respect for international law, and unimpeded lawful commerce, \n     including in the East China and South China Seas;\n       Whereas the United States alliance relationships in the \n     region, including with Japan, Korea, Australia, the \n     Philippines, and Thailand, are at the heart of United States \n     policy and engagement in the Asia-Pacific region, and share a \n     common approach to supporting the maintenance of peace and \n     stability, freedom of navigation, and other internationally \n     lawful uses of sea and airspace in the Asia-Pacific region;\n       Whereas territorial and maritime claims must be derived \n     from land features and otherwise comport with international \n     law;\n       Whereas the United States Government has a clear interest \n     in encouraging and supporting the nations of the region to \n     work collaboratively and diplomatically to resolve disputes \n     and is firmly opposed to coercion, intimidation, threats, or \n     the use of force;\n       Whereas the South China Sea contains great natural \n     resources, and their stewardship and responsible use offers \n     immense potential benefit for generations to come;\n       Whereas the United States is not a claimant party in either \n     the East China or South China Seas, but does have an interest \n     in the peaceful diplomatic resolution of disputed claims in \n     accordance with international law, in freedom of operations, \n     and in the free-flow of commerce free of coercion, \n     intimidation, or the use of force;\n       Whereas the United States supports the obligation of all \n     members of the United Nations to seek to resolve disputes by \n     peaceful means;\n       Whereas freedom of navigation and other lawful uses of sea \n     and airspace in the Asia-Pacific region are embodied in \n     international law, not granted by certain states to others;\n       Whereas, on November 23, 2013, the People's Republic of \n     China unilaterally and without prior consultations with the \n     United States, Japan, the Republic of Korea or other nations \n     of the Asia-Pacific region, declared an Air Defense \n     Identification Zone (ADIZ) in the East China Sea, also \n     announcing that all aircraft entering the PRC's self-declared \n     ADIZ, even if they do not intend to enter Chinese territorial \n     airspace, would have to submit flight plans, maintain radio \n     contact, and follow directions from the Chinese Ministry of \n     National Defense or face ``emergency defensive measures'';\n       Whereas the ``rules of engagement'' declared by China, \n     including the ``emergency defensive measures'', are in \n     violation of the concept of ``due regard for the safety of \n     civil aviation'' under the Chicago Convention of the \n     International Civil Aviation Organization and thereby are a \n     departure from accepted practice;\n       Whereas the Chicago Convention of the International Civil \n     Aviation Organization distinguishes between civilian aircraft \n     and state aircraft and provides for the specific obligations \n     of state parties, consistent with customary law, to ``refrain \n     from resorting to the use of weapons against civil aircraft \n     in flight and . . . in case of interception, the lives of \n     persons on board and the safety of aircraft must not be \n     endangered'';\n       Whereas international civil aviation is regulated by \n     international agreements, including standards and regulations \n     set by ICAO for aviation safety, security, efficiency and \n     regularity, as well as for aviation environmental protection;\n       Whereas, in accordance with the norm of airborne innocent \n     passage, the United States does not recognize the right of a \n     coastal nation to apply its ADIZ procedures to foreign state \n     aircraft not intending to enter national airspace nor does \n     the United States apply its ADIZ procedures to foreign state \n     aircraft not intending to enter United States airspace;\n       Whereas the United States Government expressed profound \n     concerns with China's unilateral, provocative, dangerous, and \n     destabilizing declaration of such a zone, including the \n     potential for misunderstandings and miscalculations by \n     aircraft operating lawfully in international airspace;\n       Whereas the People's Republic of China's declaration of an \n     ADIZ in the East China Sea will not alter how the United \n     States Government conducts operations in the region or the \n     unwavering United States commitment to peace, security and \n     stability in the Asia-Pacific region;\n       Whereas the Government of Japan expressed deep concern \n     about the People's Republic of China's declaration of such a \n     zone, regarding it as an effort to unduly infringe upon the \n     freedom of flight in international airspace and to change the \n     status quo that could escalate tensions and potentially cause \n     unintentional consequences in the East China Sea;\n       Whereas the Government of the Republic of Korea has \n     expressed concern over China's declared ADIZ, and on December \n     9, 2013, announced an adjustment to its longstanding Air \n     Defense Identification Zone, which does not encompass \n     territory administered by another country, and did so only \n     after undertaking a deliberate process of consultations with \n     the United States, Japan, and China;\n       Whereas the Government of the Philippines has stressed that \n     China's declared ADIZ seeks to transfer an entire air zone \n     into Chinese domestic airspace, infringes on freedom of \n     flight in international airspace, and compromises the safety \n     of civil aviation and the national security of affected \n     states, and has called on China to ensure that its actions do \n     not jeopardize regional security and stability;\n       Whereas, on November 26, 2013, the Government of Australia \n     made clear in a statement its opposition to any coercive or \n     unilateral actions to change the status quo in the East China \n     Sea;\n       Whereas, on March 10, 2014, the United States Government \n     and the Government of Japan jointly submitted a letter to the \n     ICAO Secretariat regarding the issue of freedom of overflight \n     by civil aircraft in international airspace and the effective \n     management of civil air traffic within allocated Flight \n     Information Regions (FIR);\n       Whereas Indonesia Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa, in a \n     hearing before the Committee on Defense and Foreign Affairs \n     on February 18, 2014, stated, ``We have firmly told China we \n     will not accept a similar [Air Defense Identification] Zone \n     if it is adopted in the South China Sea. And the signal we \n     have received thus far is, China does not plan to adopt a \n     similar Zone in the South China Sea.'';\n       Whereas over half the world's merchant tonnage flows \n     through the South China Sea, and over 15,000,000 barrels of \n     oil per day transit the Strait of Malacca, fueling economic \n     growth and prosperity throughout the Asia-Pacific region;\n       Whereas the increasing frequency and assertiveness of \n     patrols and competing regulations over disputed territory and \n     maritime areas and airspace in the South China Sea and the \n     East China Sea are raising tensions and increasing the risk \n     of confrontation;\n       Whereas the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \n     has promoted multilateral talks on disputed areas without \n     settling the issue of sovereignty, and in 2002 joined with \n     China in signing a Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in \n     the South China Sea that committed all parties to those \n     territorial disputes to ``reaffirm their respect for and \n     commitment to the freedom of navigation in and over flight \n     above the South China Sea as provided for by the universally\n\n[[Page S4441]]\n\n     recognized principles of international law'' and to ``resolve \n     their territorial and jurisdictional disputes by peaceful \n     means, without resorting to the threat or use of force'';\n       Whereas ASEAN and China committed in 2002 to develop an \n     effective Code of Conduct when they adopted the Declaration \n     on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, yet \n     negotiations are irregular and little progress has been made;\n       Whereas in recent years, there have been numerous dangerous \n     and destabilizing incidents in waters near the coasts of the \n     Philippines, China, Malaysia, and Vietnam;\n       Whereas the United States Government is deeply concerned \n     about unilateral actions by any claimant seeking to change \n     the status quo through the use of coercion, intimidation, or \n     military force, including the continued restrictions on \n     access to Scarborough Reef and pressure on long-standing \n     Philippine presence at the Second Thomas Shoal by the \n     People's Republic of China; actions by any state to prevent \n     any other state from exercising its sovereign rights to the \n     resources of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and \n     continental shelf by making claims to those areas that have \n     no support in international law; declarations of \n     administrative and military districts in contested areas in \n     the South China Sea; and the imposition of new fishing \n     regulations covering disputed areas, which have raised \n     tensions in the region;\n       Whereas international law is important to safeguard the \n     rights and freedoms of all states in the Asia-Pacific region, \n     and the lack of clarity in accordance with international law \n     by claimants with regard to their South China Sea claims can \n     create uncertainty, insecurity, and instability;\n       Whereas the United States Government opposes the use of \n     intimidation, coercion, or force to assert a territorial \n     claim in the South China Sea;\n       Whereas claims in the South China Sea must accord with \n     international law, and those that are not derived from land \n     features are fundamentally flawed;\n       Whereas ASEAN issued Six-Point Principles on the South \n     China Sea on July 20, 2012, whereby ASEAN's Foreign Ministers \n     reiterated and reaffirmed ``the commitment of ASEAN Member \n     States to: . . . 1. the full implementation of the \n     Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea \n     (2002); . . . 2. the Guidelines for the Implementation of the \n     Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea \n     (2011); . . . 3. the early conclusion of a Regional Code of \n     Conduct in the South China Sea; . . . 4. the full respect of \n     the universally recognized principles of International Law, \n     including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of \n     the Sea (UNCLOS); . . . 5. the continued exercise of self-\n     restraint and non-use of force by all parties; and . . . 6. \n     the peaceful resolution of disputes, in accordance with \n     universally recognized principles of International Law, \n     including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of \n     the Sea (UNCLOS).'';\n       Whereas, in 2013, the Republic of the Philippines properly \n     exercised its rights to peaceful settlement mechanisms with \n     the filing of arbitration case under Article 287 and Annex \n     VII of the Convention on the Law of the Sea in order to \n     achieve a peaceful and durable solution to the dispute, and \n     the United States hopes that all parties in any dispute \n     ultimately abide by the rulings of internationally recognized \n     dispute-settlement bodies;\n       Whereas China and Japan are the world's second and third \n     largest economies, and have a shared interest in preserving \n     stable maritime domains to continue to support economic \n     growth;\n       Whereas there has been an unprecedented increase in \n     dangerous activities by Chinese maritime agencies in areas \n     near the Senkaku islands, including between 6 and 25 ships of \n     the Government of China intruding into the Japanese \n     territorial sea each month since September 2012, between 26 \n     and 124 ships entering the ``contiguous zone'' in the same \n     time period, and 9 ships intruding into the territorial sea \n     and 33 ships entering in the contiguous zone in February \n     2014;\n       Whereas although the United States Government does not take \n     a position on the ultimate sovereignty of the Senkaku \n     Islands, the United States Government acknowledges that they \n     are under the administration of Japan and opposes any \n     unilateral actions that would seek to undermine such \n     administration;\n       Whereas the United States Senate has previously affirmed \n     that the unilateral actions of a third party will not affect \n     the United States acknowledgment of the administration of \n     Japan over the Senkaku Islands;\n       Whereas the United States remains committed under the \n     Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security to respond to any \n     armed attack in the territories under the administration of \n     Japan, has urged all parties to take steps to prevent \n     incidents and manage disagreements through peaceful means, \n     and commends the Government of Japan for its restrained \n     approach in this regard;\n       Whereas both the United States and the People's Republic of \n     China are parties to and are obligated to observe the rules \n     of the Convention on the International Regulations for \n     Preventing Collisions at Sea, done at London October 12, 1972 \n     (COLREGs);\n       Whereas, on December 5, 2013, the USS Cowpens was lawfully \n     operating in international waters in the South China Sea when \n     a People's Liberation Army Navy vessel reportedly crossed its \n     bow at a distance of less than 500 yards and stopped in the \n     water, forcing the USS Cowpens to take evasive action to \n     avoid a collision;\n       Whereas the reported actions taken by the People's \n     Liberation Army Navy vessel in the USS Cowpens' incident, as \n     publicly reported, appear contrary to the international legal \n     obligations of the People's Republic of China under COLREGs;\n       Whereas, on May 1, 2014, the People's Republic of China's \n     state-owned energy company, CNOOC, placed its deepwater semi-\n     submersible drilling rig Hai Yang Shi You 981 (HD-981), \n     accompanied by over 25 Chinese ships, in Block 143, 120 \n     nautical miles off Vietnam's coastline;\n       Whereas from May 1 to May 9, 2014, the number of Chinese \n     vessels escorting Hai Yang Shi You 981 (HD-981) increased to \n     more than 80, including seven military ships, which \n     aggressively patrolled and intimidated Vietnamese Coast Guard \n     ships in violation of COLREGS, reportedly intentionally \n     rammed multiple Vietnamese vessels, and used helicopters and \n     water cannons to obstruct others;\n       Whereas, on May 5, 2014, vessels from the Maritime Safety \n     Administration of China (MSAC) established an exclusion zone \n     with a radius of three nautical miles around Hai Yang Shi You \n     981 (HD-981), which undermines maritime safety in the area \n     and is in violation of universally recognized principles of \n     international law;\n       Whereas China's territorial claims and associated maritime \n     actions in support of the drilling activity that Hai Yang Shi \n     You 981 (HD-981) commenced on May 1, 2014, have not been \n     clarified under international law, constitute a unilateral \n     attempt to change the status quo by force, and appear to be \n     in violation of the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of \n     Parties in the South China Sea;\n       Whereas, on January 19, 1998, the United States and \n     People's Republic of China signed the Military Maritime \n     Consultative Agreement, creating a mechanism for consultation \n     and coordination on operational safety issues in the maritime \n     domain between the United States and the People's Republic of \n     China;\n       Whereas the Western Pacific Naval Symposium, inaugurated in \n     1988 and comprising the navies of Australia, Brunei, \n     Cambodia, Canada, Chile, France, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, \n     New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the People's Republic of \n     China, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, the Russian \n     Federation, Singapore, Thailand, Tonga, the United States, \n     and Vietnam, whose countries all border the Pacific Ocean \n     region, provides a forum where leaders of regional navies can \n     meet to discuss cooperative initiatives, discuss regional and \n     global maritime issues, and undertake exercises to strengthen \n     norms and practices that contribute to operational safety, \n     including protocols for unexpected encounters at sea, common \n     ways of communication, common ways of operating, and common \n     ways of engagement;\n       Whereas Japan and the People's Republic of China sought to \n     negotiate a Maritime Communications Mechanism between the \n     defense authorities and a Maritime Search and Rescue \n     Agreement and agreed in principle to these agreements to \n     address operational safety on the maritime domains but failed \n     to sign them;\n       Whereas the Changi Command and Control Center in Singapore \n     provides a platform for all the countries of the Western \n     Pacific to share information on what kind of contact at sea \n     and to provide a common operational picture for the region;\n       Whereas 2014 commemorates the 35th anniversary of \n     normalization of diplomatic relations between the United \n     States and the People's Republic of China, and the United \n     States welcomes the development of a peaceful and prosperous \n     China that becomes a responsible international stakeholder, \n     the government of which respects international norms, \n     international laws,

Mr. President, I want to take just a little bit of time to \nsay a few things about the health care bill. The shrill cries from the \nother side have lessened in recent weeks, and obviously for good \nreason. The New York Times reports today--I won't read the whole column \nbut I will read quite a bit.\n  It says less than ``15 percent of adults younger than 65 now lack \nhealth insurance, down from 20 percent before the Affordable Care Act \nrolled out in January.''\n  In fact, we have information from the Gallup organization today that \ncame out after this New York Times article that the rate is down to \n13.4 percent. It is the lowest quarterly average recorded since Gallup \nbegan tracking the percentage of uninsured Americans. That is pretty \ngood.\n  The Gallup poll says:\n\n       The uninsured rate has decreased sharply since the \n     Affordable Care Act's requirement for most Americans to have \n     health insurance went into effect beginning 2014.\n\n  So in the fourth quarter of 2013 the average was 17.1 percent, and \nnow it is down to 13.4. This is remarkable.\n  Carrying on with the information from the New York Times, people who \ngot new coverage--we heard all the cries about how upset people were \nwith the new health insurance, but they are very happy with the new \nproduct; 73 percent of the people who bought health care plans and 80 \npercent of those who signed up for Medicaid said they were either very \nsatisfied or somewhat satisfied. That is 73 percent with their new \nhealth insurance; 74 percent of newly insured Republicans like their \nplans; 77 percent of people who had insurance before, including members \nof the much-publicized group whose plans got cancelled last year, were \nhappy with their new coverage.\n  A survey also said that a majority of people are using their new \ninsurance. They like it. They are glad they have it.\n  People who have the insurance are going to a doctor, they are going \nto the hospital, and most people seeking new primary care doctors found \nthe process easy and had to wait less than 2 weeks for an appointment. \nSixty percent said they wouldn't have been able to afford the care \nwithout the new coverage.\n  These statistics are really staggering.\n  The article closes by saying:\n\n       There is a reason to think that the good feelings may \n     linger. . . . An Associated Press poll in January found that \n     73 percent of all Americans with insurance before the rollout \n     of the law were satisfied.\n\n  So we are doing overall very well. My Republican colleagues come to \nthe floor and say: Oh, this is just awful, people are so upset.\n  It simply is not true.\n  This is not my opinion. It is statistics and facts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/10/senate-section/article/S4442-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR MONDAY, JULY 14, 2014\n\n  Mr. REID.
