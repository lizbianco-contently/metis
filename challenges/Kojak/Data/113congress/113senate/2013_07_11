I move to proceed to Calendar No. 124, S. 1238, Senator \nReed's student loan bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the bill by \ntitle.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1238) to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 \n     to extend the current reduced interest rate for undergraduate \n     Federal Direct Stafford Loans for 1 year, to modify required \n     distribution rules for pension plans, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Following my remarks and those of the Republican leader, \nthe time until 12:30 today will be equally divided and controlled, with \nthe Republicans controlling the first 30 minutes and the majority \ncontrolling the next 30 minutes.\n  The Senate will recess from 12:30 to 2:15 for caucus meetings.\n\n\n                              Senate Rules\n\n  Last month, the Republican leader spent a great deal of time talking \nabout the importance of keeping one's word.\n  I agree without any question that Senators and everyone else should \nkeep their word. I also believe a deal is a deal, a contract is a \ncontract, an arrangement is an arrangement, a bargain is a bargain. As \nlong as each party to such agreement holds up his end of the bargain, \nSenators should stick to their word.\n  But agreement is a two-way street. If one party fails to uphold their \nend, the agreement, of course, is null and void. The Republican leader \nwants everyone to believe--he has made many statements on the floor to \nwhich I have not responded--that I have broken my word. He neglects to \nrecall his own commitments and his own words. Remember, an agreement is \na two-way street.\n  Let's take a closer look at what the Republican leader committed to \ndo. Let's look at the agreement we entered into together on the floor \nof this body, the Senate.\n  In a colloquy at the beginning of this Congress, January 24 of this \nyear, I committed not to amend the Standing Rules of the Senate except \nthrough regular order. During that colloquy, Senator McConnell also \nmade a commitment. Senator McConnell committed to end the constant \nRepublican obstruction and return the Senate to a time when nominations \nwere processed more efficiently.\n  This is what he said:\n\n       On the subject of nominations, Senate Republicans will \n     continue to work with the majority to process nominations, \n     consistent with the norms and traditions of the Senate.\n\n  I replied on the Senate floor:\n\n       The two leaders will continue to work together to schedule \n     votes on nominees in a timely manner by unanimous consent, \n     except in extraordinary circumstances.\n\n\n[[Page S5626]]\n\n\n  Remember, an agreement is an agreement, a contract is a contract, and \na bargain is a bargain.\n  The Republican leader also pledged: This Congress should be more \nbipartisan than the last Congress. He promised ``to work with the \nmajority to process nominations.'' He committed that ``the two leaders \nwill continue to work together to schedule votes on nominees in a \ntimely manner by unanimous consent, except in extraordinary \ncircumstances.''\n  Those were his words. Those were his commitments. Those were his \npromises. By any objective standard, they have been broken.\n  Let's take a look at the record--part of the record at least. Exactly \n3 weeks after Senator McConnell committed to process nominees \nconsistent with norms and traditions of the Senate--I repeat, \nconsistent with the norms and traditions of the Senate--he led the \nRepublicans on an unprecedented filibuster of the Secretary of Defense, \na highly qualified nominee, someone with whom we served in this body.\n  Nothing can be a starker violation of the commitment to a return to \nthe norms and traditions of the Senate than launching a filibuster of \nthe Secretary of Defense, the first ever in the history of our \nRepublic. What is more, Republicans obstructed the nominee because of \ncompletely unrelated issues and despite the fact that nominee Chuck \nHagel was a war hero of the Vietnam conflict and a former Republican \nSenator from Nebraska. Republicans were busy catering to the tea party \nby trying to inflate the Benghazi nonscandal, which was completely \nunrelated to Secretary Hagel. He wasn't there.\n  Secretary Hagel's nomination was pending in the Senate for 34 days, a \nrecord for the Secretary of Defense. The average time is about 10 days.\n  Confirmation of Cabinet Secretaries used to be free from obstruction. \nOnce in a while there would be something, but not very often. But under \nPresident Obama, Cabinet nominees have faced unprecedented obstruction \nand significant delays in assuming their positions.\n  Not a single Cabinet nominee was filibustered in President Carter's \nadministration. Not a single Cabinet Secretary nominee was filibustered \nin President George H. W. Bush's administration. One Cabinet Secretary \nwas filibustered in the Reagan administration, and only one Cabinet \nSecretary was filibustered in President George W. Bush's \nadministration. But already, in the Obama administration, four Cabinet \nSecretaries have been filibustered and more filibusters are likely. \nRemember, he still has 3\\1/2\\ years to go in his term of office. Yet \nthe Republican leader says there is no problem; the status quo is fine.\n  Republicans were willing to risk national security for the sake of \ntea party politics when considering the Hagel nomination, and they were \nwilling to risk it again when considering the nomination of John \nBrennan to lead the CIA, the Central Intelligence Agency. Now we have \nthe Secretary of Defense, and we have the CIA Director. They \nfilibustered the nomination of a man charged with leading one of the \nNation's most vital national security agencies. Yet the Republican \nleader says there is no problem; the status quo is fine.\n  In fact, Republican obstructionism has affected nearly every single \none of President Obama's nominees. These obstructions continued at \nevery level and through creative new methods.\n  Even before President Obama's nominations reached the Senate floor, \nSenate Republicans bogged them down with unreasonable demands, which \nare terribly time consuming. They are designed to be, if not \nunattainable, hard and difficult.\n  Tom Perez is a man who worked as a garbage man, who put himself \nthrough school. He hauled garbage. He is the President's nominee for \nSecretary of Labor. He received, after the public hearing, more than \n200 questions for the record. These are not easy questions. They are \nnot single-line questions.\n  Jack Lew, the President's nominee for Secretary of Treasury, was \nasked more than 700 questions before he was confirmed. Previously, \nSecretaries of the Treasury were just whipped through here with only a \nhandful of questions. Now Jack Lew is being held up again for another \nposition he wants with the International Monetary Fund. He is the \nSecretary of Treasury of our Nation.\n  Gina McCarthy--after a full hearing which took quite a while to get \narranged because the chairman of the committee wanted to make sure the \nranking member was satisfied with the time, witnesses, and all of \nthat--was asked to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  I know quite a bit about that committee. I was chairman of that \ncommittee twice. Now this is a World Series deal. This holds the \nrecord. She had more than 1,100 questions. It used to be common for \nnominees to be asked a handful of questions in writing after the \nhearing took place.\n  My colleague in the minority wants to claim credit for letting some \nnominees proceed. The fact that he seeks credit for approving some \nnominees only highlights the extent of the problem. Confirming nominees \nshould be the norm, not the exception.\n  Remember the agreement he and I talked about on the Senate floor. The \nPresident deserves to have his or her team in place. I don't really \ncare who is elected, whether it is Jeb Bush, Hillary Clinton, or Joe \nBiden. That person shouldn't have to go through what we have gone \nthrough in the last 4\\1/2\\ years. One look at the Senate's Executive \nCalendar shows that fundamentally nothing has changed since Senator \nMcConnell and I entered into our supposed agreement.\n  There are currently 15 executive branch nominees ready to be \nconfirmed by the Senate after long stalling in many different ways. \nThey have been waiting more than 260 days. Add it up, and that is about \n9 months per confirmation.\n  At this point in President Bush's second term, the Senate had \nconfirmed three times as many executives as for President Obama. By the \nFourth of July of President Clinton's second term, the Senate had \nconfirmed 80 of his executive nominees. By the Fourth of July of \nPresident Bush's second term, the Senate had confirmed 118. By the \nFourth of July of this year for President Obama, 34. Remember, he has \n3\\1/2\\ years left.\n  Through June of this year I have been forced to file cloture on 25 \nObama executive nominees--25. This is eating up so much time. By \ncomparison, a cloture was rarely filed during the 8 years Bush was \nPresident.\n  These procedural blockades are as obvious as they are unprecedented. \nYet the Republican leader says there is no problem here; the status quo \nis fine.\n  This leads me to wonder what exactly does my friend--and he is my \nfriend--Senator McConnell consider an extraordinary circumstance? Is it \nan extraordinary circumstance when Republicans merely dislike an \notherwise qualified nominee? Is it an extraordinary circumstance when \nRepublicans simply dislike the agency the nominee will lead, 1,100 \nquestions? Is it an extraordinary circumstance when Republicans dislike \nthe very laws a nominee will be bound to uphold?\n  It is a disturbing trend when Republicans are willing to block \nexecutive branch nominees even if they have no objection about the \nqualification of the nominee.\n  They don't like the law. They don't like the agency. Instead, they \nare blocking qualified nominees to circumvent the legislative process, \nforcing wholesale changes to laws or restructure of the entire \nexecutive branch departments. They are blocking qualified nominees \nbecause they refuse to accept the law of the land.\n  A perfect example is Richard Cordray, former attorney general of the \nState of Ohio, who has been asked by President Obama to lead the \nConsumer Finance Protection Bureau. To give a little background, \nremember, this was part of the bill that was passed called Dodd-Frank. \nThis consumer finance protection bill was the brainchild of Elizabeth \nWarren, who is now a Senator representing Massachusetts.\n  The reason she is in the Senate is not by chance. Don't even put her \nthere; the President for a long time wanted her to be there. No, he \ncan't have her, so Cordray was a replacement. He was nominated in July \nof 2011. It is now July 2013.\n\n  There is no doubt about his ability to do the job. He has won high \npraise from both Democrats and Republicans. He\n\n[[Page S5627]]\n\nhas a stellar track record. If Mr. Cordray received a fair up-or-down \nvote, he would be confirmed immediately. But the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau continues to operate without a leader because \nRepublicans want to roll back a law that protects consumers from the \ngreed of the big Wall Street banks that caused us to have the meltdown \nwe had in the first place. Republicans refuse to confirm Richard \nCordray's nomination because they refuse to accept the law of the land. \nThey do not dislike him, they dislike the law that was passed. Yet the \nRepublican leader says there is no problem here; the status quo is \nfine.\n  This same type of blatant obstruction was applied to the nomination \nof Gina McCarthy to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. This is a \nwoman who has wide-ranging support with Republicans. She served in \nState Republican administrations. She was nominated 130 days ago, or \nthereabouts, and although she has a proven track record of public \nservice that will help her bring environmental and business groups \ntogether to tackle the serious environmental challenges facing our \nNation, her nomination drags on. It just lingers. Why? Because \nRepublicans fundamentally oppose the mission of the agency--the EPA--\nshe will lead to keep the air we breathe and the water we drink safe \nfrom dangerous pollution. Once again, they refuse to accept the law of \nthe land. Yet the Republican leader says there is no problem here; the \nstatus quo is just fine; nothing is wrong with the Senate and how it \nworks.\n  Republicans also made clear from the start they would never confirm \nDonald Berwick to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, \nthe agency tasked with implementing the landmark health care reform \nlegislation. Talk about qualifications. This was a Harvard professor of \nmedicine.\n  This health care law is already saving seniors money in checkups and \nprescriptions. Millions of seniors now have wellness checkups. Being a \nwoman can no longer be considered a preexisting disability, as \ninsurance companies did before. They can't do that now. Because of \nhealth care reform, insurance companies can no longer deny coverage to \nsick children, such as those kids I had in my office yesterday, who had \njuvenile diabetes. Because of health care reform, there can be no more \nlifetime caps. A man who was a race car driver in Nevada got in an \naccident--not racing, an accident in a car--and was paralyzed. He got \nto the $100,000 limit and was all through; no more help from the \ninsurance company. He went on welfare. Because of the health care \nreform law insurance companies can no longer discriminate against \nthose, as I have indicated, with preexisting conditions.\n  Since President Obama signed that law, insurance companies can no \nlonger put profits ahead of people. It used to be there was no limit to \nwhat they could spend on the executives of the company, but now they \nare limited to 20 percent. That is why millions of people this year \nhave gotten refunds, because the insurance company was gouging them. \nRepublicans oppose this health care law. In the House they have \nscheduled another vote next week--to vote for I think the 41st time--to \nrepeal it. Because Republicans oppose the health care law, they have \ndone everything in their power to derail the law's implementation, \nincluding denying the CMS a leader.\n  Despite Dr. Berwick's stellar credentials, Republicans defamed him \nand destroyed his chance at confirmation because they refused to accept \nthe law of the land. They refused to confirm Berwick, so in 2010 \nPresident Obama was forced to recess-appoint him. Berwick's term ended \na year and a half later because that was done under a recess \nappointment, and at the end of that Congress the appointment expired. \nHe was never confirmed to lead the CMS, although his nomination was \npending for 593 days--more than a year and a half. Yet the Republican \nleader says there is no problem here; the status quo is just fine.\n  The same type of politically motivated obstruction has hobbled the \nNational Labor Relations Board. This isn't some brand new law that \nDemocrats came up with. This came into being during the Great \nDepression--not this one, but the one in the 1930s. That is when the \nNational Labor Relations Board originated. From January 2008 to March \n2010, the National Labor Relations Board has operated with just two \nmembers. Senate Republicans have refused to allow a vote on the \nPresident's nominees--refused.\n  In June 2010, the Supreme Court invalidated much of the NLRB's work \nduring this period, finding three members were necessary. There was no \nquorum unless you had an extra one, and we didn't have one because they \nwouldn't let us do it. Then the President recess-appointed a bipartisan \ngroup of three members to the board so it would function. The appeals \ncourt ruled those appointments were also unconstitutional. The case \nwill soon go to the Supreme Court about recess appointments.\n  As I mentioned, I had a meeting earlier with some of my Republican \nfriends here this morning. We met in my office, and I reminded \neverybody when this issue came up in the past, we put people on that DC \nCircuit that we had to gag to vote for in an effort to avoid a problem \nhere in the Senate, but we did. These are three we put on, the one who \ngave us this outrageous opinion that after 230 years as a country no \nlonger could we have recess appointments. So it will go to the Supreme \nCourt.\n  In the meantime, the term of one of the three remaining NLRB members \nexpires next month. So at the end of August the NLRB will continue to \nbe nonfunctioning. Republicans consider that a victory. I am not making \nthis up. Listen: In 2011, the senior Senator from South Carolina--and I \ncare a great deal about this man, Lindsey Graham. He would say he is my \nfriend and I am saying he is my friend, but listen to what he said: \n``The NLRB, as inoperable, could be considered progress.'' ``The NLRB, \nas inoperable, could be considered progress.''\n  Because Republicans refuse to accept the law of the land, they have \ndenied the NLRB the ability to safeguard workers' rights and monitor \nunions. Workers have been illegally terminated. They have no way to \nappeal. The results of contested union elections? It doesn't matter; \nnobody is there to look it over. Labor abuse and unfair labor practices \ngo unchallenged. Yet the Republican leader says there is no problem \nhere; the status quo is just fine.\n  The Constitution gives the President, whomever that President might \nbe, the right, the power to choose his team. It grants the Senate the \nright to advise and consent on those choices. But consistent and \nunprecedented obstruction by this Republican caucus has turned advise \nand consent into deny and obstruct. Republican obstruction has denied \nPresident Obama the ability to choose his team. Whether you are a \nDemocrat, a Republican, or an Independent, we should all be able to \nagree that Presidents deserve the team members they want, and their \nnominations should be subject to simple up-or-down votes.\n  No President can safeguard America's national economic security to \nthe best of his or her ability without their chosen team in place. \nLet's see if we can come up with an example. Davey Johnson is the \nmanager of the Washington Nationals--his team--we are so happy to have \nhere in Washington. He is here as manager of that team to field a \nwinning team. He was a starring second baseman for the Baltimore \nOrioles when they won four American League pennants, two World Series \nchampionships, and he has managed five different baseball teams. He has \nbeen a two-time manager of the year, he led the Mets to their 1986 \nWorld Series as a manager, and last year he gave the Nats franchise \ntheir first division title since 1981.\n\n  Major League Baseball season begins about April 1. Imagine the front \noffice of Major League Baseball calling up Davey Johnson around the 1st \nof April and saying: Davey, I know that first baseman you signed a week \nor so ago, Adam LaRoche, is a good first baseman. He is swell--a Gold \nGlove winner, a classic power hitter--but I am sorry to tell you that \nyou can't play him until maybe the middle of June. Then Davey Johnson \nis called again by the same man who says: That third baseman, Ryan \nZimmerman, I know you like him, he is a man who has won the Silver \nSlugger Award, he has been a Gold Glove recipient, an All Star, but \ntell you what, you can play him as soon as the All Star break is over.\n\n[[Page S5628]]\n\n  If that were to happen, what would happen to that team? They would go \non and perform, just as President Obama has done, but they would not \nplay to their ability. And that is ridiculous. Yet that is where we \nare. That is exactly what Republicans are saying to President Obama: \nYou can't have your team until we tell you everything is fine, and it \nis going to take a long time for us to tell you that. The gridlock the \nRepublicans have created is not only bad for President Obama and bad \nfor the Senate, it is bad for this country. We can have people come and \ngive all the statistics in the world, but is there anybody out there in \nAmerica who thinks this body is functioning well?\n  Upon examination of this record I have outlined of obstruction--of \ndelay and filibuster--it can hardly be said Senator McConnell has--to \nuse his words--worked together to follow regular order and use his \nprocedural options with discretion. It can hardly be said Senator \nMcConnell has worked with the majority to move nominations. It can \nhardly be said Senator McConnell has worked with the majority to \nschedule votes on nominees in a timely manner except in extraordinary \ncircumstances. But it could be said Senator McConnell broke his word. \nThat certainly could be said. The Republican leader has failed to live \nup to his commitments. He has failed to do what he said he would do--\nmove nominations by regular order except in extraordinary \ncircumstances. I refuse to unilaterally surrender my right to respond \nto this breach of faith. If Senator McConnell wants to continue to \ndefend the status quo of gridlock in Washington, he has that right. If \nSenator McConnell wants to continue to believe there is no problem in \nthe Senate, that is his choice. But the American people are fed up with \ngridlock, they are fed up with obstruction, and they are fed up with \npolitics as usual. They want Washington to work again for American \nfamilies.\n  I try every day of my life to be on the side of the American people. \nI wait and I wait, but I am not going to wait another month, another \nfew weeks, another year for Congress to take action on the things we \nhave been doing for almost 240 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/11/senate-section/article/S5628-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5628-S5640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I sat here patiently and listened to \nthe majority leader's speech, and I hope he will do me the courtesy to \nlisten to mine, since this is a very important day in the history of \nthe Senate. I want to make a couple of observations, which I hope my \nfriend the majority leader will listen to.\n  First, he is trying to justify in advance what would be a very clear \nfailure to honor his very clear commitment not to break the rules of \nthe Senate. What he is referring to are his own statements, not mine, \nregarding extraordinary circumstances. He said that, not me. In other \nwords, to justify breaking his clear commitments not to break the rules \nof the Senate in order to change the rules of the Senate, he is \nattributing to me something somebody else said, and that somebody else, \nby the way, is him. He is attributing to me something he said.\n  We need to keep our commitments around here and not break them, and \nwe need to be honest about quoting people around here. This is about \ntrying to come up with excuses to break our commitments. What this is \nabout is manufacturing a pretext for a power grab.\n  I listened very carefully to what the majority leader had to say. \nWhat he is saying, in effect, is he doesn't want to have any \ncontroversy at all attached to any of the nominees. In other words, \ndon't ask any questions. Advise and consent means sit down and shut up.\n  He was complaining about the number of questions the nominee for EPA \nAdministrator was required to answer.\n  What he conveniently left out was the chairwoman Senator Boxer \nrequested 70,000 documents. Why is it OK for the chairwoman to request \n70,000 documents and somehow if the ranking member makes a lot of \nrequests it is some violation of some comity? When the Founders wrote \n``advise and consent,'' I don't think they had in mind sit down and \nshut up.\n  It is noteworthy that all of the people he is complaining about got \nconfirmed. So what he is saying is he doesn't want any debate at all in \nconnection with Presidential appointments, just sit down, shut up, and \nrubberstamp everything, everyone the President sends up here.\n  On the calendar right now there are 21 nominations--21. There are 148 \nin committee. We don't control the committees, he does: 148 in \ncommittee, 21 on the calendar. It is pretty obvious Senate Democrats \nare gearing up today to make one of the most consequential changes to \nthe Senate in the history of our Nation.\n  I want everybody to understand, this is no small matter we are \ntalking about. I guarantee you it is a decision that if they actually \ngo through with it, they will live to regret. It is an open secret at \nthis point that big labor and others on the left are putting a lot of \npressure on the majority leader to change the rules of the Senate and \nto do so, as he promised not to do, by breaking the rules of the \nSenate. That would violate every protection of the minority rights that \nhas defined the Senate for as long as anyone can remember.\n  Let me assure you, this Pandora's box, once opened, will be utilized \nagain and again by future majorities and it will make the meaningful \nconsensus-building that has served our Nation so well a relic of the \npast.\n  The short-term issue that has triggered this dangerous and far-\nreaching proposal is simple enough. The hard left is so convinced that \nevery one of the President's nominees should sail through the \nconfirmation process that they are willing to do permanent irreversible \ndamage to this institution in order to get their way, and it appears as \nif they have convinced the majority leader to do their bidding and \nhijack the Senate. They are not interested in checks and balances. They \nare not interested in advise and consent. They are not even interested \nin what this would mean down the road when Republicans are the ones \nmaking the nominations. They want the power and they want it now. They \ndo not care about the consequences. The ends justify the means ethos \nhas been resisted by basically every Senate leader in the past and it \nis a clear and unequivocal violation of the public assurances that the \ncurrent majority leader made to the entire Senate, his constituents, \nand the American people just a few months ago.\n  What is worse is we got to this point on the basis of an absolute \nfairytale, a fairytale. Obviously, the left needed an excuse to justify \nsuch an unprecedented power grab, so they simply made up a story about \nRepublicans blocking the President's nominees. The majority leader is \nentitled to his opinion, but he is not entitled to his facts. The facts \nare the facts. Here is the real story. Almost nothing about this tale \nso often repeated around here holds up to scrutiny.\n  The facts are that this President took office and the Senate has \nconfirmed 1,560 people. The Senate has confirmed every single one of \nthe Cabinet nominees who has been brought up for a vote--every single \none. The President has gotten nearly three times as many judges \nconfirmed at this point as President Bush in his Presidency.\n  Here is the point. What this whole so-called crisis boils down to are \nthree nominees the President unlawfully appointed--as confirmed by the \ncourts. A Federal court has held the three nominees were unlawfully \nappointed. Two of the three are direct parties to the litigation and \nthe third one was appointed at exactly the same moment in the exact \nsame way. One of these nominees has been held up by inaction over at \nthe White House related to structural reforms that the administration \nand even the nominee himself, Mr. Cordray, now say they are willing to \nwork with us on. The fact is, indisputably, we have been confirming \nlawfully nominated folks routinely and consistently: The Energy \nSecretary, 97 to 0; the Secretary of the Interior, 87 to 11; the \nSecretary of the Treasury, 71 to 26; the Secretary of State, 94 to 3, \njust a few days after the Senate got his nomination; the Secretary of \nCommerce, 97 to 1; the Secretary of Transportation, 100 to 0; the \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget, 96 to 0; the \nAdministrator of the Centers for Medicare\n\n[[Page S5629]]\n\nand Medicaid Services, 91 to 7; the Chair of the Securities and \nExchange Commission, on a voice vote--in other words, unanimously.\n  What about the nominees still awaiting confirmation who have not--not \nbeen unlawfully appointed? The Senate is ready to vote on them too. \nRegretfully, in my view, frankly, all of them appear ready to have the \nvotes to be confirmed. I don't necessarily support them, but they have \nthe votes to be confirmed. Why don't they call them up? The majority \nleader determines what the order of business is around here. He could \nhave scheduled votes if that is what he wanted to happen. Why don't we \nhave a vote on the Secretary of Labor? What about the Administrator of \nEPA? The NLRB nominees who were not unlawfully appointed--there are \nsome other NLRB nominees who were not unlawfully appointed--why aren't \nwe voting on them?\n  As I said, pending the expected negotiations on reforms to the CFPB, \nthe Senate would likely confirm the chairman to that position as well.\n  We need to be honest about what is going on around here. The only \ncrisis is the crisis the Democrats are creating with their threats to \nfundamentally change the Senate, something the majority leader said \njust a few years ago he would never even consider. Here is why he said \nthat: Because going down this road is ``ultimately . . . about removing \nthe last check in Washington against a complete abuse of power.''\n  Those are the words the majority leader himself used in describing \nthe very thing he is now threatening to do--the very thing he is now \nthreatening to do.\n  Let me sum up what is going on around here. Senate Democrats are \ngetting ready to do permanent damage to this body to confirm three \nunconstitutionally appointed nominees by a simple majority vote. They \nare willing to break the rules of the Senate to change the rules of the \nSenate in order to confirm three nominees that the Federal courts have \nsaid were unlawfully appointed. Every other nomination we are talking \nabout has either already been confirmed or is on the way to being \nconfirmed, but they will not call them up. He gets to decide when we \nvote. Where are the callups for EPA and Labor and the three NLRB \nnominees lawfully appointed?\n\n  If this is not a power grab, I don't know what a power grab looks \nlike. The President appoints three people unconstitutionally, the \nsecond highest court in the land confirms they were unlawfully \nappointed, and Senate Democrats want to break the rules of the Senate \nto confirm them. This is not the story we just heard from the majority \nleader, but this is a fact.\n  The entire phony crisis--absolutely phony, manufactured crisis--boils \ndown to three unlawfully appointed nominees. The Democrats say we are \nholding up the others. It is not true. He gets to schedule the votes. \nWhere are they? Bring them up. The truth is, if there is anyone to \nblame for holding up things in the Senate it is the Democratic \nmajority. They are the ones blocking nearly 30 fast-track nominations, \nmany of whom Republicans have already agreed to confirm unanimously. \nThey are the ones, the Democrats, who have yet to schedule votes on \nMcCarthy and Perez, despite the fact that both of these highly \ncontroversial nominees already have enough votes to clear the 60-vote \nhurdle.\n  I do not like the facts, frankly, and I am not going to be voting for \neither of these nominees. Tom Perez in particular is a far left \nideologue whose record of bending the rules to achieve his ends is \ndeeply concerning to me and just one of the reasons I plan to vote \nagainst him. But to pretend the power to confirm these folks lies in \nthe hands of anyone but the majority leader is totally disingenuous.\n  The White House knows what I have just said. I have told them. The \nmajority leader would know it too if he spent a little more time \nworking with his colleagues in a collegial way and a little less time \ntrying to undermine and marginalize people.\n  The real reason, as I said, is that the far left and big labor are \nleaning hard on Democrats to go nuclear. Go nuclear--they love the \nsound. The majority leader is about to sacrifice his reputation and \nthis institution to go along with it because what they truly want is \nfor the Senate to ratify the President's unconstitutional decision to \nillegally appoint nominees to the NLRB and the CFPB without the input \nof the Senate. They know they cannot get that done under current rules. \nThey know time is not on their side. The second highest court in the \nland ruled unanimously that President Obama had no power to do what he \ndid. Another court has since concurred. Now the Supreme Court is set to \nhear the case in just a few months. They obviously thought it was \nimportant enough to be dealt with at the highest Court in the land.\n  This is not a fight over nominees at all. It is a fight over these \nillegal, unconstitutionally appointed nominees. It is laughable to \nthink Democrats would ever agree to such a thing if we were talking \nabout a Republican President's unlawful nominees--laughable.\n  It is equally irrational to think we would go along with this. In \nfact, no Senator, regardless of party, should ever consider ceding our \nconstitutional duties in such a way.\n  I advised the Romney team before the election that if he won and I \nwas ever elected majority leader, I would defend the Senate first in \nthese battles. I would defend this institution against a Republican \nPresident trying to abuse it. That is a precedent set by majority \nleaders, such as Robert Byrd, who revered this institution because they \nknew what it was to be in both the majority and the minority. It is \nwhat the best leaders of the Senate have always done. It is absolutely \ntragic to think these days may be over.\n  Here are the battle lines. On one side are people who think the \nPresident should have the power to unconstitutionally ignore Congress \nand their constituents. Those are people who believe in it so firmly \nthat they are willing to irreparably damage the Senate to ensure they \nget their way. They are willing to do something the majority leader \nhimself said would contribute to the ruination of the country. I am not \nmaking up his quotes; that is what he said.\n\n  On the other side are the folks in my conference, and even some \nDemocrats, with the courage to speak up against this power grab. We are \nthe folks who believe deeply that a President of any party should work \nwithin the bounds of the Constitution, and that Senators of both \nparties should fulfill their own constitutional obligations to \nthoroughly vet nominees. We also believe in giving those nominees a \nfair hearing. If you look at the facts, you will see we have already \nbeen doing that.\n  As Senator Alexander noted, no majority leader wants written on his \ntombstone that he presided over the end of the Senate. Well, if this \nmajority leader caves to the fringes and lets this happen, I am afraid \nthat is exactly what they will write. In the majority leader's own \nwords: Breaking the rules to change the rules is un-American. Those are \nhis words, not mine.\n  I hope the majority leader thinks about his legacy, the future of his \nparty and, most importantly, the future of our country before he acts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I assume the words ``I agree'' are words \nthat mean something. We had a colloquy on the floor, and at that time \nhe said he wouldn't do anything extraordinarily--he said that, and I \nsaid I agree.\n  I would like to talk about a few other things. Here is a direct quote \nSenator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said a few years ago: The Senate \nhas repeatedly adjusted its rules as circumstances dictate. The first \nSenate adopted its rules by a majority vote which specifically provided \na means to end debate instantly by a simple majority vote.\n  This was the first Senate at the beginning of our country, and that \nwas so we would have the ability to move the previous question and end \ndebate. This is not the first time a minority of Senators has upset a \nSenate tradition or practice. The current Senate majority intends to do \nwhat the majority of the Senate has often done: Use its constitutional \nauthority under Article I, Section 5 to reform Senate procedure by a \nsimple majority vote. That is what Senator McConnell said.\n  The interesting thing here is my friend talks as if: Gee, this has \nnever been done before. But the fact is it has been done many times. \nSince 1977, it\n\n[[Page S5630]]\n\nhas been done 18 times--about twice every year. I think that is pretty \ninteresting. It has happened 18 times just since 1977: December 12, \n1979; November 9, 1979; March 5, 1980; June 11, 1980; June 10, 1980; \nanother time in 1980; 1986, 1985, 1987, 1995, 1996, 1996, 1999, 2000, \n2011. Those are the times the rules have been changed, overruling \nprecedence--as my friend Senator McConnell said--with a majority vote.\n  It is also important to note that, without getting into a lot of \nlegal jargon, the Constitution gives the nomination power to the \nPresident. The Constitution does not provide for a supermajority of the \nSenate to provide its advice and consent. The Drafters of the \nConstitution knew how to provide for supermajorities when they wanted \nto. The very same clause in the Constitution that gives the President \nthe appointment power--the clause from which I just quoted--also \nprovides for consortium of treaties, which is two-thirds. Same \nparagraph. Legislation and other things require a simple majority.\n  My friend the Republican leader has made my point. He talks about all \nthe votes--97-0, 100-0, 98-0. That is the whole point. It takes months \nand months and sometimes years to get to where we can vote. They stall \neverything they can, and they have done that. That is the whole point. \nIt was supposed to only be under extraordinary circumstances, and I \nwent into some detail to explain that. Is this extraordinary \ncircumstances? Of course not.\n  He talks about Richard Cordray and how they just want a little tweak \nin the law. Here is the tweak in the law they wanted: Dodd-Frank knew \nwe would have trouble with the appropriations process because the \nRepublicans don't let us do much appropriating at all. So in the wisdom \nof the people who drafted Dodd-Frank, they said: We are going to make \nsure the position that Cordray is talking about always has the \nresources to do what they want to do. So they did something unique and \nsaid the money will come from the Federal Reserve. The little tweak the \nRepublicans want to do is to switch that and give it to the \nAppropriations Committees. They won't let us do appropriation bills. \nThat is like giving us nothing.\n  My friend went into great detail about the NLRB. For the entire \nhistory of this country, the President has had the power to recess-\nappoint people. The Republicans have found a gimmick here that now they \nare saying--no one has raised any objection about the qualifications of \nthe people the D.C. Circuit said shouldn't be sitting there. No one \nraised anything about their qualifications. If there were an effort to \navoid what is going on around here, they should approve these people.\n  The other Alice-in-Wonderland statement made by my friend is: The \nmajority leader can set votes whenever he wants. Oh, don't I wish. \nStall and obstruct is what we have around here. It is very hard to \nschedule votes. As has been indicated by me a few minutes ago, we wait \nand we wait, and finally we get a vote after months and months--and I \nindicated sometimes years--and then it is a big and overwhelmingly \npositive vote. Yes, because there is nothing wrong with the person to \nbegin with.\n  As I said early on: He makes my case. There isn't a single word that \nhas been said here today about the qualifications of the three people \nwho are seeking to go on the NLRB--or the two Republicans. He has not \nproduced any facts to question their abilities. He just argues that the \nPresident's timing was not quite right.\n  I think everyone realizes that when you are trying to get somebody \nconfirmed, such as Richard Cordray, and you are waiting 725 days, maybe \nthat is a little too long.\n  Listen to this biggy here: The Principal Deputy Under Secretary of \nDefense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics--that may sound like \na big fancy word, but that is an extremely important position in the \nSecretary of Defense's office--has been waiting 300 days. The Governor \nfor the International Monetary Fund, Jack Lew, our present Secretary of \nTreasury, has been waiting 169 days. It is now probably 172, I guess, \nsince this could be old; the EPA, 128 days; Secretary of Labor, 114 \ndays; NLRB, 573 days; the Chairman of the Export-Import Bank, 111 days; \nAssociate Attorney General, 294 days; Chemical Safety and Hazard \nInvestigation--shouldn't we have something going there? Well, they \ndon't believe in the program so we have been waiting now for 295 days \nto even have a vote on that.\n  Remember, he said I can schedule a vote whenever I want. I wish that \nwere true.\n  Member of the Board of Directors for the Tennessee Valley Authority, \n292 days; Commissioner of the Rehabilitation Services Administration, \n156 days. The average of those few people I mentioned comes to 260 \ndays.\n  I presented my case. The case is: This is not working. For the \nRepublicans to come here today and say: Well, that is fine, we will \ngive you Cordray, all we want you to do is change things so the man \nnever has any money to do his job doesn't sound like a very good deal \nto me. There has been no answer to these periods of times when we \nwaited and waited, and finally we get somebody approved by an \noverwhelming margin. Why? Because all they are doing is stalling.\n  I used to do a little work in the courts and I would have a jury. I \nwould appeal to the jury to make a decision. The jury I am appealing to \nright now is the American people. They know the Senate as it used to \nwork. Our approval rating is in the swamps, and we need to do something \nto change that. Will this change everything? No. But remember: Since \n1977, the rules of the Senate have been changed a couple of times a \nyear in this body. My friend the Republican leader said previously that \nthat is okay; that is what the majority could do.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on the issue of delay, there are 148 \nnominations in committees. The majority leader's party controls the \ncommittees. They can come out at any point. On the calendar of business \non the floor 21 nominees are pending.\n  The majority leader, I am sure, will remind everybody he always gets \nthe last word so I am sure he will speak again. But I would remind \neverybody of the core point here: He gave his word without equivocation \nback in January of this year that we had settled the issue of rules for \nthe Senate for this Congress. That was in the wake of a bipartisan \nagreement to pass two rule changes and to pass two standing orders. So \nat the core of this is the majority leader's word to his colleagues and \nthe Senate as to what the rules would be for this Congress. He gave his \nword, and now he appears to be on the verge of breaking his word.\n  Secondly, the only nominees--let's make sure we understand this--\nlikely to have a problem getting cloture are the ones who were \nunconstitutionally appointed, according to the Federal Court in the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  So where we are is the majority leader wants to fundamentally change \nthe Senate after breaking his word in order to jam through three \nnominees the Federal Courts have said were unconstitutionally \nappointed. That is where we are.\n  I think it is a sad day for the Senate. I hope the majority leader \nwill reconsider what I consider to be a highly irresponsible action on \nhis part.\n  Is the Senator from Tennessee going to pose a question to me or to \nthe majority leader?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I will wait until the majority leader finishes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. My friend the Republican leader continues to ignore his \nwords, that he would process nominations consistent with the norms and \ntraditions of the Senate. Please. That is just ignored by him? If \nanyone thinks since the first of this year that the norms and \ntraditions of the Senate have been followed by the Republican leader, \nthey are living in gaga land.\n  The Republican leader agreed that we should not have filibusters \nexcept in the case of an extraordinary circumstance. He agreed with \nthat, but he ignores that.\n  I think it is also worth talking a little bit here about how the \nRepublican leader complains that people just don't like Congress. Well, \nthere is a reason for that, and the Republican caucus deserves most of \nthe blame. The Gallup organization polled Americans last\n\n[[Page S5631]]\n\nmonth and asked for some of the reasons why people disapprove of \nCongress. The two top reasons outdistance all others. They don't like \nCongress because of gridlock and not getting anything done. Is that our \nfault? No.\n  Surveying the years that President Obama has been in office, one can \nsee time after time when Democrats reached out to Republicans to get \nthings done, and no one can see where they have done that. One can see \nthat time after time the Republican leader has pressured his colleagues \nnot to work with us.\n  There is no reason Congress should be held in such low regard. We \nshould clear the calendar. They are not going to do that. They are \ngoing to continue this process over the next 3\\1/2\\ years, badgering, \nsaying: We are really good. We got this nomination done, and we \napproved it 98 to 0--after waiting months.\n  It is the first time ever in the history of this country that the \nSecretary of Defense has been filibustered.\n  So I appeal to my friends on the other side of the aisle, remember \nthe words I read from Senator McConnell where he said a simple majority \nhas the right to do this. And we know that is true.\n  Mr. WICKER. Would the distinguished majority leader yield for 30 \nseconds?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. WICKER. I would ask the majority leader, in an hour or so \nDemocrats are going to have lunch with Democrats, and Republicans are \ngoing to go to another room and have lunch with Republicans and talk to \neach other about what the other side is doing. This is such a serious \nmatter. It may be the wise thing to do. I totally disagree. But I think \nthe majority leader will agree that this is a watershed moment.\n  Could it be that early next week, just once we could all meet \ntogether, perhaps in the Old Senate Chamber--every Democrat and every \nRepublican--for a caucus where actually Republicans listen to Democrats \nas to what they perceive as the grievances and rank-and-file Democrats \nlisten to our side?\n  People are off in classified briefings right now. People are in \ncommittee meetings. People are doing the work of the Senate whether the \npublic realizes it or not.\n  We are not listening to each other as rank-and-file Members. I would \nimplore the leadership of this body, next Tuesday let's clear the Old \nSenate Chamber and get every Republican and every Democrat who wants to \nbe there and actually quit talking past each other and see if there is \na way for us to avoid this pivotal watershed moment in the history of \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the remarks of my friend from Mississippi. I \nam going to start the process today. I am going to file cloture on a \nbunch of nominations, and those votes will occur next week when we \nschedule them. I would be happy to see if there is a way I can meet \nwith a few Senators. I have already done that with a few Republican \nSenators, and I am happy to see if there is a way of getting us \ntogether. We had a nice caucus together not long ago led by Senator \nMcCain, which was really memorable, but I listened to a bunch of them.\n  I say to my friend, if you are so concerned--and I know you are--\nabout the process, I think you need to take a look at where you are.\n  About Cordray, I am so tired of hearing this tweaking: All we need is \nto tweak this a little bit and we will let you have it.\n  I repeat, I say to my friend, that the tweak is to take away his \nability to exist. That is not a tweak; that is further obstruction and \ndistraction from what a law we have is meant to do.\n  The NLRB, all the happy-talk I hear here--and I don't say that to \ndisparage anyone--we will be happy to help you with that, but get rid \nof those two people.\n  No one questions their qualifications.\n  And I am happy to hear my friend here suddenly so enthused with that \ncourt decision. The court decision doesn't stop us from doing anything. \nThe court decision is something that says that we can do whatever we \nwant to do. We are a legislative branch of government. We don't have to \nfollow what the Supreme Court does.\n  So without going into any more dialog, I appreciate what my friend \nsays. I think what he needs to do with his caucus--we are going to have \none today--is take a look at NLRB. There are five of them. We have no \nproblem with the two Republicans. Let's get that done. Let's get \nCordray done. Let's get the Secretary of Labor, who has waited such a \nlong time, and we have the Secretary of the EPA.\n  I say to my friend, I don't know why his caucus has such heartburn \nover things dealing with labor. My friend said--I don't know exactly--\nleftwing big labor bosses. We have the Secretary of Labor who is being \nheld up. We have three NLRB people being held up. Let's try to work our \nway through that. I would be happy to listen to any way he thinks we \ncan get through that. If we can't, Tuesday we know what is going to \nhappen.\n  Mr. WICKER. Just to understand, is that a yes on trying to get us \ntogether, as Republicans and Democrats, as early as lunch Tuesday to \nsee if there is some way we can talk about this?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to consider that. I have talked to a number of \nRepublican Senators. One of them called me at home last night. I was \nhappy to take the call. He said: What happens if cloture is invoked on \nthe people you put forward? Well, if that happens, I have no \ncomplaints. I would hope everyone would learn from this process.\n  I think we need to look at what I just said. All you need is six \nRepublicans to agree to do something about NLRB, to do something about \nCordray without taking away his abilities.\n  Are there any appropriators here on the floor? I have been away from \nthe committee for a while. We are not doing much appropriating around \nhere. I know Senator McConnell and I were on the committee together. I \ngave my spot up to Ben Nelson some time ago. I still have seniority \nprotected there.\n  So I am happy for the Senator's suggestion. We will take a look at \nthat. But it is a very simple problem here. We need to get the labor--\nand they are not big bosses. But my culinary workers--70,000 of them in \nLas Vegas alone--who have problems with management, they want to be \nable to gripe to somebody.\n  Mr. WICKER. Would the distinguished leader yield on simply one \nfurther matter?\n  Mr. REID. Sure.\n  Mr. WICKER. Did the majority leader understand, as I did, Leader \nMcConnell saying just a few moments ago that the Secretary of Labor \nnominee is likely to go forward very soon?\n  Mr. REID. That is what he said.\n  Mr. WICKER. And that the EPA Administrator is likely to go forward \nalmost immediately? So we really are down to the three positions where \nthere has been a U.S. appeals court decision, which arguably could be \nviewed as an extraordinary circumstance.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, this is the first time we have dealt \nwith this. As the Senator knows, Senator McConnell is one of those who \nled the charge a number of years ago. I read part of his statement.\n  It would seem to me that it would be appropriate for folks to \nunderstand what I just said. It doesn't take somebody who has been here \nas long as Senator Byrd was.\n  I would also say this. To say to me now: We are going to do \nMcCarthy--well, she has only waited 150 days. We are going to do Perez; \nwe will do him right now. But that is the problem, I say to my friend--\nwe shouldn't be waiting around here for months and months to get a vote \non one of these nominees. That is the whole issue.\n  So I appreciate his consideration. I am going to go now to my office \nand meet a few people. I am happy to answer any questions while I am \nhere on the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. First of all, I know there have been a number of \nconversations, and I appreciate the majority leader allowing me to talk \nwith him recently on the phone. And I know we have an issue here. I \nwould just go back to the question from the Senator from Mississippi.\n  Last night I was on the phone with numbers of Members of high esteem \nin the Senator's caucus, and when I talk with them about this issue, \nthey have no understanding whatsoever about any background. They just \nsay: Look, I am frustrated, so I am going to vote for the nuclear \noption.\n\n[[Page S5632]]\n\n  And I would say, to respond to the Senator from Mississippi, that the \nSenator is right. So we have some things that are coming up here \nmomentarily. It is possible that many of them--maybe all but many of \nthem--will be resolved. But it seems to me, unless we do the thing the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi just mentioned, there is going \nto be a continual gap of knowledge regarding these issues.\n  So I would just say that I think the majority leader knows I do \neverything I can and the senior Senator from Tennessee does everything \nhe can to try to make this place work. We want to solve our Nation's \nproblems.\n  I think if the majority leader will put the actual votes off to at \nleast Wednesday, there may be some resolve. But I really would please \nask that we have that opportunity the Senator asked for so that really \nboth sides--we need to understand the other side's grievances more, and \nI know very respected Members on the Democratic side need to understand \nours. I think that would be very, very helpful, and I really believe it \nwould cause the leadership to be far more productive and worthwhile, \nand the majority leader could come in every morning smiling the way he \nis right now.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, to my friend from Tennessee, from the day he \ngot here he has tried to follow on the mold set by Senator Alexander. \nThey are both conciliators. They like to work things out. We haven't \nbeen able to work too many things out, but they try. No one tries \nharder than they do.\n  I just want to say this: We talk about extreme circumstances. That \nwas the colloquy my friend and I had here on the floor. So to now say \nthe NLRB is extreme circumstances is like somebody setting a house on \nfire and then complaining their house is gone. The extraordinary \ncircumstances have been created by you guys.\n  So I say again to my friends here in the Senate that I would be happy \nto do a joint meeting with the two caucuses but not to come here and \njust throw numbers around. The point is that I want this resolved and I \nwant it resolved one way or the other. I am through.\n  Just to remind everyone, for two Congresses--the last one and this \none--I have gone against the wishes of the vast majority of my caucus \nnot to have done something before. And we did a few things. Most of \nthem were window dressing that hasn't accomplished much of anything on \nthe rules that we changed.\n  So I am happy to have a group of Senators indicate to me how we are \ngoing to get these people I have on the calendar done. This is no \nthreat. I just think that would be the appropriate thing to do. If we \nhave something positive to report in a joint meeting without going back \nto the same stalling, obstruction--I don't need to go over this list of \npeople again. Some have been waiting for years to get something done. I \njust am not going to continue doing that. We have to have something \nmore than my friend coming to the floor and saying: I am not going to \ndo anything unless there are extraordinary circumstances. I think that \nhas been stomped into the ground. So there is name-calling we need to \nstop.\n  I am happy to go to my caucus today and make my case. I am very \nfortunate that I have a pretty good hand on the caucus, and we are \ngoing to go ahead and do what is good for the country. I hope that, as \neveryone knows, the vote will be scheduled anytime we want on Tuesday.\n  Any other questions?\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n\n\n                           Order of Business\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 12:30 p.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees, with Senators permitted to speak for up to \n10 minutes each, with the Republicans controlling the first 30 minutes \nand the majority controlling the second 30 minutes.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                              Nominations\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his \nstatement, for the time he has spent.\n  I was looking at the Executive Calendar. But, first, I have spent \nmost of this week working on the student loan issue, as the majority \nleader knows. And we are coming to an agreement, it looks like, as we \nhave with a number of other things. But I would like to renew to the \nmajority leader the suggestion that we all get together next week and \ntalk this through, as the Senator from Mississippi has suggested. I \nthink it would be a wise thing to do.\n  There are other Senators here who wish to speak, so I will try to be \nsuccinct. Let me address just a few of the points the majority leader \nmade.\n  One reason I think it would be wise for us to get together as \nDemocratic and Republican Senators is what he is saying is different \nfrom the way I read the facts, and one of us has to be wrong about \nthat.\n  For example, have Republicans used the filibuster to deny President \nObama's nominees a position in government? The answer is a fact. I \ninvited the Senate Historian and the Congressional Research Service \nover to my office. I asked them the question. Here is the answer to the \nquestion: In the history of the Senate, no Supreme Court Justice has \never been denied his or her seat by a filibuster. There was a little \nincident with Justice Fortas that Lyndon Johnson engineered, but that \nwas different. So in the cases of the Supreme Court, zero.\n  How many district judges have been denied their seat by filibuster? \nThe answer is zero.\n  How many Cabinet members have been denied their seat by a failed \ncloture vote filibuster? The answer, according to the Senate Historian \nand the Congressional Research Service, is zero.\n  How many circuit judges have been denied their seat by a filibuster? \nThe answer is seven. How did that happen? Democrats, for the first time \nin history, when President George W. Bush came in, blocked five. And we \nsaid: Well, if you are going to change the precedent, then we will \nchange the precedent, so we blocked two. That is what happens around \nhere. But other than that, it is zero.\n  Then the majority leader said there has been some big delay about \nPresident Obama's nominees. These are not throwing statistics around. \nThat is either true or it is not true.\n  Here is what the Washington Post says and the Congressional Research \nService says. The Washington Post, by Al Kamen, on March 18, 2013: \nPresident Obama's second-term Cabinet members are going through the \nSenate at a rate that ``beats the averages of the last three \nadministrations that had second terms.''\n  President Obama is being better treated in terms of his Cabinet \nnominees than the last three Presidents.\n  I asked the Congressional Research Service the same question. They \nsaid: As of June 27--last month--his nominees were still moving, on \naverage, from announcement to confirmation, faster than those of \nPresident George W. Bush, faster than those of President Clinton.\n  Someone in the Democratic caucus needs to hear this. The number of \nCabinet nominees who have been denied a seat by filibuster is zero. \nPresident Obama's Cabinet nominees are moving through the Senate faster \nthan his last three predecessors. That is important information.\n  Now, are there a lot of nominees sitting around for too long a period \nof time? I have the thing we call the Executive Calendar right here. \nSenator McConnell referred to it. I could go through it quickly. I \ncount 24 people on the calendar. The one who has been on there the \nlongest was reported by committee on February 26 of this year. That is \na little over 4 months ago.\n  Let's be very elementary about this. The only way you get on this \ncalendar is to be reported out of committee. The only way you get out \nof committee is for the Democratic majority to vote you on to this \ncalendar. So we can fill this calendar up any time the Democratic \ncommittee majority wants to.\n  Of the people here, there is a brigadier general named Long. The \ncommittee has asked that we hold that. There is Jacob Lew to the \nInternational Monetary Fund. Bring him up. Bring him up. He will be \nconfirmed.\n  Let's go back to that. The only way you get a name to a vote on the \nfloor is if the majority leader brings his name to the floor. Jacob Lew \nhas been\n\n[[Page S5633]]\n\nreported from Committee since April 16. Bring him up.\n  Here is an Air Force person. Here is Ms. McCarthy from Massachusetts. \nShe has been reported from the committee. Bring her up. The Republican \nleader has said she will get cloture. That means she will be confirmed. \nHe said the same thing about the nominee for the Department of Labor. \nHe has been reported since May 16.\n  Mr. President, I am not a very controversial person. I was held up \nfor 88 days by an ill-tempered Democratic Senator, for what I thought \nwas no good reason, relying on article II, section 2 of the \nConstitution's right to advise and consent. President Reagan's nominee \nfor Attorney General Ed Meese was held up for 1 year, and nobody \nthought about changing the rules of the Senate because it used its \nconstitutional authority to advise and consent. Former Senator Rudman \nwas held up by his home State Senator until Rudman withdrew his name, \nand then he ran against that Senator and was elected to the Senate.\n  The advice and consent responsibility of the Senate has gone on since \nthe days this country was founded.\n  If you go down through this list of people, there are only 24 on the \nlist. He could bring them all up. And 24 is not very many.\n  Then it reminds me that right after that are the privileged \nnominations. What are those? Those are the result of our rules changes \nwhich removed a number of people from Presidential confirmation and \ncreated a whole new category for several hundred executive positions so \nthey do not go through a more cumbersome process, and that is working \nvery well.\n  So zero filibusters denying nominations, Cabinet members going \nthrough the Senate more rapidly than the last three Presidents. So what \nis the beef? What is going on? There are only three judges on this \ncalendar, an embarrassingly small number for us to deal with. We could \nclear this calendar in one afternoon. How do we do that? The majority \nleader brings them up--except for three who are illegally appointed.\n  Now, I will not go into a long thing about the three illegally \nappointed, except to say they are illegally appointed.\n  Most of the Founders of this country did not want a king. They \ncreated a system of checks and balances, and they created a Congress, \nand they created an ability for us to restrain an imperial Presidency. \nThat is what this advice and consent is supposed to do, and we should \nexercise that, as former Senator Byrd used to say most eloquently on \nthis floor. It is our opportunity to answer questions. Just because the \nmajority leader seeks to cut off debate does not mean that person is \nbeing denied confirmation.\n  I will give you an example: Secretary Hagel. The majority leader \ntried to cut off debate 2 days after he came to the floor from the \ncommittee. We said: We want a little more time to consider this. We \nwill be glad to vote for him for cloture in 10 days. He went ahead with \nthe cloture vote and called that a filibuster. But Secretary Hagel is \nsitting in his spot as Secretary of Defense today.\n  So you can go down through all of these nominations and really find \nno evidence--no evidence whatsoever. So we need a meeting of the two \ncaucuses to say: What is going on? Why are you seeking to do this?\n  The last thing I would like to say is, it is appropriate from time to \ntime in the case of subcabinet members to use the cloture to deny a \nseat. That has happened seven times. John Bolton was one that the \nDemocrats did to President Bush.\n  As I conclude my remarks, I would like to say this: The majority \nleader said: Well, we have changed the rules 18 times.\n  Never like this. What he is proposing to do is to turn this body into \na place where the majority can do whatever it wants to do. That is like \nthe House of Representatives--so the majority can do whatever it wants \nto do. A freight train can run through the House of Representatives in \n1 day, and it could run through here in 1 day if the Majority leader \ndoes this. This year it might be a Democratic freight train. In a year \nand a half it might be the tea party express. There are a lot of people \non that side of the aisle who might be very unhappy with the agenda \nthat 51 people who have creative imaginations on this side of the aisle \ncould do if they could do anything they wanted to do with 51 votes.\n  I like to read a lot of history. John Meacham's book about Jefferson \nhas a conversation between Jefferson and Adams at the beginning of our \ncountry. They were President and Vice President, I guess, at the time. \nJefferson said to Adams he feared for the future of the Republic if it \ndid not have a Senate. ``[N]o republic could ever last which had not a \nSenate. . . . [T]rusting the popular assembly''--that means the House, \nthat means a majority vote institution--``for the preservation of our \nliberties. . . . [is] the merest chimera''--or illusion--\n``imaginable.''\n  One other distinguished public servant said the same thing in his \nbook in 2007. This is what Harry Reid said in his book when he wrote \nabout the nuclear option. He was talking about the then-majority leader \nSenator Frist. He decided to pursue a rules change that would kill the \nfilibuster for judicial nominations.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I will be through in just a minute. I ask unanimous \nconsent to speak for another minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. So the leader said:\n\n       Senator Frist of Tennessee, who was the Majority Leader, \n     had decided to pursue a rules change that would kill the \n     filibuster for judicial nominations.\n\n  This is Harry Reid writing.\n\n       And once you opened that Pandora's box--\n\n  Said Senator Reid--\n\n       it was just a matter of time before a Senate leader who \n     couldn't get his way on something moved to eliminate the \n     filibuster for regular business as well.\n\n  Senator Reid wrote:\n\n       And that, simply put, would be the end of the United States \n     Senate.\n\n  I do not want Senator Reid to have written on his tombstone he \npresided over the end of the Senate. Yet if he does what he is \nthreatening to do, that would be what he is remembered for in the \nhistory of this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I listened very carefully to the \nmajority leader this morning. What he said was confirming nominees \nshould be the norm, not the exception--confirming nominees should be \nthe norm, not the exception.\n  Well, I would ask, respectfully, that the majority leader take a look \nat actually the record because you cannot ignore the facts.\n  Of the 1,564 nominations that President Obama has sent to the Senate, \nonly 4 have been rejected--4 of 1,564. During the first 2 years of the \nPresident's first term in office--the 111th Congress--the Senate \nconfirmed 9,020 nominees and rejected 1. In the second portion of that \nfirst term--which was the 112th Congress--the Senate confirmed 574 \nnominees and rejected just 2. Now, during the 113th Congress, the \nSenate has confirmed 66 nominees and rejected just 1.\n  In terms of Cabinet nominees--and we heard the majority leader speak \nof that--the Congressional Research Service shows that President \nObama's nominees have waited an average of 51 days. That is shorter \nthan for President George W. Bush and shorter than the time under \nPresident Clinton.\n  When you take a look at judges--and the majority leader talked about \nthat--the Democrats should remember the Senate has already confirmed \nmore judges this year so far than were confirmed in the entire first \nyear of President Bush's second term.\n  When you go over this item by item, detail by detail, what you see is \nthat confirming nominees is the norm, not the exception.\n  It was interesting to listen to the majority leader talk about Don \nBerwick, who was actually nominated to be the head of Health and Human \nServices, Medicare. As the Medicare nominee, what happened? The \nDemocratic chairman of the committee never ever scheduled a hearing. \nThe Democrats are in charge of that nominee. The President made a \nrecess appointment. There was never even a nomination hearing.\n  We go through the years and look at the quotes, and here is Senator \nReid in 2005:\n\n\n[[Page S5634]]\n\n\n       Some in this Chamber want to throw out 214 years of Senate \n     history in the quest for absolute power.\n\n  He said:\n\n       They think they're wiser than our Founding Fathers.\n\n  Senator Reid said:\n\n       I doubt that that's true.\n\n  I think we should all follow that advice. We are not wiser than the \nFounding Fathers. It is not time to throw out the rules.\n  Then, even as majority leader, in 2009, Senator Reid said:\n\n       [T]he nuclear option was the most important issue I've ever \n     worked on in my entire career, because if that had gone \n     forward it would have destroyed the Senate as we know it.\n\n  So there is not a problem with President Obama's nominees being \ntreated fairly and being treated in a timely fashion. There is not a \nproblem with his nominees in terms of not being confirmed--1,560 \nconfirmed, 4 rejected.\n  Senate Democrats should remember--should remember--their prior \ncommitments and abandon this plan before irreparably damaging the \nSenate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              Senate Rules\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, this morning a significant debate began \non the floor of the Senate as to how to make the Senate function within \nthe framework of the Constitution and within the norms and traditions \nof the Senate.\n  Indeed, the Constitution envisioned three coequal branches of \ngovernment, and it provided checks and balances. One of those was that \nwhen the President nominates individuals for executive branch \npositions, Congress could serve as a check. Specifically, the Senate \nwas given that power, to review the qualifications and make sure there \nwas not something outrageous about the nomination, as a check on the \nExecutive.\n  This principle was embedded as a simple majority review. Indeed, in \nthe Constitution, it is in the same paragraph that lays out a \nsupermajority standard for treaties, but retains a simple majority \nstandard for reviewing executive branch nominations.\n  The Senate in recent times has started, however, to use the privilege \nof having your say; that is, everyone should be heard before a decision \nwas made, as a way to change that fundamental principle in the \nConstitution from a simple majority to a supermajority. We can't close \ndebate here in the Senate without a supermajority. Even though no one \nhas anything else to say, that power has been used to prevent a simple \nup-or-down vote.\n  Under this theory of three coequal branches of government, no one \ncould envision that a minority of one Chamber of the legislature could, \nin fact, completely undermine either the executive branch or the \njudicial branch. That certainly was never anticipated. Indeed, the \nreason it was left as a simple majority is that our Founding Fathers \nwho were writing the Constitution had experienced the challenge of what \na supermajority would do. Madison said, regarding the supermajority, \n``The fundamental principle of free government would be reversed.''\n  He said in Federalist Paper No. 22, speaking from the painful \nexperience as a New York representative to the Congress that created \nthe Articles of Confederation, that supermajority rule results in \n``tedious delays; continual negotiation, and intrigue; contemptible \ncompromises of the public good.''\n  Madison was not the only one to observe the deadly nature of \nparalysis to a Congress. In Federalist Paper No. 76, Alexander Hamilton \nlays out the nomination process in great detail. Indeed, he says he has \nkept the nomination power with the President and not the legislative \nbranch to avoid the ``party likings and dislikes, partialities and \nantipathies, attachments and animosities, which are felt by those who \ncompose the assembly.''\n  He then went on to argue the Senate is necessary to vet nominees for \nthe ``intrinsic merit of the candidate'' and continued, ``the \nadvancement of the public service.''\n  Hamilton states that he expects nominees would be rejected only when \nthere were, and I quote, ``special and strong reasons for the \nrefusal.''\n  This principle of oversight to make sure that something that is \noutside the bounds of reason is done by the executive branch has now \nreached a point of deep abuse.\n  Our majority leader came to the floor earlier today, and he laid out \nthe history of how the nomination process has been bent from an \nunrecognizable process that neither Madison nor Hamilton nor any of our \nother Founders could have envisioned, a process that allows this Senate \nto utilize the privilege of having your say on the floor and turn it \ninto a weapon of destruction against the legislative branch and the \njudicial branch.\n  We can take a look at how long it has taken folks to be able from the \nannouncements and their waiting time to get a vote, such as Richard \nCordray, 724 days and counting; Alan Estevez, 292 days; Jack Lew, 169; \nand so on and so forth.\n  The traditional norm of the Senate, a timely up-or-down vote with \nrare exceptions, is certainly missing today.\n  The executive branch is headed by the President, who was elected by \nthe citizens of the United States. In this case President Obama was not \nelected once, he was elected twice. He was elected with a vision, and \npeople expect, the citizens expect, that the President will operate the \nPresidency consistent with implementing that vision and carry out the \nresponsibilities of an executive branch.\n  This cannot be done if the folks necessary to lead different agencies \nor sit on different boards cannot get through the nomination process in \nthis Senate.\n  For those who are passionate about believing in the vision we have, \nthe constitutional vision, the balance of power, the coequal branches \nof government, we must act to remedy the deep abuses we are \nexperiencing today.\n  Let me first emphasize the extensive delays. Executive nominees who \nare ready to be confirmed by the Senate have been pending an average of \n258 days, the better balance of a complete year, more than 8 months \nsince they were first nominated--258 days. This hardly meets the norm \nor the tradition of the Senate of timely consideration. This has been a \nprime cause of the difficulty filling executive branch slots. Not only \ndoes it make the vacancies extend for a long period of time and, \ntherefore, dysfunction in executing the responsibilities of government, \nbut it certainly makes it more difficult to recruit qualified folks who \ndon't want to be held in limbo and procedurally tortured by a minority \nof the Senate in this fashion. This is not new. This did not start this \nyear, but it keeps getting worse.\n\n  In that context, let's go back to January. In January, there were a \nseries of bipartisan modest changes in the rules, and they were \naccompanied by a promise of comity. That is c-o-m-i-t-y, comity. \nSpecifically, the pledge by the Republican leader was this:\n\n       Senate Republicans will continue to work with the majority \n     to process nominations, consistent with the norms and \n     traditions of the Senate.\n\n  What are those norms and traditions? Those are timely consideration, \nup-or-down votes, with rare exception.\n  Let's take a look and see if what has happened over the last 6 months \nis consistent with the norms and traditions of the Senate and let's \nstart first with looking at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. \nOnly weeks after the January pledge, 44 Republican Senators sent a \nletter that said: ``We will not support the consideration of any \nnominee, regardless of party affiliation, to be the CFPB director''--\nFebruary 1, 2013, just days after the Republican leader pledged a \nreturn to the norms and traditions of the Senate.\n  This is not within the norms and traditions of the Senate, even going \nback to our Founders, who pointed out that they were worried about \npartisan, party-affiliated differences and animosities permeating the \nsystem. They laid out a simple nomination-confirmation process about \nthe qualifications of the individual, not about the legitimacy, if\n\n[[Page S5635]]\n\nyou will, of the agency. It is a policy decision. It is a policy that \nhas been passed in this Senate saying the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau is a valuable addition to end practices that are predatory \nfinancial practices.\n  We had a consumer safety group that looks at things such as keeping \nlead out of the paint on children's toys. That is very important, and \nit goes on to monitor the safety of toys and many other aspects.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I ask unanimous consent to speak for an additional 10 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. We indeed in this case are talking about an agency that \nwill protect our families from predatory financial practices. We all \nknow what those are. They are hidden charges on prepaid credit cards. \nThey are exploding interest rates on mortgages, where there is a teaser \nrate for 2 years and then the mortgage zooms up from 4 percent to 9 \npercent, driving defaults. In fact, that was a major factor, not only \nin the loss of homes of millions of families but also a major factor in \nthe meltdown of our economy.\n  What is good for the family, building successful families, is also \ngood for building a successful economy. We had that debate, and we as a \nSenate approved creating this organization. Now we have 44 Senators who \nsay they are going to destroy this agency by blocking a Director from \never being appointed. This is 100 percent outside the norms and \ntradition of the Senate.\n  Of course, that restoration of the norms and traditions was the \npromise made on this floor by the Republican leader just days before \nthis letter was sent.\n  According to the Senate Historian, this is the first time in history \na political party has blocked a nomination of someone because they \ndidn't like the construction of the agency. Let me repeat that. This is \nthe first time in history.\n  A few weeks later we had another first, the first ever filibuster of \na Defense Secretary nominee. The New York Times wrote: ``The first time \nin history that the Senate has required that a nominee for Secretary of \nDefense clear the 60-vote hurdle.''\n  This is the first time in history. The irony, of course, is that the \nnominee was a former Republican colleague of this Chamber, Chuck Hagel. \nCertainly this was out of sync for the norms and traditions of the \nSenate.\n  Then we come to this spring, again, unprecedented delay tactics. A \nRepublican former House Member called the boycotting of Gina McCarthy \n``an unprecedented attempt to slow down the confirmation process and \nundermine the agency.''\n  Is that consistent with the norms and traditions that were promised \nin January? It is not.\n  In fact, I sit on the committee that voted Gina McCarthy out. When we \ntried to have the vote, we were faced with the boycott; that is, a \nquorum was denied because our colleague, Senator Lautenberg, was \nextremely sick and could not attend. Taking advantage of his illness, \nRepublicans decided not to show up and therefore block that nomination \nfrom coming out of the committee. Only when Senator Lautenberg came in, \nin the midst of an extreme illness, did the Republican members attend \nthe committee. This is part of this ongoing process of unprecedented \nobstruction.\n  Real delays involve real hurt. It is not an academic debate. This \nobstruction is having a real impact on people's lives.\n  Let's turn to the National Labor Relations Board. In a few weeks in \nAugust, there will no longer be a quorum of the NLRB. This means for \nthe first time in 78 years there will be no referee in place between \nthe rules for the conduct of employers and employees. That referee \nmakes sure that illegal practices by workers don't occur and illegal \npractices by employers don't occur. We lose that referee in a few weeks \nand that, as Members of this Senate have expressed, is their \ngoal. Again, this is unprecedented--not putting forward a policy debate \nover eliminating the National Labor Relations Board but instead \nundermining it by blocking the ability to hold up-or-down votes on the \nnominees.\n\n  Workers are deeply affected by whether this referee is in place. \nKathleen Von Eitzen, a Panera baker who tried to organize her fellow \nbakers, came to Washington, DC, to talk about how they have been unable \nto get to a final contract and how, in the process, their members have \nbeen cut, in some cases their hours have been cut, and a whole host of \nother retaliatory measures. These are the things you need a referee \nfor--to say that is not acceptable or to judge the evidence as both \nsides present it. That is why we need the NLRB.\n  How about Marcus Hedger, who was fired for taking a friend through \nthe shop floor. It just so happened Marcus was a union leader in his \nshop. He asked permission to escort a friend through the floor and it \nwas granted. Then the employer said: Aha, we got you. We can fire you \nbecause you know you are not allowed, under the rules, to escort a \nfriend through the shop floor.\n  The NLRB ruled quickly, saying this was an extraordinarily flimsy \npretext for firing someone because he happened to be a shop steward, \nand it was during the timeframe of a labor negotiation. The company was \ntrying to send a message. They were trying to say: If you support \nworkers organizing to fight for living wages, you may get fired, and \nhere we have just set an example.\n  It is the NLRB that is the referee that says those sorts of \nunacceptable tactics cannot occur.\n  Back to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It has refunded \nAmericans $425 million in savings by getting rid of credit card tricks \nand traps.\n  I think it is important we fight for the success of our families. \nThese are family values. We should not measure the success of our \nNation by the size of the gross domestic product. We should measure it \nby the success of our families, and eliminating predatory tactics is an \nincredibly important piece of that puzzle that touches millions.\n  What we have seen is this: The pledge made on this floor by our \nRepublican leader in January--the pledge that said we will return to \nthe norms and traditions of the Senate for nominations--has not \noccurred. The Republican leader may indeed have had every good will in \nmaking that pledge, but it requires the cooperation of the entire \ncaucus and that certainly has not occurred and we haven't heard a \nstrong effort to abide by that pledge made in January.\n  So it is time to restore the norms and traditions in the Senate, \nwhere the Senate provides a check on outrageous nominations, but it is \na check, not a form of paralysis. It is advise and consent, not \nparalyze or veto.\n  For those who love democracy, it has been sad to see this Chamber, \nonce considered the premier deliberative body in the world, fall into \nsuch a State of paralysis and dysfunction. It is up to us, as Members \nof this body, to come forward and say that is absolutely unacceptable.\n  That is the debate that was started today. I applaud the majority \nleader who in January of 2011 strived to resolve this dysfunction \nthrough a gentleman's agreement, but within weeks that gentleman's \nagreement was in tatters. I applaud the majority leader for his \ninstinct in January when he sought modest bipartisan rule changes with \nthe promise of comity and a pledge from the Republican leader to return \nto the customs and traditions of the Senate. His instinct was right. We \nshould be able to accomplish these things by restoring the social \ncontract.\n  The leader, Harry Reid, has gone the extra mile and then another \nextra mile in seeking to adopt the social contract that held this body \ntogether, but now what we see is it has not been reciprocated. The \npledges made, the promise of comity, the gentleman's agreement has not \nresulted in material changes in tactics employed on the floor of the \nSenate. So now we have to work to restore the vision of our Founders, \nthe vision of simple majority, with timely up-or-down votes on \nnominations. We owe this to the executive branch, and we certainly owe \nit to our citizens who reelected President Obama.\n  I wish to address one last point; that is, it has been argued what \nthe majority leader is proposing--that we, if necessary, change the \nrule or change the application of the rule in order to make this place \nwork again--is unprecedented.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Senator's time has expired.\n\n[[Page S5636]]\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I have in my hands a document entitled ``The Senate's \nPower to Make Procedural Rules by Majority Vote,'' and this lays out a \nwhole host of viewpoints expressed in 2005 that I think would be \ninteresting reading for my colleagues across the aisle because it was \ntheir document.\n  I also have a long list of cases where every other year, on average, \nwe have changed the application of a rule in order to make the Senate \nfunction in a different way, a better way. So this is far from \nunprecedented.\n  It is time for us, together as Senators, to live up to our \nresponsibility and restore the power to the executive branch to put \ntheir folks in place, operating under our advise and consent in the way \nenvisioned in the Constitution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I come to the floor to \nspeak about the rules issue that has come to a head in the Senate. We \nhave seen unprecedented obstruction by the other side of the aisle. \nThey have continually blocked nominations--and I will get into the \nnumbers--and this is something that has been building since we came in, \nin this Congress. We had a debate about rules, and we didn't do the \nthings we should have done. We should have put in place a talking \nfilibuster. There is no doubt about it. We should have put in other \nrules changes. What has happened is we find ourselves in the situation \nof a tyranny of the minority.\n  What is a tyranny of the minority? The Founders talked about it. The \nFounders saw that if a situation was created where a minority could \nblock the action of the Senate, then the minority would actually be \ngoverning, and that is the situation we have before us. The minority \ngoverns when it comes to nominees, and they have blocked nominees in a \nvery significant way. I can't repeat enough that this is unprecedented \nin the history of the country.\n  The President can't get his team. What is at issue is we have a \nPresident of the United States who had a very big win in the last \nelection. He put himself out there, he campaigned on a number of \nissues, and he won the election. So one would think he can now get his \nteam in place, but he is unable to get his team in place. He tries to \npropose people.\n  For example, in talking about the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau, we have a very qualified attorney general--and I was a former \nattorney general a few years back--a young man the President put \nforward from Ohio who was very well qualified. He has not been able to \nget a vote. He is in an agency that is tremendously important to the \nmiddle class, he is in an agency that is important to consumers, and he \nis able to do things that are very important for consumers across this \nNation when it comes to bank loans, when it comes to safety issues, and \nall across the board. Yet we have a situation where he cannot be sworn \nin and do his job as a full-time appointee for that agency. This is \nabsolutely unprecedented, and we have to tackle this issue.\n  What is happening with the minority side is, if they do not like a \nnominee or they do not like the policies the nominee stands for or they \ndo not like the administration's policies, they prevent the nominee \nfrom taking office at all. In effect, through the minority process that \nis being utilized, they are determining policy.\n\n  That is what the big objection is, and I think we are going to have \nto address this. I am very supportive of Leader Reid coming out and \nsaying we have to address this, we have to deal with this, and I think \nwe are going to deal with it starting today and flowing into the next \nweek or so.\n  It was mentioned here recently that the Republican policy committee \nput out a document entitled ``The Senate's Power to Make Procedural \nRules by Majority Vote.'' I believe that document was put into the \nRecord.\n  Earlier in the debate this document was referred to, and I just want \nto make sure everyone understands it is very clear, in reading this \ndocument, that at the time of April 2005 and in that period, the \nRepublicans were making very strong arguments that we could go forward \nwith rule changes during the middle of a session. They were pointing \nout that Majority Leader Robert Byrd--and we all know Robert Byrd was \none of the Senators in this institution who studied and knew the rules; \nmost people believe Robert Byrd knew the rules better than any Senator \nin the last 100 years--always felt we had the right, under the \nconstitutional option, to make changes that needed to be made.\n  In 1977, 1979, 1980, and 1987, Majority Leader Byrd established \nprecedence that changed Senate procedures during the middle of a \nCongress, and I think that is what we are talking about, something \nalong those lines. This is a critical issue for us as we try to move \nforward and we try to govern.\n  The Democrats have a majority and a big majority, if we consider the \nIndependents who have joined with us, no doubt about it. Yet we cannot \ngovern because of the procedures being utilized today.\n  I wish to highlight a little of this unprecedented Republican \nobstruction. Executive nominees who are ready to be confirmed by the \nSenate have been pending, on average, for 260 days--more than 8 months \nsince they were first nominated. The Senate confirmed only 34 executive \nnominees by the July 4 recess compared to 118 at this point in the Bush \nadministration. There are 184 pending executive nominees.\n  Since President Obama took office, Senate Republicans have \nfilibustered 16 executive nominations and two nominees, including Mr. \nCordray to be the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Board, via \nfilibuster. For the first time ever, Senate Republicans filibustered a \nnomination for the Secretary of Defense. As the New York Times noted, \n``The vote represented the first time in history that the Senate has \nrequired that a nominee for Secretary of Defense clear the 60-vote \nhurdle before a final simple majority vote.''\n  That is the New York Times.\n  Senate Republicans continue to block the nomination of Gina McCarthy \nto be EPA Administrator, claiming she has been unresponsive. Mrs. \nMcCarthy was forced to answer more questions than ever before--more \nthan 1,100 questions--since Senate Republicans boycotted her hearing at \nthe committee I serve on, the Environment and Public Works Committee.\n  Mrs. McCarthy was previously environmental adviser to Mitt Romney. \nShe has very good credentials.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at what she did in New Mexico. Here you \nhave Gina McCarthy. There is a potential for a lawsuit. It is an issue \nthat has to do with air quality in New Mexico. She ended up pulling all \nthe parties together through her Regional Administrator and reached a \ncompromise where we closed down two coal-fired plants and opened in \ntheir place two natural gas-fired plants. It was considered by the \nGovernor, the EPA Regional Administrator, and everybody as a win-win \nfor everyone, and she engineered that from her position at air quality \nthere in the EPA.\n  Another point that should be made about Gina McCarthy is Gina \nMcCarthy is a woman who has already been approved by the Senate. She \nwas approved in a lopsided vote and has been doing her job for 4 years.\n  So what are we doing that they are saying she has to be filibustered, \nshe has to be stopped because they don't like the policies she is going \nto put in place. It is absolutely outrageous what is happening, and we \nneed to rein this in. I agree Senator Reid is headed in the right \ndirection to do this.\n  I applaud Senator Murray for her good work with Senator Reid and the \nleadership team in terms of trying to address how we govern and very \nmuch appreciate how she has tried to shape this issue and tries to \nalways work with the Republicans on this issue. We have tried to work \nthrough these things and haven't been able to.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I appreciate the comments of my \ncolleague from New Mexico. As a former chief executive myself, it is \nremarkable to me that regardless of who is the President of the United \nStates, he or\n\n[[Page S5637]]\n\nshe ought to be able to get their team in place, with appropriate \noversight and review. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be the case in \nthis body.\n  Many of the other debates we have had are important, but in my 4-plus \nyears that I have been here, this supersedes everything else that if we \ncould reach some resolution on, I think might go further than any other \naction in both lowering some of the rhetoric and lancing some of the \nboil of partisanship in the Senate, as well as doing more for the kind \nof job growth that is still so desperately needed. That is getting our \nfiscal house in order, getting our balance sheet in order.\n  We have seen some good news as the economy recovers. We have seen our \nannual deficit numbers go down, although I have to look with somewhat \njaundiced eyes when the press is saying: Hallelujah, this year our \ndeficit may only be $746 billion. That is still not good enough, and \nthe solution set we are looking for is not that far away.\n  I am going to make a couple comments and then ask my colleague, the \nchair of our Budget Committee, to once again make an offer to proceed \nwith regular order, something that is in the backstop of this debate \nabout rules, something our colleagues on the other side of the aisle--\nperhaps appropriately--beat us over the head for 3 years about the fact \nthat we ought to have regular order around the budget.\n  It has now been 110 days since the Senate approved a budget, after a \nmarathon session that went to 5 in the morning--a session that I think \neven our colleagues on the other side who didn't vote for the budget \nwould agree was open and appropriate to rules and everybody got the \nchance to have their say and offer their ideas.\n  Now, for the 16th time, we are going to come and ask our colleagues: \nLet's abide by regular order and go to a budget conference. Let's do \nthe hard work that is necessary to make sure we finish the job of \ngetting the kind of deficit reduction, getting our balance sheet in \norder, that will allow this economy to move forward and, quite \nhonestly, allow us to get back to regular order on issues such as \nappropriations bills and a host of other things. I can't speak for \neveryone, but people in Virginia and I imagine people in Washington \nState--and I see colleagues from New Mexico and Florida--and elsewhere \nare saying: What are you doing? Why can't you get something done?\n  Every day that we remain in this paralyzed state, while it may be \ngreat late-night fodder for comedians about Congress's inability to \nact, at some point this dysfunction erodes the underlying confidence \nthe American people have in our institutions. That is not good for \nAmerican democracy, and it is not good as well for the ability of our \neconomy to recover.\n  One of the things we have seen in press reports and what is starting \nto seep into consciousness is the actions that were set up in \nsequestration; that they don't seem to be as bad as people think. But \nlet's remind ourselves that sequestration was set up to be the \nstupidest option possible, an option so stupid that no rational group \nof people would ever let it come to pass.\n  I have cut budgets as Governor. I have cut budgets in business. There \nis a smart way and a stupid way to cut a budget. We set up a process \nthat was so stupid that no rational group would ever let it happen.\n  One of the reasons why I think our approval rating hovers around 8 \npercent is we didn't come together, we didn't let this budget process \ntake place, and we allowed this sequestration to move forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for the majority has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent for a 5-minute extension.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for the Senator \nfrom Virginia to finish his statement, for me to have 8 minutes of \nmorning business, and then allow our colleagues on the other side to \nrespond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I don't have objection to the time they \nwant to use. What is our order on the time until 12:30?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At 12:30, the Senate will stand in recess.\n  Mr. RUBIO. I ask unanimous consent that after they are done with \ntheir remarks, I have 10 minutes. I may have an objection, and probably \nwill, and would like to speak on that as well. I want to make sure we \ncould have unanimous consent on that. I don't intend to keep us in \nlonger than we need to be.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague.\n\n\n                           Budget Conference\n\n  I just want to point out the fact that we are now starting to see \nfurloughs in the Federal workforce. There is no State in our Nation \nthat is more ground zero, that is getting hit harder than the \nCommonwealth of Virginia with sequestration. There are real people who \nare being hurt.\n  We have talked about some of the numbers, whether it is in Head Start \nor NIH grants, but let me share some of the things I have heard in the \nlast 2 weeks from Virginians.\n  Pat Hickman, who works at the Department of Defense in northern \nVirginia, says: ``I'm tired of hearing, `It's only one day,' and `it's \nonly 20 percent.' ''\n  Pat is now starting to decide, because of these 11 days of furlough, \nwhether she is going to have to start to curtail her contributions to \nher Thrift Savings Plan. Her retirement would be in jeopardy.\n  Another employee whose name didn't come forward said that if you have \nkids in school, during the summertime they are in daycare. This Federal \nemployee spends $2,000 a month for daycare, and they are not getting a \ndiscount on these expenses that are built into their family budget. How \ncould they have planned 1 year out that they were going to get \nfurloughed 11 weeks in a row?\n  Craig Granville, who works down at the shipyard in Portsmouth, says \nthat furloughing for the next 12 weeks will hit their expenses hard. He \nhas a wife who is currently going for treatment for an illness and the \ninsurance company only pays half. They have to decide do they cut back \non the wife's treatment or do they go into their savings.\n  I have letters and comments from Virginian after Virginian urging \nus--begging us--to take off our Democratic and Republican hats and put \nthe interests of our country first and foremost.\n  I know we have lots of differences on how we want to approach and \nbridge this gap. We are never going to get to bridge the gap in our \ndifferences on the debt and deficit and on the budget unless we can get \nto conference and try to work it out.\n  I say in strong support of our Budget chairman, I thank her for the \ngreat work she has done in getting a budget in a fair way, where our \nRepublican colleagues had a chance to raise their objections. I hope \nand pray we will get to that conference so we can get this issue \nresolved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Virginia. \nThere is no one in this body more passionate to do the work to get us \nto a balanced bipartisan deal, to put the budget deficit and the budget \nissues behind us, and to get our country back on track than the Senator \nfrom Virginia. I know he wants to get to a conference committee as \nbadly as I do--not to demand that we only have our position but to work \nwith others to find a bipartisan solution.\n  As he so eloquently stated, it has been more than 100 days now since \nthe Senate did pass a budget, and we have tried now 15 times to take \nthe next step to move to a bipartisan conference with the House. Every \ntime we have asked, we have been blocked by a tea party Republican with \nthe support of the Republican leadership.\n  I understand that for some factions in the Republican Party, \n``compromise'' is a dirty word. That may explain why they have offered \nup excuse after excuse for blocking the regular budget order we are \ntrying to work toward. They refuse to allow a conference before we get \nto a so-called preconference framework. They demand we put \npreconditions on what can be discussed or talked about in a bipartisan \nconference, to claiming that moving to a budget conference--which \nleading Republicans called for just\n\n[[Page S5638]]\n\nmonths ago--was somehow now not regular order, to most recently \nclaiming we need to look at a 30-year budget window before we look at \nthe major problems we have in front of us right now, when we can--and \nmust--do both at the same time.\n  I know there are significant differences between our parties' values \nand our priorities. Some of us--Democrats and Republicans--think this \nis a reason to come together and try to reach a bipartisan deal in a \nbudget conference now. It has been heartening to hear from Senators \nMcCain and Collins and many other Republicans who have chatted with me \nabout why they believe we need to have a formal bipartisan negotiation \nmove on this. Unfortunately, there is a small group of Senators who \nwould prefer to throw up their hands and stall until we reach a crisis, \nwhen they think they can get a better deal.\n  Last week, I was home in my State, similar to most Senators, and I \ntalked to a lot of Americans who don't understand that kind of \napproach. They run their businesses and help their communities and \nsupport their families by compromising every single day. They can't \nafford to wait to reach agreements until the very last minute, because \nwhen that happens, they have to deal with the consequences. But that is \nexactly what my Republican colleagues are doing to thousands of my \nfamilies in the State of Washington. Because Republicans will not allow \nus to come to the table, the automatic cuts from sequestration are \nimpacting everything from children who depend on Head Start to our \nnational security. What is more, many of the same colleagues will try \nto tell you that sequestration is not impacting American families. As \nthe Senator from Virginia just talked about, I can tell you firsthand \nthat the impacts are real.\n\n  For thousands of families in my home State, these become a reality \ntomorrow morning. That is because furloughs for the Department of \nDefense employees begin this week--equivalent to a 20-percent pay cut \nfor 650,000 defense workers nationwide. Bases in my home State of \nWashington are being affected, and the first furlough date at Joint \nBase Lewis-McChord in Washington State is tomorrow. So instead of going \nto work, thousands of workers in my State will go home. The 9/11 call \ncenter and the fire department will be understaffed. Airfields are \ngoing to be shuttered except for emergencies. The military personnel \noffice is closed. The substance abuse center is closed. The Army \nMedical Center is going to close clinics, and even the Wounded Care \nClinic is going to be understaffed.\n  I am reminded of one worker I met last week, Will Silba. Will is a \nformer marine, an amputee. He works now as a fire inspector, and he \ntold me that because of these furloughs he is going to have to get a \nsecond job. He is going to struggle with his mortgage payments.\n  While these furloughs are going to directly impact thousands of \npeople and civilian employees, the leaders at Lewis-McChord have made \nit very clear that the furloughs are going to hurt our soldiers. They \nare going to limit their access to medical care. They are going to cut \nback on the family support programs. They are going to make it tougher \nto find a job when they finish their military careers. Why? Because our \ncolleagues refuse to work together. To me, this is unacceptable.\n  Because some Republicans would like to preserve the harmful cuts from \nsequestration despite these kinds of impacts, we have a $91 billion gap \nbetween the House and the Senate appropriations levels for next year. \nIf we do not resolve that gap, we are headed for another round of \nuncertainty and brinkmanship, another unnecessary burden on our \neconomic recovery and the millions of Americans who are looking for \nwork every day. Some of my Republican colleagues say they are fine with \nthat. In fact, House Republicans are reported, right now, to be busy \nworking on a debt limit ransom note--right now--and so far that ransom \nnote sounds quite a lot like the Ryan budget. As you know, the budget \nwe did pass here in the Senate was very different, but that is exactly \nwhy we have to resolve our differences in conference. That is where we \ncome together in a public fashion and talk about our differences and \nwork out agreements.\n  I believe we have an opportunity, a window of opportunity over the \nnext few weeks to do what Americans across the country have asked us to \ndo--compromise and confront these problems before we head back to our \nhome States for the work period in August. We do not have a lot of \ntime, but I am confident that if those of us who can see working \ntogether as a responsibility rather than a liability come to the table, \nwe can get a fair bipartisan agreement.\n  By the way, I was very discouraged to hear just this week from some \ntea party Republicans--many of the same ones who are now blocking us \ngoing to conference--who are already talking now about shutting down \nthe government in order to defund ObamaCare. Not only do they want to \npush us to a crisis, but they want to do that in order to cut off \nhealth care coverage for 25 million people and reopen that doughnut \nhole we know so much about, causing seniors to pay more for their \nprescriptions, and end preventive care for seniors, and the list goes \non.\n  This is an absurd position. We should not be talking about shutting \ndown the government. I really hope responsible Republicans reject this \napproach and work with us on real solutions, not more political fights. \nMy colleagues and I are going to continue urging the Senate Republican \nleadership to end their tea party-backed strategy of manufacturing \ncrises and allow us to do the work we were sent here to do and go to a \nconference. I urge them to listen not just to Democrats but to many \nMembers of their own party who want to get to a budget conference and \nallow us to get to work to solve the Nation's problems.\n\n\n               Unanimous Consent Request--H. Con. Res. 25\n\n  Today I come to the floor to ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 33, H. Con. Res. 25; that \nthe amendment which is at the desk, the text of S. Con. Res. 8, the \nbudget resolution passed by the Senate, be inserted in lieu thereof; \nthat H. Con. Res. 25, as amended, be agreed to; that the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that the Senate \ninsist on its amendment, request a conference with the House on the \ndisagreeing votes of the two Houses, and the Chair be authorized to \nappointment conferees on the part of the Senate; that following the \nauthorization, two motions to instruct conferees be in order from each \nside: the motion to instruct relative to the debt limit and a motion to \ninstruct relative to taxes and revenues; that there be 2 hours of \ndebate equally divided between the two leaders or their designees prior \nto a vote in relation to the motions; that no amendments be in order to \neither of the motions prior to the votes; and that all the above \noccurring with no intervening action or debate.\n  I ask unanimous consent for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I do not \noppose going to a budget conference with the House. I think I have \nshown, especially in the last week, a willingness and ability to \ncompromise on important issues--one, quite frankly, very unpopular \namong people supportive of my candidacy--in my time here in the Senate \nwhen we dealt with the issue of immigration. My concern is that when \nthis goes to a budget conference with the House, they will negotiate \nthe debt limit--an issue that I believe is so monumental it should be \ndebated on its own merits and by itself.\n  So what I am arguing for is a compromise. Let's go to conference but \nassure everyone here that this is not a conference that is going to \ndeal with the debt limit issue. We need to deal with that issue \nseparately.\n  I ask unanimous consent of the Senator on a compromise. I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senator modify her request so that it not be \nin order for the Senate to consider a conference report that includes \nreconciliation instructions to raise the debt limit.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so modify her request?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I will object, but let me just say \nthis. What the Senator is requesting is that we tell our conferees \nbefore they ever get to the conference committee what they can do on a \nspecific issue. What I offered in my original offer is to have a vote \non that, which is how we do this here. The Senator is requesting not\n\n[[Page S5639]]\n\nthat we have a vote but that we have a demand.\n  I respect the Senator from Florida. He has worked very hard, as he \nstated, on immigration reform. He is working now to try to get the \nHouse to pass that. At some point they will go to conference. What he \nis saying is that when his bill goes to conference, what he wants to do \nis allow any Senator on this floor to make a demand of that conference \ncommittee before they get there--not a vote, not a majority vote, but a \ndemand from a small minority of what is going to be in that conference. \nWe cannot agree with that.\n  What I have offered is a vote on that, which is what we are--a \ndemocracy. You are allowed to vote, and if enough Senators agree with \nthat position, that is what we would direct the conference to do. But \nthis body is not built on a demand from one Senator or a small group of \nSenators on a conference before we go there. We are a democracy.\n  So I again object to his request as he said and renew my request, \nwhich will allow a debate and a vote on that issue he is requesting, as \nhappens in a democracy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to the modification. Is \nthere objection to the original request?\n  Mr. RUBIO. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, let me say at the outset on this debt \nlimit issue that we have been told by everyone here that the debt limit \nis not going to be dealt with; they don't intend to deal with it; that, \nin fact, we have rules in place that prohibit that from happening. So \nif the intent is to say we are not going to deal with the debt limit, \nwhy not just put it in writing? Why not just agree to it? I think it \nraises suspicion that they refuse to take the debt limit off the table \nin writing in a specific motion, even though they told us that is not \nthe case.\n  But I want to raise a couple of points in regard to all this debate \nwe are having. We heard a lot of debate about the impact of the \nsequester on this country. I do not dispute that it will have an \nimpact. In fact, I voted against the deal that actually gave us the \nsequester, and I voted against it because, while I believe deeply we \nneed to constrain spending because we are spending a lot more money \nthan we are taking in, about $1 trillion a year more than we are taking \nin, borrowing about 40 cents of every dollar we spend in the Federal \nGovernment--for the folks visiting here in the gallery, you may be \nshocked to hear that. Every dollar the Federal Government spends, 40 \ncents of it is borrowed. When you borrow it, that means you have to pay \nit back with interest. That is your money. That doesn't come from a \ntree. That is money taxpayers are eventually going to have to come up \nwith. And for the youngsters here, I want you to understand it is \nprimarily going to come from you in the years to come.\n  So the reason I thought the sequester was a bad idea is because that \nsequester is going after things that by and large are not the drivers \nof our debt. The drivers of our debt are certain programs that are \nbuilt in a way that are unsustainable, important programs such as \nMedicare. I believe in Medicare. I support Medicare, as I tell anyone \nwhen they ask me about it. My mother is on Medicare. I don't want to \nsee Medicare hurt or changed for her. But I also recognize that if \nMedicare is going to exist when I retire, we better start making some \nchanges to it for future retirees, people 20 or 30 years from now. That \nis where we should be focusing our reform efforts.\n  We cannot get the other side to agree on any sort of changes. There \nwas an effort in the House last year to try to do something very \nserious about that. They brutally attacked it. There was a reference to \nthe Ryan budget a moment ago. The Ryan budget--I am not saying it was \nperfect, but it was the most serious effort yet in this Congress, in \nthis city, to reform a program that is going bankrupt on its own.\n  I think the only thing worse than the sequester is to raise taxes to \nprevent a sequester because that will hurt job creation in America. The \nonly thing worse than the sequester is not to have any spending \nreductions at all, which leads me to the point that was raised earlier \nsaying that we are not going to agree to a short-term budget unless \nObamaCare is defunded and that we are threatening a crisis by shutting \ndown the government.\n  Let me say that one of the people who said that was me, so let me \naddress that for a moment. Let me tell you what the disaster is. The \nreal disaster is ObamaCare itself. In fact, it is such a disaster that \nthe people who supported it are now delaying implementing portions of \nit. Just last week we were told that one of the key components of the \nlaw requiring that employers provide insurance--they are going to have \nto delay that by a year, conveniently until after the next election.\n  Here is the other thing we found out last week. I know that under \nObamaCare, when you go in and say, I make so much money, you can \nqualify for the government to give you extra money to buy insurance. \nGuess what. They now admitted they have no way of verifying how much \nmoney you really make. Basically, it means people are going to get to \nshow up and say, I only make $20,000 a year, and get their subsidy, \nwith no way to verify the truth about what they make.\n  It is not limited to that. The disaster that is looming with regard \nto ObamaCare impacts every single American. Here is a list of them that \nwas recently produced by the Heritage Foundation. They missed a bunch \nof deadlines.\n\n       Most states resisted Obamacare's call to create insurance \n     exchanges, choosing to let Washington create a federally run \n     exchange instead. However, a Government Accountability Office \n     report noted that ``critical'' activities to create a federal \n     exchange have not been completed and the missed deadlines \n     ``suggest a potential for challenges going forward.''\n\n  That is right--you may have to go on a Federal exchange--including, \nironically enough, the Members of the Congress and their staffs--and \nthe exchange doesn't exist yet. You are going to be expected in a \ncouple of months to sign up for something that doesn't even exist yet. \nThat is one part of the disaster. There are many others.\n\n       The administration announced in April that workers will not \n     be able to choose plans from different health insurers in the \n     small business exchanges next year--a delay that [a liberal \n     blogger] called ``a really bad sign of ObamaCare \n     incompetence.''\n\n  Here is another one, the child-only plans--one of the things people \nwere excited about. There was a drafting error in the law that actually \nled to less access to care for children with preexisting conditions.\n\n       A 2011 report found that in 17 states, insurers are no \n     longer selling child-only health insurance plans, because \n     they fear that individuals will apply for coverage only after \n     being diagnosed with costly illnesses.\n       Basic health plan: DELAYED.\n       This government-run plan for states, created as part of \n     ObamaCare, has also been delayed, prompting one Democrat to \n     criticize the Administration for failing to ``live up'' to \n     the law and implement it as written.\n\n  The early retiree reinsurance--it is broke.\n\n       The $5 billion in funding for this program was intended to \n     last until 2014--but the program's money ran out in 2011, two \n     years ahead of schedule.\n\n  Waivers:\n\n       After the law passed, HHS discovered that some of its new \n     mandates would raise costs so much that employers would drop \n     coverage rather than face skyrocketing premiums. Instead, the \n     Administration announced a series of temporary waivers--and \n     more than half the recipients of those waivers were members \n     of union health insurance plans.\n\n  It goes on and on. This thing is a disaster. I don't care about how \nyou feel about it, there is an insurance crisis in America, let there \nbe no doubt. People are struggling to find access to quality health \ninsurance. We should deal with that, but this approach is a disaster. \nNo matter how you feel about it, it is a disaster. It cannot be \nimplemented in time. You don't think that is looming over our economy?\n  I just left a meeting with an owner of a chain of restaurants. They \nare worried about it. They don't know what to make of it. Why, if you \nask what it is going to look like next year, they don't know. They \ndon't know. We are in July already, folks. We are going to implement \nthis? We are going to force this on our economy? You don't think that \nis a disaster? You don't think in the\n\n[[Page S5640]]\n\nreal world--not in Washington or the think tanks--small- and medium-\nsized businesses and individuals are holding back on investing or \nholding back on making moves? You don't think someone who decided to \nleave their job, take their life's savings, and open a business because \nthey believe so much in their dream--you don't think this uncertainty \nis hurting that from happening? It is.\n\n  You cannot grow your economy unless people are willing to start new \nbusinesses or grow existing businesses, and ObamaCare is keeping that \nfrom happening. That is the disaster.\n  Why would we fund a disaster? Why would we pay for something out of \nthe American taxpayer's wallet we know isn't going to work? When they \ntalk about shutting down the government and how it is going to be a \ndisaster--ObamaCare threatens to shut down our economy. I am telling \nyou this is a disaster. We should not fund it, and we should not have a \ntemporary budget around here that gives money to this thing. It is a \ndisaster, it will not work, and it is going to hurt people.\n  The other thing about this debt limit that I make such a big deal \nabout--let me tell you why. We owe $17 trillion, and that is bad, and \nit is bigger than our economy. Here is the worst part about it: There \nis no plan in place to stop that from continuing to grow. You heard \nright. There is no plan. This budget the Senate passed--I am glad we \npassed a budget--only makes it worse; it doesn't make it better.\n  Where is the urgency? What are we waiting for? This isn't going to \ntake care of itself. We are not going to win the Powerball lottery and \npay this thing off. When is someone going to step up and say it is time \nto solve it?\n  I have been here now 2\\1/2\\ years. If on the day I got elected you \ntold me we would go 2\\1/2\\ years without seriously dealing with this, I \nwouldn't have believed you. I would have said: Look, I know it is going \nto be hard, but we have to do something. We are 2\\1/2\\ years into this, \nand they are saying: We are going to raise the debt limit, and we don't \nwant any conditions. We don't want to deal with anything that fixes it.\n  People say: Well, the debt is something that is far off in the \nfuture. It is off in the future, but it is also happening now. Do you \nthink when people decide to invest money to start a new business or \nexpand an existing business--which is how you create jobs; that is how \njobs are created in the private sector.\n  If you graduated college, went to school, got your degree, and now \nyou can't find a job, I will tell you why you cannot find a job: The \nbusinesses that create those jobs will not create them until all of \nthis is figured out. People do not want to risk their hard-earned and \nsaved money in an economy that is headed for a catastrophe.\n  Look at what is happening in Europe now. Europe has a debt problem. \nYou know how they have had to deal with it? Disruptive changes in \ngovernment and tax increases. If you think that stuff attracts \ninvestment in business, you are out of your mind. There isn't a chamber \nof commerce in the world that tells people: Come to us. Here we have \nhigh taxes and heavy debt that will make those taxes even bigger in the \nfuture.\n  The bottom line is that the debt limit and the fact that we don't \nhave a solution for the debt is also the reason for the crisis. We need \nto begin dealing with this seriously and stop playing games.

Madam President, I want to speak about a subject that is \non the hearts of most of us now as we approach not what is a coming \nconstitutional crisis, but what is already a constitutional crisis \nbecause this body is not functioning as the Constitution intended. The \nminority, under the rules of the Senate, is protected and has been.\n  In the early days of the Senate, there was no cutting off of debate. \nIn the early 1900s, a level, a threshold of 67 was established in order \nto cut off debate. Then, after the abuses of that filibuster \nrequirement to cut off debate in the abuses in the civil rights era, \nindeed, the threshold was lowered to what we have in the Senate rules \ntoday--60. But we are seeing that it is being abused.\n  Under the Constitution we have the checks and balances of the \nseparate branches. But when a President is elected, the President is \nentitled to have the people he wants to advise him to be a part of his \nteam to be confirmed. It has always been the practice under the \nConstitution to have, not a supermajority vote, as is required for \ntreaties, but a simple majority vote in the approval of the \nnominations.\n  The issue in front of us is whether the President will be entitled to \nhave approved by the Senate the people he has put forth to head the \nagencies and the Departments of his administration. That is what has \nbrought us to the constitutional crisis where we are now finding \nourselves ready to act.\n  Congress has failed to put aside political differences to find \ncommonsense solutions not only on the issue of the approval of the \nPresident's appointments, but on so many of our Nation's pressing \nproblems.\n  Let's start out with the charade that we call the sequester. The \nsequester is a meat cleaver approach to budgeting. I daresay in the \nminds of most of the Senators it was never intended to go into effect. \nIt was the meat cleaver hanging over the head, a year and a half ago, \nof the appointed supercommittee that--after the initial $1 trillion of \nspending cuts were made on the budget over a 10-year period, which was \ndone--the supercommittee was to come along and work out deficit \nreduction with a target somewhere around $4 trillion in total.\n  What was to encourage the supercommittee was this meat cleaver \nhanging over their heads, or guillotine hanging over all the heads that \nnobody wanted, which was cuts across the board without regard to \nprograms--across the board in discretionary programs, defense and \nnondefense discretionary programs.\n  Such across-the-board budget cuts, is that the way to go about making \nproper appropriations decisions? Those kinds of meat cleaver approaches \ndo real damage to people's everyday lives. In the long run, the \nsequester is certainly going to hurt our national defense, our national \nsecurity, and our Nation's ability to compete economically with other \ncountries. If we see these kinds of cuts continue in this ideological \nfashion without regard to programs, then we are going to be in serious \ntrouble.\n  We can continue to have both sides of the aisle point fingers at each \nother, but isn't it about time we get rid of this approach to the \nbudget--the sequester--and start talking about how we can get the job \ndone?\n  Well, the ranking member of the Finance Committee is here. He is one \nof my dear personal friends. I believe he is very sincere, along with \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee, to really\n\n[[Page S5641]]\n\ntake on tax reform. Are we happy with the Tax Code we have? Do we think \nit has much too much complication? And couldn't its streamlining--\nparticularly with tax expenditures, which are tax deductions and tax \ncredits, and almost every special interest in the world has their own \nspecial tax expenditure--could we not clear out a lot of them, which \nproduces revenue, and use that revenue in order to lower tax rates and \nalso use some of it to lower the deficit?\n\n  Well, we need to close some of those loopholes, and I am hopeful, \nwith the leadership of Senator Baucus and Senator Hatch, we are going \nto be able to do that. But there are a lot of other things in there.\n  It is no surprise that I have been speaking of subsidies that go to \ncompanies, such as oil companies, that have outlived their usefulness \nthat were given a century ago in the Tax Code as incentives to drill \nfor oil. Do we think oil companies need those financial incentives now? \nWhat about the offshore tax dodges?\n  I think it is also obvious that when you look at the Medicare drug \nprogram, you know the taxpayers of this country, through their \ngovernment, got a break on the cost of prescription drugs that we \nsupply to Medicaid and to the Department of Defense and to the \nVeterans' Administration. But when it comes to if you have been getting \nthat price break on your drugs through Medicaid, but you now turn 65, \nand you get your drugs through Medicare, the U.S. Government does not \nget the break, the discount on the drugs through Medicare. The very \nsame people who were getting them under Medicaid now are getting them \nby Medicare because they passed the threshold of age 65--same drug, \nsame people; the government is paying it--but the government is paying \na much higher price. That could be worth a savings of $150 billion to \nthe U.S. taxpayer over the course of a decade.\n  You do the math on just these few examples I have given in this short \nlittle speech, and it adds up to well over $1 trillion. And that is \njust a starter. There are hundreds of billions of dollars more that \nmight be saved by closing some of these tax loopholes.\n  I think we need to keep in mind that not all tax deductions are bad. \nSome serve very legitimate purposes. But here we are, and we come back \nto the gridlock we are experiencing. We passed a budget resolution in \nthe Budget Committee. It passed out here on the floor of the Senate. \nThe House of Representatives has passed a budget resolution, albeit \nmuch different than ours. The normal process around here is to try to \nwork out our differences and to do it as ladies and gentlemen with \ncomity. But we cannot even get a motion approved in order to go to a \nconference committee to work out the differences between the House and \nthe Senate budget resolutions.\n  So I would continue to plead with our colleagues to allow this to \nmove forward. No less than one of the most stellar Members of this \nbody, Senator McCain, has called for the naming of the conference \ncommittee. My Republican colleague who helps me lead the Aging \nCommittee, Senator Collins, has called for the naming of the conference \ncommittee.\n  So let's do it. Let's end the gridlock on this one little thing. \nLet's compromise. And let's start using some common sense. If we do, \nyou will see a chorus of amens from our fellow countrymen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/11/senate-section/article/S5641-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5641-S5651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, last month I spoke here about the \nconfirmation process and how the majority was committing filibuster \nfraud.\n  The leaders on the other side of the aisle, including the majority \nleader and the majority whip, voted for judicial filibusters more than \n20 times by this point in the previous administration.\n  They succeeded. There were five times as many judicial filibusters at \nthat time during the Bush administration as there have been today. \nLooking at executive branch nominations, those same Democratic leaders \nvoted to filibuster President Bush's nominees to be Assistant Secretary \nof Defense and EPA Administrator, and twice voted to filibuster his \nnominee to be U.N. Ambassador. They must have thought very differently \nthen about whether the President deserves his team. Their actions then \nspoke more loudly than their words do today whether they think all \nnominees do deserve an up-or-down vote.\n  The Senate recently confirmed the Directors of OMB and the CIA, the \nU.S. Trade Representative, the Secretaries of Energy, Interior, \nTreasury, State, Transportation, and Commerce this year by a collective \nvote of 816 to 61. That does not sound like a Senate that is in \njeopardy or trouble. In fact, it does not sound like they even have a \ncase to make to do what they have alleged they are going to do.\n  The Congressional Research Service says the Senate is considering \nPresident Obama's executive nominees faster than during President \nBush's second term, but none of that is good enough for this majority. \nThey not only want more, but it appears they are willing to get it by \nany means necessary.\n  According to media reports, the majority leader is being pushed by \npolitical interests to use a parliamentary gimmick to limit or abolish \nfilibusters. In other words, his political base, especially Big Labor, \nwants him to put short-term partisan politics ahead of the integrity \nand tradition of the Senate itself. If simply saying that is not enough \nto show how dangerous it is, we are in more trouble than I thought.\n  Thomas Jefferson called the Capitol the first temple to the \nsovereignty of the American people. The people established our \nConstitution with its separation of powers. They designed the \nlegislative branch with an action-oriented House and a deliberation-\noriented Senate. We call ours a system of government because it \nincludes all of these parts designed to be different and yet to work \ntogether.\n  Many people bemoan the division and conflict in Congress, the \npartisanship and on and on. Yes, there will be conflict over the \nimportant issues facing our country. Men and women of different \nperspectives, views and ideologies and serving different States serve \nin Congress. But I always thought we should be of one mind about the \nlong-term integrity of the system of our institutions.\n  For more than two centuries, the Senate has been designed to play its \nown particular part in the legislative process. Form follows function, \nthey say. So our rules reflect our role. For more than two centuries \nthe minority has had some basic rights in this body, including the \nright to debate. That right has always annoyed the majority and \nempowered the minority. I know that from experience, as I have been \namong the annoyed, just as today I am among the empowered.\n  The majority knows it too. A decade ago when they were in the \nminority they began for a time using that right to debate to defeat \njudicial nominees who otherwise would have been confirmed. Now back in \nthe majority, they want to ban the very tools they found so useful just \na few years ago. Now that the majority leader is done using the \nopportunity for extended debate, he wants to make sure no one else can \nuse it.\n  Why? For one simple reason. Because they want their way every time. \nThey think they are entitled to it, and if they cannot get it the old-\nfashioned way, by persuading their colleagues and the American people, \nthen they will simply rig the rules.\n  This short-term power grab, however, will cause long-term damage to \nthe Senate and to the system of government of which it is such a vital \npart. Do not think just because they say they are limiting it to the \nexecutive branch appointments, excluding judges, do not think that is \nnot going to lead to all kinds of other obnoxious approaches toward the \nSenate.\n  A little dose of history provides a big dose of clarity for this \ndebate. For more than a century the right to keep debate going belonged \nto each individual Senator. There was no rule at all for ending debate. \nA single Senator could prevent bills from passing by preventing debate \nfrom ending.\n  We have had a rule for ending debate for nearly a century. Today it \nis easier to end a debate than at any time since the turn of the 19th \ncentury--not the 20th century, the 19th century. Not only that, but the \nmajority is using that rule more effectively today to prevent \nfilibusters than the rule has been\n\n[[Page S5642]]\n\nused in the past. It is all there in the public record. When we vote to \nend debate, we prevent a filibuster. A higher percentage of votes to \nend debate has succeeded in recent Congresses than in the past.\n  To top it off, just a few months ago, the Senate overwhelmingly \nadopted two new standing orders and two new standing rules giving the \nmajority even more power considering nominations and legislation. But \nusing the rules to their advantage is not enough for the majority. \nGaining even more power through those new orders and rules is not \nenough. Now the majority threatens to use a parliamentary maneuver to \nweaken or abolish the right to debate itself.\n  But as I said, the Senate rules reflect the Senate's role. Changing \nthose rules, especially in the way the majority is talking about, means \nchanging the Senate's role in our system of government. A few partisan \nvictories simply cannot be enough to justify that.\n  The minority leader has faithfully reminded us of the majority \nleader's past promises not to change the Senate's rules or procedures \nexcept through the process provided for in the rules. On January 27, \n2011, the majority leader said: ``I will oppose any effort in this \nCongress or the next to change the Senate's rules other than through \nthe regular order.'' My question is this: When the majority leader \nsaid: ``I will oppose,'' did he really mean ``I will lead''?\n  The integrity of this institution and the system with which it is a \npart should matter more than the politics of the moment. If our \ncommitment to this institution and to keeping our word no longer \nmatter, we will be breaking the trust of the American people and \nfailing in our duty to them.\n  This must not happen. The Senate is a venerable institution. If the \nmajority continues to go down the road they are going down, it is going \nto be much less venerable, and it is going to be a broken institution. \nKeep in mind, their decision, if they do choose to do this, will work \nagainst them someday.\n  I have to say that I am very concerned because I believe that not \nonly is it wrong, what they are going to do, but it is based upon false \npremises. When the majority leader says we have filibustered hundreds \nof times, that is totally inaccurate, especially when the leader calls \nup a bill and files cloture immediately just to make it look like we \nare filibustering. We are fast moving away from being the most \ndeliberative body in the world to one that is just run by the majority, \nsimilar to the House of Representatives.\n  I hope some of the wiser Senators on the Democratic side will \nprevail. Right now it does not look like they will. But I will tell you \nthis, if we go down the road that the majority leader is talking about, \nthis institution is going to be dramatically changed for the worse.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Utah for his \nthoughtful remarks. I have been trying to think of a way to put in \ncontext what is at stake because the majority leader said in his \nremarks today: We have changed the rules 18 times. True. We have \nchanged the rules a lot. But we are not talking about changing the \nrules of the Senate. We are talking about changing the Senate.\n  That is what the proposal is, changing the Senate from an institution \nthat protects minority rights by requiring 60 votes out of 100 on major \nmatters of importance instead of a majority of votes. You know we grow \nup and we go to first grade and we learn that the majority wins. So we \nget that ingrained in ourselves as we grow up in America. It is a good \nprinciple, the majority wins. It is a way to resolve disputes and work \nthings out.\n  But from the very beginning of our country, our most thoughtful \nobservers and visitors have looked at our country and said: But a \ndemocracy needs some protections for the minority, for the people with \na minority view.\n  I have mentioned on the floor before that I have been reading Jon \nMeacham's book about Thomas Jefferson, about the conversation they had \nafter dinner on February 15, 1798. Jefferson wrote about what Adams \nsaid to him. Adams said:\n\n       No Republic could ever last which had not a Senate. \n     Trusting the popular assembly for the preservation of our \n     liberties is unimaginable.\n\n  ``Trusting a popular assembly for the preservation of our \nliberties.'' What did he mean by that? What he meant by that is that \nthe passions in our country--and they particularly happen that way \ntoday because of the Internet--can suddenly grow very strong. They \nhappened back at that time in France with the French Revolution, where \nthe population got excited and began to behead people in connection \nwith the French Revolution.\n  So popular passions can run strong. Our Founders said: We want a \nHouse of Representatives that reflects those popular passions, which is \nwhy when you go over to the House, they have a Rules Committee. Whoever \nwins the House by one vote gets nine of the seats and whoever loses \ngets four of the seats to make it clear that the party that has four of \nthe seats does not have anything to say about anything, so they can \nbring it up on Monday and pass it on Tuesday.\n  That is what a popular assembly can do. So Adams was saying to \nJefferson: We need another body. We need a Senate that is not so \nresponsive to the popular passions. President Adams and President \nJefferson said at the beginning of our country that they did not \nbelieve a Republic could stand without such a Senate. That is what they \nsaid then. Our most famous visitor to the United States was Alexis de \nTocqueville, a young Frenchman who came in the 1830s.\n  He wrote a book, ``Democracy in America,'' which is probably the best \nbook ever written about democracy in America. He said in this that \nthere are two great dangers he saw in our future democracy. This is \nwhen it was very young. One was Russia. That was a prescient comment. \nBut the other was the tyranny of the majority. That is what de \nTocqueville said.\n  The great danger to our democracy is the tyranny of the majority. \nThat means a majority can run over you with a one-vote margin. What \ndoes that mean today? Let's say you care about abortion rights. Let's \nsay you care about gay rights.\n  Let's say you care about climate change. Let's say you didn't support \nthe war in Iraq, you didn't support the war in Afghanistan. Let's say \nyou don't like government snooping, but the majority does. The majority \nhas a view that is different from your view, so they can run over you--\nin the Senate they can't because they will have to persuade at least \n60. It will take some time to do it, and it doesn't always work. You \nhave to stop and think about any issues.\n  The House can say: No secret ballot in a union election, and they can \npass it in a day. It will come to the Senate, and we will say: Let's \nthink about it. We will think about it even if the Democrats are in \ncharge and they are in favor of no secret ballot in a union election \nbecause we protect the rights of working men and women across the \ncountry who may be in the minority. But we have to stop and think about \nwhether we want to abolish the secret ballot in union elections.\n  What the majority leader is proposing doing next week is not just \nchanging a rule, he is changing this institution so that whoever has a \nmajority of one can do anything they want to do, anytime they want to \ndo it, and can run over any minority. It doesn't make so much \ndifference that you run over a person in the minority in the Senate--\nyou know, we are just individuals. But what about the views we \nrepresent? What about the views of the farmers in North Dakota, \nmountaineers in Tennessee, or the civil rights workers in Alabama? What \nabout the people in the 1970s who opposed the Vietnam war? The \nmajority? The majority ran over it.\n  People who are accustomed to being in the minority know the advantage \nand the importance of having protection of minority rights. They know--\nand they have studied American history--that the chief defender of \nminority rights in the history of our country has been the Senate. This \nis what the majority leader proposes to change. He proposes to make \nthis place like the House, where a freight train can run through it \novernight and change abortion rights, change the war attitude, change \ncivil rights, change environmental policy. One vote can do it. Run the \ntrain through the House. Run the train through the Senate. Today it\n\n[[Page S5643]]\n\nmight be a Democratic train. Tomorrow it might be the tea party \nexpress.\n  Our friends on the other side might wish to think about that. I have \nsome very creative colleagues over here. I will bet they could come up \nwith a pretty good agenda of things we would like to do if we had 51 \nvotes and we could do it anyway.\n  This is not about a rules change. This is about changing the nature \nof a Senate that John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, and \nthe Founders of our country created to be an alternative to a popular \nassembly and that every majority leader in our history has, in the end, \nsupported in this way.\n  We should not take this lightly--especially if you are an American \nperson who has an unpopular view. If you feel as though you are in the \nminority, if you feel that a majority might not agree with you, might \neven run over you, you do not want the Senate to suddenly be a place \nwhere a freight train could run right through it overnight.\n  You may say: Well, we have the President and the White House.\n  You may. You do today. You might not tomorrow. You might not \ntomorrow.\n  When I came to the Senate 10 years ago one party had both the Senate, \nthe House, and the Presidency. What if we were 10 years ago and we \ncould run a freight train through the House, to the Senate, and send it \ndown to President Bush? We might say that no State in the country--\nevery State in the country must have a right-to-work law. We believe in \nright-to-work laws. We might have new rules on public unions. We might \nhave different ideas on abortion. We might have different ideas on \nclimate change. If you are in the minority, you wouldn't be able to \nstop us. You wouldn't even be able to slow us down for a good \nconversation. We could just run right through town.\n  Nearly one-half of this body is in its first term. More than half of \nmy Democratic friends have never been in the minority. I have been in \nthe minority in a variety of ways in my lifetime, and I want some \nprotection--more than just from the popular assembly that might run \nthrough.\n  That is why I said this morning that I hope very much that the \nDemocratic leader will accept the request from those of us on the \nRepublican side for all of us Senators to meet together in the Old \nSenate Chamber where we can meet privately, where we can talk face-to-\nface.\n  We can say: We need to understand how in the world the Democratic \nside could want to change the character of the Senate in this way when \nin 2 years they could be on the other side. What would make you so \nangry that you would want to do that?\n  If you would say to us, you have been filibustering our nominees, we \nwould say to you, I guess you know that none of your nominees have ever \nbeen defeated by filibuster. I guess you know that--except for two \ncircuit judges. And you started that because you did five of ours.\n  You will say: Well, you have been delaying our nominations.\n  We will say: I hope you know that the Congressional Research Service \nand the Washington Post say that President Obama's Cabinet nominees \nhave been moving through the Senate more rapidly than President Bush's \ndid and President Clinton's did in their second terms. I hope you know \nthat.\n  You may say: But you have been holding people up for years.\n  We will reply: I hope you will look at the Executive Calendar.\n  It is on everybody's desk here. This is the list of people who can be \nconfirmed in the Senate. How do they get on the Executive Calendar? \nThey come out of committees. Who controls the committees? Democratic \nmajorities. If there is someone who hasn't been confirmed, put him on \nthe calendar. It is your committee that can do it.\n  Once they get on the calendar, how do they get confirmed? Only one \nperson can manages that schedule--the majority leader. All he has to do \nis say: I move the nomination of Jacob J. Lew, of New York, to be U.S. \nAlternate Governor of the International Monetary Fund. He has been on \nthe calendar since April 16, 2013.\n  You may say: There is an objection to that.\n  We will say: So what? The majority leader can bring it up, and under \nour rules we can ask for a 60-vote vote on Mr. Lew to the International \nMonetary Fund.\n  He is already in the administration, so that probably wouldn't \nhappen, but let's say it did. The majority leader can bring it up on \nMonday. We would vote on Wednesday. He would get 60 votes, and then he \nwould be confirmed. That would take one of the 24 people off of this \nExecutive Calendar.\n\n  You might say: Well, they have been waiting for years.\n  We might say: Wait a minute, I have got it right here. The one who \nhas been waiting the longest came to the floor February 26, 2013. That \nwas 4 months ago. There is no one here who has been waiting longer than \n4 months, who has been here waiting for us to do something about it. \nThe only one who could move somebody off this calendar to a vote is the \nmajority leader sitting right over there, so what are you talking \nabout?\n  This is what we would say to you.\n  You must be angry about something else or you wouldn't be thinking \nabout changing the character of the whole Senate because no one has \nbeen denied their seat by filibuster except a circuit judge, and you \nset the precedent for that. There is no one left to confirm except \nthese nominees for the National Labor Relations Board that President \nObama made unconstitutionally on January 24, 2012.\n  The Republican leader said: You have a Labor Secretary who is \ncontroversial.\n  We all concede that, but the majority leader hasn't moved that we \nhave a vote on him. He has been reported since May; he has been sitting \nhere since May. The majority leader could have been brought him up.\n  There is a lady nominated for the Environmental Protection Agency. \nBring up her nomination. Let's vote on it. There are a couple of other \ncontroversial nominations, but all we have to do is vote--except on \nthese unconstitutional nominees.\n  What do we do about them? Let's make clear what happened to the \nNational Labor Relations Board. In December of 2011 the President sends \nus two nominees to the National Labor Relations Board. This is the way \nit is supposed to happen. Their papers then come over to the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee. Senator Hatch used to chair \nthat. I am on that committee now as a ranking member. Before the papers \nfrom the White House even get to the committee, the President recess-\nappoints them. In other words, he used his power to appoint these \npersons to the NLRB during a recess when the Senate was in session. How \ndo we know it was in session? It was in session, in a pro forma \nsession, which is a device invented by the majority leader, Senator \nReid, when George W. Bush was President to keep President Bush from \nmaking recess appointments.\n  President Bush didn't like that, these 3-day pro forma sessions, but \nhe respected it.\n  He said: Our Founders didn't want a king. They created separation of \npowers. That means checks and balances. I am the President, but I can't \ndo everything. There is Congress over here, and there is a bill of \nrights over here.\n  President Bush said: I don't like what Senator Reid did. He created \nthese pro forma sessions so I can't make a recess appointment, but I \nwill respect that.\n  Senator Reid has a pro forma session when President Obama is in, and \nPresident Obama doesn't respect it and appoints two people. They are \nstill there. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has \nruled that unconstitutional, as has the Third Circuit Court of \nAppeals--two of the highest courts in the land--and they are still \nthere. They are still there making cases unconstitutionally. They have \ndecided 1,031 cases, all of which will be subject to being vacated if \nthe Supreme Court agrees with the Federal courts. We cannot ignore that \nin the Senate if we wish to preserve the principle of checks and \nbalances in the United States.\n  I mentioned at the beginning that I like to read history. I said this \non the Senate floor, and I will read it again and then conclude because \nI know other Senators are here.\n  I was reading Jon Meacham's book about Thomas Jefferson, which I \nmentioned, and John Adams and Jefferson and how changing the Senate, \nnot changing the rules--but if you change\n\n[[Page S5644]]\n\nthe Senate rules in this way, that means that the majority, on any day, \nany year, could come through and do anything it wants do.\n  They might decide: We don't like the gas in North Dakota, or we don't \nlike the corn in Tennessee. So we are going to change the rules so we \ncan have an advantage that 51 of us can do something about.\n  They could do that any day. Do it now; do it then.\n  I mentioned that history. I mentioned de Tocqueville's history. But \nhere is the last piece of history I will mention once more. This is \nchapter 7 of Senator Reid's book in 2007. Chapter 7 is entitled ``The \nNuclear Option.'' I had just come to the Senate. He talks about me in \nthis chapter and gives me some credit for the gang that was formed to \npreserve the Senate at the time when another majority leader was trying \nto change the character of the Senate.\n  I see the distinguished majority leader, so I will defer to his \ncomments. Maybe it is appropriate for me to read them. Senator Reid \nwrote in 2007:\n\n       Peaceable and productive are not two words I would use to \n     describe Washington in 2005.\n       I just couldn't believe that Bill Frist was going to do \n     this.\n       The storm had been gathering all year, and word from \n     conservative columnists and in conservative circles was that \n     Senator Frist of Tennessee, who was the majority leader, had \n     decided to pursue a rules change that would kill the \n     filibuster for judicial nominations.\n\n  This is Senator Reid's book. It is an excellent book, and I \nappreciate being mentioned in it.\n  Senator Reid continues:\n\n       And once you opened that Pandora's box, it was just a \n     matter of time before a Senate leader who couldn't get his \n     way on something moved to eliminate the filibuster for \n     regular business as well. And that, simply put, would be the \n     end of the United States Senate.\n\n  I believe that. I believe it would be. It is not a mere rules change. \nAnytime this body changes its rules in the middle of a session without \nfollowing the 67-vote rules cloture requirement, anytime it does that, \nit doesn't matter what it is for, it could do it again for a matter of \nprecedent. If it does it for judicial nominations, the importance of \nthe change is not whether it is a good idea to have an up-or-down vote \non judicial nominations, the importance of the change is that with 51 \nvotes you can do anything you want at any time. That, in de \nTocqueville's words, in his foresight and his prescience in the 1830s, \ntakes away from the people of the United States their greatest \nprotection of their liberties because it encourages the tyranny of the \nmajority.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I have great respect for the Senator \nfrom Tennessee. He is my friend. We have worked together successfully \nand I hope we will in the future, but I would take exception to his \nconclusions about the current status of the Senate.\n  I have been in the Senate--now my 17th year. I have seen this \ninstitution change dramatically--dramatically--in 17 years. We have \nfaced more gridlock, more wasted time than I ever imagined could occur \nin this great institution. It has become commonplace for us to face \nfilibuster after filibuster after filibuster.\n  People at home who would turn on C-SPAN to watch the Senate Chamber \nwould have to get close to their television screens and look to see if \nthere was any evidence of life on the floor of the Senate. Are those \npeople actually moving? Are they awake? We go on for 30 hours at a time \ndoing nothing around here. Why? Because we are facing a record number \nof filibusters from the other side of the aisle.\n  Time and again, when we have important issues come up, they ground to \na halt for 30-hour periods of time. We are lucky to do one or two \nthings of substance a week. Oh, there are exceptions. A couple weeks \nago we did an immigration bill. I thought it was one of our better \nmoments. But it was a rare moment in the Senate.\n\n  Too often now we are facing filibusters on the President's nominees. \nMake no mistake, President Barack Obama won the election on November 6 \nlast year. Some on the other side of the aisle are in complete denial \nof that reality. Winning that election, this President has a \nresponsibility to lead this Nation. He wants to put together a team to \nlead. He brings the names to the Senate for confirmation, but time and \nagain they are facing filibusters from the Republican side of the \naisle.\n  There is one that even precedes the last election. Richard Cordray, \nwho was Attorney General of the State of Ohio--an extraordinarily \ngifted public servant--was chosen by President Obama to head up the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau. This is the only consumer \nprotection bureau in the Federal Government. It is an important agency. \nWe created it with the Dodd-Frank financial disclosure reform bill. For \nmore than 2 years--more than 2 years--Mr. Cordray's nomination has been \nheld on the floor of the Senate by the Republican minority. That is \nunacceptable and it is fundamentally unfair.\n  No one has ever raised a question about this nominee's competence or \nabout his integrity. Yet they will not approve him because they do not \nlike the notion of a consumer protection agency. That is it. So to stop \nthe agency from functioning they are going to stop this appointment by \nPresident Obama--for 2 years.\n  The National Labor Relations Board sits down in judgment of labor \npractices across America for the safety of our workers, the \norganization of workers. It is an important agency. But in the words of \nformer Senator Dale Bumpers, there are some on the other side of the \naisle who hate the National Labor Relations Board like the Devil hates \nholy water. They do not want to see it exist, but they can't abolish \nit. They know that. So they stop it from having a functioning majority. \nThey stop nominees the President submits to fill the vacancies at the \nNational Labor Relations Board time and time again.\n  The same thing is true when it comes to the Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco, Firearms and Explosives as well. This is an agency opposed by \nmany in the gun lobby. So since the time we have said that agency shall \nbe filled by senatorial appointment, there has never ever been a person \nappointed.\n  It is the approach of those on the other side of the aisle to stop \nagencies from doing their work. This has to come to an end. I don't \nwant to see this happen in the Senate, this confrontation over rules, \nbut I don't want to see the current situation continue either.\n  Earlier this year Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader from \nNevada, met with the Republican leaders, sat down and worked out a \nbipartisan agreement to avoid what we are facing right now. He was \ncriticized by many Democrats who said: Come on, Harry, they are just \nleading you along; they are not going to work with you. You will find \nout, if you don't change the rules of the Senate, you are not going to \nget the job done.\n  But Harry Reid said: I would rather try to do it on a bipartisan \nbasis by agreement. He made that effort, and it didn't work. Today we \nfind ourselves in the situation with key executive appointments being \nstalled and held up.\n  Listen to this: Gina McCarthy was nominated by President Obama to \nhead the Environmental Protection Agency. What is her background? Her \nbackground was serving as head of the EPA in the Commonwealth of \nMassachusetts--the State of the Presiding Officer--under Governor \nRomney. She was Governor Romney's cabinet official for the EPA in \nMassachusetts. She not only has credentials, she is clearly bipartisan \nin her approach. So her name came before the regular Senate process. \nWhat did the other side do? They submitted a few questions for her to \nanswer. No, not just a few, they broke all Senate records. They gave \nher a list of 1,100 questions to answer before they would consider her \nnomination. That is what we are up against--clear tactics to delay and \nstall even good people from serving, holds on nominees that go on \nindefinitely. These sorts of things have to come to an end. If we are \ngoing to end the obstruction in this Senate, if we are going to give to \nthe President the power and the authority to lead this Nation, as he \nwas elected to do, the Senate can no longer stand as a blockade and \nobstruction to that exercise of authority granted to the President by \nthe people of the United States of America. That is what this is about.\n  A number of my Republican colleagues have reached out to me in the\n\n[[Page S5645]]\n\nlast few days saying: Is there a way to avoid this? There is. There is. \nIf we come to the point where we can sit down and work this out \ntogether, resolve these nominees, all the better. It would be a good \nday for the Senate if it could be achieved. But the notion we are going \nto walk away from these Presidential nominees or other key nominees in \nthe future isn't fair. I invite my Republican colleagues to vote no if \nthey disapprove of the President's nominees. That is their right and it \nis their duty. But to stop the Senate from even coming to a vote on \nthese nominees has gone on for way too long.\n  I urge my colleagues to try to find some way to resolve this issue. \nBut if we can't, let's end the obstruction in the Senate and make sure \nthe rules reflect the reality that a President should have the \nexecutive appointments he needs to lead this Nation.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I know we have been talking about the \nnominations process here on the floor and in caucus meetings, but I \nthink it is worth reviewing the facts and comparing President Obama's \nnominees to how nominees of President Clinton and President George W. \nBush have been treated, because I think there is broad \nmisunderstanding. And, of course, when you don't know what the facts \nare--or the facts you truly believe in are wrong--then you are going to \nreach the wrong conclusion.\n  I think a fair look at the facts will demonstrate that President \nObama and his nominees have been treated more than fairly. As a matter \nof fact, 1,560 nominees of President Obama have been confirmed during \nthe 4\\1/2\\ years he has been President, and 4 have been rejected. That \nis not a bad ratio, 1,560 \nto 4.\n  When you start looking at how long it has taken for the President's \nCabinet nominees to be confirmed, President Obama's Cabinet nominees \nhave waited, on average, about 51 days from the time they were \nnominated until the time they were confirmed. For President George W. \nBush it was 52 days, and for President Bill Clinton it was 55 days. So \ncertainly President Obama has nothing to complain about, at least \nrelative to President George W. Bush and President Clinton in terms of \nthe amount of time it has taken for his nominees to be voted on by the \nSenate.\n  As far as judges are concerned, there have been 199 of President \nObama's nominees confirmed to the U.S. District Court; only 2 of them \nhave been defeated. That is a 99-percent success rate, which I think is \npretty good in anybody's book.\n  President Obama has had 28 judges at the district court, circuit \ncourt, and other article III courts, so 28 for President Obama and 10 \nfor President George W. Bush at this same point in their Presidency.\n  Someone once said that facts are stubborn. But if you acknowledge the \nfacts, it is hard for me to understand where this sense of outrage and \nurgency comes from with regard to the President's nominees.\n  Indeed, the renewed sense of urgency of our colleagues across the \naisle to change the longstanding rules of the Senate is based either on \na misunderstanding of the facts or--I am sorry to say--willful \nignorance is the only other alternative.\n  So this is a manufactured crisis with no grounding in objective \nreality. That is about the nicest way I can say it. The facts show that \nPresident Obama's nominees have moved through the Senate at a pace \nquicker than his predecessors.\n  So what about the nominees to the National Labor Relations Board? \nThese are a special case, because the Circuit Court of Appeals in the \nDistrict of Columbia found that the President exceeded his \nconstitutional authority to make an appointment to these NLRB positions \nin a reported opinion from the court. But--this is important--it wasn't \nbecause Congress or the Senate denied the President his choice for \nthese NLRB appointees. In fact, the President nominated them on \nDecember 15, 2011, right before Christmas. So the President nominates \nthem right before Christmas, on December 15, 2011, and the President \nrecess-appointed these same nominees on January 4, 2012.\n  What was so astonishing about that is the paperwork for the \nnominations hadn't even made its way over to the Senate, and the \ncommittee of jurisdiction had not even had an opportunity to have a \nhearing on these nominees. But in spite of that, the President sought \nto circumvent the advice and consent function for the Senate that is \nwritten in the U.S. Constitution and make what he called a recess \nappointment.\n  Another notable fact about that is the President himself decided--not \nthe Senate--when we were in recess, leaving the Court of Appeals, when \nthey reviewed this recess appointment and holding it unconstitutional, \nto say there is no real difference between what the President did in \nterms of determining the Senate was in recess and deciding to do it \nwhile we were breaking for lunch, and held that it was not \nconstitutional. So Senators were not even given a chance to review his \nnominees to the National Labor Relations Board, much less block them.\n  After the court ruled these appointments unconstitutional, the \nPresident renominated them this past February. They were reported out \nof the committee in May, and due to the inaction of the majority \nleader--who is essentially the traffic cop for the Senate floor--they \nhaven't even been put up for a vote by the majority leader.\n  This is another important fact that I think most people don't fully \nappreciate. If I wanted to propose a nominee, I wouldn't have any \nstanding to do so. It is the majority leader of the Senate, \nrepresenting the majority party, who is the one who determines when \nthese nominees will come up for a vote. So to say that somehow it is \nthe minority's fault these individuals haven't been put up for a vote \ncompletely distorts how the Senate operates and is a disingenuous \napproach, to say the least.\n  We should recall that Republicans and Democrats came to a genuine \ncompromise on the matter of nominations at the beginning of this \nCongress and a deal was struck: In exchange for Republican support, the \nmajority leader gave his word here on the Senate floor that he would \nnot attempt to change the Senate rules other than through regular \norder.\n  What that means, as the distinguished Senator from Kansas, the \nranking member of the Rules Committee, knows, is going through the \nRules Committee and coming to the floor, with 67 votes, to change the \nStanding Rules of the U.S. Senate. So the majority leader gave his word \nthat he would not try to invoke the so-called nuclear option--which we \nare now threatened with--but would, rather, seek to change the rules \nthrough the regular order, which would require 67 votes on the Senate \nfloor.\n  As it turns out, Senator Reid is apparently willing to go back on his \nword and is now poised to break the rules of the Senate in order to get \nhis way, in order to change the rules.\n  We have questioned many of our colleagues about, Why would there be \nsuch an extraordinary power grab and breaking of one's word when it \ncomes to how the rules changed, and wondered, what is the rationale for \nthis?\n  When we have gone through the same facts I described earlier, which \nshow President Obama's nominees have been treated at least as fairly--\nor even more fairly, one could argue--than President Clinton and \nPresident George W. Bush, our Democratic colleagues have said, Well, \nthis is a narrow, modest change that would only apply to nominees to \npositions in this administration.\n  That is not the way the Senate works. If you break the rules in order \nto change the rules, in this instance, there is a slippery slope, to \nsay the least, to extend this same practice not only to executive \nnominations but also to Federal judges and to ordinary legislation, \nwhich would allow the tyranny of the majority and deny the minority an \nopportunity to influence ordinary legislation or to make sure its voice \nwas heard when it comes to nominees. So the argument that this is some \nsort of a narrow fix designed to break some imaginary logjam with \nregard to this administration's executive nominees is false.\n\n[[Page S5646]]\n\n  The fact is, if the majority leader goes through with this nuclear \noption, as it is called, he will have set a new precedent in the \nSenate--one that says it is permissible to break the rules of the \nSenate at any point simply to get your own way, if the majority has the \ngumption to do it.\n  I hope the majority leader is aware of the magnitude of this \ndecision. Even more importantly than that, I hope Members of the \nDemocratic caucus understand what this means.\n  I have been here long enough to have been in the majority and the \nminority. I can tell you that being in the majority is a lot more fun. \nBut I can also tell you that majorities and minorities are fleeting. \nThe shoe will be on the other foot. It is simply shortsighted and, I \nbelieve, an abuse of our process to try to jam these nominees through \nbased on some manufactured and imaginary crisis and change the Senate \nas we know it forever.\n  I hope the majority leader understands the consequences will forever \nalter the nature of this institution--and not one based on just the \nrules but based on the relationships that are so important to getting \nanything done here.\n  We all understand the rules are important. But fundamentally, the way \nthe Senate operates--regardless of whether Republican or Democratic, \nregardless of where we come from--is your word is your bond. We have to \nbe able to believe it. No matter what their political differences may \nbe, when colleagues across the aisle give their word, you have to be \nable to depend on it. And if we can't depend on your word and we can't \ndepend on the majority leader's word when he said he won't invoke the \nnuclear option, it forever undermines the important relationship and \nbonds of trust and confidence we should be able to have in this \ninstitution.\n  Just to go over a few other short points:\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, the Senate is \nconsidering President Obama's executive nominations faster than any \nother recent President. I talked about that recently. But here are some \nof the President's Cabinet nominees who have been confirmed recently:\n  The Energy Secretary, confirmed 97-0. The only reason we had to vote \non it is because the majority leader finally decided to put that \nnomination on the floor. It was unanimous, 97-0. Everybody who was here \nvoted in favor of that nomination.\n  The Secretary of Interior was 87-11; Secretary of Treasury, Jack Lew, \n71-26; the Office of Management and Budget, 96-0; Secretary of State \nJohn Kerry was confirmed 94-3--and he was confirmed only 7 days after \nthe Senate got his nomination; the Administrator for the Centers of \nMedicare and Medicaid Services was confirmed 91-7; the Chair of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission was confirmed by voice vote. There \nwasn't even a recorded vote. That is essentially a unanimous decision \nof the Senate; Secretary of Transportation, 100-0; Secretary of \nCommerce, 97-1.\n  It is worth recalling some of the words that were spoken by different \nMembers of the Senate, because this is the kind of thing that will come \nback to haunt you if you flip-flop and take a different position later \non.\n  This is Senator Harry Reid, December 8, 2006:\n\n       As majority leader, I intend to run the Senate with respect \n     for the rules and for the minority rights the rules protect. \n     The Senate was established to make sure that minorities are \n     protected. Majorities can always protect themselves, but \n     minorities cannot. That is what the Senate is all about.\n\n  Then there is the majority whip Senator Durbin. This is April 15, \n2005:\n\n       Those who would attack and destroy the institution of the \n     filibuster are attacking the very force within the Senate \n     that creates compromise and bipartisanship.\n\n  Well, if that is true--and I agree it is true--why in the world would \nany Senator vote to destroy the very force within the Senate that \ncreates compromise and bipartisanship, particularly when we are making \ndecisions here that affect 319 million Americans.\n  Then there is the President of the United States when he was in the \nSenate, April 13, 2005. Then-Senator Barack Obama said:\n\n       If the majority chooses to end the filibuster, if they \n     choose to change the rules and put an end to the democratic \n     debate, then the fighting, the bitterness, and the gridlock \n     will only get worse.\n\n  I realize we are passionate about our positions on the various issues \nthat come before the Senate, and that is entirely appropriate. We all \nhave convictions about these important issues. But this is the only \nplace perhaps left in the country, I believe, where we can actually \ndebate these in an open and responsible way and be held accountable by \nthe people who send us here--in my case, 26 million Texans.\n  But if we are willing to engage in this sort of shifty behavior, if \nwe are willing to break our word in order to get momentary political \nadvantage, then I think the public's confidence in the Senate is going \nto be completely undermined, and we will have lost our effectiveness. \nAlso, perhaps just as significantly, the very bonds of trust that are \nso important in order to get things done around here will have been \nbroken.\n  For what? For a temporary advantage over five or six or seven \nexecutive nominees. I daresay if Senator Reid had put these nominations \non the floor, we would have seen the vast majority of them confirmed a \nlong time ago. The only reason they were not is because he chose not to \ndo so. What he has done is to put them on the floor now, in this period \nof time before the August recess, to create a manufactured crisis so he \ncan then invoke the nuclear option and somehow convince Members of his \nown caucus that they ought to be party to breaking the Senate rules in \norder to gain temporary advantage. It is incredibly shortsighted, and I \nthink it will exacerbate the gridlock and the divisions here rather \nthan help us try to find ways to build consensus and work together in \nthe best interests of the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, thank you for being able to maintain \norder in this very crowded Chamber.\n  It should be a crowded Chamber. It is not. I say it should be because \nthis should be a required debate. As a matter of fact, we should have \nhad the debate.\n  I am the ranking member of the Senate Rules Committee. The \ndistinguished Senator from Texas just pointed out if we went to regular \norder, we would be having a meeting of the Rules Committee, having a \nvery interesting debate, a very educational debate. I think especially \nfor the class of 2010 and the class of 2012 on the majority side, who \ndid not have the advantage of listening to Bob Byrd's lecture to every \nclass that came in, his sermon to every class that came in--we all \nbecame born again to our responsibilities as Senators, seeing the light \nwith only his advantage of being both in the majority and the minority. \nI regret that is not the case. I regret we are not in the Rules \nCommittee.\n  I rise, like the distinguished Senator from Texas and others who have \nspoken about this, our leader, Senator Alexander in particular, giving \nus a real history on what is going on here or what is not going on. We \nare trying to discuss the so-called nuclear option that the majority \nleader reportedly wishes to employ.\n  We are apparently brought to this point as a result of the leader's \nfrustration. I was here when, obviously, he was simply frustrated with \nthe pace of the Senate and how the Senate operates. This really comes \ndown to the NLRB and the appointments to the NLRB and the fact that two \ncourts found these appointments were illegal. That is what our side \nobjects to. It is not especially to the appointments.\n  Apparently, we are going to have a cloture vote on it, and apparently \nthe nuclear gun is cocked and ready to be pulled. There is a country \nwestern song, ``Don't take your guns to town, son. Leave your guns at \nhome.'' Harry, don't take that nuclear gun to this body. Take it back \nto Searchlight, NV. Put it back in its holster if in fact the nuclear \ngun has a holster. That would be my advice.\n  I would say this about the majority leader. I have known him for a \nlong time. We worked together on the Ethics Committee--and I mean we \nworked together. As majority leader I have had a good relationship with \nhim. He has a good sense of humor. Sometimes that doesn't show, but he \nactually does.\n\n[[Page S5647]]\n\n  I remember one time he was conducting a mini-filibuster. I don't \nremember the issue. I was the Acting Presiding Officer. I was listening \nto him talking about how rabbits were eating the cactus in front of his \nhome in Searchlight, NV; whereupon I took the floor and we engaged in \nquite a colloquy about rabbits and cactus and not to sit on cactus. \nThere are a lot of cactus in the world.\n  This is probably the biggest one we are attempting to sit on, and I \njust don't think it is a good idea.\n  The majority leader was a boxer. He was a good one. His hero is \nSmokin' Joe, Smokin' Joe Frazier. So when I talk to him, I call him \nSmokin' Joe. My appeal to him, if he is listening--he probably isn't, \nbut if he reads about this, or if his staff tells him, tell him your \nold friend from the Ethics Committee had some advice. Smokin' Joe used \nto wait until the late rounds. He was in better shape. But he knew when \nto hold them and when to fold them. He was a great champion.\n  We do not need to go down this road. We really don't need to go down \nthis road. Apparently, the majority leader has determined that--and \nthis is my view--he will have to destroy the Senate in order to save \nit.\n  Those are pretty strong words. Those are harsh words, but I intend \nthem to be. We should not be confused about this. By breaking the rules \nto change the rules the majority seeks to destroy what has made the \nSenate great, unique in the history of the world. I am repeating the \nadvice we all got from Senator Byrd, the institutional flame of the \nSenate. Again, every time a new class came in, he would give his sermon \nor his lecture or his advice or his counsel, and we all took it, \nregardless of whether we were Democrat or Republican.\n  The Senate has always been the one place where all Americans could be \nassured they would have a voice. Every American, no matter what State \nthey happened to live in or what political party they belonged to, knew \nthey would be represented here. Kansas, Massachusetts, wherever; they \nknew they would be represented. Minority views were respected. Even if \nyour party was not in power, you still had a voice.\n  Unfortunately, if you pull that trigger on that nuclear gun, the \nmajority will abolish that. If you take that step, that is surely going \nto lead to complete control of this institution by the majority. That \nhas been predicted by virtually everybody who has spoken, and I intend \nto quote a lot of majority leaders and a lot of people in the Senate on \nthe Democratic side who have pointed this out.\n  I know some on the other side, especially those who have never been \nin the minority, will seek to minimize the import of what they are \ndoing. Oh, it is just a small change. They will claim what they are \ntrying to do is very limited, applying only to executive nominations.\n  I wish I had a chart. But if you look at the difference of 68 percent \non civilian nominations that were confirmed in past administrations in \nthe 106th Congress, and you are talking, 68, 72, in that neighborhood, \nand then you move clear up here to the 112th Congress, and President \nObama is 82 percent, 86 percent--what is the deal? Other than being \nupset about the NLRB.\n\n  Make no mistake. The change itself will be less important than the \nmanner in which it is imposed. Let me repeat that. The change itself \nwill be less important than the manner in which it is imposed. If the \nmajority decides to write new rules with a simple majority vote, \nregardless of the issue, ignoring the existing rules that require a \nsupermajority to achieve such a change, it will put us on a path that \nwill surely lead to total control of this body by the majority.\n  As of today there is only one House of Congress where the majority \nhas total control. The majority wishes, apparently, now, there were \ntwo--or there will be two.\n  We do not have to wonder what the Senate will become if they get \ntheir wish. We only need to look to the House of Representatives. We \nwill become the Senior House. I don't know about the Upper House or the \nLower House--perhaps we will be the Upper House--but we will become the \nHouse.\n  I know that doesn't mean much to many of my colleagues who have never \nbeen in the minority or served in the House. I served as an \nadministrative assistant to a wonderful House Member for 12 years and \nwas in the House for 16 years. I have the privilege of now serving my \nthird term in the Senate. I have been in the majority and I have been \nin the minority. The Senator from Texas is surely right, the majority \nis better.\n  Many of you folks who should be here have never served in the House. \nMany of you have never served in the minority. I have done both, as I \nhave indicated. Let me explain what it means to serve in the minority \nin the House to those who have never had this wonderful privilege.\n  In the House, no bill comes to the floor without a rule. The rule \ngoverns the length of debate and the amendments that will be \nconsidered. If you want to even speak on the bill, you have to get the \nbill manager to give you some of the very limited time available under \nthe rule. If there is not enough time, you will not be able to even \nspeak on it.\n  The majority in the House writes the rule, and they decide how much \ntime they will allow. The rule also determines what amendments will be \nconsidered. If the rule does not allow for consideration of your \namendment it will not be considered, it will not be debated, and it \nwill not be voted on. The majority in the House decides what amendments \nwill be considered.\n  If you are a member of the majority, they might allow consideration \nof your amendment--if you are in good standing with the Rules \nCommittee. If you are a member of the minority, you can forget about \ngetting a vote on your amendment. If the majority does not want to \nallow it, it will not happen. As a member of the minority there is \nnothing that you can do about it.\n  I know about this. I remember when I first went to the House Rules \nCommittee under a very determined, aggressive chairman of the Rules \nCommittee. I had an amendment that I thought was well placed, well \ntaken, pertinent. It was on agriculture. It was on something that dealt \nwith the farm bill or agricultural program policy. But I was a \nRepublican. I went in and I thought this amendment would be considered \nunder parliamentary procedure whether it would be germane or not. Guess \nwhat. It was just a rehash of a partisan debate because it was not \nbipartisan. We had a lot of bipartisan support for it.\n  So my amendment was not allowed. Then I figured it out. Charlie \nStenholm was from Texas--well, he still is from Texas and he is still \nactive in the agriculture community. Very active, very respected. \nCharlie wanted the same amendment. So I finally figured out, let \nStenholm introduce my amendment, but don't tell them it is my \namendment.\n  So Stenholm introduced my amendment and then as soon as it was \napproved by the House Rules Committee, then it became the Stenholm-\nRoberts amendment. If it passed, obviously, it became the Roberts-\nStenholm amendment in Kansas and the Stenholm-Roberts amendment in \nTexas, and that is how we got things done. So we had the Stenholm-\nRoberts for quite a few years. I never went into the Rules Committee \nbecause if I did I knew I would lose. Boy, talk about one-party rule.\n  We don't want to do that. Guess what. We had a revolution back in \n1994. I became chairman of the Agriculture Committee. All of a sudden \nthe Stenholm-Roberts amendment became the Roberts-Stenholm amendment, \nand that is how it worked in the House of Representatives.\n  I don't think we want to do that. It is precisely for this reason \nthat many Members of the House choose to run for the Senate. That is \nwhy I did it. The Senate is supposed to be different. Here, if you want \nto be heard on a bill, it will happen. We haven't been living up to \nthat recently, but that is how the place is supposed to work. In the \nSenate the Senator's right to speak is not supposed to depend on the \nwhim of the majority. Now it is on a whim and a prayer. That is why \npeople run for the Senate. That is what has distinguished this body \nfrom the House since we first convened in 1789.\n  The majority, unfortunately, wants to erase that distinction. It \nwants to assure that Members do not have any rights beyond those which \nthe majority is willing to grant.\n  You don't have to take my word for it. The distinguished majority \nleader--\n\n[[Page S5648]]\n\nwhom I affectionately call Smokin' Joe--himself has recognized this. As \nmy colleague, Senator Alexander, from that desk right over there, has \npreviously noted, Senator Reid addressed this topic in his book--how \nappropriate--``The Good Fight,'' from a boxer and now our majority \nleader. Senator Reid wrote about the battle over the nuclear option in \n2005. Things were a little different. This is what he wrote:\n\n       Once you opened that Pandora's box, it was just a matter of \n     time before a Senate leader who couldn't get his way on \n     something moved to eliminate the filibuster for regular \n     business as well. And that, simply put, would be the end of \n     the United States Senate.\n\n  The end of the United States Senate.\n  The distinguished majority leader said:\n\n       It is the genius of the Founders that they conceived the \n     Senate as a solution to the small state/big state problem. \n     And central to that solution was the protection of the rights \n     of the minority. A filibuster is the minority's way of not \n     allowing the majority to shut off debate, and without robust \n     debate, the Senate is crippled.\n\n  Senator Reid went on to say:\n\n       Such a move would transform the body into an institution \n     that looked just like the House of Representatives where \n     everything passes with a simple majority.\n\n  Senator Reid also wrote:\n\n     there will come a time when we will all be gone, and the \n     institutions that we now serve will be run by men and women \n     not yet living, and those institutions will either function \n     well because we've taken care of them, or they will be in \n     disarray and someone else's problem to solve.\n\n  Boy, that is pretty heavy stuff; that is meaningful. That is \nsomething everybody here should consider.\n  He described the nuclear option this way at that time:\n\n       In a fit of partisan fury--\n\n  I am not quite sure we are there yet. I would say it is more of a \npartisan frustration.\n\n     they were trying to blow up the Senate. Senate rules can only \n     be changed by a two-thirds vote of the Senate, or sixty-seven \n     Senators. The Republicans were going to do it illegally with \n     a simple majority, or fifty-one. Vice President Cheney was \n     prepared to overrule the Senate parliamentarian. Future \n     generations be damned.\n\n  Do you think the Senator was upset then? He was upset then a heck of \na lot more than he was this morning. If only the majority leader would \nrecall his own words.\n  The Vice President also recognized the damage this would do. This is \nwhat Vice President Biden said on the floor when he was still a Member \nof this body. This is important stuff. We all know Joe Biden. We are \nall a friend of Joe Biden. He is the Vice President of the United \nStates. When he was a Senator he said something very important:\n\n       Put simply, the nuclear option would transform the Senate \n     from the so-called cooling saucer our Founding Fathers talked \n     about to cool the passions of the day to a pure majoritarian \n     body like a Parliament.\n       Republicans control the Senate, and they have decided they \n     are going to change the rule. At its core, the filibuster is \n     not about stopping a nominee or a bill, it is about \n     compromise and moderation. That is why the Founders put \n     unlimited debate in. When you have to--and I never conducted \n     a filibuster--but if I did, the purpose would be that you \n     have to deal with me as one Senator. It does not mean I get \n     my way. It means you may have to compromise. You may have to \n     see my side of the argument. That is what it is it about, \n     engendering compromise in moderation.\n\n  Joe Biden went on to say:\n\n       If there is one thing I have learned in my years here, once \n     you change the rules and surrender the Senate's institutional \n     power, you never get it back.\n\n  Folks, we are about to break the rules to change the rules.\n  He went on to say:\n\n       The nuclear option abandons America's sense of fair play. \n     It is the one thing this country stands for: Not tilting the \n     playing field on the side of those who control and own the \n     field.\n\n  Then he said to the Republican side of the aisle, which was then in \nthe majority:\n\n       I say to my friends on the Republican side: You may own the \n     field right now, but you won't own it forever. I pray God \n     when the Democrats take back control, we don't make the kind \n     of naked power grab you are doing. But I am afraid you will \n     teach my new colleagues the wrong lessons.\n       We are only in the Senate as temporary custodians of the \n     Senate. The Senate will go on. Mark my words, history will \n     judge this Republican majority harshly, if it makes this \n     catastrophic move.\n\n  I hope the Vice President will listen to his own prayers. We don't \nneed any divine intervention here, but maybe he can share his concerns \nwith the majority leader. It could help us avert a real catastrophe.\n  The majority leader and the Vice President are not the only people \nwho recognize the damage that would be done by triggering the so-called \nnuclear option. Our former Parliamentarian, named Bob Dove--a man whose \nadvice I sought when I had the privilege of being the acting Presiding \nOfficer--and Richard Arenberg, a professor and one-time aide to former \nmajority leader George Mitchell, wrote a book on the subject, \n``Defending the Filibuster.''\n  I know I am quoting a lot, but these are important issues. I hope \nthey stick like a burr under your saddle so they make you stop and \nthink about this. They wrote--\n\n       If a 51-vote majority is empowered to rewrite the Senate's \n     rules, the day will come, as it did in the House of \n     Representatives, when a majority will construct rules that \n     give it near absolute control over amendments and debate. And \n     there is no going back from that. No majority in the House of \n     Representatives has or ever will voluntarily relinquish that \n     power in order to give the minority a greater voice in \n     crafting legislation.\n       Do not be fooled by those who would try to minimize the \n     impact of what the majority is actually contemplating.\n\n  The rule changes themselves are less important than the manner in \nwhich they will be imposed. Once the majority has decided it can set \nthe rules, there is no limit to what the majority might do in the \nfuture. I hope you understand that. There are no constraints. The \nmajority claims these changes are necessary to make the Senate \nfunction. If it decides further changes are needed, it will make them. \nThe minority will have no voice, no say, no power, and that has never \nbeen the case in the Senate.\n\n  Tragically, what the majority contemplates is at once both calamitous \nand totally unnecessary. The filibuster is a product of our \ndysfunction, not the source.\n  I know many Members--and I have harped on this--do not even know what \nit is like to serve in a functioning Senate. They hardly know what it \nis like to operate under regular order where bills are referred to \ncommittee, amended, brought to the floor, debated, amended, and passed.\n  This matter should be before the Rules Committee. We should have a \ncomplete hearing and then bring it to the floor. We averted this at the \nfirst of this year. I know people think the filibuster is to blame for \nthis breakdown, but they are wrong. We don't operate under regular \norder here because the majority leadership doesn't want to. They have \nan agenda. I understand that.\n  They have been trying to operate this place like the House of \nRepresentatives for years. They want to control debate and to control \nthe amendments.\n  I know a little bit about this. When we were talking about the farm \nbill last year, Senator Reid said: We can't do a farm bill in less than \n3 weeks. I said: We will do it in 3 days. Senator Stabenow and I worked \nvery hard to get common agreement on the farm bill, but we did it. We \nneeded regular order. We needed to open it up. We needed to give \nSenators here on our side a chance to at least offer amendments, and we \ndid it. We had 73 amendments. We did it in 2\\1/2\\ days. We had regular \norder and people said: Gee, is this what the Senate used to be all \nabout? And that was the case. So it can work.\n  I know there are folks over there who think the filibuster is to \nblame for this breakdown, but they are wrong. Rather than give up that \ncontrol, they have decided during the past 4 years--with the exception \nof a few bills I have just mentioned--I think they want to make it \nofficial. I think they would rather blow up the Senate rather than let \nit work its will.\n  It will be a tragedy. They think it will save the Senate, but it will \ndestroy it. That threat of destruction may not be obvious to some \ntoday, but it is real. If the nuclear option is deployed, one day it \nwill become clear to all. And when that day comes and people wonder: \nWhat happened to the Senate? When did it die? We will know the answer. \nIt died the day the nuclear option was triggered. That is what nuclear \ndevices do--they destroy. This is not just\n\n[[Page S5649]]\n\na minor shot across the bow to be used only once. This is a mushroom \ncloud over the Capitol.\n  Again, I urge the distinguished majority leader: Don't take your \nnuclear gun to town.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have the remarks by U.S. \nSenator Robert C. Byrd at the orientation of new Senators, December 3, \n1996, printed in the Record.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that Senator Byrd's final speech before \nthe Rules Committee called ``The Filibuster And Its Consequences'' be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Remarks by U.S. Senator Robert C. Byrd at the Orientation of New \n                       Senators, December 3, 1996\n\n       Good afternoon and welcome to the United States Senate \n     Chamber. You are presently occupying what I consider to be \n     ``hallowed ground.'' You will shortly join the ranks of a \n     very select group of individuals who have been honored with \n     the title of United States Senator since 1789 when the Senate \n     first convened. The creator willing, you will be here for at \n     least six years. Make no mistake about it, the office of \n     United States Senator is the highest political calling in the \n     land. The Senate can remove from office Presidents, members \n     of the Federal judiciary, and other Federal officials but \n     only the Senate itself can expel a Senator.\n       Let us listen for a moment to the words of James Madison on \n     the role of the Senate.\n       ``These [reasons for establishing the Senate] were first to \n     protect the people against their rulers: secondly to protect \n     the people against the transient impression into which they \n     themselves might be led. [through their representatives in \n     the lower house] A people deliberating in a temperate moment, \n     and with the experience of other nations before them, on the \n     plan of government most likely to secure their happiness, \n     would first be aware, that those charged with the public \n     happiness, might betray their trust. An obvious precaution \n     against this danger would be to divide the trust between \n     different bodies of men, who might watch and check each \n     other. . . . It would next occur to such a people, that they \n     themselves were liable to temporary errors, through want of \n     information as to their true interest, and that men chosen \n     for a short term, [House members], . . . might err from the \n     same cause. This reflection would naturally suggest that the \n     Government be so constituted, as that one of its branches \n     might have an opportunity of acquiring a competent knowledge \n     of the public interests. Another reflection equally becoming \n     a people on such an occasion, would be that they themselves, \n     as well as a numerous body of Representatives, were liable to \n     err also, from fickleness and passion. A necessary fence \n     against this danger would be to select a portion of \n     enlightened citizens, whose limited number, and firmness \n     might seasonably interpose against impetuous councils, . . \n     .''\n       Ladies and gentlemen, you are shortly to become part of \n     that all important, ``necessary fence,'' which is the United \n     States Senate. Let me give you the words of Vice President \n     Aaron Burr upon his departure from the Senate in 1805. ``This \n     house,'' said he, ``is a sanctuary; a citadel of law, of \n     order, and of liberty; and it is here--it is here, in this \n     exalted refuge; here, if anywhere, will resistance be made to \n     the storms of political phrensy and the silent arts of \n     corruption; and if the Constitution be destined ever to \n     perish by the sacrilegious hand of the demagogue or the \n     usurper, which God avert, its expiring agonies will be \n     witnessed on this floor.'' Gladstone referred to the Senate \n     as ``that remarkable body--the most remarkable of all the \n     inventions of modern politics.''\n       This is a very large class of new Senators. There are \n     fifteen of you. It has been sixteen years since the Senate \n     welcomed a larger group of new members. Since 1980, the \n     average size class of new members has been approximately ten. \n     Your backgrounds vary. Some of you may have served in the \n     Executive Branch. Some may have been staffers here on the \n     Hill. Some of you have never held federal office before. Over \n     half of you have had some service in the House of \n     Representatives.\n       Let us clearly understand one thing. The Constitution's \n     Framers never intended for the Senate to function like the \n     House of Representatives. That fact is immediately apparent \n     when one considers the length of a Senate term and the \n     staggered nature of Senate terms. The Senate was intended to \n     be a continuing body. By subjecting only one-third of the \n     Senate's membership to reelection every two years, the \n     Constitution's Framers ensured that two-thirds of the \n     membership would always carry over from one Congress to the \n     next to give the Senate an enduring stability.\n       The Senate and, therefore, Senators were intended to take \n     the long view and to be able to resist, if need be, the \n     passions of the often intemperate House. Few, if any, upper \n     chambers in the history of the western world have possessed \n     the Senate's absolute right to unlimited debate and to amend \n     or block legislation passed by a lower House.\n       Looking back over a period of 208 years, it becomes obvious \n     that the Senate was intended to be significantly different \n     from the House in other ways as well. The Constitutional \n     Framers gave the Senate the unique executive powers of \n     providing advice and consent to presidential nominations and \n     to treaties, and the sole power to try and to remove \n     impeached officers of the government. In the case of \n     treaties, the Senate, with its longer terms, and its ability \n     to develop expertise through the device of being a continuing \n     body, has often performed invaluable service.\n       I have said that as long as the Senate retains the power to \n     amend and the power of unlimited debate, the liberties of the \n     people will remain secure. The Senate was intended to be a \n     forum for open and free debate and for the protection of \n     political minorities. I have led the majority and I have led \n     the minority, and I can tell you that there is nothing that \n     makes one fully appreciate the Senate's special role as the \n     protector of minority interests like being in the minority. \n     Since the Republican Party was created in 1854, the Senate \n     has changed hands 14 times, so each party has had the \n     opportunity to appreciate first-hand the Senate's role as \n     guardian of minority rights. But, almost from its earliest \n     years the Senate has insisted upon its members' right to \n     virtually unlimited debate.\n       When the Senate reluctantly adopted a cloture rule in 1917, \n     it made the closing of debate very difficult to achieve by \n     requiring a super majority and by permitting extended post-\n     cloture debate. This deference to minority views sharply \n     distinguishes the Senate from the majoritarian House of \n     Representatives. The Framers recognized that a minority can \n     be right and that a majority can be wrong. They recognized \n     that the Senate should be a true deliberative body--a forum \n     in which to slow the passions of the House, hold them up to \n     the light, examine them, and, thru informed debate, educate \n     the public. The Senate is the proverbial saucer intended to \n     cool the cup of coffee from the House. It is the one place in \n     the whole government where the minority is guaranteed a \n     public airing of its views. Woodrow Wilson observed that the \n     Senate's informing function was as important as its \n     legislating function, and now, with televised Senate debate, \n     its informing function plays an even larger and more critical \n     role in the life of our nation.\n       Many a mind has been changed by an impassioned plea from \n     the minority side. Important flaws in otherwise good \n     legislation have been detected by discerning minority members \n     engaged in thorough debate, and important compromise which \n     has worked to the great benefit of our nation has been forged \n     by an intransigent member determined to filibuster until his \n     views were accommodated or at least seriously considered.\n       The Senate is often soundly castigated for its \n     inefficiency, but in fact, it was never intended to be \n     efficient. Its purpose was and is to examine, consider, \n     protect, and to be a totally independent source of wisdom and \n     judgment on the actions of the lower house and on the \n     executive. As such, the Senate is the central pillar of our \n     Constitutional system. I hope that you, as new members will \n     study the Senate in its institutional context because that is \n     the best way to understand your personal role as a United \n     States Senator. Your responsibilities are heavy. Understand \n     them, live up to them, and strive to take the long view as \n     you exercise your duties. This will not always be easy.\n       The pressures on you will, at times, be enormous. You will \n     have to formulate policies, grapple with issues, serve the \n     constituents in your state, and cope with the media. A \n     Senator's attention today is fractured beyond belief. \n     Committee meetings, breaking news, fundraising, all of these \n     will demand your attention, not to mention personal and \n     family responsibilities. But, somehow, amidst all the noise \n     and confusion, you must find the time to reflect, to study, \n     to read, and, especially, to understand the absolutely \n     critically important institutional role of the Senate.\n       May I suggest that you start by carefully reading the \n     Constitution and the Federalist papers. In a few weeks, you \n     will stand on the platform behind me and take an oath to \n     support and defend the Constitution of the United States \n     against all enemies, foreign and domestic; to bear true faith \n     and allegiance to the same; and take this obligation freely, \n     without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and to \n     well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on \n     which you are about to enter: So help you God.\n       Note especially the first 22 words, ``I do solemnly swear \n     that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United \n     States against all enemies foreign and domestic . . .'' In \n     order to live up to that solemn oath, one must clearly \n     understand the deliberately established inherent tensions \n     between the 3 branches, commonly called the checks and \n     balances, and separation of powers which the Framers so \n     carefully crafted. I carry a copy of the Constitution in my \n     shirt pocket. I have studied it carefully, read and reread \n     its articles, marveled at its genius, its beauty, its \n     symmetry, and its meticulous balance, and learned something \n     new each time that I partook of its timeless wisdom. Nothing \n     will help you to fully grasp the Senate's critical role in \n     the balance of powers like a thorough reading of the \n     Constitution and the Federalist papers.\n       Now I would like to turn for a moment to the human side of \n     the Senate, the relationship among Senators, and the way that \n     even that faced of service here is, to a degree, governed by \n     the constitution and the Senate's\n\n[[Page S5650]]\n\n     rules. The requirement for super majority votes in approving \n     treaties, involving cloture, removing impeached federal \n     officers, and overriding vetoes, plus the need for unanimous \n     consent before the Senate can even proceed in many instances, \n     makes bipartisanship and comity necessary if members wish to \n     accomplish much of anything. Realize this. The campaign is \n     over. You are here to be a Senator. Not much happens in this \n     body without cooperation between the two parties.\n       In this now 208-year-old institution, the positions of \n     majority and minority leaders have existed for less than 80 \n     years. Although the positions have evolved significantly \n     within the past half century, still, the only really \n     substantive prerogative the leaders possess is the right of \n     first recognition before any other member of their respective \n     parties who might wish to speak on the Senate Floor.\n       Those of you who have served in the House will now have to \n     forget about such things as the Committee of the Whole, \n     closed rules, and germaneness, except when cloture has been \n     invoked, and become well acquainted with the workings of \n     unanimous consent agreements. Those of you who took the \n     trouble to learn Deschler's Procedure will now need to set \n     that aside and turn in earnest to Riddick's Senate Procedure.\n       Senators can lose the Floor for transgressing the rules. \n     Personal attacks on other members or other blatantly \n     injudicious comments are unacceptable in the Senate. Again to \n     encourage a cooling of passions, and to promote a calm \n     examination of substance, Senators address each other through \n     the Presiding Officer and in the third person. Civility is \n     essential here for pragmatic reasons as well as for public \n     consumption. It is difficult to project the image of a \n     statesmanlike, intelligent, public servant, attempting to \n     inform the public and examine issues, if one is behaving and \n     speaking in a manner more appropriate to a pool room brawl \n     than to United States Senate debate. You will also find that \n     overly zealous attacks on other members or on their states \n     are always extremely counterproductive, and that you will \n     usually be repaid in kind.\n       Let us strive for dignity. When you rise to speak on this \n     Senate Floor, you will be following in the tradition of such \n     men as Calhoun, Clay, and Webster. You will be standing in \n     the place of such Senators as Edmund Ross (KS) and Peter Van \n     Winkle (WEST VIRGINIA), 1868, who voted against their party \n     to save the institution of the presidency during the Andrew \n     Johnson impeachment trial.\n       Debate on the Senate Floor demands thought, careful \n     preparation and some familiarity with Senate Rules if we are \n     to engage in thoughtful and informed debate. Additionally, \n     informed debate helps the American people have a better \n     understanding of the complicated problems which besiege them \n     in their own lives. Simply put, the Senate cannot inform \n     American citizens without extensive debate on those very \n     issues.\n       We were not elected to raise money for our own reelections. \n     We were not elected to see how many press releases or TV \n     appearances we could stack up. We were not elected to set up \n     staff empires by serving on every committee in sight. We need \n     to concentrate, focus, debate, inform, and, I hope, engage \n     the public, and thereby forge consensus and direction. Once \n     we engage each other and the public intellectually, the tough \n     choices will be easier.\n       I thank each of you for your time and attention and I \n     congratulate each of you on your selection to fill a seat in \n     this August body. Service in this body is a supreme honor. It \n     is also a burden and a serious responsibility. Members' lives \n     become open for inspection and are used as examples for other \n     citizens to emulate. A Senator must really be much more than \n     hardworking, much more than conscientious, much more than \n     dutiful. A Senator must reach for noble qualities--honor, \n     total dedication, self-discipline, extreme selflessness, \n     exemplary patriotism, sober judgment, and intellectual \n     honesty. The Senate is more important than any one or all of \n     us--more important than I am; more important than the \n     majority and minority leaders; more important than all 100 of \n     us; more important than all of the 1,843 men and women who \n     have served in this body since 1789. Each of us has a solemn \n     responsibility to remember that, and to remember it often.\n       Let me leave you with the words of the last paragraph of \n     Volume II, of The Senate: 1789-1989: ``Originally consisting \n     of only twenty-two members, the Senate had grown to a \n     membership of ninety-eight by the time I was sworn in as a \n     new senator in January 1959. After two hundred years, it is \n     still the anchor of the Republic, the morning and evening \n     star in the American constitutional constellation. It has had \n     its giants and its little men, its Websters and its Bilbos, \n     its Calhouns and its McCarthys. It has been the stage of high \n     drama, of comedy and of tragedy, and its players have been \n     the great and the near-great, those who think they are great, \n     and those who will never be great. It has weathered the \n     storms of adversity, withstood the barbs of cynics and the \n     attacks of critics, and provided stability and strength to \n     the nation during periods of civil strife and uncertainty, \n     panics and depressions. In war and in peace, it has been the \n     sure refuge and protector of the rights of the states and of \n     a political minority. And, today, the Senate still stands--\n     the great forum of constitutional American liberty!''\n                                  ____\n\n\n     May 19, 2010--Rules Committee Hearing, Senator Byrd's Opening \n           Statement, ``The Filibuster and Its Consequences''\n\n       On September 30, 1788, Pennsylvania became the first state \n     to elect its United States senators, one of whom was William \n     Maclay. In his 1789 journal Senator Maclay wrote, ``I gave my \n     opinion in plain language that the confidence of the people \n     was departing from us, owing to our unreasonable delays. The \n     design of the Virginians and of the South Carolina gentlemen \n     was to talk away the time, so that we could not get the bill \n     passed.''\n       Our Founding Fathers intended the Senate to be a continuing \n     body that allows for open and unlimited debate and the \n     protection of minority rights. Senators have understood this \n     since the Senate first convened. In his notes of the \n     Constitutional Convention on June 26, 1787, James Madison \n     recorded that the ends to be served by the Senate were \n     ``first, to protect the people against their rulers, \n     secondly, to protect the people against the transient \n     impressions into which they themselves might be led . . . \n     They themselves, as well as a numerous body of \n     Representatives, were liable to err also, from fickleness and \n     passion. A necessary fence against this danger would be to \n     select a portion of enlightened citizens, whose limited \n     number, and firmness might seasonably interpose against \n     impetuous councils.'' That ``fence'' was the United States \n     Senate. The right to filibuster anchors this necessary fence. \n     But it is not a right intended to be abused.\n       During this 111th Congress in particular the minority has \n     threatened to filibuster almost every matter proposed for \n     Senate consideration. I find this tactic contrary to each \n     Senator's duty to act in good faith. I share the profound \n     frustration of my constituents and colleagues as we confront \n     this situation. The challenges before our nation are far too \n     grave, and too numerous, for the Senate to be rendered \n     impotent to address them, and yet be derided for inaction by \n     those causing the delay. There are many suggestions as to \n     what we should do. I know what we must not do. We must never, \n     ever, tear down the only wall--the necessary fence--this \n     nation has against the excesses of the Executive Branch and \n     the resultant haste and tyranny of the majority. The path to \n     solving our problem lies in our thoroughly understanding it. \n     Does the difficulty reside in the construct of our rules or \n     in the ease of circumventing them?\n       A true filibuster is a fight, not a threat or a bluff. For \n     most of the Senate's history, Senators motivated to extend \n     debate had to hold the floor as long as they were physically \n     able. The Senate was either persuaded by the strength of \n     their arguments or unconvinced by either their commitment or \n     their stamina. True filibusters were therefore less frequent, \n     and more commonly discouraged, due to every Senator's \n     understanding that such undertakings required grueling \n     personal sacrifice, exhausting preparation, and a willingness \n     to be criticized for disrupting the nation's business.\n       Now, unbelievably, just the whisper of opposition brings \n     the ``world's greatest deliberative body'' to a grinding \n     halt. Why? Because this once highly respected institution has \n     become overwhelmingly consumed by a fixation with money and \n     media. Gone are the days when Senators Richard Russell and \n     Lyndon Johnson, and Speaker Sam Rayburn gathered routinely \n     for working weekends and couldn't wait to get back to their \n     chambers on Monday morning. Now every Senator spends hours \n     every day, throughout the year and every year, raising funds \n     for reelection and appearing before cameras and microphones. \n     Now the Senate often works three-day weeks, with frequent and \n     extended recess periods, so Senators can rush home to \n     fundraisers scheduled months in advance.\n       Forceful confrontation to a threat to filibuster is \n     undoubtedly the antidote to the malady. Most recently, Senate \n     Majority Leader Reid announced that the Senate would stay in \n     session around-the-clock and take all procedural steps \n     necessary to bring financial reform legislation before the \n     Senate. As preparations were made and cots rolled out, a deal \n     was struck within hours and the threat of filibuster was \n     withdrawn.\n       I heartily commend the Majority Leader for this progress, \n     and I strongly caution my colleagues as some propose to alter \n     the rules to severely limit the ability of a minority to \n     conduct a filibuster. I know what it is to be Majority \n     Leader, and wake up on a Wednesday morning in November, and \n     find yourself a Minority Leader.\n       I also know that current Senate Rules provide the means to \n     break a filibuster. I employed them in 1977 to end the post-\n     cloture filibuster of natural gas deregulation legislation. \n     This was the roughest filibuster I have experienced during my \n     fifty-plus years in the Senate, and it produced the most-\n     bitter feelings. Yet some important new precedents were \n     established in dealing with post-cloture obstruction. In \n     1987, I successfully used Rules 7 and 8 to make a non-\n     debatable motion to proceed during the morning hour. No \n     leader has attempted this technique since, but this procedure \n     could be and should be used.\n       Over the years, I have proposed a variety of improvements \n     to Senate Rules to achieve a more sensible balance allowing \n     the majority to function while still protecting minority \n     rights. For example, I have supported eliminating debate on \n     the motion to proceed to a matter (except for changes to \n     Senate rules), or limiting debate to a reasonable\n\n[[Page S5651]]\n\n     time on such motions, with Senators retaining the right to \n     unlimited debate on the matter once before the Senate. I have \n     authored several other proposals in the past, and I look \n     forward to our committee work ahead as we carefully examine \n     other suggested changes. The Committee must, however, \n     jealously guard against efforts to change or reinterpret the \n     Senate rules by a simple majority, circumventing Rule XXII \n     where a two-thirds majority is required.\n       As I have said before, the Senate has been the last \n     fortress of minority rights and freedom of speech in this \n     Republic for more than two centuries. I pray that Senators \n     will pause and reflect before ignoring that history and \n     tradition in favor of the political priority of the moment.\n\n  I urge all Members of this wonderful body to read what Senator Byrd \nsaid and urged and counseled and advised. I know the new Members have \nnot had this experience.\n  When you first went in, you thought, my gosh, how long is this going \nto last? The man wrote a book about the Senate. As it turned out, we \nhung on every word and took his advice, and it is good advice. It is \nprinted in the Record. Read it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the material will be placed \nin the Record.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. We might have a heck of a test on it next week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom Kansas. I am sure he will have to take a call from the Vice \nPresident to discuss his remarks on the floor. I appreciate the way in \nwhich he talked about all that has been said on the floor in the past \nby the Vice President, and President Obama, who was then a Senator, and \nthe leaders here in the Senate. We have had lots of statements on the \nfloor and commitments made in the past. The majority leader has \ncommitted twice on the Senate floor not to use the nuclear option, with \nthe last time being a few months ago. These were not conditional \ncommitments. They were not commitments with caveats. They were not \ncommitments to not violate the rules of the Senate unless it became \nconvenient for political purposes to violate the rules of the Senate.\n  As recently as January 27, 2011, the majority leader said, and I \nquote:\n\n       I agree that the proper ways to change Senate rules is \n     through the procedures established in those rules, and I will \n     oppose any effort in this Congress or the next to change the \n     Senate's rules other than through the regular order.\n\n  Earlier this year, on January 24, 2013, there was a discussion \nbetween the minority leader Senator McConnell and the majority leader \nSenator Reid. Senator McConnell said:\n\n       I will confirm to the majority leader that the Senate would \n     not consider other resolutions relating to any standing order \n     or rules of this Congress unless they went through the \n     regular order process?\n\n  He was posing a question to the majority leader.\n  Majority Leader Reid said:\n\n       That is correct. Any other resolutions related to Senate \n     procedure would be subject to a regular order process, \n     including consideration by the Rules Committee.\n\n  That was January 24, 2013.\n  What has happened since that point that would change the way the \nmajority leader views this issue? Well, let's see. We confirmed the \nSecretary of Energy by a vote of 97-0. We confirmed the Secretary of \nInterior with a vote of 87-11. We confirmed the Secretary of the \nTreasury with a vote of 71-26. We confirmed the Secretary of State 94-\n3. I might add in that case, that vote happened just 7 days after the \nSenate got his nomination. We confirmed the Secretary of Commerce 97-1. \nWe confirmed the Secretary of Transportation 100-0. We confirmed the \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget 96-0. We confirmed the \nAdministrator of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services 91-7. We \nconfirmed the Chair of the Security and Exchange Commission by voice \nvote. In other words, he was confirmed unanimously. Not to mention the \nfact we have passed major legislation out of the Senate. We just \ncompleted a 3-week debate on a major immigration overhaul, and it \npassed with a bipartisan vote. We had a major debate on a farm bill, \nwhich passed with a bipartisan vote. Other legislation has moved \nthrough the Senate in the last few months.\n  So it begs the question: Why are we now having this discussion? The \nmajority leader said back in January he wasn't going to change the \nrules, and to change the rules, you have to break the rules. Let's make \nthat very clear. It takes 67 votes to change the rules of the Senate. \nWhat is being talked about here is basically using a procedural \ndevice--a gimmick, if you will--to be able to change the rules to 51 \nvotes. In other words, breaking the rules to change the rules.\n  There is absolutely no basis and no foundation based on the numbers \nand the facts I just quoted for the majority to be making the argument \nthat they are here today.\n  If you go back and look at the statements that have been made by \nothers in the past--and I remember coming here in 2005 as a new Member \nof the Senate from the House of Representatives. At that point we were \ndebating judicial nominations. The Democrats were holding up several of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominations. There was a big debate about \nwhether to exercise the nuclear option; in other words, to confirm some \nof those with 51 votes.\n  I remember at the time being sympathetic to that. I came from the \nHouse of Representatives. In the House of Representatives we moved \nthings in an orderly fashion. The Rules Committee decided what \nlegislation came to the floor, what amendments were made in order, and \nhow much time was allowed for debate on each amendment. It was a very \nstructured and orderly process. Those of us who got here to the Senate \nwere frustrated at times with the slow pace in the Senate. On some \nlevels it made sense to think: Gee, wouldn't it be great if we could \nmake the Senate function more like the House.\n  Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed because the Senate is not \ndesigned to function like the House. It was created for a very \ndifferent purpose and a very different design. What we are talking \nabout here would completely undermine that purpose and that design for \nthis institution. We have observed traditions, rules, in the Senate for \ndecades. What we are talking about, if the majority has its way, is \ndoing something that would break the rules to change the rules and \nforever change the Senate in a way the majority leader Senator Reid \nmentioned back in 2009; that doing that would ``ruin'' the country and \nthe Senate would be ``destroyed'' if we went about a rules change along \nthe lines of what is being talked about today. So I hope cooler heads \nwill prevail again. I certainly understand now, as I look back on what \nhappened in 2005, the wisdom of those who had been here a little bit \nlonger and understood a little bit more about the way this institution \noperates: the importance of having a Senate where you have open debate, \nwhere you have the opportunity for amendments--something that in the \nHouse oftentimes you do not have the opportunity to do.\n\n  It is important, in my view, that Republicans and Democrats come \ntogether and recognize if we go back on the traditions, the rules, the \nprecedents in the Senate, we will be forever changing not just the \nrules, but we will be changing the Senate, and that is certainly not \nwhat our Founders had in mind, nor do I think that is what our \ncolleagues on the other side have in mind. They may be well-\nintentioned, but what they are talking about doing is going to change \nforever the Senate in a way that would be very perilous to this \ninstitution and, more importantly, jeopardize the rights of the \nAmerican people to have their voice heard in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have the greatest respect for my friend \nfrom South Dakota. But, obviously, he missed the speeches this morning. \nWe went through all this. I am not going to repeat what has gone on \nsince the broken promise earlier this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/11/senate-section/article/S5651-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5651-S5652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   NOMINATION OF RICHARD CORDRAY TO BE DIRECTOR, BUREAU OF CONSUMER \n                          FINANCIAL PROTECTION\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I have a consent that I think would \nset up these votes in a much more expeditious way than the way the \nmajority leader is proceeding. But first let me just say, these are \ndark days in the history of the Senate. I hate that we have come to \nthis point. We have witnessed the majority leader break his word to the \nSenate.\n  Now our request for a joint meeting of all the Senators has been set \nfor Monday night--a time when attendance around here is frequently \nquite spotty--in an obvious effort to keep as many of his Members from \nhearing the concerns and arguments of the other side as possible. It \nremains our view that for this to be the kind of joint session of the \nSenate that it ought to be, given the tendency of the Senate to have \nsparse attendance on a Monday night, to have this meeting on Tuesday \nbefore it is too late.\n  Having said that, a more expeditious way to accomplish most of what \nthe majority leader is trying to accomplish would be achieved by the \nfollowing consent: I ask unanimous consent that on Tuesday at 2:15, the \nSenate proceed to consecutive votes on the confirmation of the \nfollowing nominations: No. 104, that is Pearce to be a member of the \nNLRB; No. 102, Johnson, to be a member of the NLRB, and No. 103, \nMiscimarra, to be a member of the NLRB.\n  I might just say, parenthetically, if those nominees were confirmed, \ncoupled with the two nominees illegally appointed, whose illegal \nappointments' term continue until the end of the year, the NLRB would \nhave a full complement of five members and able to conduct its \nbusiness.\n  I further ask consent that following those votes, the Senate proceed \nto the cloture motion filed on Calendar No. 99; that is, Perez, to be \nSecretary of Labor; and, further, if cloture is invoked, the Senate \nimmediately proceed to a vote on the confirmation of the nomination--I \nwould add, parenthetically, that would eliminate the post 30 hours, \nassuming cloture were invoked on the very controversial nominee, Perez, \nto be Secretary of Labor--further, the Senate then vote on the cloture \nmotion filed on Calendar No. 98, McCarthy, to be EPA Director; and if \ncloture is invoked, the Senate proceed to a vote on the confirmation of \nthe nomination--also eliminating the 30 hours postcloture if cloture is \ninvoked on McCarthy; and I might add that the ranking member of the \nenvironment committee supports cloture on the McCarthy nomination. \nThereby, it is reasonable to assume that cloture would be invoked on \nwhat is for a lot of our Members, including myself, a very \ncontroversial nomination. I further ask consent that the Senate then \nvote on the cloture motion that was filed on Calendar No. 178--this is \nsomeone named Hochberg, to be president of the\n\n[[Page S5654]]\n\nExport-Import Bank--again, if cloture is invoked, the Senate proceed to \nan immediate vote on the confirmation of that nomination--again, \neliminating the 30 hours postcloture, assuming cloture is invoked; and \nI assume that it will be--finally, I ask consent that following the \nvotes listed above the Senate proceed to the cloture votes on the \nremaining three filed cloture motions.\n  Now, before the Chair rules, what this allows, as I indicated, is for \nthe Senate to work efficiently through a series of nominations in a \nquicker fashion than the majority leader has proposed.\n  They would get their votes and there would not be a delay. This would \nonly leave discussion and votes on the three remaining illegally--\naccording to the Federal court--the three remaining illegally appointed \nnominations. That is my unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, no matter how \noften my friend rudely talks about me not breaking my word, I am not \ngoing to respond talking about how many times he has broken his word. \nThat does not add anything to this debate we are having. So he can keep \nsaying that as much as he wants. All we have to do is look back at the \nrecord today.\n  As to the caucus Monday night, my Members will be here. I do not \nunderstand--unless this is part of the overall pattern we have come to \nexpect around here, to not do anything today you can do tomorrow. We \nare going to have a vote at 5:30. Members are usually pretty good at \ngetting here for votes at 5:30.\n  I also am stunned by boasting about the ranking member on the EPW \nCommittee suddenly seeing the light and he is going to allow Gina \nMcCarthy to get a vote. Now, is that not wonderful? Is that not \nsomething to cheer about? He has held up this woman. He is the one who \nis responsible for 1,100 questions to her. That is what is wrong here. \nThis is so transparent what my friend has asked. He has said he wants \nto approve two Republican members to the NLRB. Let's have those votes \nfirst--only one Democratic nominee. What does this mean? It means \nwithin a couple of months Republicans have a majority of the NLRB. I do \nnot blame him for wanting that.\n  They do not like the organization anyway, just like they do not like \nCordray's organization. So I can understand that the Republican leader \nwould like to get consent to create a Republican majority on the NLRB. \nBut it is so obvious. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. We are going to have a caucus Monday at 6 o'clock in the \nOld Senate Chamber. We are going to vote at 5:30. I would hope with \nsomething this important we will have attendance. I know my caucus will \nbe there. If nothing is resolved there, which is the way things have \nbeen going today, likely it will not be, so we will have a vote \nsometime early Tuesday morning on these nominations.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the majority leader always reminds me \nhe can have the last word. I am sure he can have the last word again. \nSpeaking for Senator Vitter, he did ask for a lot of information from \nthe new prospective Administrator of the EPA--so did Senator Boxer. She \nasked for 70,000 pages herself. But he was satisfied with the responses \nhe got. This is how the process ought to work. This is how it has \nworked for decades. You are trying to get answer to questions. You are \ntrying to engage in some kind of prediction as to how somebody might \noperate in the future.\n  What the majority leader has been saying all along is he wants the \nconfirmation process to be speedy and for the minority to sit down and \nshut up. He believes that advise and consent means sit down and shut \nup; confirm these nominees when I tell you to.\n  The reason he is having to take a lot of heat over this is because he \nhas broken his word to the Senate, given last January, that we had \nresolved the rules issue for this Congress. I know for a fact, even \nthough he may get his 51 votes, there are a lot of Democrats who are \nnot happy with where the leader is.\n  When they tell me that--the Republican I expect they would be least \nlikely to want to tell that to--I know what is going on here. They have \nbeen hammered into line. This has been personalized by the majority \nleader: You have to do this for me. What is astonishing is he is \nsaying, you have to do this for me because you have to help me break my \nword and go back on everything I said in my own biography just a few \nyears ago. You have to help me look bad. You have to help me break my \nword, violate what I said in my own biography, create unnecessary \ncontroversy in the Senate, which has done major bills on a bipartisan \nbasis all year long and had begun to get back to normal.\n  This is very hard to understand. This is why my Members are \nastonished at where we are. They are scratching their heads, saying: \nWho manufactured this crisis? We know who manufactured it, the guy \nright over here to my left. So this is a very sad day for the Senate. \nIf we do not pull back from the brink, my friend the majority leader is \ngoing to be remembered as the worst leader of the Senate ever, the \nleader of the Senate who fundamentally changed the body.\n  It makes me sad. Some of my Members are more angry. I am more sad \nabout it. But it is a shame we have come to this. I sure hope all the \nDemocratic Senators are there Monday night. I am certainly going to \nencourage my Members to be there. It is high time we sat down and tried \nto understand each other, because many Members on the other side are \nhearing a different version of the facts that are largely unrelated to \nreality.\n  I know my friend the majority leader will have the last word. He \nreminds me of that frequently, on a daily basis, that the difference \nbetween being the majority leader and the minority leader is he gets \nthe last word. So I will yield the floor and listen to the last word.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, no matter how many times he says it, he \ntends to not focus on what he has done to the Senate. As I indicated \nearlier, there is lots of time for name-calling. But we know it is \nreplete in the Record, as delivered this morning, how he said there \nwould be no filibusters, we would follow the norms of the Senate, only \nextraordinary circumstances.\n  The extraordinary circumstances have come because we are in session, \nI guess. The only person I know who thinks things are going just fine \nis my friend. The American people know this institution is being \nhammered hard. He does not have to worry about me for the heat I have \ntaken. I have not taken any heat. I had a very nice caucus today. My \ncaucus was thoughtful. We heard from--out of my 54 Senators, we \nprobably heard from 25 or 26 of them. Attendance was nearly perfect. So \nI do not want him to feel sorry for the Senate, certainly not for me.\n  I am going to continue to try to speak in a tone that is appropriate. \nHis name-calling--I guess he follows, and I hope not, the demagogic \ntheory that the more you say something, even if it is false, people \nstart believing it.\n  It is quite interesting that Richard Cordray, who no one--no one--\nsays there is a thing wrong with this man, former attorney general of \nthe heavily populated State of Ohio--Democrats and Republicans have \nsaid he is a good guy--this man has been waiting 724 days; Assistant \nSecretary for Defense, 292 days; Monetary Fund Governor, 169 days; EPA, \n128 days; NLRB, two of them, 573 days. We have 15 of them. Average time \nwaiting is 9 months.\n  Reshuffling the votes as he wants them, that is a laugher. He wants \nto have a majority of the NLRB be Republicans. I do not think that is a \ngood idea. We are going to have our caucus Monday. I think it was a \ngood idea. I have tried to have them before. My friend has objected to \nthem. That is replete in the press. But we are going to have this one. \nI am happy to do that.\n  My friend said the process works. The process works? The status quo \nis good. I do not think so.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Of course, the majority of the NLRB would not be \nRepublicans. I have mentioned to the administration on several \noccasions: Send us up two nominees who are not illegally appointed. But \nwe cannot seem to get that done. I mean, the taint attached to the two \nNLRB nominees and to Mr. Cordray, who I agree is a good man and many of \nmy Members support, is that they were illegally appointed.\n  But, of course, the agencies have not been at a disadvantage. They \nare there\n\n[[Page S5655]]\n\nwaiting. He may have been waiting to be confirmed, but he is not \nwaiting to do the job. He is in office. The two NLRB members are in \noffice. The question is, do we respect the law? A Federal court has \nsaid the two NLRB members were illegally appointed.\n  Mr. Cordray, unfortunately, was appointed on exactly the same day in \nexactly the same way. Is the Senate completely lawless? Do we not care \nwhat the Federal courts say? I am stunned at where we are. It is pretty \nclear to me that all the other nominees are highly likely to be \nconfirmed.\n  What it comes down to is that the majority leader is going to break \nthe rules of the Senate to change the rules of the Senate in order to \nconfirm, with 51 votes, three illegally appointed positions that the \nFederal courts have told us are unconstitutionally appointed. That is \nthe rationale for the nuclear option?\n  That is why I say it is a sad day for the Senate, a sad day for \nAmerica.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, illegally appointed? Why did President Obama \nrecess appoint Cordray and the two NLRB members? Because the \nRepublicans had blocked them, blocked them, blocked them, blocked them. \nWe count Cordray as only 571 days. That went on long before he got \nthere. Elizabeth Warren is the one who set up this program. They said: \nNo chance. Do not even think of bringing her here. That is when he came \nwith Cordray. Elizabeth Warren found him as attorney general of Ohio. \nSo these big crocodile tears--you have recess appointments because the \nPresident had no choice if he wanted his team to work.\n  He said: Oh, we would be happy to process them quickly, just like \nRichard Perez has been processed quickly? Just like all of these people \nhave been processed quickly? Sorry. So there is not a chance that we \nare going to let the NLRB be dominated by Republicans. That one \norganization, above all, looks out for working men and women in this \ncountry, should not be dominated by Republicans. It is not going to be.\n  So I repeat, this issue can be resolved very quickly. I had somebody \nout here at my stakeout say: What happens if you get cloture on \neverybody?\n  I said: There is no problem. They can all vote against these people. \nThey can vote against them, every one of them. But they, on a \nprocedural basis, they are holding up votes on people who are well \nqualified and would be approved by the Senate if they got a vote. So \nthis is a little strange deal. Talk about marshaling your troops to do \nsomething that is absolutely wrong. It is that. If they are so worried \nabout the rules changes around here, it would seem to me they should \napprove three qualified people whom no one--no one--suggests there is \nanything wrong with any of them.\n  Why were they recess appointed? Because the Republicans forced \nPresident Obama to do that. There will be no further votes this week. \nThe next vote will be Monday at 5:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on the issue of delay, I am trying to \navoid bursting out in laughter. The two NLRB nominees were sent up to \nthe Senate December 15, 2011--December 15, 2011. Before their paperwork \ngot here, 2 weeks later the President recess appointed them. Delay? \nTheir paperwork had not even arrived. The committee could not do \nanything with them. A couple of weeks later they were recess appointed.\n  That is not my definition of a delay, by any objective standard.\n  The core issue here, no matter how much the majority leader tries to \nobfuscate and discuss other matters, is that he is prepared to break \nthe rules of the Senate to change the rules of the Senate for three \nnominees who were unconstitutionally appointed, according to the \nFederal Circuit Court in Washington, DC. For that, the majority leader \nproposes to use the nuclear option? It is a sad, sad commentary on \ntoday's Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. A sad day in the Senate created by the Republicans. This \nrules change--he keeps talking about the rules change. The Presiding \nOfficer knows the Constitution is very clear. It is clear that there is \none paragraph that says treaties take a two-thirds vote. In that same \nparagraph, how many votes does it take to confirm a nomination? A \nsimple majority. That is in our Constitution. Since 1977 rules have \nbeen changed in this body 17 times--not by fancy things done by the \nRules Committee but right here in the Senate.\n  We have three people who are qualified, and if Republicans want to \navoid a problem--obviously they don't. What they want to do is \ncontinue.\n  Can you imagine--the American people are looking at this and saying: \nThe Republican leader thinks the Senate is going just fine, the status \nquo is good? Look at any poll. The Gallup Poll did one. Eighty-six \npercent of the American people--why do they think things are bad? \nBecause of gridlock, not doing important things. Sure we were able to \nget a few things done, but I have been here a while, and we have done \nsome good things this year, but we should be doing lots of good things, \nnot focused on immigration and a farm bill that has been passed twice, \non a postal bill that we passed once and we haven't passed again. We \ntalk a lot about WRDA. I am glad we got that done, WRDA, and I am not \ngoing to denigrate my friend, the chairman of that committee, but that \nbill is a mere shadow of its former self because of what the \nRepublicans have done to make a mockery of what goes on here.\n  All we want is for the President of the United States, whoever that \nmight be, Democrat or Republican, to be able to have the team he wants \nas contemplated in that document called the Constitution of the United \nStates. That is not asking too much.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Are there any rules currently on how long one may speak?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senators may speak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I have been listening carefully to the debate that has \nbeen taking place here on the floor, and the esteemed minority leader \nhad a couple of phrases that he used any number of times.\n  One of those was that this debate is about whether to break the rules \nin order to change the rules, and the second phrase, also involving the \nword ``break,'' was to repeatedly say to the majority leader: You have \nbroken your word. Those are very powerful words. My mother always told \nme that when people start saying things like that, it is because they \nare at a loss for a real argument, but I found them disturbing. I found \nboth of those phrases disturbing. I found them disturbing because they \nare so at odds with what this conversation is really about.\n  We are here in the midst of a constitutional crisis. Our Constitution \nwas set up with a balance of powers between three coequal branches, \nwith checks and balances. Never in their wildest dreams did the \ncrafters of our Constitution envision that a minority of the Senate, a \nminority of one Chamber, would undermine the functioning of the other \ntwo branches. In fact, they were very deliberate--very, very \ndeliberate--in their determination that there not be such a \npossibility. They laid out with clarity that advise and consent on \ntreaties took a supermajority, but when it came to the other branches, \nthe judicial branch and executive branch have a de facto simple \nmajority standard in the Constitution. They are in exactly the same \nparagraph, so you can compare them, one to the other.\n  Our Founders talked about this, and they talked about it because they \nhad the experience with the Continental Congress in which a \nsupermajority had caused all sorts of difficulties. So I thought I \nwould remind us a little bit about the framework they laid out in the \nConstitution.\n  Alexander Hamilton said on a supermajority it would lead to ``tedious \ndelays; continual negotiation and intrigue; contemptible compromises of \nthe public good.'' Alexander Hamilton felt so strongly that there \nshould be a simple majority standard. He wasn't alone. We have Madison, \nwho wrote that ``the fundamental principle of free government would be \nreversed'' if a\n\n[[Page S5656]]\n\nsupermajority was the functioning principle.\n  So we have this system of coequal branches with simple majority votes \non nominations as a check against extraordinarily ill-advised \nnominations by the executive branch. Indeed, that has been the \ntradition throughout our Nation's history--simple majority votes on a \ntimely basis on nominations, interspersed by very, very occasional \nblockades put up by exercising the will to filibuster but very rare use \nof that until the last few years. Indeed, it was just a few years ago \nthat our Republican colleagues were in charge, and they were upset by a \nsmall number of filibusters by the Democrats on judicial nominees, and \nthey came to this floor and they said that is not acceptable. They \nreminded us of this constitutional history, of this constitutional \nframework, and they asked for a deal. The deal they asked for was they \nwouldn't change the rules if Democrats wouldn't filibuster the \nnominations, and that deal was struck.\n\n  But now the tide has turned. The parties are reversed, and suddenly \nthat deal is not holding because we see filibuster after filibuster \nafter filibuster obstructing the ability of the executive branch--with \na President reelected by the citizens of the United States--and with \nvacancies in the judicial branch, with judicial emergencies from hither \nto yon, with the largest number of judicial vacancies and the largest \nnumber of executive branch appointments piled up. Yet my colleagues on \nthe other side are saying: The Senate is functioning just fine. Only \nabout 8 percent of the American people think the Senate is functioning \nfine, and those 8 percent one would have to recognize are just not \npaying attention.\n  This is not the Senate I knew as a young man, coming here as an \nintern and sitting up in the staff gallery for Senator Hatfield. I \nwould come down to the floor to brief him on the amendments and the \ndebate before each vote. At that time, we had simple up-or-down votes \non nominations, with rare exception. Even if we turn the clock back to \nthe time of Lyndon B. Johnson, in the 6 years when Lyndon B. Johnson \nwas majority leader in this Chamber, only once in his 6 years did he \nneed to file a motion in order to close debate, and that wasn't just on \nexecutive nominations but a combination of executive nominations, \njudicial nominations and legislation--just once in 6 years.\n  Senator Reid, in his first 6 years as majority leader, had to file \n391 motions. This cloture process is designed to take a long period of \ntime, often up to 1 week, because it was envisioned it would be used \nrarely.\n  So here we are with the minority in the Senate doing deep damage to \nthe executive branch, deep damage to the judiciary by the abuse of the \nfilibuster, creating an imbalance or creating unequal branches of \ngovernment that is completely out of sync with the constitutional \nvision. Are we, as Members of this body--having taken a pledge to \nuphold the Constitution and having that responsibility--going to allow \nthis deep abuse of the constitutional vision of equal branches? I don't \nthink anyone who takes their pledge seriously can come to this floor \nand argue that a small group of the Senate should be able to do deep \ndamage to the other branches.\n  The Republican leader said the strategy is to break the rules in \norder to change the rules. I thought I would just remind him that--and \nI believe he came here in 1985--since the time he first arrived, there \nhave been many times the Senate changed the precedent on the \napplication of rules. Using a simple majority, the Senate changed the \napplication of a rule. It was done once in December 1985, once in \nSeptember of 1986, then twice in 1987, once in 1995, twice in 1996, \nonce in 1999, and once in the year 2000 and in the year 2011. That is \n10 times during the time the Republican leader has been a Member of \nthis Senate.\n  The minority leader described this as a nuclear option. So using his \nreasoning, there have been 10 nuclear option bombs exploded in this \nChamber during the time he has served here. Yet I didn't hear that \nmentioned in the presentation he put forward. It might interest the \nRepublican leader to recall that of these instances, where under the \nstandard of a simple majority the application of a rule was changed \nduring the time he has served here, that seven of those times were \nunder Republican leadership. It has occurred three times under \nDemocratic leadership. So seven times under Republican leadership the \ntype of action we are discussing--of reorienting the application of a \nrule in order to make the Senate work better--and three times under \nDemocratic leadership. All of these instances occurred during the time \nhe has served in this Chamber.\n  So to come to the floor and talk about breaking the rules in order to \nchange the rules, the Republican leader would have to go back and talk \nabout those 10 times and explain how 7 of them happened under \nRepublican leadership, but somehow that doesn't qualify as being the \nsame standard. I think it is important to get away from the \noverinflation of the rhetoric that has been put forward.\n  The second piece that bothered me in this debate was saying the \nmajority leader broke his word. I think everyone who is party to a deal \nunderstands there are two parties to a deal and those two parties need \nto uphold their half. So I would remind folks about what the Republican \nleader's half of that deal was. I put on this chart, ``The January \nPledge.'' This is the pledge made by the Republican leader on the floor \nof this Chamber. He said: ``Senate Republicans will continue to work \nwith the majority to process nominations, consistent with the norms and \ntraditions of the Senate.''\n  What are those norms and traditions? Those norms and traditions are \nthat nominations are able to be voted on in a modest period of time \nwith up-or-down votes. If we should have any doubt about what the \nminority leader meant about norms and traditions, we can go to the \nRepublican policy document from 2005. Here we have the last major \ndebate over the abuse of the filibuster--Democrats in the minority, \nRepublicans in the majority--and this is what the Republican policy \nargument said:\n\n       This breakdown in Senate norms is profound. There is now a \n     risk that the Senate is creating a new 60-vote confirmation \n     standard. The Constitution plainly requires no more than a \n     majority vote to confirm any executive nomination, but some \n     Senators have shown that they are determined to override this \n     constitutional standard.\n\n  I will stop quoting there for a minute and just note this was a very \nclear delineation of the constitutional standard during the time the \nRepublican leader was in this Chamber, in 2005--not so many years ago. \nThe document goes on to say:\n\n       Thus, if the Senate does not act . . . to restore the \n     Constitution's simple majority standard, it could be \n     plausibly argued that a precedent has been set by the \n     Senate's acquiescence in a 60-vote threshold for nominations.\n\n  The document goes on to talk about the role of the Constitution in \nadvise and consent:\n\n       One way that Senators can restore the Senate's traditional \n     understanding of its advice and consent responsibility is to \n     employ the ``constitutional option''--an exercise of a Senate \n     majority's power under the Constitution to define Senate \n     practices and procedures. . . . Exercising the constitutional \n     option in response to judicial nomination filibusters would \n     restore the Senate to its longstanding norms and practices.\n\n  So if we want to know what norms and traditions meant in this pledge \nmade in January, it is all laid out in extensive detail in the \nRepublican policy document, and it is laid out in the history of the \nUnited States. It means a modest amount of time to have a vote after a \nnomination comes out of committee, with a simple up-or-down vote, with \nrare exception.\n\n  But that is not what we have had. So I would ask the Republican \nleader to engage in a discussion about our constitutional role, much \nlike the debate the Republicans led in 2005. Because otherwise we are \njust casting aspersions, and the citizens looking in wonder at what \nhappened to that great deliberative institution--the Senate.\n  This standard of processing nominations according to the norms and \ntraditions of the Senate did not materialize after January. Within \ndays, there was the first ever--first ever in U.S. history--filibuster \nof a nominee for Defense Secretary. Ironically, that nominee was former \nRepublican Senator Chuck Hagel.\n  Within a short period of time after that, we had a letter from 44 \nSenators saying they would not allow a vote on\n\n[[Page S5657]]\n\nany nominee for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Any nominee? \nThat is the advice and consent role embodied in the Constitution that \ncalls for a simple up-or-down vote? They are going to use the \nfilibuster to oppose any nominee, regardless of the person's \nqualifications?\n  That is actually using the filibuster in a whole new way to basically \nsay we don't have the votes to undo the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau--which, by the way, is charged with stopping predatory practices \nthat undermine the success of families--so instead of trying to get rid \nof this institution that protects families--and I am not sure where \nfamily values fits in there--we are, instead, going to prevent anyone \nfrom exercising leadership authority and sitting in the Director's \nchair at the CFPB.\n  I see my colleague is here and waiting to speak, so I will conclude \nwith this. Let's recognize that the deal laid out in January just \ndidn't work. It didn't work. It doesn't make sense to keep saying who \ndidn't make it work. Certainly, from my perspective on this side of the \naisle, this issue of continuing to work to process nominations \nconsistent with norms and traditions didn't work. My colleagues across \nthe aisle have a different concept of why it didn't work. But at the \nheart of it, as they argued in 2005, there is a constitutional vision \nfor the use of advice and consent, and that constitutional vision is in \ndeep trouble. It is not permission for one coequal branch to undermine \nthe other two branches.\n  That is why the Members of this body need to have this debate. It is \nwhy I am on the floor now, and it is why we need to wrestle with \nrestoring the role of this Senate, the proper role in the nomination \nprocess.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we are in an unpleasant time, indeed, in \nthe Senate. I hate to see it happen. This is a robust body. We are at \neach other. We defend the interests of our constituents and try to \nadvocate for the values we share, and it is a contentious place at \ntimes, but we usually work our way through that. I would just say there \nis no reason we should be at this point today.\n  I do believe the majority leader has been abusing the powers of his \noffice. I remain dreadfully concerned and firmly believe this \nconsistent practice of using the tactics of refusing to consider \ncertain bills and filling the tree to keep Members of the Senate from \nhaving a vote is an abuse maybe even larger than the issue we are \ndealing with today. In fact, it is larger.\n  For example, we have been debating the question of interest rates \ngoing up on student loans and how to fix that. There are two different \nbills, two different ideas. One of those bills the majority leader \nsupports. He has brought it up and he wants to vote on it, but he \ndoesn't want to vote on anything else. But there are a number of \nSenators on this side, along with Democratic Senators who agree with \nthem in a bipartisan way, who have come up with a better bill--I think \nit is better--and we want to vote on it. But, the majority leader \nrefused to allow us to vote on that alternative. Time and time again, \nhe prevents us from voting on legislation and from engaging in a full \nand open amendment process.\n  So in the Senate, on an important issue, on an extremely well-\nthought-out alternative plan that would fix the student loan interest \nrate issue, the majority leader basically says: No, you don't get a \nvote.\n  This is a change in the history of the Senate, and it goes on every \nday. Senators have to plead with the majority leader to get a vote on \nan amendment. This is not the way the Senate should be. It is a very \nbig deal, it goes on every day, and it is time to stop it.\n  So now we have this idea that nominations have to be moved through at \nthe pace the majority leader would like them to be. Many of these are, \nfrankly, very controversial for very significant reasons. In my \nopinion, the President's nominations in his second term have been less \ncapable than those from his first. Many of them have serious weaknesses \nthat need to be examined, and many of them should never be approved. \nLet me talk about one now that is about to come to the floor. We ought \nto debate that one. The Constitution provides the Senate should advise \nand consent on nominations.\n  We have to consent to a nomination. That is the question we are \ndealing with in many ways here.\n  We come down to the big issue, though. In essence, it takes two-\nthirds--67 votes--to change the rules of the Senate. Because of a fight \nover three nominations that were illegally appointed, as determined by \nthe Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and the President \nwants to continue to have them serve--which Senator McConnell and many \non this side oppose and don't think they should be confirmed--what the \nmajority leader is proposing to do is to say, in essence, you can't \nblock a vote on those nominations and require 60 votes; there only has \nto be 51.\n  He will propose that, and what will happen? The Parliamentarian of \nthe Senate will rule that Senator McConnell is correct, that the \nnomination is not prepared to be voted on because 60 votes weren't \nobtained, and the majority leader loses.\n  Then what does he intend to do? He intends to look to the Chair and \nsay, I appeal the ruling of the Chair, and expects all his Members to \npresumably line up behind him and vote to overrule the rules of the \nSenate, overrule the independent Parliamentarian of the Senate. That is \nwhat he is talking about doing.\n  So when Senator McConnell says he wants to break the rules to change \nthe rules, that is exactly what he means. That is exactly what we are \ntalking about.\n  Stability in the Senate requires us not to change the rules willy-\nnilly when we have a tempest in a teapot, as these nominations are. \nThere will no doubt be times when things get so intense over big issues \nthat actions get taken, and history will record whether they are wise. \nBut we don't need to be changing the rules of the Senate every time it \nbecomes inconvenient for the majority leader. He has already done this \nonce.\n  He changed the rules of the Senate when Senator DeMint was making a \nmotion to get a vote, after he was denied the right to have a vote. The \nmajority leader filled the tree, wouldn't allow votes, and he used the \npostcloture technique to force at least a vote relevant to that issue. \nThe majority leader got tired of it, appealed it; the Chair ruled for \nSenator DeMint, and so he asked his colleagues to join him in \noverruling the Chair and changing the rules of the Senate. They backed \nhim on that and that was done.\n  This gets to be a habit around here, and our side is not happy with \nthe power grab from the top, from the majority leader, and how it is \nimpacting everyday life in the Senate, and we are not going to go \nquietly on this one. It is a big deal and the Senate should avoid it.\n  I am pleased that at least we will have a conference Monday in which \nwe can talk about the issue openly amongst ourselves and see if we can \navoid what could be a serious constitutional crisis. I believe we need \nto cool our heads down a bit and understand that the nature of the \nSenate is the majority does not get everything it wants.\n  I was here, and I remember how the judges' situation developed. \nJudges have traditionally not been filibustered. There have been a few \nefforts at delaying votes and people were held up, but systematic \nfilibusters were not at all part of the tradition of the Senate.\n  After President Bush was elected in 2000, the Democrats went to \nconference at a retreat somewhere. They had Marcia Greenberger, \nLaurence Tribe, and Cass Sunstein, three well-known liberal lawyers and \nprofessors. They came out, and then announced, We are changing the \nground rules of confirmation.\n  The vast majority of President Bush's early nominees to the Court of \nAppeals were blocked. Highly qualified nominees, with great skill and \nability, there was no basis to oppose them on merit. It went on for \nover 2 years, and others were being blocked.\n  As a result, then-Leader Frist threatened this kind of event. At the \nend, cooler heads prevailed, a compromise was reached, and the \nagreement was that we would not filibuster Federal judges unless \nextraordinary circumstances existed. Normally, we\n\n[[Page S5658]]\n\nwould give an up-or-down vote to Federal judges. That is the way that \nwas settled.\n  I would say with regard to the nominations we are looking at now, \nthese three illegally appointed nominees present a pretty extraordinary \ncircumstance.\n  We shouldn't sit here and go quietly when the President of the United \nStates--without any legal basis, in my opinion--makes a recess \nappointment to avoid the confirmation process, and now we object to \nthese people being confirmed after they were in office. After they were \nin office, after the court ruled they were illegally appointed, they \ncontinued to sit and continued to vote on issues important to \nAmericans. They should not have done that. They should have followed \nthe court's order, even if they previously thought they were legally \nappointed--which they weren't, pretty clearly, from the beginning--it \nwas never close to being a legitimate recess appointment. I am worried \nabout this. Hopefully cool heads will come together and work this out.\n  With regard to the traditional norms of the Senate that Senator \nMcConnell talked about, I have been in the Senate long before holds \nhave been put on nominations. You don't move the nominations until you \nget questions answered relative to their appointment. Nominations don't \njust go smoothly and get voted the next week. There are a lot of \nreasons for that process.\n  This was raised at the beginning of the year. These issues were \ndiscussed and an agreement was reached. As part of the agreement, \nSenator Reid said he wouldn't use the nuclear option if the Republicans \nagreed to certain things, and an agreement was reached. Senators Lamar \nAlexander and John McCain and others were in on the agreement and an \nagreement was reached.\n  Senator Merkley openly says now, Well, the agreement didn't work. \nWell, there is an agreement out there, it was agreed to, and Senator \nReid is now changing that agreement--changing the commitment he made in \nexchange for getting concessions from this side.\n  This isn't the breaking of a word like, You elect me majority leader \nand everything is going to be sweet and nice. This was a negotiated \nagreement of great intensity.\n  Senator Merkley and several other Senators were involved in the \ndiscussions, and an agreement was reached. The essence of it was \nconcessions were made by the Republican side, and the Democratic leader \naccepted those concessions and promised he wouldn't use the nuclear \noption. Now he is threatening to use the nuclear option.\n  The nomination of Mr. Jones, to be Director of the Alcohol, Tobacco, \nand Firearms, a highly important agency is supposed to happen today. \nMaybe in committee they determined to move it through. I was a U.S. \nattorney for 12 years. The closest agency you deal with is the FBI, and \nyou have to deal with them on a regular basis. They know how well you \ndo your job, they know whether you are functioning well, and there is \nnormally a good relationship and you try not to be critical of one \nanother. This is what Mr. Oswald, former Special Agent in Charge of the \nFBI, wrote about Mr. Jones:\n\n       As a retired FBI senior executive, I am one of the few \n     voices able to publicly express our complete discontent with \n     Mr. Jones' ineffective leadership and poor service provided \n     to federal law enforcement community without fear of \n     retaliation or retribution from him.\n\n  Because he is no longer in office, he doesn't have any fear. He is \ntelling the truth. He says he felt ``morally compelled to make [the] \ncommittee aware of Mr. Jones' atrocious professional reputation within \nthe federal law enforcement community in Minnesota's Twin Cities \narea.''\n  This is the guy they want to promote to the head of the Alcohol, \nTobacco, and Firearms.\n  The letter describes the frustration with Mr. Jones' ``ineffective \nleadership and his lack of concern about matters and issues brought to \nhis attention by each of us.''\n  Each of us, being the other Federal agencies, like the Drug \nEnforcement Administration, the Secret Service, or the IRS.\n\n       Our common dissatisfaction with Jones' poor leadership, \n     pathetic interaction, and insufficient prosecution support \n     was the theme of many discussion during my tenure. . . . He \n     consistently reacted defensively and often spoke to us \n     disrespectfully, and occasionally with disdain.\n\n  Then he went on to note that after he became the U.S. Attorney in \nMinnesota, they prosecuted significantly less cases of every type. \nForty percent fewer defendants were charged in 2012, when Mr. Jones was \nthe U.S. attorney, than the previous year because he wouldn't prosecute \nthe cases, and the Federal investigative agencies were up in arms about \nit.\n  This retired SAC tells the truth. I think he should be listened to. \nBut President Obama is determined to make him the head of the ATF, \ninvolving leadership of gun enforcement, firearms, and weapons charges \nall over America.\n  We have already had the Fast and Furious scandal. So shouldn't the \nSenate ask questions about this? Should we rubberstamp this? They are \nrushing it through committee, trying to do it right now: Move him on. \nGet him confirmed. And anybody who stands in the way? Tough luck.\n  The majority leader is going to drive it through. He gets to decide \nwho gets confirmed around here. He gets to decide what the rules are in \nthe Senate. They are forgetting the effort they led in the last part of \nPresident Bush's term when they blocked John Bolton to be Ambassador to \nthe United Nations. He was blocked by full filibuster by the Democratic \nMembers of the Senate. The rules weren't changed then, and the rules \nare not to be changed now.\n  We have a conference coming up Monday. Let's see if we can't work \nthrough it. Let's see if we can't work in a way that restores the \nSenate. The Senate is that saucer that is supposed to provide a cooling \nopportunity to slow down a rush to judgment. Should the Senate be \ncompelled to confirm three members to lower official appointments in \nthe Federal Government who were illegally appointed and continued to \nserve in their offices after they were so found? I don't think so. I \ndon't think so. I don't think that dispute is such that it would lead \nthe majority leader to break the rules of the Senate, to override the \nplain rules of the Senate through a procedure, which is not proper and \nvery dangerous, to get his way on this matter.\n\n  There are other things that could go wrong if this goes forward. My \nimpression from talking to my colleagues is that there are very deep \nfeelings about this and people have had about enough of this. There \nhave been all kinds of abuses here about how we conduct our business. \nWe are not going to keep accepting that because when you accept that, \nthe loyal opposition is eroded over a period of time consistently in \nits ability to exercise the little powers it has, and then the Senate \nis weakened. Then the Senate's role as the body that slows down \nproblems, that stands up to ATF nominations, that stands up to NLRB \nillegal appointments, is eroded. We do not need to do that.\n  I know there is a lot of feeling here.\n  I see my colleague Senator Hatch. He has been through this for a long \ntime and has seen these disputes. I have seen a few myself in my 16 \nyears--not nearly as long as Senator Hatch, who chaired the Judiciary \nCommittee and has been ranking member on that committee. But what I \nwill say is that this situation does not justify the nuclear option. It \ndoes not. It is a dangerous thing, and it can be addictive for the \nmajority leader--every time he is confronted by someone legitimately \nusing the rules of the Senate to raise questions about the majority's \nagenda, that they are overruled and the rule is changed so the majority \nleader can advance his agenda. That is what the issue is about.\n  I ask my Democratic colleagues, let's slow down, let's not go this \nway. Maybe this conference Monday will help us reach an accord and \navoid a very dangerous event for the history of the Senate.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I have in front of me the list of the number of times \nthe application of a rule was changed from the precedent. It was done \neach time under a simple majority structure, and it was done 10 times \nsince 1985.\n  I pointed out earlier--I am not sure if my colleague was on the \nfloor--that seven of these times this was done\n\n[[Page S5659]]\n\nunder Republican leadership. So seven times Republicans came to the \nfloor and said: We are going to change the application of a rule under \nredirection of the precedent or overruling of the precedent. I want to \nask if the Senator is familiar with that because the way he was \nspeaking, it sounded as if this conversation is about something--a \nprocedure that had never been done. Yet it was done seven times since \n1985 by my Republican colleagues.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I said it is a dangerous trend and it can be addictive \nand it can undermine the nature of the Senate. I did not say it never \nhappened. But to my knowledge, I would like for the Senator to list for \nme the number of times since 1985 the majority leader has gone before \nthe Parliamentarian and the Presiding Officer and actually altered the \nrules by a vote of the Senate, overruling the Chair?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I will be happy to do that. I have that in front of me. \nLet's start on December 11, 1985:\n       The Senate allows a conference report on the basis that \n     everything included is ``relevant,'' even though multiple \n     provisions have been ruled to violate the scope of the \n     conference committee's authority.\n  The ruling of the Chair changing the precedent was reversed.\n  This happened again in September-- Mr. SESSIONS. Was there a vote on \nthat?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. How many votes? I am curious. I know it was done \nbefore. The big time that I recall, I say to Senator Merkley, was the \none over Federal judges, similar to this. At the end, cooler heads \nprevailed, a compromise was reached, and a very significant rule of the \nSenate was not altered.\n  Some of these could be technical rulings of the Chair that are not \nthat significant, but I am interested in seeing what others the Senator \nmight mention. I am particularly interested if there was an actual vote \nof the body, by the Senate.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Yes. I can assure my colleague that each and every one \nof these involved an actual vote, and each and every one of these 10 \noccasions did reverse the previous precedent. That happens in two \nfashions.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator offer that for the record?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Absolutely.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would like to look at that and see where we are.\n  Senator Hatch is here now.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I will get the Senator a personal copy.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       September 25, 1986: The Senate establishes that procedural \n     motions or requests do not constitute speeches for purposes \n     of the two-speech rule (ruling reversed 5-92).\n       December 11, 1985: The Senate allows a conference report on \n     the basis that everything included is ``relevant,'' even \n     though multiple provisions have been ruled to violate the \n     scope of the conference committee's authority (ruling \n     reversed 27-68).\n       April 28, 1987: The Senate establishes that the Presiding \n     Officer should defer to the Budget Committee Chair on whether \n     an amendment violates Section 201(i) of the Budget Act \n     (ruling sustained 50-46).\n       May 13, 1987: The Senate establishes that a Senator may not \n     decline to vote when it is done for the purposes of delaying \n     the announcement of that vote (ruling reversed 46-54).\n       March 16, 1995: The Senate allows legislating on \n     appropriations bills (ruling reversed 42-57) [this precedent \n     was reversed in 1999 by resolution].\n       May 23, 1996: The Senate establishes that a budget \n     resolution with reconciliation instructions for a measure \n     increasing the deficit is appropriate (ruling sustained 53-\n     47).\n       October 3, 1996: The Senate broadens the scope of allowable \n     material in conference reports (ruling reversed 39-56) [this \n     precedent was reversed in 2000 by language in an \n     appropriations bill].\n       June 16, 1999: The Senate establishes that a motion to \n     recommit a bill with instructions to report back an amendment \n     had to be filed before the amendment filing deadline (ruling \n     sustained 60-39).\n       May 17, 2000: The Senate establishes that it is the Chair's \n     prerogative to rule out of order non-germane precatory \n     (sense-of-the-Senate or -of-Congress) amendments (ruling \n     reversed 45-54).\n       October 6, 2011: The Senate establishes that motions to \n     suspend the rules in order to consider non-germane amendments \n     post cloture are dilatory and not allowed (ruling reversed \n     48-51).\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Reclaiming the floor, Mr. President, I appreciate the \nSenator's sharing that. We will study them. It is absolutely a practice \nthat can occur, but it is a very dangerous practice. The Senate is a \nplace of a certain amount of collegiality and a certain amount of good \njudgment and understanding and respect for the body. Sometimes you can \ncarry out a procedure that may be dubious but within the realm of \nacceptable procedures, and sometimes you can feel and understand that \nis a dangerous alteration of the precedents of the Senate. That is \nwhere I am afraid we are with this vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will yield for a question from Senator Hatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. It makes a difference between issues where the Chair has \nbeen overruled rather than the nuclear option which changes the rule, \nwhich breaks the rule and changes it. That is a significant difference. \nThat is what is being done here by a mere majority vote.\n  The majority wants to change a very important rule. If we go down \nthat road, I am going to tell you, the majority is going to be a very \nsorry majority in the future because they may be a minority. This body \nhas always protected the rights of the minority, whether Democratic or \nRepublican. It is what made it the greatest body in the world. We are \nabout to destroy that for no good reason.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will be pleased to yield to the \nSenator from Utah and look forward to hearing his remarks. He is a man \nof great expertise on this particular issue.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me say that there are differences in how the rules are \ninterpreted from time to time. From time to time the Chair has been \noverruled. I have been here when it has. I have only been here 37 \nyears, and I have never seen anything like this in the whole 37 years.\n  I have to say that this is a dangerous thing to do. I predict that if \nour colleagues on the other side--all of whom I care for--if they do \nthis, they are going to rue the day they did it. It is that simple. \nThey can say: Oh, it is just an eensy-teensy little change. It is not. \nIt is a monumental change. There is going to be a tremendous price to \npay for it, to the detriment of our country--it is just that simple--\nand certainly to the detriment of the Senate, the greatest deliberative \nbody in the world.\n  It is hard for me to understand, over two NLRB partisans whom the \nPresident just recess-appointed, ignoring the rules of the Senate, and \nover Cordray, who probably under any other circumstances would get \nthrough easily, but there is very good reason why he should not go \nthrough this way.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak on what is known as ObamaCare and what \nthe Obama administration did last week, hoping the American people were \nnot paying attention, that impacts huge parts of the President's \nsignature domestic policy achievement as our Nation was celebrating the \nFourth of July. I am talking about the administration's decision to \nsuspend for a year--conveniently past next year's election, which is \nvery interesting to me--enforcing what is known as the employer \nmandate, the requirement that businesses offer insurance to their \nemployees or face the penalty. And then a rule was issued by the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services last Friday stating that it \nwould not verify people's incomes before giving out premium subsidies. \nMy gosh, we have fraud all over the Federal Government, and they do \nsomething this stupid and undesirable?\n  I am certainly glad employers got some relief. It is quite a message \nfrom the Obama administration, quite a message the Obama administration \nis sending the struggling families and individuals who will get no \nrelief from this monstrosity of a law and its burdensome individual \nmandate tax. Republicans in Congress believe this is unfair as such. \nSenator Thune spearheaded a letter to President Obama, which I \nenthusiastically signed, urging him to permanently delay the whole \nentire law and treat individuals the way he is going to treat \nbusinesses. I am glad it has been put over for businesses, even though \nI question why it was put over for this next year. But\n\n[[Page S5660]]\n\nwhy not do it for the individuals who are suffering from it? If it is \ngood for the goose, it should be good for the gander. Shouldn't the \nObama administration give the same relief to everyone?\n  Furthermore, I would like to point out that we have always known this \nlaw was a budget buster. With the employer mandate delayed, I have \njoined with a group of Republican committee leaders in the House and \nSenate asking for the Congressional Budget Office to get us an updated \ncost estimate of the bill. I can't say what CBO will find, but I have a \nfeeling that ObamaCare's price tag will continue to soar. It is already \noff the charts. Everybody knows it is an abominable bill, and that \nincludes Democrats as well.\n  What happened last week is just the latest in a series of \nconfirmations that the President's health care is simply not ready for \nprime time. Unfortunately, it is the American people who pay the price \nfor the largest expansion of government in generations. They will pay \nthe price through higher taxes. They will pay the price through higher \nhealth care costs and insurance costs. They will pay the price with \nmore and more government regulations and debt. They will pay the price \nwhen they are forced into what are called exchanges that are simply not \nready and unlikely to be ready in the near future.\n  This law, which was jammed through Congress on a purely partisan \nvote, is simply too big to work. The lesson is that asking government \nto do this much--when those of us who fought it tooth and nail said at \nthe time it amounts to a government takeover of one-sixth of the \nAmerican economy--will not succeed and cannot succeed. That is a lesson \nthe Obama administration doesn't seem to get, doubling down on selling \nObamaCare that is less popular today than when the President signed it \ninto law. In fact, the White House is rolling out a massive \nmultibillion-dollar PR campaign using taxpayer dollars to try to \nconvince the American people that it is all the administration \npromised, shaking down the health care industry, professional sports \nteams, and movie stars in the process.\n  Where is it going to end? What is the matter with this \nadministration? Can't they just live with the facts and acknowledge \nthat this is a dog? In fact, a cynic might argue that ObamaCare was \ndesigned to fail in order for the Federal Government to step in for a \ntrue, European-style single-payer system that many on the extreme left \nwanted all along. In other words, socialized medicine with the Federal \nGovernment controlling every aspect of our lives from a medicine and \nhealth-care standpoint.\n\n  Now it seems as though every day we learn about more and more \nproblems with ObamaCare. What do we know about it less than 4 months \nout from the open enrollment in the Federal and State health insurance \nexchanges which are supposed to occur on October 1?\n  We have heard from countless experts who say the exchanges will be \nrife with issues once they are supposedly up and running. Indeed, those \nexperts have predicted everything from ``glitches'' to ``consumer \nhorror stories.''\n  Two GAO reports released in June confirm that the Obama \nadministration is ill-equipped for the implementation of both the \nfederally facilitated health insurance exchange and the so-called Small \nBusiness Health Option Program Exchange. And that is two reports from \nGAO saying the administration is ill-equipped to implement those \nfederally facilitated health insurance exchanges. Citing the programs' \ndelays and missed deadlines, the GAO concluded that there is potential \nfor ``implementation challenges going forward.''\n  While we have been hearing about the problems with the exchanges for \nmonths now, we have not heard an explanation from the administration as \nto how--despite all of these reports--all of this is supposed to be up \nand running by October 1. I hope I am wrong, but I have a feeling come \nOctober millions of Americans are going to find themselves unable to \nnavigate these waters.\n  Sadly, the problems with the exchanges aren't the only difficulties \nwith ObamaCare. Over the last several months we have heard numerous \nreports about the problems at the Internal Revenue Service. Let's face \nit. The IRS has never been beloved. Indeed, millions of Americans \nloathe and fear the IRS, and the recent scandal surrounding the \ntargeting of conservative groups has not helped the agency's reputation \neither.\n  At the heart of this recent scandal, there are claims by the IRS that \nthey were simply unable to manage the increased workload that came with \nan influx of applications of groups applying for tax exempt status \nunder 501(c)(4). According to the IRS officials, the increase in \napplications were so massive that examiners had to find new ways to \ncategorize and screen the documents submitted by these groups. They say \nthat was the main cause of the targeting scandal.\n  Let's assume these arguments are true for a moment. When all is said \nand done, the number of applications of groups applying for 501(c)(4) \nstatus increased by 1,700 over a 4-year period. The IRS was apparently \nso flummoxed by an increase of less than 2,000 applications that it had \nto resort to inappropriate and potentially illegal measures. Give me a \nbreak.\n  If this is true, the country is in real trouble. If the IRS cannot \nmanage an increase of 1,700 applications of groups applying for tax \nexempt status, how will it handle its significant role in implementing \nObamaCare or even handling the so-called premium supports? Under the \nso-called Affordable Care Act, premium subsidies--complex tax credits \ndesigned to defray the costs of purchasing health insurance based on \nhousehold income--will go to an estimated 7 million tax filers \naccording to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Within 2 years, that \nnumber will nearly double. And they can't take care of 1,700 \napplications for 501(c)(4) that are basically and relatively simple?\n  In other words, the number of premium subsidy applications will jump \nfrom zero to 7 million in just 1 year. That is 7 million applications \nfor people across a wide income spectrum claiming subsidies that did \nnot exist before. Only God knows how many of those claims are going to \nbe made fraudulently since they don't seem to be able to handle them.\n  Basically, the Obama administration would have us believe that while \na 4-year increase of 1,700 applications for tax exempt status was \nenough to give the agency fits, it is perfectly capable of handling 7 \nmillion new filings for a brandnew health care entitlement. On top of \nthat, they want us to believe they can continue processing these \nsubsidies as they double in number over the first 2 years. Needless to \nsay, I am more than a bit skeptical.\n  Of course, it is difficult to figure out exactly what the Obama \nadministration expects the American people to believe when it comes to \nthe IRS implementing ObamaCare. That is because despite all the \nupcoming deadlines, it is still not clear how the agency plans to \nfulfill this new responsibility; and despite numerous Congressional \ninquiries--as well as those from GAO and the Treasury Inspector General \nfor Tax Administration, or TIGTA--no one really knows how the \nAffordable Care Act office in the IRS is going to work.\n  One of the few things we know for sure is that the person who headed \nthe IRS division that was responsible for targeting conservative \norganizations now heads the division responsible for implementing \nObamaCare. How lucky can we be? That is hardly a comforting thought. \nMake no mistake, processing these complex premium subsidies will not be \na walk in the park. These credits are both advanceable and refundable--\nmeaning they will be paid out first and verified later. Some have \nreferred to this process as ``pay and chase.''\n  Many of my Democratic friends have referred to tax expenditures they \ndon't like as ``spending through the Tax Code.'' That label is usually \nnot accurate, but when we are talking about refundable credits, it is \nprecisely on target. The problem is that over the years, the IRS has \nstruggled to administer these types of tax credits. One needs to look \nno further than the earned income tax credit, or the EITC, to see the \ninherent problems with refundable credits.\n  In a report issued this past April, TIGTA found that 21 to 25 percent \nof total EITC payments were improperly given out. If you assume that \nsame percentage of improper payments will apply to the $1 trillion we \nwill spend on\n\n[[Page S5661]]\n\nObamaCare premium subsidies--which is fair, due to the fact that the \nIRS has no way of verifying household income, and now the Department of \nHealth and Human Services said it will not even try to verify a \nperson's income--we could be looking at $210 billion to $250 billion in \nimproper payments over the next 10 years. When is it going to end? When \nare the taxpayers going to get a break? This administration doesn't \nseem to know how to get us there.\n  Some of that will be the result of fraud and some of it will simply \nbe due to filing errors. Either way, if the IRS's track record with \nrefundable credits is any indication, we are looking at hundreds of \nbillions of dollars in improper payments when it comes to the ObamaCare \npremium subsidies. Now with the Obama administration abandoning any \nincome verification, we are left with a policy that is little more than \nan honor system for hundreds of billions of dollars of premium \nsubsidies.\n  I will say it again: An honor system at a time when the Finance \nCommittee and the administration are trying to crack down on improper \ngovernment payments both within the tax system and our Federal health \nprograms. If the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over \nand over expecting different results, then this is the definition of \ninsanity on steroids. Couple that with the already soaring pricetag of \nthe subsidies and we have a disaster on our hands.\n  In his fiscal year 2012 budget, President Obama put the cost of the \nfirst year of premium subsidies at nearly $16 billion. In his most \nrecent budget, that number soared to nearly $22 billion without any \nadditional explanation.\n  Why are these costs going up? There are a number of possible \nexplanations. For example, there is the fact that due to the cost \nimposed by ObamaCare, more and more employers are opting to drop \ncoverage, thereby pushing more and more people into the exchanges \nsubsidized by these very same tax credits. At the same time, we know in \norder to avoid providing health care benefits, many employers are \nmoving employees into part-time work, which, once again, pushes more \npeople into receiving premium subsidies in order to purchase health \ninsurance.\n  Of course, there is the looming fact that despite the President's \nclaims that his health care law would reduce the cost of health \ninsurance, the cost of insurance premiums has continued to skyrocket. \nAll of these are potential explanations of why the estimated cost of \nthe premium subsidies has gone up in the President's budget.\n  Yesterday a group of my Senate colleagues and I sent a letter to \nSecretary Lew and Secretary Sebelius asking for an in-depth analysis as \nto how much of a burden the new health insurance exchanges will be on \nthe Federal budget given the skyrocketing pricetag of these premium \nsubsidies. This is a reasonable question given the magnitude of \nAmerica's debt.\n  Between the dramatically increasing costs, the daunting tasks of \nadministering these credits through the Tax Code, and now the \nadministration is pulling back antifraud requirements, the chances for \nsuccess are extraordinarily slim.\n  As I said earlier, this law is too big, too cumbersome, too \ninclusive, and too costly to work. I have never supported it, and for \ngood reasons. What is most disconcerting is that it is the millions of \nAmericans who work hard every day to pay their bills, put food on their \ntables, and send their children to school who will bear this burden. \nFor their sake, the best solution is a permanent delay of the whole \nlaw--and not just for the business sector but for everybody. That is \nwhat we need to do.\n  We have to get rid of this pay-and-chase system that is going on \nright now where the government just pays in accordance under the honor \ncode they described and later have to chase those who have defrauded \nthe government. It is just unbelievable.\n  Well, look at the premium subsidies. These are tax credits in \nObamaCare designed to defray the cost of purchasing health insurance. \nThese are going to go to some 7 million tax filers in households \nearning as much as $94,000 a year. How many people who are making much \nmore than that will claim they are making less than $94,000 a year? \nWell, if we look at the past, there is going to be a lot of them.\n  What is the IRS going to be able to do? They will not be able to \napprove it because they don't have the mechanisms to do it. My gosh.\n  The administration said they are just going to rely on the filer to \nself-report their income to get access to the credits. Give us a break. \nMy gosh. Like I said, the projected figure for subsidy expenditures has \ngone from $16 billion to $22 billion in just a couple of years. It is \nmind-boggling that they get away with it. It is mind-boggling that the \nAmerican people have not risen up in rebellion against this stupid \nbill, and it is mind-boggling to me how my colleagues on the other side \ncontinue to defend this monstrosity.\n  Every day we hear about more and more problems with it. Every day we \nhear about more and more costs. Every day we hear about more and more \nfraud. Every day we hear about people in the government who don't \nunderstand it and can't figure it out.\n  When are we going to grow up and realize this is a dog and it is \nhurting America? I will be honest. I believe within a year or two the \nPresident is going to throw his hands in the air and say: This is not \nworking. We have to go to a single-payer system--in other words, \nsocialized medicine where the government will control all of our lives \nand will determine who gets health care and who doesn't. I have to say \nthat is where we are headed. I hope I am proven wrong in the future, \nbut I know I am going to be proven right. I can just see it. If it \nhappens, it will have been done by our friends on the other side--100 \npercent--who voted for this dog. They don't seem to recognize it is \neating America alive.\n  I don't understand it. I love my colleagues on the other side. We \nhave been friends for a long time. I have been here 37 years. There are \nonly two Senators in that 37-year period whom I thought had no real \nreason to be here. I have loved everybody else, some more than others, \nof course.\n\n  The fact is what is happening has happened because of the Democratic \nside of this floor, and we have to get some heroes over there to start \nstanding and saying: We are not going down that road. We are not going \nto become socialism revisited, even though many of their supporters \nwant that, as is evident to anybody who looks at it. When is our media \ngoing to take up and realize this is what is happening to our country \nand it is wrecking it. On top of that, we have this absolutely idiotic \ndesire on the part of my friends on the other side to change the \nrules--to break the rule to change it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/11/senate-section/article/S5661-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5661-S5662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            TOO BIG TO FAIL\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, there is broad agreement that overleveraged \nfinancial institutions significantly contributed, to put it mildly, to \nthe 2008 financial crisis and that they were bailed out because \neveryone knows they are too big to fail.\n  Years later--5 years later now--there is an implicit assumption that \nthe largest megabanks--the five or six largest banks in the country--\nare still too big to fail. That means the markets give them funding \nadvantages that experts estimate are as high as 50 or 60 or 70 or even \n80 basis points.\n  That means when they go in the capital markets, they can borrow money \nat close to 1 percent. Eighty-eight basis points is fourth-fifths of 1 \npercent. They can borrow money at a lower cost than virtually anyone \nelse in our economy.\n  Studies from Bloomberg have shown that this can mean a subsidy of \nupward of $80 billion to these five, six, seven megabanks--these large \nmegabanks.\n  Last year, as a result, my colleague Senator Vitter and I began to \npush the banking regulators--the Federal Reserve, the Office of the \nComptroller of the Currency, and the FDIC, the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation--to use stronger capital and leverage rules to \nend this too-big-to-fail subsidy.\n  There is now bipartisan agreement that imposing more stringent \ncapital\n\n[[Page S5662]]\n\nand leverage requirements for the largest financial institutions could \nhelp prevent the next financial crisis and prevent future bailouts.\n  Unfortunately, the Basel Committee--named after a city in \nSwitzerland--responsible for the Basel III international capital rules \nadopted a mere 3-percent leverage ratio.\n  In 2007, the investment banks Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers were \nleveraged 33 to 1 and 31 to 1, respectively. These institutions would \nhave been compliant with the Basel III international leverage ratio, \nand yet each would have become insolvent, or nearly insolvent, if the \nvalue of their assets declined by as little as 3 percent. That meant \nthey only had sort of 3 percent protection, and if their assets \ndeclined by more than 3 percent, they would be what you call \nunderwater. They simply would be a failing, unsustainable institution \nor bank.\n  I am pleased to say that this week regulators finally went beyond \nthese inadequate rules and proposed a 6-percent leverage ratio for \ninsured banks. I said earlier, Senator Vitter and I had argued for this \nand were pushing the banking regulators to do what they, in fact, did \nthis week.\n  The move is a necessary step in the right direction. It shows how far \nthis conversation has gone in a short time. But there is more work to \nbe done. Let me explain several things we can do now.\n  First, the number needs to be higher. The Wall Street Journal \neditorial board--not a group of people with whom I often agree or with \nwhom I see eye to eye very often--wrote this morning about these rules:\n\n       [O]ur preference would be to go north of 6 percent.\n\n  To be higher.\n\n       Why not approach the capital levels that small finance \n     companies without government backing are required by markets \n     to hold, which can run into the teens?\n\n  They are required by markets. For the megabanks, the market does not \nquite respond the same way because of their economic and their \npolitical power.\n  Second, I am still concerned that banks can use risk weights and \ntheir internal models to game capital rules. This amounts to the banks \ndetermining for themselves--this is not some government body or some \nunaligned group of economists--this amounts to the banks determining \nfor themselves how risky their assets are, thereby setting their own \ncapital requirements.\n  The Financial Times said today the biggest banks plan to use \n``optimization'' strategies--not more equity--to meet the new leverage \nratio.\n\n       ``We're going to be able to pull a lot of levers,'' said an \n     executive at a large US bank on Wednesday. . . . Analysts at \n     Goldman Sachs noted in research for clients that ``banks have \n     a lot of options to mitigate the impact.''\n\n  That is why we need simpler rules that cannot be gamed by Wall \nStreet, and this rule cannot be watered down by Wall Street lobbyists.\n  There is no reason agencies should not finalize these rules and begin \nimplementing their rules tomorrow--not go through the long rules \nprocess. We cannot wait. Small businesses and families cannot afford to \nwait, neither can our economy.\n  Finally, there is more work to be done to rein in Wall Street \nmegabanks. Senator Vitter and I have a bill that would do this--the \nbipartisan too big to fail act. It would restore market discipline by \nraising megabanks' capital requirements and limiting the Federal safety \nnet that supports them.\n  I have also proposed legislation called the SAFE Banking Act to cap \nthe amount of nondeposit liabilities that any single megabank can have.\n  The regulators have begun to do their jobs. It is time for Congress \nto do its job. This week was a good week. It was a step in the right \ndirection, but it is time to finish the job. It is time to end too big \nto fail once and for all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Orrin G. Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: The Insured Retirement Institute (IRI) \n     \\1\\ commends your leadership on increasing retirement \n     security of American workers by introducing the SAFE \n     Retirement Act of 2013. The current state of retirement \n     savings readiness in America is at crisis levels and the need \n     for Americans to insure against the risk of outliving their \n     assets has never been greater.\n       Seventy-nine million Baby Boomers today face immediate and \n     unprecedented retirement income challenges--challenges that \n     simply did not exist in earlier generations. Research shows \n     nearly half of Boomers, over 30 million Americans, are ``at \n     risk'' for inadequate retirement income, not having \n     sufficient guaranteed lifetime income. These challenges have \n     been created by the shift from defined benefit plans to \n     defined contribution plans, longer life spans, increased \n     medical costs, and inadequate savings rates. In fact, for a \n     married couple both age 65 now, a 60 percent chance exists \n     that one spouse will live to age 90, and a 30 percent chance \n     exists that one will live to age 95.\n       As a result of these needs, the public policy focus on \n     enhancing retirement security in America has never been \n     greater. Along with other retirement security legislative and \n     regulatory initiatives, the SAFE Retirement Act is an \n     important contribution to efforts to enable Americans to \n     achieve financial security in their retirement years.\n       Annuities offered by IRI's insurer, broker-dealer, and bank \n     members provide retirees guaranteed lifetime income and \n     should remain a key component of retirement financial \n     planning, as the SAFE Retirement Act recognizes. While many \n     Americans are at risk for having inadequate retirement \n     income, according to IRI research, Baby Boomers who own \n     insured retirement products, including all types of \n     annuities, have higher confidence in their overall retirement \n     expectations, with nine out of ten believing they are doing a \n     good job preparing financially for retirement.\n       Because annuities help address numerous risks retirees \n     face, including longevity risk and inflation risk, financial \n     advisors and Boomers are increasingly seeing the need for \n     lifetime income provided by annuities, particularly middle-\n     income families who make up the bulk of annuity owners. A \n     number of IRI research reports show that Boomers who own \n     annuities have more confidence in their financial security in \n     retirement and are using more annuities to meet their \n     retirement income needs.\n       73 percent of annuity owners believe that annuities are a \n     critical part of their retirement strategy.\n       Baby Boomer annuity owners are more likely to engage in \n     positive retirement planning behaviors than Baby Boomer non-\n     annuity owners, with 68 percent having calculated a \n     retirement goal and 63 percent having consulted with a \n     financial advisor.\n       Nine out of ten female Boomer annuity owners are confident \n     they will have a comfortable retirement.\n       84 percent of financial advisors say they are having more \n     retirement income discussions with clients.\n       71 percent of advisors say they had a client request to \n     purchase an annuity during the last year.\n       For these reasons, IRI and its member companies commend you \n     for introducing the SAFE Retirement Act. We support \n     improvements to the current employer retirement plan system \n     resulting in greater simplification, increased participation \n     and savings by workers, and access to lifetime income \n     products within retirement plans.\n       As Congress considers tax reform, we appreciate your \n     continued support of the current retirement security system. \n     We look forward to working with you and your staff to improve \n     the retirement security of all Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                       Catherine J.

Orrin Hatch,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Hart \n         Office Building, Washington DC.\n       Dear Ranking Member Hatch: I am writing to applaud your \n     ongoing efforts to strengthen the U.S. retirement system. You \n     have championed throughout your career public policies that \n     help Americans save for their retirement years. Nearly two \n     decades ago, you authored, along with Sen. David Pryor (D-\n     AK), the Pension Simplification Act of 1995. More recently, \n     you strongly supported retirement savings plan improvements, \n     including provisions in the Economic Growth and Tax Relief \n     Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Pension Protection Act of \n     2006, which made permanent the increased contribution limits \n     for IRAs and other qualified plans, including 401(k)s. \n     Building upon the system's tax incentives, plan regulations, \n     and innovation, these improvements have helped Americans \n     accumulate $20.8 trillion for retirement, including $11.1 \n     trillion in defined contribution (DC) plans and individual \n     retirement accounts (IRAs).\\1\\ More than 80 million U.S. \n     households have accumulated retirement savings under \n     employment-based retirement plans and IRAs.\\2\\\n       We understand that you plan to introduce the SAFER Pension \n     Act, which aims to build on the strengths and successes of \n     the U.S. retirement system, so that it works even more \n     effectively to help American workers and their families \n     prepare for secure retirements. While we are still reviewing \n     the draft language that was recently shared with us, we note \n     that your bill targets several key areas for improving the \n     system, such as: making it easier and more cost effective for \n     small business owners to offer 401(k) retirement plans to \n     their employees; encouraging employers to enroll workers \n     automatically at higher levels of savings and to escalate the \n     savings more substantially than is perceived appropriate \n     under current law; and enabling greater use of electronic \n     delivery of plan information and tools to help workers \n     understand their savings options and make sound decisions.\n       We look forward to working with you and sharing our ideas \n     for further improving these and other provisions in this \n     important piece of legislation, to ensure their effectiveness \n     and the product neutrality that has helped create our \n     flexible and innovative retirement system.\n       Thanks to the strengths of our system, successive \n     generations of American retirees have been better off than \n     previous generations.\\3\\ The Institute stands ready to assist \n     you in continuing this trend by promoting greater retirement \n     savings opportunities for American workers.

Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: MetLife applauds your introduction of \n     the Secure Annuities for Employee (SAFE) Retirement Act of \n     2013. In introducing this bill, you have highlighted the \n     importance of guaranteed income throughout retirement for \n     millions of Americans. We agree this is of critical \n     importance.\n       The SAFER Pension Act also serves to increase attention to \n     a number of key challenges, including the importance of \n     stable pension benefit funding, the importance of lifetime \n     income to retirement security, and the importance of \n     regulatory simplification for plan sponsors, all of which \n     strengthen the foundation of our overall retirement system.\n       For many Americans, worries about their financial future \n     are intensified by weakening employer-based and public safety \n     nets--and by inadequate levels of personal savings and \n     retirement income protection. MetLife believes that \n     policymakers, insurers and employers all play an important \n     role in revitalizing and establishing programs that can \n     provide certainty in today's uncertain world.\n       In 1921, MetLife became the first life insurance company to \n     develop and offer a group annuity contract to fund defined \n     benefit plans and provide guaranteed income to employees at \n     retirement. We have continued this tradition of innovation \n     more recently with group annuity contracts designed to \n     provide guaranteed income for defined contribution plans. We \n     appreciate that the SAFER Pension Act has helped to highlight \n     the positive role annuities can play, and look forward to \n     working together in this retirement security reform effort.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Peter R.

Thank you, too, \n     for recognizing the valuable role fixed annuities play to \n     insure retirement. Our nation's retirement security depends \n     upon commitments like yours so that America's workers can \n     look forward to the retirement of their dreams with a \n     guaranteed and steady income.\n       Providing state and local governments a fixed annuity \n     option issued by an insurance company not only guarantees \n     lifetime income, but the industry's record of strength and \n     solvency also insures that pensions are protected from market \n     crises and cannot be underfunded. In addition, the effective \n     and vigorous regulation of the annuity industry by the state \n     insurance departments has been demonstrated day after day and \n     year after year by high consumer satisfaction and the ever \n     increasing purchase of fixed annuities. The fixed annuity \n     industry already secures the future for millions of \n     American's and continues to be one of the most reliable and \n     steady financial services sector throughout this country's \n     history.\n       NAFA looks forward to continue working with your office as \n     the bill progresses.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois, Mr. Kirk, in submitting a resolution celebrating \nthe 50th anniversary of Loyola University of Chicago's historic season \nas National Collegiate Athletics Association men's basketball \nchampions. The season is also remembered for the historic matchup with \nMississippi State University in the NCAA Tournament, which helped end \nracial segregation in college athletics.\n  The Mississippi State and Loyola teams, along with their coaches and \nschool administrators, led with courage and sportsmanship and a love of \nthe game of basketball. That contest a half century ago helped to move \nmy State and our Nation forward in addressing the inequalities of our \nsociety.\n  I appreciate the legacy and inspiring example of these teams, and am \npleased to cosponsor the resolution introduced today by Senators Kirk, \nDurbin, and Wicker.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the \nClarion Ledger newspaper article from March 18, 2013, titled, ``As \nMarch Madness nears, so does 50th anniversary of MSU's `Game of \nChange'.''\n\n  As March Madness nears, so does 50th anniversary of MSU's ``Game of \n                                Change''\n\n                          (By Jerry Mitchell)\n\n  Loyola captain Jerry Harkness shakes hands with MSU captain Joe Dan \nGold before the historic 1963 game.\n  As March Madness nears, so does the 50th anniversary of the ``Game of \nChange,'' where the all-white Mississippi State University basketball \nteam dodged a judge's injunction and the governor's wrath to play the \nintegrated Loyola University of Chicago.\n  Those across the nation know more about Texas Western's 1966 defeat \nof Kentucky, becoming the first champion with five African-American \nstarters (depicted in the 2006 film, Glory Road).\n  While that game, once and for all, settled the question of race on \nthe court, MSU's game against Loyola also played a critical role. The \nblog, The '60s at 50, quotes from the March 25 edition of Sports \nIllustrated:\n  ``Literally out of hiding to play Loyola the night before had come \nMississippi State, the team that saddened the hearts of segregationists \neverywhere by agreeing--eagerly--to participate in a tournament open to \nNegroes. On the eve of his team's departure from Starkville, Coach Babe \nMcCarthy got word that a sheriff was out with a court order that could \nkeep the team in Mississippi. Like Little Eva skipping across the ice \nahead of the bloodhounds, McCarthy skipped into Tennessee. University \nPresident Dr. D.W. Colvard vanished, too. Early Thursday morning an \nassistant coach verified that the coast was clear at the airport, \nhustled the team into a plane and away it flew on a modern underground \nrailroad in reverse.''\n  McCarthy had faced a series of frustrations as MSU's basketball \ncoach. His teams had dominated nationally, winning the SEC championship \nin 1959, 1961 and 1962--only to watch Kentucky represent the league in \nthe postseason because Mississippi authorities prevented them from \nplaying any integrated teams.\n  Former Clarion-Ledger sportswriter Kyle Veazey (currently with The \nCommercial Appeal) has penned a new book on the subject, Champions for \nChange: How the Mississippi State Bulldogs and Their Bold Coach Defied \nSegregation.\n  He was stunned to find out no one had written the story and decided \nto write it himself.\n  When the question of playing an integrated team arose in 1959, MSU's \npresident at the time, Ben Hilbun, received mail 3-to-1 in favor of \nkeeping the team at home.\n  Four years later, the mail ran 3-to-1 in favor of playing, Veazey \nsaid. ``Sports helped personalize the integration issue when it was so \noften being characterized by polarizing figures.''\n  He suspects the 1959 and 1962 teams could have won the national \nchampionship if permitted to go.\n  In the 1962-1963 season, the Loyola team, with four African-American \nstarters, faced its own difficulties, encountering vitriol and jeering \nfrom some fans during games in the South.\n  Before leaving for the big game in March 1963, Loyola players \nreceived hate mail from the Ku Klux Klan, according to ESPN.\n  Photographers snapped the legendary picture of Loyola captain Jerry \nHarkness and MSU captain Joe Dan Gold shaking hands at half court. \n(Harkness told USA TODAY he decided to play basketball his senior year \nafter a visitor to the Harlem gym urged him to play. That visitor? \nBaseball legend Jackie Robinson.)\n  Loyola defeated MSU 61-51 on the way to winning the national \nchampionship in a game watched in person by a little-known boxer named \nCassius Clay.\n  Throngs of MSU fans surrounded their team arriving at the airport, \nand a survey afterward found that Mississippians overwhelming favored \nletting MSU play the game.\n  Sports began to change hearts in a way that laws couldn't, Veazey \nsaid. ``It was an example of Mississippi doing something right when it \nwas doing so many other things wrong. It showed Mississippians that \nprogress could happen, that men like Babe McCarthy and (MSU President) \nDean Colvard could be courageous--and successful.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/11/senate-section/article/S5664-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5664-S5665]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MAINE FIREFIGHTERS COMMEMORATION\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, every day across this country, \nfirefighters quietly put their lives on the line in order to protect \nthe communities in which they serve. Few firefighters better exemplify \nthe selfless qualities that\n\n[[Page S5665]]\n\ncharacterize this select group of public safety personnel than those in \nFranklin County, ME, who recently rushed to the aid of their Canadian \nneighbors to help combat a deadly fire in the border town of Lac-\nMegantic, Quebec. I rise today to recognize those firefighters from the \nMaine towns of Chesterville, Eustis, Farmington, New Vineyard, \nPhillips, Strong, and Rangeley.\n  In the early morning hours of Saturday, July 6, 2013, a freight train \ncarrying hundreds of thousands of gallons of crude oil was sent \nhurtling toward Lac-Megantic, a small, picturesque Canadian village \nlocated only 30 miles from the Maine border. The train derailed in the \ncenter of town, leveling several blocks and killing numerous residents. \nThis unthinkable loss has touched every member of that close-knit \ncommunity. My heart goes out to the family and friends of the victims \nof this tragedy, and my thoughts and prayers are with the residents of \nLac-Megantic during this time of mourning. Yet, out of this terrible \ncalamity, I was exceedingly heartened to hear the stories of more than \n30 firefighters in nearby Maine who answered their Canadian neighbors' \ncall and reported for duty.\n  Within mere hours of the accident, the Franklin County Emergency \nManagement Agency had alerted seven area fire departments, and the \nMaine firefighters were at the scene. Upon arriving in Lac-Megantic, \nthese firefighters overcame tremendous obstacles in order to combat the \nflames. The initial blasts had severed the town's phone lines, power, \nand water supply, leaving Canadian firefighters unable to use the fire \nhydrants. Maine fire trucks, equipped with the capability of drawing \nwater directly from the nearby lake, allowed firefighters to cool off \nthe remaining fuel-laden cars that were in danger of combusting, likely \naverting additional destruction.\n  The response of the Maine firefighters demonstrates the best \nqualities of international cooperation as well as the tenets of the \nbrotherhood of firefighters. Maine and eastern Canada are bound \ntogether by history, family ties, and friendship, and that special \nrelationship was clearly evident on the morning of July 6. Despite \nchallenges posed by incompatible hose couplings, different radio \nsystems, and even a language barrier in French-speaking Quebec, Maine \nand Canadian firefighters worked side-by-side to quickly and \neffectively douse the flames and mitigate the damage caused by this \ndreadful accident.\n  The valiant and selfless efforts of these Maine firefighters are \nunquestionably worthy of our respect and gratitude. This unassuming \ngroup of first responders never thought twice about helping their \nCanadian neighbors and fellow firefighters. I applaud the firefighters \nof Chesterville, Eustis, Farmington, New Vineyard, Phillips, Strong, \nand Rangeley, as well as the effective coordination of these \ndepartments by the Franklin County Emergency Management Agency. Truly, \nwe can feel secure knowing these heroes are always willing to answer \nthe call for help.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/11/senate-section/article/S5665-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5665]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO CYNTHIA M.A. BUTLER-McINTYRE\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, my friend, Mrs. Cynthia M.A. Butler \nMcIntyre, will be retiring her role as the national president of Delta \nSigma Theta Sorority, Inc, this year. She has served as president since \nJuly 2008, and has been a great asset to the organization.\n  Mrs. McIntyre became a member of Delta Sigma Theta on November 30, \n1973, and has served as a leader at the local, State, regional, and \nnational levels. Mrs. McIntyre has an impressive professional resume \nthat includes director of Human Resources for the Jefferson Parish \nPublic School System in Harvey, LA, kindergarten teacher, assistant \nprincipal, summer school principal, and personnel administrator in her \nschool district.\n  Her professional and honorary degrees reflect her passion for \neducation. She received a bachelor of arts in early childhood education \nfrom Dillard University and a master of education in curriculum and \ninstruction as well as educational administration from the University \nof New Orleans. She also received an honorary doctorate of divinity \ndegree in religious education from the Louisiana Bible College.\n  Under the leadership of Mrs. McIntyre, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority has \npartnered with Water in Education International, WEI, to open The \nCynthia M.A. Butler-McIntyre Campus in Cherette, Haiti which is \ndedicated to providing access to clean water for children. Members of \nDelta Sigma Theta Sorority have donated funds to support the Clean \nWater Haiti Fund and under Mrs. McIntyre's direction, the sorority is \nset to open a new elementary school in Haiti this summer.\n  Mrs. McIntyre is a national leader who currently serves on the board \nof the New Orleans Convention Center and the Martin Luther King, Jr. \nTask Force. Previously, she served as executive director of the Tech-\nPrep Summer Program at Delgado Community College in New Orleans and has \nworked as the assistant coordinator of field experiences and college \neducation supervisor for early childhood student teaching experiences \nfor the University of New Orleans. In 2011, she was appointed by \nPresident Barack Obama to the Christopher Columbus Fellowship \nFoundation board of trustees.\n  Delta Sigma Theta Sorority has truly benefitted from Mrs. McIntyre's \nleadership as a pioneer of education reform. Her accolades include \nDistinguished Delta of the Year, Distinguished Public Servant Award, \nMLK Outstanding Activist Recognition, Hall of Fame, Distinguished Women \nof Honor, Who's Who in American Education, YMCA Role Model Recognition, \nElementary Assistant Principal of the Year, and Teacher of the Year, \njust to name a few.\n  Delta Sigma Theta Sorority will have big shoes to fill in the absence \nof their president, Mrs. McIntyre. She has made invaluable \ncontributions to the state of education, and her uncompromised \nleadership has impacted communities, nationally and internationally. I \nwish her continued success for the future.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Mr. Julius \nCiaccia, executive director of the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer \nDistrict on his election as president of the National Association of \nClean Water Agencies, NACWA.\n  Mr. Ciaccia is an accomplished leader and committed environmental \nsteward who has played a prominent role in the water industry, \nexemplifying what it means to be a public servant. He is ideally suited \nto serve as president of one of the Nation's leading proponents of \nresponsible policies that advance clean water. Mr. Ciaccia has served \nthe people of the Cleveland area for decades, and in this new role, \nwill continue to ensure that the Nation's clean water agencies continue \nto protect public health and improve the environment.\n  Mr. Ciaccia began his career in public utilities in 1977 when he was \nappointed as assistant director of the Public Utilities Department for \nthe city of Cleveland. In 1979, he joined the leadership of the city's \nDivision of Water where he served as both deputy commissioner and \ncommissioner until 2004.\n  During some 30 years with the city of Cleveland's Division of Water, \nMr. Ciaccia oversaw the management of more than $1 billion worth of \ncapital improvement projects and maintained the agency's favorable \nfinancial position. He was appointed director of the city's Department \nof Public Utilities in 2004 exercising oversight of the water, sewer \ncollection, and public power systems, with a focus on developing \ncomprehensive financial plans and supporting revenue enhancement \ninitiatives.\n  Mr. Ciaccia began his current role at the Northeast Ohio Regional \nSewer District, NEORSD, in 2007. In his current role at the district, \nhe oversees all aspects of managing one of the Nation's largest \nwastewater management utilities. Under his leadership, the district has \nreceived two awards from the Commission on Economic Inclusion, \nincluding a 2009 award for Supplier Diversity, which highlights the \nsuccess of\n\n[[Page S5666]]\n\nhis initiative to craft and implement a supplier inclusion program. In \n2012, the NEORSD was awarded by the Commission for Senior Management \nInclusion, recognizing the diversity of senior staff.\n  As the district's executive director, Mr. Ciaccia was responsible for \nconfirming their consent decree for a long-term control plan to \nsignificantly reduce overflows from combined sewers, as well as the \nsuccessful development and implementation of a new Regional Stormwater \nManagement Program. Among Mr. Ciaccia's many accomplishments as \nexecutive director of NEORSD is the transformation of the district's \nculture to one of transparency and exceptional financial management.\n  As a member of NACWA's board of directors, Mr. Ciaccia has served as \nthe secretary, treasurer, and vice president. Mr. Ciaccia has shared \nhis time, passion, energy and ideas to carry out the objectives of the \nClean Water Act.\n  It is my pleasure to congratulate Julius Ciaccia on becoming \npresident of NACWA. I am certain his actions will ensure continued \nwater quality progress for the Cleveland area, the State of Ohio and \nthe Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/11/senate-section/article/S5666-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    2013 NATIONAL BOY SCOUT JAMBOREE\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER: Mr. President, right now tens of thousands of \nBoy Scouts are gathering in the adventure-filled mountains of southern \nWest Virginia for the 2013 National Scout Jamboree.\n  At the Summit Bechtel Reserve in Fayette County beginning on July 15, \nScouts from across the country will challenge themselves--with biking, \nswimming, whitewater rafting, zip lining, and rock climbing. But they \nalso will challenge themselves in ways new to the National Jamboree--by \ngiving back to local communities.\n  For the first time ever, the Jamboree is engaged in a community \nservice effort, one that has ignited in extraordinary ways in West \nVirginia. Over a 5-day period, up to 40,000 Scouts will work with \ngroups in 9 counties on more than 350 projects--involving wellness, \narts, education, infrastructure and beautification--totaling hundreds \nof thousands of service hours.\n  It is the biggest community service initiative of its kind in the \ncountry. It is an inspiration. And it speaks to the heart of West \nVirginia, a State where service is deep-rooted in our people; where \n``neighbor helping neighbor'' is more than an idea--it is a way of \nlife.\n  It also speaks to the heart of the Boy Scouts of America, which has a \nlong tradition of community service and dedicates virtually countless \nhours of volunteer work year round. During the 2013 Jamboree, Scouts \nfrom ages 12 to 18 and from every State in the Union will be living out \nthe Scout oath, ``To help other people at all times.''\n  Today I applaud everyone involved with the Reaching the Summit \nCommunity Service Initiative--the Boy Scouts who built this idea, the \nCitizens Conservation Corps of West Virginia for bringing together all \nthe pieces to make it possible, the many organizations on the ground \nmaking a difference side-by-side with our Scouts, and the local \ncommunities supporting them. This initiative will make a tremendous \ndifference in West Virginia communities, but it means more than that. \nIt means that thousands of bright young Scouts will continue to \nexperience the unparalleled feeling that comes with helping \nothers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/11/senate-section/article/S5666-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/11/senate-section/article/S5666-3", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  (The message received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/11/senate-section/article/S5666-4", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  At 2:42 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 251.

A bill to reduce risks to the financial system by limiting \nbanks' ability to engage in certain risky activities and limiting \nconflicts of interest, to reinstate certain Glass-Steagall Act \nprotections that were repealed by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senator Warren of \nMassachusetts, Senator Cantwell of Washington, and Senator King of \nMaine, and also recognize the hard work of my friend from Ohio who has \nbeen heavily involved in this issue in the past.\n\n[[Page S5669]]\n\n  This legislation is bipartisan. The 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act, \nwhich will restore the much needed wall between investment and \ncommercial banking to lessen risk, restore confidence in our banking \nsystem, and better protect the American taxpayer. The original 1933 \nGlass-Steagall Act was put in place to respond to the financial crash \nof 1929.\n  Similar to the 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act that we are \nintroducing today, it put up a wall between commercial and investment \nbanking with the idea of separating riskier investment banking from the \ncore banking functions such as checking and savings accounts that \nAmericans need in their everyday life.\n  Commercial banks traditionally use their customer's deposit for the \npurpose of Main Street loans within their communities. They did not \nengage in high-risk ventures. Investment banks, however, managed money \nfor those who could afford to take bigger risks in order to get a \nbigger return and who bore their own losses. Unfortunately, core \nprovisions of the Glass-Steagall Act were repealed in 1999, shattering \nthe wall dividing commercial banks and investment banks. Since that \ntime, we have seen a culture of greed and excessive risk-taking take \nroot in the banking world, where common sense and caution with other \npeople's money no longer matters.\n  When these two worlds collided, the investment bank culture \nprevailed, cutting off the credit lifeblood of Main Street firms, \ndemanding greater returns that were achievable only through high \nleverage and huge risk-taking, which ultimately left the taxpayer with \nthe fallout.\n  Leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, the mantra of ``bigger is \nbetter'' took over, and sadly it still remains. The path forward \nfocused on short-term gains rather than long-term planning. Banks \nbecame overleveraged in their haste to keep in the race. The more they \nlent, the more they made.\n  Aggressive mortgages were underwritten for unqualified individuals \nwho became homeowners saddled with loans they could not afford. Banks \nturned right around and bought portfolios of these shaky loans. I know \nthe 2008 financial crisis did not happen solely because the wall of \nGlass-Steagall was knocked down. But I strongly believe the repeal of \nthese core provisions played a significant role in changing the banking \nsystem in negative ways that contributed greatly to the 2008 financial \ncrisis.\n  I believe this culture of risky behavior is still in play. For \nexample, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, on which \nI serve as ranking member, held a hearing in March of this year to \ndiscuss the findings of the subcommittee investigation report entitled, \n``JPMorgan Chase Whale Trades: A Case History of Derivatives Risks and \nAbuses.''\n  The hearing and the findings of the investigation described how \ntraders at JPMorgan Chase made risky bets using excess deposits that \nwere partially insured by the Federal Government. If they wanted to \nmake these bets on deposits and money that was not insured by the \nFederal Government, the Senator from Massachusetts and I would not be \nhere today.\n  They used federally insured deposits, putting the taxpayers on the \nhook for their risky and ultimately failed investments. I say again, \nthe Dodd-Frank bill, the whole purpose of it, as sold to this Congress \nand to the American people, was to ensure that no investment company or \ninvestment financial enterprise would ever be too big to fail again.\n  Is there anybody who believes these institutions such as I just \ntalked about, JPMorgan Chase and others, are not too big to fail? Of \ncourse they are still too big to fail. The investigation revealed \nstartling failures and shed light on a complex and volatile world of \nsynthetic credit derivatives.\n  In a matter of months, JPMorgan Chase was able to vastly increase its \nexposure to risk while dodging oversight by Federal regulators. The \ntrades ultimately cost the bank a staggering $6.2 billion in loss. This \ncase represents another shameful demonstration of a bank engaged in \nwildly risky behavior. The London Whale incident matters to the Federal \nGovernment and the American taxpayer because the traders at JPMorgan \nChase were making risky bets using excess deposits, a portion of which \nwere federally insured.\n  These excess deposits should have been used to provide loans for Main \nStreet businesses. Instead, JPMorgan Chase used the money to bet on \ncatastrophic risk. The 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act will return \nbanking back to the basics by separating traditional banks that offer \nsavings and checking accounts and are insured by the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation from riskier financial institutions that offer \nother services such as investment banking, insurance, swaps dealing and \nhedge fund and private equity activities.\n  I believe big Wall Street institutions should be free to engage in \ntransactions with significant risk but not with federally insured \ndeposits. The bill also addresses depository institutions' use of \nproducts that did not exist when Glass-Steagall was originally passed, \nsuch as structured and synthetic financial products, including complex \nderivatives and swaps.\n  Finally, the bill provides financial institutions with a 5-year \ntransition period to separate their activities. Many prominent \nindividuals in the banking world support returning to a modern day \nGlass-Steagall banking system, including FDIC Vice Chairman Thomas \nHoenig. Last year in his opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal, \nentitled ``No More Welfare For Banks. The FDIC and the taxpayer are the \nunderwriters of too much private risk taking,'' he lays out his plan to \nstrengthen the U.S. financial system by simplifying its structure and \nmaking its institutions more accountable for their mistakes, which he \ncalls Glass-Steagall for today. He ends his piece by stating:\n\n       Capitalism will always have crises and the recent crisis \n     had many contributing factors. However, the direct and \n     indirect expansion of the safety net to cover an ever-\n     increasing number of complex and risky activities made this \n     crisis significantly worse. We have yet to correct the error. \n     It is time we did.\n\n  I could not agree more. Almost 3 years ago, Congress passed Dodd-\nFrank with the intent to overhaul our Nation's financial system. I did \nnot vote for Dodd-Frank because it did little if anything to tackle the \ntough problems facing our financial sector.\n  What Dodd-Frank did, though, was create thousands of pages of new and \ncomplicated rules. Is there any Member of this body who believes that \nDodd-Frank has resulted in the end of too big to fail? The 21st Century \nGlass-Steagall Act may not end too big to fail on its own, but it moves \nthe large financial institutions in the right direction, making them \nsmaller and safer.\n  This bill would rebuild the wall between commercial and investment \nbanking that was successful for over 60 years and reduced risk for the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Thomas Hoenig article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From The Wall Street Journal, June 10, 2012]\n\n                       No More Welfare for Banks\n\n\nThe FDIC and the taxpayer are the underwriters of too much private risk \n                                taking.\n\n                           (By Thomas Hoenig)\n\n       I have a proposal to strengthen the U.S. financial system \n     by simplifying its structure and making its institutions more \n     accountable for their mistakes. Put simply, my proposal would \n     help prevent another 2008-style crisis by prohibiting banking \n     organizations from conducting broker-dealer or other trading \n     activities and by reforming money-market funds and the market \n     for short-term collateralized loans (repurchase agreements, \n     or repos). In other words, Glass-Steagall for today.\n       Those opposed to taking these actions generally focus on \n     two themes. First, they say that if Glass-Steagall--enacted \n     in 1933 to separate commercial and investment banking--had \n     been in place, the crisis still would have occurred. Second, \n     they argue that requiring the separation of commercial \n     banking and broker-dealer activities is inconsistent with a \n     free-market economy and puts U.S. financial firms at a global \n     competitive disadvantage. Both assertions are wrong.\n       Advocates of the first argument say the crisis was not \n     precipitated by trading activities within banking \n     organizations but by excessive mortgage lending by commercial \n     banks and by the failures of independent broker-dealers, such \n     as Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns.\n       This assertion ignores that the largest bank holding \n     companies and broker-dealers were engaged in high-risk \n     activities supported by explicit and implied government\n\n[[Page S5670]]\n\n     guarantees. Access to insured deposits or money-market funds \n     and repos fueled the activities of both groups, making them \n     susceptible to the freezing of markets and asset-price \n     declines.\n       Before 1999, U.S. banking law kept banks, which are \n     protected by a public safety net (e.g., deposit insurance), \n     separate from broker-dealer activities, including trading and \n     market making. However, in 1999 the law changed to permit \n     bank holding companies to expand their activities to trading \n     and other business lines. Similarly, broker-dealers like Bear \n     Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs and other ``shadow \n     banks'' were able to use money-market funds and repos to \n     assume a role similar to that of banks, funding long-term \n     asset purchases with the equivalent of very short-term \n     deposits. All were able to expand the size and complexity of \n     their balance sheets.\n       While these changes took place, it also became evident that \n     large, complex institutions were considered too important to \n     the economy to be allowed to fail. A safety net was extended \n     beyond commercial banks to bank holding companies and broker-\n     dealers. In the end, nobody--not managements, the market or \n     regulators--could adequately assess and control the risks of \n     these firms. When they foundered, banking organizations and \n     broker-dealers inflicted enormous damage on the economy, and \n     both received government bailouts.\n       To illustrate my point, consider that if you or I want to \n     speculate on the market, we must risk our own wealth. If we \n     think the price of an asset is going to decline, we might \n     sell it ``short,'' expecting to profit by buying it back more \n     cheaply later and pocketing the difference. But if the price \n     increases, we either invest more of our own money to cover \n     the difference or we lose the original investment.\n       In contrast, a bank can readily cover its position using \n     insured deposits or by borrowing from the Federal Reserve. \n     Large nonbank institutions can access money-market funds or \n     other credit because the market believes they will be bailed \n     out. Both types of companies can even double down in an \n     effort to stay in the game long enough to win the bet, which \n     supersizes losses when the bet doesn't pay off. The Federal \n     Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) fund and the taxpayer \n     are the underwriters of this private risk-taking.\n       This leads to the second criticism of my proposal--that \n     breaking up the banks is inconsistent with free markets and \n     our need to be competitive globally. The opposite is true. My \n     proposal seeks to return to capitalism by confining the \n     government's guarantee to that for which it was intended--to \n     protect the payments system and related activities inside \n     commercial banking. It ends the extension of the safety net's \n     subsidy to trading, market-making and hedge-fund activities. \n     This change will invigorate commercial banking and the \n     broker-dealer market by encouraging more equitable and \n     responsible competition within markets. It reduces the \n     welfare nature of our current financial system, making it \n     more self-reliant and more internationally competitive.\n       Capitalism will always have crises and the recent crisis \n     had many contributing factors. However, the direct and \n     indirect expansion of the safety net to cover an ever-\n     increasing number of complex and risky activities made this \n     crisis significantly worse. We have yet to correct the error. \n     It is time we did.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like to thank the Senator from Massachusetts, \nwhom I will freely admit has a great deal more knowledge, background, \nand expertise on this issue than I do. I appreciate her leadership. \nWhen the Senator sought to join us in the Senate, she committed to the \npeople of Massachusetts and this country that she would be committed to \ncertain significant reforms to ensure that we never again have the kind \nof crisis that devastated my State.\n  Still today, nearly half the homes in my State are underwater, which \nmeans they are worth less than their mortgage payments, while Wall \nStreet has been doing well for years. That bailout is one of the more \nunfair aspects that I have seen in American history. We cannot revisit \nor fix history, but we sure can make sure we have made every effort to \nmake sure these large financial institutions do not gamble with \ntaxpayers' money.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. It is a pleasure to join her \nin this effort as her junior partner.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the senior Senator \nfrom Arizona and to support the 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act. I am \nhonored to join Senators McCain, Cantwell, and King in introducing this \nbill. I particularly commend Senator McCain for his hard work and his \nlong-time dedication on this issue.\n  Senator McCain is a real leader in the Senate. While we do not agree \non every issue, he is a fighter who stands for what he believes. \nSenator McCain has worked hard to shed light on the too-big-to-fail \nproblem. He has been thinking about how to bring back elements of \nGlass-Steagall for years. I am proud to join with him to speak about \nthe 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act. I am glad to be his partner in \nthis endeavor.\n  Washington is a partisan place. This Congress has its share of \npartisan bills. But we have all joined together today because we want a \nsafe future for our kids and for our grandkids. We know that 5 years \nago Wall Streets's high-risk bets nearly brought our economy to its \nknees, disrupting the lives and livelihoods of hard-working Americans.\n  We know the economic downturn did not affect just Democrats or just \nRepublicans or just Independents, it affected everyone.\n  Over the past 5 years we have made some real progress in dialing back \nthe risk of future crises. But despite the progress that has been made, \nthe biggest banks continue to threaten the economy. The four biggest \nbanks are now 30 percent larger than they were just 5 years ago. They \nhave continued to engage in dangerous high-risk practices that could \nonce again put our economy at risk.\n  The big banks were not always allowed to take on big risk while \nenjoying the benefits of both explicit and implicit taxpayer \nguarantees. Four years after the 1929 crash, Congress passed the \nBanking Act, or the Glass-Steagall Act as it is known, which is best \nknown for separating the risky activities of investment banks from the \ncore depository functions such as savings accounts and checking \naccounts that consumers rely on every day.\n  For years, Glass-Steagall played a central role in keeping our \ncountry safe. Traditional banking stayed separate from high-risk Wall \nStreet banking. But big banks wanted the higher profits they could get \nfrom taking on more risk. Investors wanted access to the insured \ndeposits of traditional banks. So Wall Street investors combined with \nthe big banks to try to weaken and repeal Glass-Steagall. Starting in \nthe 1980s, regulators at the Federal Reserve and the Office of the \nComptroller of the Currency responded, reinterpreting longstanding \nlegal terms in ways that slowly broke down the wall between investment \nbanking and depository banking. Finally, after 12 attempts to repeal, \nCongress eliminated the core provisions of Glass-Steagall in 1999.\n  The 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act will reestablish the wall between \ncommercial and investment banking, make our financial system more \nstable and more secure, and protect American families.\n  Like its 1933 predecessor, the 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act will \nseparate traditional banks that offer checking and savings accounts and \nare insured by the FDIC from the riskier financial services. It will \nreturn banking--basic banking--to the basics.\n  The 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act also puts in place some important \nimprovements over the original Glass-Steagall. It reverses the \ninterpretations the regulators used to weaken the original Glass-\nSteagall. Our bill also recognizes that financial markets have become \nmore complicated since the 1930s, and it separates depository \ninstitutions from products that did not exist when Glass-Steagall was \noriginally passed, such as structured and synthetic financial products, \nincluding complex derivatives and swaps.\n  The idea behind the bill is simple: Banking should be boring. Anyone \nwho wants to take big risks should go to Wall Street, and they should \nstay away from the basic banking system.\n  I wish to be clear--the 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act will not by \nitself end too big to fail and implicit government subsidies, but it \nwill make financial institutions smaller, safer, and move us in the \nright direction. By separating depository institutions from riskier \nactivities, large financial institutions will shrink in size and won't \nbe able to rely on Federal depository insurance as a safety net for \ntheir high-risk activities. It will stop the game these banks have \nplayed for too long. Heads, the big banks win and take all the profits \nand, tails, the taxpayer gets stuck with all the losses.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to \nreduce the risk in the financial system and to\n\n[[Page S5671]]\n\ndial back the likelihood of future crises.\n  Exactly 70 years ago the halls of the Senate filled with excitement \nand history when it passed the original Glass-Steagall. The financial \nindustry at that time experienced some big immediate changes, but \ndespite all kinds of claims to the contrary, Wall Street survived and \nthe sky did not fall. In fact, the American people enjoyed a half \ncentury of financial stability and a strong, growing middle class. The \nregular financial crises that had occurred over and over before Glass-\nSteagall faded away, and our economy became stronger and more stable.\n  Few in Congress have been around long enough to have lived through \nthe Great Depression that led to the first Glass-Steagall, but we were \nall around during the 2008 financial crisis. It has been 5 years since \nthen, but our economy still has not fully recovered, and the downturn \nhas had an impact everywhere--on our families, businesses, retirees, \nworkers, schoolchildren, and college students. We need a banking system \nthat serves the best interests of the American people, not just the few \nat the top. The 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act is an important step in \nthe right direction. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nmeasure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. \n        Franken):\n  S. 1286. A bill to encourage the adoption and use of certified \nelectronic health record technology by safety net providers and \nclinics; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nMedicaid Information Technology to Enhance Community Health Act of \n2013, or the MITECH Act. I am proud to be joined by my colleagues \nSenator Franken and Senator Whitehouse in introducing this important \npiece of legislation which would help clinics and health care providers \nserving our Nation's most vulnerable citizens qualify for incentives to \nadopt meaningful use electronic health records for their patients.\n  In recent years, Congress has recognized the benefits of implementing \nelectronic health records in our health care system. Countless experts \nhave determined that electronic health records and other forms of \nhealth information technology improve health care quality, reduce \nmedical errors, and lower overall medical costs. We have made \nunprecedented investments in electronic health records and have seen \nthe benefits of these investments. Since its implementation, these \nprograms have helped hundreds of thousands of providers and hospitals \nnationwide establish and effectively use electronic health records. \nHowever, eligibility requirements for these incentives payments have \nprevented some low-income providers from receiving them.\n  While electronic health records are a vital part of any quality \nhealth practice, they are in some ways even more important for clinics \nthat serve low income, uninsured, and underinsured populations. These \npatients often seek services from any number of settings rather than \nreturning to a set primary care provider. When the clinics that serve a \nparticular population are able to establish and maintain electronic \nhealth records for their patients, it is far more likely that a \npatient's record will be available to their health care providers even \nif the patient is seeing a different provider in a different clinic. \nThis allows an individual's health care providers to have access to a \ncomplete medical history, improving their ability to form a diagnosis, \npreventing unnecessary duplication of tests, and reducing costs for the \npatients and government. This measure also will allow safety net \nclinics to better communicate with patients about necessary screenings \nand help to make sure patients are taking medications as prescribed and \nnot ``doctor shopping'' for inappropriate medication.\n  The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health, \nHITECH, Act created financial incentives called ``meaningful use'' \nincentives for both Medicare and Medicaid providers to adopt and \nmeaningfully use implement and support electronic health records. While \nthe current program has helped thousands of providers, practices, and \nhospitals nationwide, many safety net providers and clinics have not \nbeen able to benefit from the incentives. Given that Medicaid \neligibility levels are so low in many states, it is difficult for many \nsafety net providers to meet the 30 percent Medicaid patient threshold \nrequired to participate in the Medicaid electronic health records \nincentive program even though their patients are predominately low-\nincome.\n  Congress addressed this problem only for practitioners working in \nFederally-qualified health centers and rural health centers by creating \na 30 percent ``needy'' threshold in the HITECH Act for those providers. \nUnfortunately, the law failed to provide similar support for other \nproviders serving low-income individuals.\n  The MITECH Act of 2013 seeks to eliminate these barriers, which \nprevent many safety net providers from qualifying for Medicaid \nelectronic health record incentive payments. The bill will improve \naccess to incentives for safety net providers that were left out of the \nHITECH Act's efforts. Additionally, the MITECH Act requires the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to develop a methodology to \nallow these safety net clinics to be eligible for payments as an \nentity, similar to the current process that exists for hospitals.\n  Access to Medicaid electronic health records incentives will allow \nsafety net clinics to better communicate with patients about necessary \nscreenings, help ensure compliance with prescription drugs, reduce \nunnecessary duplication of tests and will strengthen the safety net \nwhich provides essential care to so many Americans.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill. In doing so, we will offer \nvital support to safety net providers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Coons, and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 1291. A bill to strengthen families' engagement in the education \nof their children; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce the Family Engagement in \nEducation Act with my colleagues Senator Coons and Senator Whitehouse. \nI thank Representative Thompson for introducing the House companion of \nthis bipartisan bill.\n  Our legislation will strengthen family engagement in education at the \nlocal, state, and national levels. It will empower parents by \nincreasing school district resources dedicated to family engagement \nactivities from one percent to 2 percent of the district's Title I \nallocation. It will also improve the quality of family engagement \npractices at the school level by requiring school districts to develop \nand implement standards-based policies and practices for family-school \npartnerships. It will build State and local capacity for effective \nfamily engagement in education by setting aside at least 0.3 percent of \nthe State Title I allocation for statewide family engagement in \neducation activities, such as establishing statewide family engagement \ncenters to continue and enhance the work that had been supported \nthrough the Parent Information Resource Centers. For states with Title \nI-A allocations above $60 million, the State Educational agency will \nmake grants to at least one local family engagement in education center \nto provide innovative programming and services, such as leadership \ntraining and family literacy, to local families and to remove barriers \nto family engagement, and to support State-level activities in the \nhighest need areas of the State. Finally, at the national level, our \nlegislation will require the Secretary of Education the convene \npractitioners, researchers, and other experts in the field of family \nengagement in education to develop recommended metrics for measuring \nthe quality and outcomes of family engagement in a child's education.\n  Research demonstrates that family engagement in a child's education \nincreases student achievement, improves attendance, and reduces dropout \nrates. A study by Anne Seitsinger and Steven Brand at the University of \nRhode Island's Center for School Improvement and Educational Policy \nfound that students whose parents support their education through \nlearning activities at home and discuss the importance of education \nperform better in school. Yet too often, family engagement is not built \ninto our school improvement efforts in a systematic way. The Family \nEngagement in Education Act will promote meaningful family engagement\n\n[[Page S5672]]\n\npolicies and programs at the national, state, and local levels to \nensure that all students are on track to be career and college-ready.\n  This legislation builds on my successful efforts in the last \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, ESEA, \nthe 2001 No Child Left Behind Act, to incorporate provisions throughout \nthe law to strengthen and boost parental involvement. It is also in \nline with the administration's blueprint for the ESEA reauthorization, \nwhich calls for doubling the amount that school districts are required \nto set aside for parental involvement and encouraging states to use \nsome of their Title I funding to support local family engagement \ncenters in education.\n  Developed with the National Family, School, and Community Engagement \nWorking Group, which includes organizations such as National PTA, \nUnited Way Worldwide, Harvard Family Research Project, and National \nCouncil of La Raza, and endorsed by hundreds of local, state, and \nnational organizations, this legislation represents the broad consensus \nthat we must do a better job of engaging families in all aspects of \ntheir children's education.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the Family Engagement in Education \nAct, and to work for its inclusion in the forthcoming debate to \nreauthorize and renew the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/11/senate-section/article/S5672-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n          COMMITTEE ON HEALTH, EDUCATION, LABOR, AND PENSIONS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.
