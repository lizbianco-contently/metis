The clerk will report the bill by \ntitle.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 243, S. 1356, a bill to \n     amend the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 to strengthen the \n     United States workforce development system through innovation \n     in, and alignment and improvement of, employment, training, \n     and education programs in the United States, and to promote \n     individual and national economic growth, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID.

At 5 p.m. the \nSenate will proceed to executive session to consider the nomination of \nPatricia Millett to be U.S. circuit judge for the DC Circuit \npostcloture. At 5:30 p.m. then, the Senate will vote on confirmation of \nthe Millett nomination.\n\n\nMeasures Placed On The Calendar--S. 1774, S. 1775, H.R. 1965, and H.R. \n                                  2728\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think there are four bills--and the clerk \ncan help both of us--at the desk due for a second reading.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will read the bills by \ntitle for the second time.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1774) to reauthorize the Undetectable Firearms \n     Act of 1988 for 1 year.\n       A bill (S. 1775) to improve the sexual assault prevention \n     and response programs and activities of the Department of \n     Defense, and for other purposes.\n       A bill (H.R. 1965) to streamline and ensure onshore energy \n     permitting, provide for onshore leasing certainty, and give \n     certainty to oil shale development for American energy \n     security, economic development, and job creation, and for \n     other purposes.\n       A bill (H.R. 2728) to recognize States' authority to \n     regulate oil and gas operations and promote American energy \n     security, development, and job creation.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I object to any further proceedings with \nrespect to these bills en bloc.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection having been heard, the \nbills will be placed on the calendar.\n\n\n                           The Next Two Weeks\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, welcome back. I hope the Acting President \npro tempore and staff and all the other Senators had a wonderful \nThanksgiving. It was a very good Thanksgiving for us. We had all of our \nchildren and all of our grandchildren, except one; she had to work. She \nlives in New York now.\n  This week the U.S. Senate begins a short 2-week work period, and I \nhope it is only 2 weeks. But it could bleed over the weekend before \nChristmas. I know I come to the floor and say a lot of times that we \nare going to have to work weekends, but we may really have to work the \nnext couple weekends. We have had a wonderful 2-week break. It was \nimportant for all of us.\n\n\n                       Remembering Nelson Mandela\n\n  But before I discuss the business before this body, I mourn--as we \nall mourn--the loss but I also celebrate the life of South Africa's \ngreat emancipator Nelson Mandela. He once said: ``Difficulties break \nsome men but make\n\n[[Page S8540]]\n\nothers.'' His dedication to peace and justice was forged in the fire of \nadversity--27 years in prison, among other things.\n  But while he endured great hardship for the cause of universal \nsuffrage, his capacity for forgiveness was as boundless as his \ndedication to democracy, freedom, and equality.\n  He leaves a legacy that is so significant. It will inspire current \nand future leaders for generations to come.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. President, now as to our schedule. This week, as South Africa \nmourns the founder of its democracy, the Senate must continue its work \nin our democracy.\n  I suggest to my colleagues that the Senate, as I have indicated, will \nwork long nights--I think we are going to come in earlier than we \nnormally do--and possibly weekends to complete the workload we have \nbefore the holidays.\n  During this next work period--the one we are now engaged in--we must \ncomplete work on the National Defense Authorization Act. It is my \nunderstanding that the two bodies, the two committees, have come up \nwith something. I hope we get a message from the House soon, and I hope \nwe can dispose of this very quickly.\n  We must address the issue of additional sanctions against Iran. We \nmust pass an agriculture jobs conference report. We must ensure seniors \non Medicare can keep their doctors by adjusting physician payments. We \nmust consider a large number of nominations. And we must complete a \nbudget agreement that protects our economy and ensures our government \ncan continue the work of the people.\n  I am not going to talk about each of these individually other than \nthat I think it is so shortsighted what the Republicans are doing \nregarding the famous SGR or physician payments for Medicare. There is \nmoney to take care of this problem--a number of different sources--not \nthe least of which are the overseas contingency funds. We had money set \naside for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. They are being phased out. \nThere is still almost $1 trillion left. I cannot understand why the \nRepublicans refuse to use that money. No one except the Republicans \nopposes closing these tax loopholes--and not Republicans around the \ncountry. It is only the Republicans in Congress who oppose them, not \nRepublicans around the country. These loopholes are so big you could \ndrive the biggest vehicle in the world through them. But we are where \nwe are.\n  Despite the costly Republican government shutdown this fall, last \nweek's jobs report proved that the American economy continues to gain \nsteam. Private sector businesses have added more than 8 million jobs \nover the last 45 consecutive months.\n  If Republicans had not insisted on shortsighted, draconian cuts that \nforced layoffs of tens of thousands of teachers, firefighters, and \npolice officers, the economy would be growing even faster than it is \ntoday. The Acting President pro tempore knows--we all know--that we \nneed an infrastructure program. For every $1 billion we spend as a \ngovernment on infrastructure--roads, bridges, dams, highways, water and \nsewer systems--we create almost 50,000 high-paying jobs.\n\n  Despite last week's good economic news, Congress can and must do even \nmore to create jobs for the millions of Americans who are still looking \nfor work.\n  As to unemployment compensation, we need these extended benefits. \nThere are 1.5 million people in America who have been out of work for \nmore than 26 weeks. We must replace the meat-ax cuts that have happened \nwith the sequestration with smart savings, reducing the deficit by \nclosing wasteful tax loopholes, and making job-creating investments \nthat spur economic growth.\n  As we close out this year, I hope Republicans and Democrats can put \naside our differences and work together to produce results for the \nmiddle class.\n  The Acting President pro tempore served in the House. I served in the \nHouse. I am fortunate to serve here in the Senate. When I first came to \nthis body, Democrats had to focus on what they thought the foundation \nof democracy was. Republicans did the same. They thought they knew the \nright thing to do. But, you know, we could never get what we wanted. \nEach side could not get what it thought was the way it should be. So \nwhat did we do? We worked together and came up with compromises to move \nlegislation forward. Let's get back to where we were. That is what this \nbody needs. So I hope we can put aside our differences and work \ntogether like we used to.\n  It is also time for Republicans to work with us--instead of against \nus--to make the landmark health reform law more workable.\n  I remind my Republican colleagues that the Affordable Care Act is the \nlaw and has been the law of the land for 4 years, and it was upheld by \nthe Supreme Court.\n  As Democrats have predicted for months, enrollment in Affordable Care \nAct exchanges is picking up speed as we approach the New Year. As \nAmericans learn more about the benefits of this law, more and more of \nthem are logging on to shop for affordable, quality insurance through \nthe State and national exchanges. The rollout of the national \nAffordable Care Act Web site was rocky, to say the least, when it came \nout.\n  Congress had to make crucial improvements to other landmark programs, \nsuch as Social Security and Medicare, when they were first enacted as \nwell. These big legislative deals can have some wrinkles in them. It \ndoes not mean Social Security is bad. It does not mean Medicare is bad. \nIt means they are hard to get started. It is just the same for \nObamaCare.\n  But now, I repeat, many of the major problems with the health care \nsite have been fixed, hundreds of thousands of Americans are logging on \nevery day to research plans they think could work for them and sign up \nfor insurance they know they need.\n  States that embraced the Affordable Care Act--such as Kentucky and \nWashington--have also reported successes with their exchanges. And \nthanks to the health care law, in a few short weeks no one can ever \nagain be denied insurance just because they have a preexisting \ncondition--because they are a cancer survivor, because they live with \ndiabetes, because they had acne growing up or because they are a woman.\n  Because of this landmark law, insurance companies can no longer \ncancel your policy when you get sick, charge you more, I repeat, \nbecause you are a woman, or set an arbitrary limit on the care you \nreceive.\n  Millions of seniors have saved billions of dollars on medicine \nbecause of the Affordable Care Act. Why? Because it closed the gap in \nprescription drug coverage, the so-called doughnut hole.\n  Millions of young people have stayed on their parents' health plans. \nAnd 17 million Americans will qualify for tax credits to purchase the \ncoverage they need and the coverage they deserve.\n  There are still problems with the Affordable Care Act and ways we can \nmake it better if we work together. But we cannot improve the law \nwithout help from some reasonable Republicans. It time for my \nRepublican colleagues to give up their fantasy of repealing a law that \nis already benefiting tens of millions of Americans and start working \nwith us to make the Affordable Care Act succeed instead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/09/senate-section/article/S8540-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  Mr. REID.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will be in a period of morning business until 4 o'clock p.m., \nwith Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              Minimum Wage\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, 75 years ago President Roosevelt signed the \nFair Labor Standards Act written, in\n\n[[Page S8541]]\n\npart, by Senator Hugo Black of Alabama. He actually sat at this desk as \nhe was writing the minimum wage law and some of the Fair Labor \nStandards Act legislation in the 1930s.\n  This legislation ensured that American workers would receive a \nminimum wage and work reasonable hours. We know what that has done for \nfamilies in this country. We also know that the minimum wage hasn't \neven been close to keeping up with the cost of living and with \ninflation. We also know a number of other facts about the minimum wage.\n  The minimum wage is $7.25 an hour. Many minimum wage workers are \nworking and making $7.25, $8 or $9--less than what we want to raise the \nminimum wage to so all would get a raise. We know that many of those \nworkers work in the fast food industry.\n  The CEO of a fast food corporation makes about $8.7 million or $8 \nmillion a year, while his employees average something around $19,000 a \nyear.\n  I am not one of those who says they have to work a million hours to \nget to the $8 million a year. To put into perspective what has happened \nwith wages, as wages for CEOs and top management have gone up, we have \nseen the productivity of workers go up. We know that wages for those \nworkers have simply not kept up, not only for minimum-wage workers but \nfor workers overall.\n  Since the 1970s, and especially since 2000, profits have gone up, \nproductivity has gone up, executive salaries have gone up dramatically, \nyet workers wages have been stagnant. There is no better example of \nthat than the minimum wage. The minimum wage was raised my first year \nin the Senate.\n  My first speech on the Senate floor was with Senator Barack Obama \nsitting in the Presiding Officer's chair. Senator Kennedy and Senator \nByrd were on the floor that day talking about and debating increasing \nthe minimum wage.\n  We did that in a bipartisan way in 2007. The bill was signed by \nPresident Bush. That is good news.\n  The bad news is there was no cost-of-living adjustment. There was no \nescalation so that the wage would keep up with inflation. There has not \nbeen a minimum wage increase since then.\n  Here is another fact about the minimum wage. For tipped workers, \nthose who work in diners--in many cases those who work pushing \nwheelchairs at airports don't work for the airlines. They work for a \nsubcontracting company that pays subminimum wage.\n  Valets and people who are in positions in hotels where they might get \ntipped, their minimum wage is only $2.13 an hour. A woman working the \nfloors of a diner, a man who is pushing a wheelchair or driving a cart \nin an airport, their minimum wage is only $2.13 an hour. Some are paid \nmore than that, but some of them are paid as little as $2, $3 or $4 an \nhour, supposedly expecting that tips will make up the difference and \nget them to the minimum wage or above.\n  The assistant majority leader, who has joined me on the floor, has \nbeen working with Senator Harkin and several others of us on \nlegislation for the new minimum wage increase. We want to increase the \nminimum wage $2.10 an hour, 90 cents at the President's signature, then \nanother 90 cents, and another 90 cents. We also want to increase the \ntipped minimum wage--not increased for 22 years--to lock it in at 70 \npercent of the real minimum wage.\n  As the real minimum wage increases by the year 2016 under our \nlegislation, and a worker's minimum wage would then be $10.10 an hour, \na subminimum wage of a tipped employee in an airport or restaurant \nwould then be $7 and a few cents an hour. Both of those wages, the \ntipped minimum wage and a minimum wage, will have a cost-of-living \nadjustment so we don't have to come back every 6 years and have a big \npolitical fight to raise the minimum wage. It shouldn't be a big \npolitical fight because clearly people in this country overwhelmingly--\nDemocrats, independents, and Republicans--think the minimum wage should \nbe increased.\n  It will not only be the tipped employee or the minimum wage worker at \na fast-food restaurant who gets a raise from what is now $7.50 or $8 an \nhour or even $9 an hour. As the minimum wage goes up, so will the wages \nfor many of low-income, slightly above minimum wage workers.\n  In a fast food restaurant where perhaps the night manager may make a \ncouple of dollars more an hour than the line workers who are at the \ncounter--although the night manager does plenty of that too--the night \nmanager might make a couple of dollars above or $3 above minimum wage. \nThere we raise the minimum wage, thus raising everybody's wage. Then \nthe night manager's wage will increase too.\n  The opponents to the minimum wage--and it is amazing to me that \npeople can sit in this institution, with the good salaries that we make \nas Members of the Senate and Members of the House in both parties, with \ngood benefits, good health insurance, decent pensions paid for by \ntaxpayers, and oppose the minimum wage. It equally amazes me that they \ncan oppose extending unemployment benefits. In my State alone--and I \nknow in the assistant majority leader's State of Illinois and in the \nPresiding Officer's State, for a significant number of people, over \n120,000, in my State alone, their Christmas present will be that \nunemployment benefits have stopped for them, have been eliminated, \nunless Congress acts. That is why it is so important, not only to enact \na minimum wage in the weeks ahead but that we extend unemployment \nbenefits for those workers who are looking for jobs.\n  These aren't people who don't want to work. These are people looking \nfor jobs. They have to look for jobs in order to qualify. It is not a \nlot of money. It is 40 or 50 percent typically of their wage, of what \nthey used to make.\n  There aren't enough jobs in this country. There aren't enough jobs in \nConnecticut, Illinois, and Ohio that they can find jobs, and then we \ntake the unemployment benefits away.\n  No. 1, think of what it means to that family and, No. 2, as the \nassistant majority leader knows, this helps our economy. When people \nare receiving unemployment benefits, they are spending it. They are \nspending it in Toledo at the grocery store. They are spending it in \nCleveland at the hardware store. They are spending it in Dayton at \nthe auto repair shop to fix their car, so they can go out, get a job, \nand go to work. All of those are reasons why extending the minimum wage \nand extending unemployment insurance is so important.\n\n  One further point before yielding to the assistant majority leader \nfrom Illinois, unemployment is not called welfare, it is unemployment \ninsurance. People pay in when they are working. They hope they are \ngoing to pay in for a long time and that they are not going to lose \ntheir jobs. But if they lose their jobs, they collect their insurance. \nThey paid in. That is what insurance is. If things aren't working \nright, one gets unemployment benefits, unemployment insurance, social \ninsurance. This is why this is so important.\n  I yield to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Ohio yield for a question through \nthe Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask of the Senator from Ohio if he recalls that it was \nnot that long ago the issues that we are discussing were marginally \nbipartisan issues. When it came to raising the minimum wage \nperiodically, Senator Ted Kennedy, who used to sit back at that desk, \nled the effort. It would turn out to be a bipartisan vote to increase \nthe minimum wage.\n  Over the years, that reflected a bipartisan consensus that if one is \nworking for a living in America, they ought to be able to get by or at \nleast have a little bit put away for their future.\n  We are finding more and more that people working for a minimum wage \ncannot get by. I listened to public radio over the break. There was a \nlady on there who works in the hospitality industry, I believe, and \nexplained she was on food stamps. She said she had a small family and \nmade $7.25 an hour. With her children she still qualified for SNAP, the \nfood stamp program.\n  I did a quick calculation in my mind--I believe this is correct--and \nshe was making somewhere in the range of $14,000 to $15,000 a year at \n$7.25 an hour, the minimum wage in many parts of the United States. She \nstill qualified for a helping hand to feed her children.\n  This is not a lazy person. This is a person who gets up and goes to \nwork. My guess is it is not an easy job. She is\n\n[[Page S8542]]\n\nmaking $7.25 but still needs a helping hand.\n  I find it interesting that issues that used to be bipartisan to help \npeople such as her, working people, have now become too partisan. We \nshould have a bipartisan consensus that regularly we increase the \nminimum wage in America to keep up with the cost of living. I hope we \nall agree that if we have a working mom, who is doing her best, and \nneeds a helping hand to feed her children, food stamps should be \navailable to her.\n  Of the 47 million Americans receiving food stamps, 22 million of the \n47 million are children, 1 million are veterans, and 9 million are \nelderly and disabled. Three-fourths of the recipients of food stamps \nfall into those categories: children, veterans, the elderly, and the \ndisabled. Yet we are up against a battle on the farm bill about whether \nwe are going to make deep cuts in food stamps. It seems to me this is \ncounterproductive. We should be helping working families--those who \nstruggle paycheck to paycheck--to get by, to at least feed their \nchildren.\n  Going back to the point made by the Senator from Ohio, when we look \nacross the board at the vulnerability of working families, it is wages, \nfood on the table, and many times it turns out to be health insurance. \nThe number one reason for bankruptcy in America today is the failure of \npeople to be able to pay their medical bills.\n  What we are trying to do with the Affordable Care Act is to say to \neveryone in my State, the 1.8 million uninsured people in Illinois, we \nwill give them a chance--possibly for the first time in their lives--to \nhave health insurance so they won't go broke when they get sick. To me, \nwhen we start putting it together, it is the paycheck, the food, the \nhealth care, and the housing.\n  In a country such as ours that wants to build the next middle class, \nto me this is the bedrock of what we need to provide to working \nfamilies. It seems we have fallen far away from that goal of trying to \nprovide for working families. It has become too partisan.\n  I was on a talk show with the Senator from Ohio who shares the State \nwith Senator Brown, and he gave the classic argument against raising \nthe minimum wage: It is a job killer. He said: If we raise the wage 50 \ncents, $1 an hour, whatever it is, there will be fewer jobs.\n  It turns out that history and the economic analyses prove him wrong. \nThat is the argument that has been made against increasing the minimum \nwage since Franklin Roosevelt first increased it back in the 1930s.\n  I ask the Senator from Ohio, when we take a look at the vulnerability \nof working families in America and those who have lost their jobs \ntrying to find another, the basics that we are talking about give them \na fighting chance to survive, to help raise their families, and maybe \nto send their kids to school for a better education and for a better \nfuture. Failing to do that does just the opposite.\n  Last week fast food workers across the country led a 1-day strike to \nbring attention to low-wage workers who can't make a living on their \ncurrent wages.In Chicago, some 200 workers took to the street in \nprotest.\n  This is only one part of a much larger discussion in recent days \nabout growing economic disparities in this country and the plight of \nlow-wage workers.In November, Pope Francis stated, ``While earnings of \na minority are growing, so too is the gap separating the majority from \nthe prosperity enjoyed by those happy few.''\n  Only last week President Obama echoed these concerns in his address \nfocused specifically on income inequality.In a speech at the Center for \nAmerican Progress, the President noted that more than half of all \nAmericans at some point in their lives will experience poverty.\n  The week before Thanksgiving, a Walmart in Ohio was running a food \ndrive to help the hungry have a happy Thanksgiving.That kind of \ngenerosity and empathy is commendable. What is noteworthy, though, is \nthat the food drive was specifically to support Walmart associates--\ntheir own employees--in need.\n  It reminded me of an effort McDonalds launched earlier this year to \nhelp their employees create a budget.\n  According to that budget, the only way to make ends meet for someone \nmaking the minimum wage and working 40 hours a week at McDonalds would \nbe to work a second job.\n  Washington Post's Wonkblog analyzed the chart and found that a worker \nmaking the minimum wage would have to work 75 hours a week to have the \nafter-tax income in the McDonalds sample budget.\n  But low wages are not a problem just in the fast food industry or \nother historically low-wage fields; it is catching up to other \ntraditional jobs that used to be able to support a family.\n  There may be fewer better examples of this than in the banking \nsector.\n  The banking industry last year posted $141.3 billion in profits.\n  The median executive pay--$552,000.\n  And yet a recent report found that 39 percent of bank tellers in New \nYork are enrolled in some form of public assistance.\n  Low wage work is just not enough to get by.\n  Working 40 hours per week at $7.25 per hour translates to $15,080 per \nyear.\n  That's about $400 less than the Federal poverty level guidelines for \na family of two.\n  If we accept the McDonald's sample budget, a worker making the \nminimum wage would have to work 75 hours a week to have the after-tax \nincome necessary to make ends meet. Working 75 hours a week at minimum \nwage--with no vacation days and limited benefits, if any--one can make \n$24,720 a year, after tax.\n  I want to say that it is not possible, but the reality is that many \npeople do it. Yet how do people raise a family working that many hours?\n  One way people get by is they are forced to turn to government \nassistance programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, \nSNAP, Low-Income Heating and Energy Assistance, LIHEAP, the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, CHIP, the Emergency Food Assistance program, \nTEFAP, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, TANF, Section 8 housing \nassistance, and, yes, the Affordable Care Act.\n  According to a recent UC Berkeley study, undertaken in partnership \nwith the University of Illinois, 52 percent of families of fast-food \nworkers are enrolled in one or more public assistance programs. \nSubsidizing low wage employment through these programs costs the \nFederal Government $3.9 billion annually.\n  Instead of trying to find solutions to ensure full time work is \nadequate to support a family, many of my colleagues are attacking the \nvery public assistance programs that allow working families at minimum \nwage jobs to get by.\n  For many of these working families, SNAP is the first place to turn.\n  At a time when almost 15 percent of households have trouble keeping \nfood on the table, SNAP has helped 47 million Americans buy \ngroceries.In Illinois, more than 2 million people--that is in one in \nseven residents--rely on SNAP benefits to buy the food they need.\n  In my lifetime, Walmart transitioned to also selling food. Walmart \nnow accounts for nearly 30 percent of all groceries sold in the United \nStates.Yet after working at a grocery store all day, imagine having to \nturn to your SNAP benefits to be able to take your own groceries home \nwith you or after working at the grocery store all day, a person must \nturn to their local food bank.\n  This is the reality for working people. I wish to stress--working \npeople.\n  The House Republican solution for this is in its farm bill, where it \ncut $40 billion from SNAP. The House bill gets its ``savings'' by \nkicking 3.8 million people out of the program. That includes children, \nsingle mothers, unemployed veterans, and Americans who get temporary \nhelp from SNAP to make ends meet while they look for work.\n  This is unacceptable. If a farm bill conference agreement were to \nreach the floor including the House language, I would vote against it \nwithout a second thought.\n  But it doesn't stop with SNAP.\n  One of biggest challenges for low-income workers is that they are \nliving paycheck-to-paycheck, making sacrifices simply to keep the heat \non--with no savings for emergencies, and most low-income workers have \nno healthcare coverage.With no savings\n\n[[Page S8543]]\n\nand no health care. When someone in the family is too sick to ignore \nit, the emergency room is the only real option.\n  With the Affordable Care Act, many of these workers and their \nfamilies can now afford health care, either through the expansion of \nMedicaid or, in the very near future through a private plan in the \nexchanges, using Federal subsidies.According to the CBO, 12 million \npeople in America are newly eligible for Medicaid. Another 23 million \npeople will be able to buy private health insurance.\n  How are Republican proposing to help these working families? They \nwant to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n  Go back to no coverage. Apparently, these families don't work hard \nenough to deserve it.\n  We have to protect these programs, but we need to do more than that.\n  More and more working families are being forced to rely on government \nassistance programs because their work does not support a living wage.\n  If working should be a requirement for receiving public assistance, I \nwould take it a step further and propose that if someone is working \nfull time, they shouldn't need public assistance.\n  Since 1967, the Federal minimum wage has increased from $1.40 to \n$7.25.While at first glance this seems like significant progress, when \nadjusted to current dollars the value of the minimum wage has actually \ndeclined by 12.1 percent.\n  Had the minimum wage kept pace with inflation, it would be $10.74 an \nhour today.If the minimum wage were increased to $10.10, more than 30 \nmillion workers would receive a raise, and 88 percent of those workers \nare adults.\n  If the minimum wage were $10.10, a full-time worker being paid \nminimum wage would go from making $15,080 a year to $21,000.That can be \nthe difference between getting by and living in poverty.\n  Workers in America, full-time workers, are falling behind.\n  Attacking or cutting programs that working poor or needy rely on will \nnot solve the problem. It only ignores it.\n  In the coming weeks I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting \npolicies that provide all Americans with the opportunity to improve \ntheir lives. Full-time, low-wage workers should not have to live in \npoverty.\n  I would ask the Senator from Ohio if he would include in this the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  Mr. BROWN. That is right. First, the points that the assistant \nmajority leader was making about the bipartisanship has been exactly \nright. What is most--not discouraging but perhaps the most \ndisappointing part of this is even as recently as 2007, when President \nBush signed this bill--it was my first month or two in the Senate when \nwe passed it. It was a big bipartisan vote in the House. I don't \nremember exactly the numbers in the Senate. Many Republicans joined. I \nbelieve almost every Democrat or maybe every Democrat--but it was \ngladly signed by the Republican President of the United States.\n  From the time of the minimum wage, when Senator Hugo Black sat at \nthis desk and helped to write the minimum wage law and President \nRoosevelt signed the bill, for all of these decades the minimum wage in \nfits and starts has kept up with inflation--most of the time--until the \n1980s. It has been signed on by people from both parties; the same with \nthe extension of unemployment benefits that we discussed, this \nextension of unemployment benefits, social insurance. They pay in when \nthey don't need it. When they need it, they can take money out of the \nsocial insurance fund and receive unemployment benefits if they can't \nfind a job.\n  These are very tough times. Some of my colleagues, I don't think, \nunderstand sometimes how tough a time it is for so many families.\n  The President of the United States, the last President from Illinois \nbefore this one, Abraham Lincoln, used to talk about getting out of the \nWhite House and going out and getting his public opinion bath that he \nneeded to hear from the public.\n  I know Senator Durbin does that throughout his State of Illinois. I \nknow Senator Murphy of Connecticut, the Presiding Officer, does the \nsame.\n  We go out and listen to people. We are talking to somebody making $8 \nor $9 an hour, and this minimum increase will increase their pay. They \nprobably don't have insurance because they can't afford it. They are \nprobably eligible for the SNAP program because of their low income, and \nso it is the least we can do.\n\n  These are people who work as hard as we do. We have jobs we get a lot \nout of. We are well paid, we have good benefits, and we also have \nwonderful opportunities to serve the public. So many people in these \njobs are barely making it. They work jobs where they are on their feet \nall day. The woman in the diner is making $3 or $4 an hour and hoping \npeople will tip her to get her up to $7 or $8 or $9 an hour. She is \nworking every bit as hard as my colleagues and I work. Yet she has so \nlittle to show for it.\n  This is an opportunity for us, as people who care about this country \nand care about the people who live in this country--people who are \ndoing such hard work cleaning hotel rooms, cleaning our schools, making \nsure our schools are clean and the trash is taken out, people who are \nserving our food--for the people in these kinds of jobs--home care \nworkers who are barely making it--the least we can do is make sure the \nminimum wage gets them somewhat close to a decent lifestyle and \nstandard of living and that we do better, if they are laid off, with \nunemployment insurance and that they get a chance with the Affordable \nCare Act so they can buy affordable health insurance because they will \nget some help and they can draw on food stamps if they are eligible, if \nthey need them on these low wages.\n  There is no reason we can't, in the Christmas spirit, if you will, do \nwhat has been done on a bipartisan basis during my lifetime and that of \nmy colleague Senator Durbin, where both parties would step up and do \nit.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if my colleague will yield, through the \nChair, for one last point, he raised something that brought to my mind \na recent story I read about the new Pope, Pope Francis. What an \nextraordinary man, this Catholic. I am amazed at this man, his humility \nand his popularity with Catholics and non-Catholics alike, those of \ndifferent faiths and those of no faith. They say that of an evening he \nwill take off his papal garb and put a simple suit on and go out into \nthe streets of Rome with a friend and meet with poor people and talk to \nthem. I can't even envision in my mind what that must be like, but it \nsure tells me a lot about him, and I think it is a reminder to all of \nus of two things: When he gives a message to the world about income \ninequality, it is not a political message to the United States or one \ncountry; it is a more basic message about the values in life whatever \nyour religious beliefs or whether you have a religious belief.\n  When he takes off the papal garb and goes out as an ordinary person, \nI hope it is a reminder to all of us that we need to keep in touch with \nthe very people we represent, some of whom are not wealthy enough to \nhave a lobbyist or to be politically articulate during a campaign but \ndeserve our representation just as much.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank my colleague.\n  Pope Francis I, as he integrated these kinds of things into his life, \nhe exhorted his parish priests--similar to Lincoln saying ``I need my \npublic opinion bath''--to smell like the flock and to get among people \nand talk to them and learn from them, to smell like the flock, to be \none of them. I am not Catholic. I know my friend from Illinois is Roman \nCatholic. But this Pope has really brought us to a different level. He \nhas called upon our better angels, if you will.\n  Before yielding to Senator Durbin for his remarks, I have one more \npoint to make about the minimum wage. The belief among many is that the \nminimum wage is for a bunch of teenagers. That is simply not true. Most \nminimum wage earners in this country are not teenagers; most of them \nare supporting themselves and in many cases supporting a spouse or a \nfamily or someone in their family who is disabled or a close friend. \nThis is a wage people really depend on to get along. It is not just \nspending money for a high school kid; families depend on this.\n  That is why it is so important that in the next few weeks we raise \nthe minimum wage; tie this subminimum wage, tipped wage, to that \nincrease and\n\n[[Page S8544]]\n\nindex it for inflation so we don't have to do this every 3 or 4 years \njust to keep up with inflation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/09/senate-section/article/S8544-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8544-S8548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING PRESIDENT NELSON MANDELA\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to join my colleagues and \npeople all around the world in expressing my condolences to the people \nof South Africa on the passing of their great leader Nelson Mandela.\n  Nelson Mandela ended his extraordinary autobiography, entitled ``Long \nWalk to Freedom,'' with these words:\n\n       I have walked that long road to freedom. I have tried not \n     to falter; I have made missteps along the way. But I have \n     discovered the secret that after climbing a great hill, one \n     only finds that there are many more hills to climb. I have \n     taken a moment here to rest, to steal a view of the glorious \n     vista that surrounds me, to look back on the distance I have \n     come. But I can rest only for a moment, for with freedom \n     comes responsibilities, and I dare not linger, for my long \n     walk is not yet ended.\n\n  Sadly, President Nelson Mandela's long walk and his noble life are \nindeed now ended, but his influence on the world will endure for a long \ntime to come. As the editorial cartoonist for the Washington Post put \nit, Nelson Mandela was ``larger than life--and death.''\n  Through enormous strength of character and a determination unlike \nmany people in this world, Nelson Mandela helped his beloved South \nAfrica to end the vicious system of apartheid and begin a new walk \ntoward multiracial democracy. His dream, he often said, was that South \nAfrica would become ``a rainbow nation at peace with itself and with \nthe world.''\n  Nelson Mandela astonished the world with his capacity to forgive--\neven to forgive those who jailed him and persecuted his family. There \nwas an interview on television I saw yesterday morning on ABC in which \nNelson Mandela spoke about his imprisonment shortly after he had been \nreleased. He had spent 27 years in prison, part of it on Robben Island, \nwhich I have had the opportunity to visit, to actually stand in Nelson \nMandela's tiny cell. It is an island off of Capetown. The waters around \nit are shark infested so the prisoners won't try to escape from that \nisland. They can just barely make out the land mass away from that \nisland, but they are separated--separated on this piece of land in the \nmiddle of this ocean. There Nelson Mandela lived for almost 25 years. \nHe lived in this cell, many times in isolation. He labored in a quarry \nnearby, which we visited. The sunlight bouncing off of the rocks in \nthat quarry virtually blinded him for the rest of his life. He wore \nsunglasses and begged photographers not to use flashbulbs the rest of \nhis life because of the damage that had been done to his eyes.\n  The prisoners on Robben Island--many of them sharing his political \nphilosophy and opposing apartheid--tried to create a university \natmosphere where they taught one another all they could remember and \nall they knew. They devoured information from the outside world in an \neffort to try to keep in touch with what was going on.\n  In this interview, as he was released from his imprisonment, Nelson \nMandela was asked by the interviewer about his warden and his guards at \nthe prison. He talked about the deep emotional ties they developed, how \nthis guard he came to know--I believe his name was Gregory--was a real \ngentleman, in the words of Nelson Mandela, and how, when Mandela was \nfinally released, there was a moment of emotion as they knew they would \npart after all these years of such a close relationship. I recall that \nstory because so many times when I have given commencement addresses I \nhave used as an example Nelson Mandela's decision, when elected \nPresident of South Africa, to invite that guard from his prison to be \nthere as one of his honored guests at his inauguration as President of \nSouth Africa. That, to me, speaks volumes.\n  Nelson Mandela taught us powerful lessons about justice, tolerance, \nand reconciliation. As the first democratically elected President of \nSouth Africa, Mandela was the father of a new nation. Like George \nWashington, the father of our Nation, he chose consciously, \ndeliberately, to walk away from power. In doing so, he reminded us that \nthe peaceful, orderly transition of power is one of the hallmarks of a \nreal democracy.\n  The prestigious Ibrahim Prize for Achievement in African Leadership \nwas created in 2007 to recognize African leaders who served their \npeople by voluntarily stepping down from power, as President Mandela \ndid. Sadly, this year, for the second year in a row, the award \ncommittee couldn't identify one African leader who met that standard. \nLeaders in neighboring Zimbabwe, as well as Syria, Egypt, Venezuela, \nCuba, and so many other nations torn by conflict and manipulated \ndivisions, would do well to ponder this measure of Nelson Mandela's \ngreatness.\n  One of the great honors of my life was meeting President Mandela when \nhe came to Washington in September 1998, near the end of his \nPresidency, to receive the Congressional Gold Medal. The Congressional \nGold Medal is the highest honor this Congress can bestow on a civilian. \nPresident Mandela noted that he was humbled to be the first African to \never receive it.\n  In his brief remarks at the Gold Medal ceremony, President Mandela \nthanked the American people and Congress for our help in bringing an \nend to the odious system of apartheid through congressionally imposed \neconomic sanctions and other measures. These are Nelson Mandela's \nwords:\n\n       If today the people of South Africa are free at last to \n     address their basic needs; if the countries of southern \n     Africa have the opportunity to realize the potential for \n     development through cooperation; if Africa can devote all her \n     energies and resources to her reconstruction; then it is not \n     least because the American people identified with and lent \n     their support to the struggle to end apartheid, including \n     critically through action by this Congress.\n\n  I remember that battle. I remember that debate. I was brand new to \nthe U.S. House of Representatives, just a few years in service, and the \ndebate came up as to whether the United States would continue to impose \nsanctions on the apartheid racist Government of South Africa. I sat on \nthe floor, convinced that we should do so, and listened to the critics \nof that policy. Many of them came to the floor and said things I \ncouldn't believe. They characterized Nelson Mandela as nothing more \nthan a Communist who should never be trusted to lead that country. I \nthought to myself, he might have had a flirtation with communism at \nsome point in his life, but this man is speaking to the basic \nprinciples that are consistent with America's values and principles.\n  I found it interesting last week, after Nelson Mandela died, to read \nthe editorial in the Wall Street Journal about Nelson Mandela. I \ncommend it to people to understand where that thinking came from, that \nbelief that the United States should not be involved in trying to \nstrike down the apartheid form of government. If you will read that \neditorial about Nelson Mandela's death, you will find the following \nnames mentioned: Carl Marx, Lenin--I am trying to recall who else. I \nthink Che Guevara was mentioned, as well as communism. Stalin was \nmentioned in there. In just a few sentences about Nelson Mandela, the \nWall Street Journal editors decided to put all those names in there as \ntouchstones and reference points to his life. It is an indication of \nhow people can get it just plain wrong even at the highest levels of \njournalism in the United States, as they did in the debate in Congress.\n  We passed the sanctions legislation in--I believe the year was 1985 \nor 1986. We sent it to President Reagan, and he vetoed it. We overrode \nPresident Reagan's veto so that the sanctions went forward to condemn \napartheid and do what we could to change it in South Africa 30 years \nago.\n  I can recall that because a Congressman at the time, Howard Wolpe of \nMichigan, was the chairman of the Africa subcommittee. He came to me \none day as a new Member of the House and said: I want to do a \ncongressional delegation trip to Africa. Would you like to go?\n  I said: I would be honored. I have never been there, and I would like \nto go.\n  We put our itinerary together, included South Africa, and then, when \nwe applied for visas, that apartheid government denied visas to all the \nMembers of Congress who had voted for sanctions, which included \nChairman\n\n[[Page S8545]]\n\nWolpe and myself, and so the trip never took place. It took several \nyears, a change in government, and the arrival of Nelson Mandela to see \na welcoming South Africa and visas issued to Members of Congress who \nwished to visit.\n  President Mandela asked the American Congress and the people to \ncontinue to walk with the people of South Africa to help them develop \ntheir economy and strengthen their democracy. As I have said, I have \ntraveled to the countries in Africa. I have seen the progress that can \noccur when governments are accountable to their people and really serve \ndemocracy. This Congress can pay a truly fitting tribute to President \nMandela's life by heeding the request he made to us to help Africa, to \nhelp South Africa strengthen its economies in ways that will benefit \nnot only that continent but the United States of America.\n  I mentioned earlier the parallels between President Washington and \nPresident Mandela. Nelson Mandela was also his nation's Abraham \nLincoln. I do not exaggerate. I will close with a story.\n  We all know the words of President Lincoln's majestic second \ninaugural address, which took place right outside those doors. It was \nin 1865. As he looked forward to the end of the Civil War, he turned to \nthis war-torn nation that had lost so many in this battle that had gone \non for years, and he said:\n\n       With malice toward none; with charity for all; with \n     firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let \n     us strive on to finish the work we are on.\n\n  A friend would later note that Lincoln's features when he gave that \naddress were ``haggard with care, tempest tossed and weather beaten.'' \nBut with the nightmare of the Civil War almost over, Washington, DC, \nwas poised for a joyous celebration of victory.\n  For the first time, African-American troops marched down the streets \nin the inaugural parade after President Lincoln gave that address, and \nBlacks mingled with the inaugural crowd right outside here on the \nCapitol lawn.\n  It was a rainy, overcast day when Lincoln gave his second inaugural \naddress. But a friend of his noted: Just as President Lincoln stepped \nforward to take the oath of office, the Sun, which had been obscured by \nrain clouds, burst forth in splendor. President Lincoln saw it. The \nnext day the President asked a friend: Did you notice that sunburst? It \nmade my heart jump.\n  The skies were also overcast the day Nelson Mandela received the \nCongressional Gold Medal here in Washington. On that day, the dark \nbronze bust of Martin Luther King, Jr., had been moved from one side of \nthe Rotunda so that Lincoln and Dr. Martin Luther King appeared to \npreside together over the ceremony awarding the Congressional Gold \nMedal to Nelson Mandela. As President Mandela started to speak, rays of \nsunlight began to pour into the Rotunda. They illuminated the base of \nthe statues first and then rose gradually until, by the time President \nMandela finished speaking, both Lincoln and King were bathed in bright \nsunlight. With a little imagination, you could almost hear Lincoln say: \nDid you notice that sunburst? It made my heart jump.\n  Like Lincoln, President Mandela now belongs to the ages. And while \nour hearts are heavy today with President Mandela's passing, the world \ncan take inspiration from the lessons he taught us while he walked \namong us.\n\n\n              Remembering Du Quoin Mayor John Rednour, Sr.\n\n  As we mourn the passing of Nelson Mandela, the great noble leader who \nchanged history, we also take a moment to recall other leaders closer \nto home. One of those leaders, and a friend of mine, had his memorial \nservice this week. His name was not well known to many outside of \nsouthern Illinois, but he was a good man and a good friend, and he \nworked throughout his life to create opportunities and a sense of \ncommunity. His name was John Rednour, although almost everybody skipped \nthe first name and called him Rednour. He passed away on December 1, at \nage 78. He had just retired as mayor of Du Quoin, IL, a small town in \nsouthern Illinois, where he presided as mayor for a remarkable 24 \nyears. During his tenure, he prided himself on balancing the budget and \ninvesting in the city's future. He did it year after year.\n  Amazingly, public service was his third career. John Rednour began \nhis working life as an ironworker--a member of the United Ironworkers. \nHe also worked as a shoemaker. In 1970, he moved to Du Quoin with his \nwife Wanda and three kids. In the early 1980s, he began his second \ncareer, when he brought together local shareholders and took control of \na struggling local bank. He converted it into one of the soundest, most \nprofitable banks in southern Illinois. But it was John Rednour's third \ncareer--his work as mayor of Du Quoin--that really distinguished his \npublic service. As a mayor, he was a fiscal conservative. But he was \nalso a person who believed in giving people a chance.\n  John Rednour was a proud Democrat. In fact, he was the former \nchairman of the Illinois Democratic Party. He rode on Air Force One \nwith President Jimmy Carter and had good relationships with Presidents \nincluding President Obama. The politicians whose careers he helped \nlaunch or advance could have filled a stadium. But he knew there were \nthings more important than party politics. He always made it a habit to \nmeet with new Du Quoin city council members and offered the same \nadvice: Do what is good for Du Quoin. Do what is right for the people. \nThat is certainly good advice for any officeholder.\n  Over the years, my wife Loretta and I were fortunate to be visitors \nat John Rednour's home at their annual State fair parties for the Du \nQuoin State fair. We always appreciated seeing that great crowd at the \nsocial event of southern Illinois for the year, and then staying \novernight and waking up in the morning as Wanda, his wife, made her \nfamous Texas pancakes. We loved them. And people gathered from all over \nthe community as Wanda kept making the pancakes.\n  John's funeral last week was attended by the Governor of our State, \nPat Quinn, Members of Congress, including current Congressman Bill \nEnyart, former Congressmen Glenn Poshard, Jerry Costello, and Ken Gray, \nand many other elected officials.\n  The anecdote that best captured the spirit of John Rednour was \noffered in eulogy by his grandson. He said he once asked his \ngrandfather why he gave money to homeless people every time he saw \nthem. John Rednour replied: Because it's the right thing to do. Simple \nas that, it was the right thing to do.\n  Carl Sandburg, another son of Illinois, wrote a poem called ``Prayers \nof Steel.'' It is a prayer of a working person asking for a useful \nlife. John Rednour was an ironworker. These words about a steelworker \napply to him as well:\n\n     Lay me on an anvil, O God.\n     Beat me and hammer me into a crowbar.\n     Let me pry loose old walls.\n     Let me lift and loosen old foundations.\n     Lay me on an anvil, O God.\n     Beat me and hammer me into a steel spike.\n     Drive me into the girders that hold a skyscraper together.\n     Take red-hot rivets and fasten me into the central girders.\n     Let me be the great nail holding a skyscraper through blue \n           nights into white stars.\n\n  John Rednour must have prayed those words, or something like them, \noften. And God must have heard them, because John Rednour achieved much \ngood in his life--a leader of workers, a businessman, a banker, a \nmayor, a husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather, and a friend \nto legions.\n  For decades, John Rednour was the great nail that held his community \ntogether and helped move it forward. His contributions will enable his \nbeloved Du Quoin to continue to reach for the stars for years to come.\n\n\n                            The Minimum Wage\n\n  Mr. President, last week fast-food workers across the country led a \n1-day strike to bring attention to low-wage workers who can't make a \nliving on their current wages. In Chicago, 200 workers took to the \nstreets.\n  But this is only one part of a much larger debate, a debate in recent \ndays about the growing economic disparities in the United States of \nAmerica and the struggles of low-wage workers.\n  In November, Pope Francis stated:\n\n       While the earnings of a minority are growing exponentially, \n     so too is the gap separating the majority from the prosperity \n     enjoyed by those happy few.\n\n  Just last week, President Obama echoed those concerns in an address \non income inequality. He spoke at the Center for American Progress, and \nhe\n\n[[Page S8546]]\n\nnoted that more than half of all Americans at some point in their lives \nwill experience poverty.\n  The week before Thanksgiving, a Walmart in Ohio was running a food \ndrive to help the hungry have a happy Thanksgiving. That kind of \ngenerosity and empathy is commendable. What was noteworthy, though, is \nthe food drive was specifically to support their associates--their own \nemployees. It reminded me of an effort McDonald's launched earlier this \nyear to help their employees create a budget. According to that budget, \nthe only way to make ends meet for someone making minimum wage and \nworking 40 hours at McDonald's was to take a second job.\n  Washington Post's Wonkblog analyzed the chart and found that a worker \nmaking minimum wage would have to work 75 hours a week to have the \naftertax income this company thought was basic to a family budget.\n  Low wages aren't a problem just in the fast-food industry, and I \ndon't want to pick on Walmart and McDonald's. It is catching up in many \nother traditional jobs that used to be able to support a family.\n  There may be fewer better examples of this than in the banking \nsector. The banking industry in America last year posted $141.3 billion \nin profits. The median executive pay in the banking industry in America \nis $552,000 a year. Yet a recent report found that 39 percent of bank \ntellers in the State of New York are on public assistance.\n  Low-wage work is just not enough to get by. Working 40 hours a week \nat $7.25 translates into $15,080 a year. That is about $400 less than \nthe Federal poverty level guidelines for a family of two.\n  If you accept the sample budget we have talked about, a worker making \nthe minimum wage would have to work 75 hours a week to have the \naftertax income necessary to make ends meet. Working 75 hours a week at \na minimum wage with few or no vacation days and limited benefits, if \nany, you can make $24,720 a year after taxes. I want to say it is not \nimpossible to do that, but the reality is many people actually have to \ndo it. How do you raise a family working 75 hours a week? When do you \nhave time to sit down with your kids and even read a book?\n  One way people get by is they are forced to turn to government \nassistance programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance \nProgram, the SNAP program, historically known as food stamps, or the \nLIHEAP program, Low Income Heating and Energy Assistance Program, which \nhelps to pay for heating and cooling bills; the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, the CHIP program, which provides health insurance \nfor the children of the poorest families; the Emergency Food Assistance \nProgram, TEFAP; the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families program, \nTANF; the section 8 housing program; and, yes, the Affordable Care Act, \nwhich is providing for the first time health insurance for some of the \nworking poor who have never had insurance as a benefit at any time in \ntheir lives.\n  According to a recent study at the University of California-Berkeley \nundertaken in partnership with the University of Illinois, 52 percent \nof families of fast-food workers are on public assistance. Thirty-nine \npercent of the bank tellers in New York, 52 percent of the families of \nfast-food workers are on public assistance.\n  Subsidizing low-wage employment through these programs costs the \nFederal Government $3.9 billion annually. Think about what that means. \nIt means that working families across America paying their taxes are \nnot only sustaining this government, they are sustaining the low-wage \nworkers in their communities who cannot survive without a helping hand \nfrom a government program that keeps food on the table or may provide \nhealth insurance.\n  Instead of trying to find solutions to ensure full-time work so it is \nadequate to support a family, many of my colleagues are now attacking \nthese programs. The House Republicans oppose the farm bill primarily \nbecause they want to make deep cuts in the food stamp program for \nfamilies barely getting by and feeding their children. That strikes me \nas wrong. We are too good a Nation.\n  If we are going to have a political fight over saving money and \ncutting spending, for goodness sake, let's not start first with the \nchildren, the elderly, the disabled, and the veterans who are receiving \nfood stamps. That, to me, defines the politics and the values of some \nMembers of Congress.\n  SNAP is the first place many people turn when they struggle, this \nfood stamp program. At a time when almost 15 percent of households in \nAmerica have trouble keeping food on the table, SNAP helps 47 million \nAmericans buy their groceries. In Illinois, more than 2 million \npeople--about one in seven of our residents--rely on food stamp \nbenefits. In my lifetime, we have seen many companies that are selling \nfood across America now finding they are selling a large part to those \nwho are coming in with food stamps.\n  After working at a grocery store all day, imagine having to turn to \nyour SNAP benefits to buy the groceries you need to take home to feed \nyour family; or, after working at a grocery store all day, you go to \nyour local food bank. I have visited quite a few of those. I am sure \nthe Presiding Officer has too. What is amazing going to a food bank is \nthe people who are there. They are not the people you might expect. \nSome of them are elderly people on Social Security, barely getting by. \nThey need that food bank, twice a month sometimes, to have enough food \non the table to live for another month.\n  There are also a lot of people who work for a living in those food \nbanks. I remember going to central Illinois and visiting one of those \nfood bank warehouses. I saw a well-dressed young lady there who I \nthought was on the staff. I learned later she was a single mom with two \nkids. She had a part-time job that didn't pay very well. She qualified \nfor food stamps and also went to the food bank with some frequency. But \nshe wanted to come and thank me, because the food stamp program now \nallowed her to use her food stamp benefits at farmers markets so she \ncould take her kids out to buy fresh fruits and vegetables at that time \nof year. For her it was a great side trip for the kids to meet the \nfarmers and learn a little more about life here. She thought getting \nthem the food was secondary to that experience for which she wanted to \ncome and thank me.\n  The farm bill conference needs to reach an agreement which will not \npenalize the poorest people in America--not penalize the children, the \nveterans, the elderly, and the disabled who count on food stamps.\n  One of the biggest challenges we face is to make sure our workers all \nacross America have a minimum wage they can get by on, have food \nstamps, if necessary, but also have access to health insurance. That is \nwhere the Affordable Care Act comes in. Now 1.8 million Illinoisans \nhave no health insurance. Many are going to have their first chance to \nbe covered by health insurance because of the Affordable Care Act. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, 12 million people in \nAmerica are going to be eligible for Medicaid, and 23 million will for \nthe first time buy private health insurance, and they won't be \ndiscriminated against because someone in the family has a preexisting \ncondition. They will not be caught in a situation where there are \nlimits on the amount of coverage these policies offer. They are going \nto have opportunities for preventive care and regular wellness \ncheckups. For many of them it is going to be the first time in their \nlives they have ever had this luxury and peace of mind.\n\n  We have to protect these programs and we have to do more. More and \nmore working families make it clear that the Federal minimum wage needs \nto be increased. Since 1967 it has gone up $1.40 to $7.25. This may \nseem like significant progress, but when you adjust it to current \ndollars, the value of the minimum wage has actually declined over that \nperiod by 12 percent. Had the minimum wage kept up with inflation, it \nwould be $10.74 today, not $7.25.\n  If the minimum wage is increased to $10.10--which I support and we \nwant to bring it to the floor for a vote--more than 30 million American \nworkers will get a raise. What will they do with that money? They will \ngo shopping, of course. They live paycheck to paycheck. A little more \nmoney means shoes, clothes, food, the basics in life. When they go \nshopping and create more economic activity, it creates even more jobs.\n\n[[Page S8547]]\n\n  Workers in America--full-time workers, hard-working Americans--are \nfalling behind through no fault of their own. Attacking or cutting \nprograms that help these struggling families is just wrong. We have to \nwork together to help them.\n  In the coming weeks I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nwill restore the bipartisan tradition of supporting working families. I \nurge my colleagues to support an increase in the minimum wage and to \nresist these efforts to make deep cuts in the food stamp, or SNAP, \nprogram.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. REID. This is an announcement to all the Senators. Due to the \nmyriad of problems with the weather, there are Senators who are still \nstranded and trying to get here, so we are going to have to put off the \nvotes this afternoon. We will not have votes this afternoon. We will \nhave votes in the morning.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the previous order with respect to the \nvote on the confirmation of the Millett nomination be modified so the \nvote will follow leader remarks on Tuesday, December 10. Also, there \nwill be no morning business tomorrow morning. Following leader remarks, \nwe will go right to the business of the day.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I apologize to everyone for the late notice, \nbut we have been trying to scramble around to see if we could have \nenough participation tonight. Most people have been able to get here, \nbut some of them--certainly it is not their fault--tried to get here \nlast night and still are not here. I am sorry for the late notice, but \nthat is where we are.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Undetectable Firearms Act\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, we are about to hit the 1-year mark since \nthe tragic shooting in Sandy Hook, CT, which took the lives of 20 \nlittle boys and girls, 6- and 7-year-olds, and 6 of their educators who \ncared for them.\n  It should be a source of great embarrassment to the Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives that we have not moved the ball forward 1 inch \nwhen it comes to the issue of protecting the thousands of people all \nacross this country who are killed by guns every year. This is the case \neven while 90 percent of Americans agree that people should have proof \nthat they are not a criminal before they buy a gun and that there is \nreally no reason why we should allow military-style weapons to get into \nthe hands of ordinary Americans. We should be embarrassed by the fact \nthat we are not doing more to try to stem the scourge of gun violence \nthat plagues our Nation today. But we should be even more embarrassed \nif this week we cannot pass a commonsense extension and update to the \nUndetectable Firearms Act, a bipartisan piece of legislation that has \nbeen on the books since 1988. Most people in this country have no idea \nit exists because up until this week it has been so noncontroversial.\n  In an effort to explain to my colleagues a little bit about why this \nis so important, I wish to take my colleagues back 60 years to World \nWar II. In World War II the allies developed a very small firearm \ncalled the Liberator. The Liberator was capable of only firing one \nshot. It was a very small, little gun. The idea was that we would get \nthis out to the resistance movement in Europe and they would be able to \nconceal this very small firearm so they could get close enough to a \nGerman soldier, use the one bullet in the gun to kill the soldier, and \nthen take his weapon. That program never went very far.\n  Fast forward to 70 years later, to a University of Texas student who \ncame up with a design for a new undetectable firearm--a plastic gun \nthat can be reproduced on what is now known as the 3D printer--named \nthe Liberator. It is very similar to the gun that was developed by the \nresistance movement during World War II. Witness also the fact that \nonce he posted the plans for that plastic undetectable gun online, \nthose plans were downloaded 100,000 times in short order across this \ncountry before the Department of State used its authority to take down \nthose plans.\n  I don't know exactly what the designs for this gun were, but it can \nbe used in the exact same way the original Liberator gun was used. It \nis a plastic gun which is undetectable by imaging equipment, by metal \ndetectors. It can be used to get into a very secure place such as, \nlet's say, a government building. The ones being designed today, such \nas the one the young guy in Texas put online, can't fire more than a \ncouple of bullets, but it can fire enough bullets to injure a law \nenforcement officer or a security officer, take their gun, and do even \nmore damage.\n  So we have two problems today when it comes to this new issue of \nundetectable plastic guns:\n  First, the law passed in 1988 that bans the manufacture, possession, \nor sale of undetectable firearms--firearms that can't be picked up with \na metal detector, that can essentially move into secure locations \nwithout being identified--expires today. If we don't pass an extension, \ntomorrow it will be legal in this country to create an undetectable \nfirearm.\n  The second problem is this new technology that is pretty widely \navailable, already called 3D printing, has made it very easy to make \nfirearms that comply with the existing law but are still potentially \nundetectable.\n  Why is that? Because to be a legal weapon, you have to have a certain \namount of the weapon be metal so it can be picked up by a metal \ndetector or an x ray machine. But because we can now make very \ncreatively constructed weapons with 3-D printers, that piece of metal \ncan be easily removed before it goes through a metal detector and still \nbe used without the metal on the other side of the detection unit, thus \nessentially erasing the benefit of having a metal component if the \nmetal component can just be stripped out.\n  It is a pretty simple update we have to make here. All we have to say \nis that the metal piece of the gun has to be integral to the firing \nmechanism of the gun so that if you take the metal out to get it \nthrough a metal detector it does not work on the other end. But we are \nhaving a hard time getting that commonsense update--just recognizing \nthe advancement of technology--passed in the Senate and in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  So we have these two problems: one, the underlying bill--which is \nstill really good law even without the update--is expiring. We have to \npass it here. Second, we need this update to be taken care of.\n  This is not science fiction anymore. The threat of undetectable \nfirearms has always been around and that is why in 1988 both parties \ngot together to pass it. It has been extended since then. But it is no \nlonger science fiction that somebody can make a gun in their basement \nbasically obliterating the utility of all of our Nation's firearms laws \nand use it to perpetrate great evil throughout this country.\n  Mr. President, 3-D printers cost only about $2,000 today. Most \nfuturists are pretty certain that in maybe a decade or more most \nAmericans will have access to this technology. Just like the \nphotocopier and the personal computer seemed out of reach at some point \nfor most middle-class Americans, maybe today the 3-D printer is, but in \na decade or more it might be another household appliance that sits \nright next to your computer printer.\n  Second, we know how dangerous plastic guns are because people have \ntested this premise. One investigative journalist in Israel took a \nplastic gun into\n\n[[Page S8548]]\n\nthe Israeli Parliament--got through the serious security that surrounds \nthat building, got into the Parliament, and sat 10 rows behind Benjamin \nNetanyahu with a plastic gun in his possession. So this is not science \nfiction. It is not just a perceived or imagined threat. This is real, \nthis is now, and we have to do something about it.\n  One of the things that has happened in the wake of Sandy Hook is that \nschools have invested in enormous amounts of security. I am somebody \nwho does not believe ultimately that is the way you keep schools safe. \nBut to the extent that schools have put in more metal detectors, have \nput in more security platforms around their entryways and exit ways, it \ndoes not do any good if somebody can walk through that school, who \nwants to do great damage within it, with a plastic firearm that will be \nlegal in this country in one way, shape, or form if we do not pass an \nupdated version of this bill right now this week.\n  It is time we recognize the future is here, plastic guns are real. As \nwe approach the 1-year anniversary of the most horrific school shooting \nthis country has ever seen, it is time for us to do what we have many \ntimes before: reauthorize and update the Undetectable Firearms Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/09/senate-section/article/S8548-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 1197, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1197) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2014 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military \n     personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid (for Levin/Inhofe) amendment No. 2123, to increase to \n     $5,000,000,000 the ceiling on the general transfer authority \n     of the Department of Defense.\n       Reid (for Levin/Inhofe) amendment No. 2124 (to amendment \n     No. 2123), of a perfecting nature.\n       Reid motion to recommit the bill to the Committee on Armed \n     Services, with instructions, Reid amendment No. 2305, to \n     change the enactment date.\n       Reid amendment No. 2306 (to (the instructions) amendment \n     No. 2305), of a perfecting nature.\n       Reid amendment No. 2307 (to amendment No. 2306), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, before we left for the Thanksgiving break, \nSenator Inhofe and I said we would come to the Senate floor today to \nupdate Members on the status of the National Defense Authorization Act \nfor Fiscal Year 2014.\n  Before the break we spent a week on the Senate floor trying to bring \nmore amendments up and to have them debated and voted on, but we were \nunable to do so. We tried to reach agreement to limit consideration to \ndefense-related amendments, but we were unable to do that. We tried to \nget consent to vote on two sexual assault amendments--the Gillibrand \namendment and the McCaskill amendment--that had been fully debated, but \nwe could not get that consent. We tried to get consent to lock in \nadditional amendments for votes and to move a package of cleared \namendments, but we were unable to do so.\n  At this point, the House of Representatives will be adjourning for \nthe year at the end of this week, and there is simply no way we can \ndebate and vote on those amendments to the pending bill, get cloture, \npass the bill, go to conference with the House, get a conference report \nwritten, and have it adopted by the House of Representatives all before \nthe House goes out of session this Friday. There simply is no way all \nof those events can take place to get a defense bill passed.\n  So Senator Inhofe and I believe it is our responsibility to the Armed \nServices Committee, to the Senate, to our men and women in uniform, and \nto the country to do everything we can to enact a defense authorization \nbill. For this reason, we are taking the same approach we took when we \nwere unable to finish the bill and go to conference with the House in \n2008 and 2010. What we did is we sat down with our counterparts on the \nHouse side--in this case, chairman Buck McKeon and ranking member Adam \nSmith of the House Armed Services Committee--and we set our staffs to \nwork to come up with a bill that would have a chance of getting passed \nby both Houses.\n  The four of us have reached agreement on a bill that we hope will be \npassed by the House before it recesses this Friday and, if it does, \nthen be considered by the Senate next week.\n  We worked hard to blend the bill that was overwhelmingly voted out of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee with the bill that was \noverwhelmingly approved by the House of Representatives. We have \nworked, as we always do, on the SAS Committee on a bipartisan basis.\n  We took into consideration as many proposed Senate amendments as we \ncould. We focused on amendments that had been cleared on the Senate \nside when the bill was being debated in the Senate. We approached these \namendments and others in much the same manner as we did provisions that \nwere in the bill, working to come up with language, wherever possible, \nthat could be accepted on the Democratic and Republican sides in both \nthe Senate and the House.\n  The bill we have come up with is not a Democratic bill or a \nRepublican bill. It is a bipartisan defense bill, one that serves the \ninterests of our men and women in uniform and preserves the important \nprinciple of congressional oversight over the Pentagon. Here are some \nexamples of what will be in the bill that will be considered by the \nHouse later this week and then hopefully by the Senate next week.\n  The bill will extend the authority of the Department of Defense to \npay combat pay and hardship duty pay for our troops. The bill, relative \nto Guantanamo, includes that part of the Senate language easing \nrestrictions on overseas transfers of Gitmo detainees, but it retains \nthe House prohibitions on transferring detainees to the United States.\n  Although we were unable to consider the Gillibrand and McCaskill \namendments on the Senate floor or in the bill itself that will be \nforthcoming, the bill includes more than 20 other provisions to address \nthe problem of sexual assault in the military that were in the Senate \nbill that came to the floor out of the committee and that were in the \nHouse of Representatives bill as well.\n  These provisions include the following: They provide a special \nvictims' counsel for survivors of sexual assault, make retaliation for \nreporting a sexual assault a crime under the Uniform Code of Military \nJustice. The provisions require commanders to immediately refer all \nallegations of sexual assault to professional criminal investigators. \nThey would end the commanders' ability to modify findings and \nconvictions for sexual assaults, and would require higher level review \nof any decision not to prosecute allegations of sexual assault.\n  The bill will do the following that will be hopefully coming here \nnext week: Make the Article 32 process more like a grand jury \nproceeding. Under the UCMJ, the Uniform Code of Military Justice, \ncurrently the proceeding that is taken under Article 32 is more like a \ndiscovery proceeding rather than a grand jury proceeding, and it has \ncreated all kinds of problems, including for victims of sexual assault \nwho would have to appear and be subject to cross-examination by the \ndefense.\n  This bill will extend supplemental impact aid to help local school \ndistricts educate military children. The bill will extend existing \nmilitary land withdrawals in a number of places that would otherwise \nexpire, leaving the military without critical testing and training \ncapabilities. The bill includes a new land withdrawal to enable the \nMarine Corps to expand its training area at 29 Palms.\n  The bill provides needed funding authority for the destruction of the \nSyrian chemical weapons stockpile and for efforts of the Jordanian \nArmed Forces to secure that country's border with Syria.\n  Earlier today GEN Martin Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of\n\n[[Page S8549]]\n\nStaff, wrote a letter to the leadership of the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives in which he strongly urges completion of action on the \nNational Defense Authorization Act this year. General Dempsey's letter \nprovides a long list of essential authorities that will lapse if this \nbill is not enacted. This is just one paragraph from his letter:\n\n       The authorities contained [in the National Defense \n     Authorization Act] are critical to the Nation's defense and \n     urgently needed to ensure we all keep faith with the men and \n     women, military and civilian, selflessly serving in our Armed \n     Forces.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that General Dempsey's letter, \nwith that attachment, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             Chairman of the Joint\n\n\n                                              Chiefs of Staff,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 9, 2013.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington. DC.\n       As we enter the final weeks of December, I write to urge \n     you to complete the National Defense Authorization Act this \n     year. The authorities contained therein are critical to the \n     Nation's defense and urgently needed to ensure we all keep \n     faith with the men and women, military and civilian, \n     selflessly serving in our Armed Forces. Allowing the Bill to \n     slip to January adds yet more uncertainty to the force and \n     further complicates the duty of our commanders who face \n     shifting global threats. I also fear that delay may put the \n     entire Bill at risk, protracting this uncertainty and \n     impacting our global influence.

We have not failed to pass a National Defense \nAuthorization Act for 52 years even when, as I mentioned, in a couple \ncases in recent years the final bill was the result of a process like \nwe have had to follow with this year's authorization bill.\n  This is not the best way to proceed, but our troops and their \nfamilies and our Nation's security deserve a defense bill, and this is \nthe only practical way to get a defense bill done this year. There is \nno other way, because, as I indicated before, the House of \nRepresentatives is--we could not get a bill done before the end of this \nweek if we brought back the bill that was pending before Thanksgiving. \nThere is no way we can do it. And the experience in the week before the \nThanksgiving recess demonstrated pretty clearly there is no way we \ncould get a defense bill, such as the one that was pending, passed in \nthis body before the end of this week.\n  The problem is that the House of Representatives is done at the end \nof this week. If we use the pending bill that was previously pending as \nthe vehicle, we cannot possibly get to a conference, get an agreement \non a conference, get a conference report, go back to the House of \nRepresentatives, and then get a conference report here, because the \nHouse of Representatives is done on Friday.\n  This is the only path to a bill. We have not missed in 52 years, and \nthe reason we do not miss is our troops and their families and the \nnational security of this country. That is why we have not failed. We \ncannot fail this year. The only practical way to avoid failure is if we \nfollow the course which Senator Inhofe and I are now proposing to this \nbody. Again, it is not the preferred course. It just happens to be the \nonly course.\n  I thank Senator Inhofe and all the members of our committee for the \nway they have worked on this bill for now almost a whole year and for \nthe final product, which I believe will have the full committee support \nor at least almost all of us. There were only three members of our \ncommittee who did not vote for the bill that came to the floor before.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, let me express my \nappreciation for not just since this last Monday--a week ago today--\nwhen we met and put together a negotiated settlement, a negotiated \nbill, but all year long, in the previous year, Senator Levin has been \nvery good to work with. We did our best to get a bill. We passed our \nbill out of committee months ago--months ago--and the problem has been \nhere.\n  I am critical of the leadership of the Senate and a lot of the people \nwho wanted amendments. I have to say this: On the Republican side, we \nagreed, finally, to cut it down to 25 amendments, which I think is very \nreasonable, and we were denied that. I could be critical. It does not \ndo any good to be critical of the majority right now because we are \nwhere we are now.\n  The chairman has stated that looking at December we only have between \nnow and Friday at 11 o'clock. That is it; the House is gone. They have \nalready made that decision. They have made the announcement. It is \ngoing to happen. So mechanically, if we are all going to embrace and \nlove each other and not disagree with anything, it still could not be \ndone. There is no way in the world we can have a defense authorization \nbill this year except to do the negotiated bill we got together on.\n  By the way, when people say they want to wait until January, keep in \nmind that on December 31 the services will no longer be authorized to \npay hazardous pay to the troops serving in hostile-fire areas. After \nDecember 31 the services will no longer be authorized to offer 37 \nspecific special and incentive pays, including enlistment and \nreenlistment bonuses.\n  These people in service, those who have been in service, we know they \napproach them when it is getting close to the time they are going to \nget out. They say: These are the benefits that are going to be there if \nyou will reenlist. It is absolutely necessary that they have that \ninformation. All of a sudden, we are pulling the rug out from under \nthem, after they had anticipated what their reenlistment would be.\n  Those things stop December 31. If you say: Well, we will come back in \nJanuary and do it, I can show you this calendar right here. We start on \nJanuary 6, and we are going to be in the CR on January 15. There is no \nway they are going to pay any attention to Defense authorization during \nthat time period. There is not the time to do it.\n  I will not be redundant and repeat what the chairman talked about \nthat would not happen.\n  Gitmo is controversial. However, the provisions in the Fiscal Year \n2013 NDAA which prohibit the transfer of Gitmo detainees to the United \nStates have expired. The prohibitions, which are currently in effect, \nwhich prevent the transfer of detainees to the United States are \nprovisions which were included in an Appropriations Act. That Act, \nwhich has been extended due to\n\n[[Page S8550]]\n\nthe CR, is set to expire in January. Therefore, it is important to \nenact the FY'14 NDAA since our bill will extend these prohibitions for \nall of 2014. Of course, we also passed prohibitions on construction and \nmodifying facilities in the United States. However, all of these \nprohibitions could come to an end if we do not have this bill.\n  Now, we have covered this. I appreciate the fact--and I want to \nrepeat what the chairman said--that we actually had and cleared and \nconsidered some 87 amendments. In this bill we got 79 of the \namendments; that is, Democratic and Republican amendments. So we have \ndone this in the areas where we are supposed to be accomplishing it.\n  I looked at some of the things in military construction. We will have \nto stop work on any major projects that are currently under \nconstruction. I mean, they could be partway through a project. For \nexample, the bill contains $136 million to continue construction for \nthe replacement of a command center for the U.S. Strategic Command at \nOffutt Air Force Base in Nebraska. If this amount is not authorized for \nappropriations, DOD will have to stop work halfway through \nconstruction, leading to a contract claim, lost time, maybe even \nlawsuits, but certainly extra work. I can say the same about areas in \nMaryland, Kentucky, Washington, Texas, and New York. If we look at the \nconstruction of aircraft carriers, without the congressional action we \nhave in this bill to update the statutory cap on construction of the \nCVN-78--the USS Ford, the first aircraft carrier of the Ford class--the \nNavy will be forced to cease construction of the CVN-78 when it is \nalready 75 percent complete, denying our Nation this critical asset \nafter we have already spent $12 billion on it. We are talking about \nhuge amounts of money. We are talk about defending the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I hate to think we got here the way we did. We should not have had to \ndo that. There is some blame to go around on both sides, but \nnonetheless we have been unable to do it the way we have done it in the \npast.\n  I will tell you something that is kind of interesting. We did a \nstudy. We found that in the last 30 years we have never gone into \nJanuary before. Never. Not once.\n  The two times we went in were after a veto of the bill, and then \nafter that we immediately overrode the veto and we were home free. So \nthis has not happened before. For people to say that it has and that it \nis not unusual to go into January, factually that is just not true.\n  So we have special operations, and we have land use agreements. This \nis a big one that will ensure special operations forces have sufficient \naccess to training ranges. The SEALs, the Navy SEALs--I think many of \nus have been to the Chocolate Mountain Aerial Gunnery Range in \nCalifornia, which serves an indispensable role in training the Navy \nSEALs for deployment. Failure to adopt the NDAA agreement we are \ntalking about now will result in sending Navy SEALs to combat with \ninsufficient training, undermining mission effectiveness and increasing \nthe risk of losing lives.\n  So we have every reason to be concerned about this. We have only one \nway that we are going to be able to get a defense authorization bill. \nIf we do not do it, this will be the first year in 52 years that we \nhave not had one. So that is how serious this is. I do not like the way \nit was done, but I can like the end product.\n  I think the chairman mentioned the sexual assault discussion we have \nhad. We had the Gillibrand amendment, and we had the McCaskill \namendment. We did not get a chance to talk about those. But we actually \nhave 27 specific reforms to support victims and encourage sexual \nassault reporting, expanding it and so forth. So we have done a lot.\n  I do not think anyone can argue that we would in any way be better \noff not having an authorization bill or just lumping it together and \nputting it on a clean CR. That is not any way to do business. It does \nnot accomplish any of what I just mentioned and that the chairman \nmentioned as progress in this bill.\n  With that, I am happy to join the chairman of the committee in a \nbipartisan way to help try to defend America. The first thing we need \nto do is to pass our negotiated bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with the chairman and ranking member if necessary as we \ndiscuss this legislation----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Or lack of legislation, which may be unique in the \nhistory of the Senate in that for 51 years this body has passed a \ndefense authorization bill, gone to conference between the two Houses, \nand sent a bill to the President's desk--legislation that I think most \nAmericans would agree is our first priority, and that is to defend the \nsecurity of this Nation.\n  I guess one of the questions I have for the distinguished chairman of \nthe committee, and obviously the ranking member, is that by us not \nacting on this bill before the end of the year, is it not true, I would \nask Chairman Levin, that we have already done some damage to the \nmilitary and our readiness? Is it not also true that in the years that \nSenator Levin and I and Senator Inhofe have been together in the Armed \nServices Committee, we have never tried to do an authorization bill in \na week? There are too many issues that are worthy of debate and votes \non the part of this body. So is it not true, I would ask Senator Levin, \nthat if we fail to take up this legislation, we will be embarking into \nunknown and uncharted waters because then we will be leaving it, isn't \nit true, to various appropriations bills or continuing resolutions or a \npatchwork kind of addressing what I would argue--and I do not know how \nanyone could dispute--is the most important obligation the Congress of \nthe United States has; that is, to authorize the provisions in law that \nare necessary to defend this Nation? I would ask the Senator from \nMichigan those questions.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The point of the Senator from Arizona is extremely well \ntaken. There is, relevant to his point, a list of expiring authorities \nwhich we have just received from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, \nGeneral Dempsey. I put that letter in the Record; we got it literally a \nfew hours ago--listing some of the expiring authorities, including a \nnumber that the Senator mentioned and----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Would the chairman mention a couple of those?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Special pay and bonuses, combat pay, travel and \ntransportation allowances, nonconventional assisted recovery \ncapability, the authorities to do MILCON, which were mentioned by the \nSenator from Oklahoma. It is a long list. There will be a real chasm if \nwe don't do this this year. You cannot just say: Well, it will go to \nnext year. Senator Inhofe pointed out, I believe, that in one or two \ncases where it actually did get signed in the year after the bill was \npassed, it was because there was a veto by a President and the veto \noverride took place, I believe, in the weeks after January.\n  But these expiring authorities are very serious. We are going to tell \nmen and women in combat that there is a gap in their combat pay? We \ndon't know for sure that it will ever be filled. This is what General \nDempsey mentioned in his letter. He said: Allowing the bill to slip to \nJanuary adds yet more uncertainty to the force and further complicates \nthe duty of our commanders who face shifting global threats. I also \nfear that delay may put the entire bill at risk, protracting this \nuncertainty and impacting our global influence.\n  Then he gave us a list of the expiring authorities.\n  So the Senator from Arizona raises a very critical issue. Now, it is \nnot desirable for us to pass a bill as we have. But with the help of \nthe Senator from Arizona when he was the ranking member, we were able, \non two occasions, in a situation where there were objections to \namendments being offered on the Senate floor--I will not go into all \nthe details, but 2 of the last 5 years we were put in a position where \nwe could not get the usual course followed, where the bill had a full \namendment process on the Senate floor--it had some, as this bill has, \nbut not enough time. Then we ran into that wall, and we were able to \nwork out a bipartisan resolution to present to the Senate, sort of a \nvirtual conference report--not\n\n[[Page S8551]]\n\ntechnically a conference report but a bill, a fresh bill, a new bill \nwhich merged and blended the bill that passed the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee in those 2 years with the bill that passed the House of \nRepresentatives. We then on a bipartisan basis presented those two \nbills to the Senate, and they were passed.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me mention a couple of others to the Senator from \nArizona. His specific question is, What expires on December 31? In \naddition to the hazard pay that was articulated by the chairman, we \nalso have the reenlistment bonus. I think any of us who have served in \nthe military remember that as you get close to your date of discharge, \nyou make a plan for the future as to what you are going to do in terms \nof reenlistment. It is all based on assumptions of reenlistment \nbonuses. If all of a sudden they disappear, you could not have that. \nWhat is that going to do to our forces? Impact Aid. Impact aid is \nsomething people do not really think about unless they happen to be in \nan area that has a lot of military activity where people have been \ntaken off the tax rolls. On January 1, impact aid would end.\n  So, yes, there is a lot of concern over this. We talked for a long \ntime about what will happen with this bill in terms of military \nconstruction that is partially done or the building of various \nplatforms. But what would actually happen as of January 1 would be \nreally a crisis if we were to have to stop these things.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I should have stated at the beginning that I am very \nproud of the leadership that both Senator Inhofe and Senator Levin have \nprovided to the Armed Services Committee.\n  I serve on a number of committees and have served on a number of \ncommittees in my time in the Senate. The bipartisanship and cooperative \nlegislating that is exemplified by both Senators makes me proud and \nmakes me believe there is still some hope for bipartisanship in the \nSenate. Their leadership has been vital in putting together an \nauthorization bill which is, as we have described, incredibly \nimportant.\n  I ask both of my colleagues, I am hearing--especially now from this \nside of the aisle--it is OK if we let this go over into January. After \nall, we only have another week. We have the farm bill, we have the \nbudget agreement, et cetera. The House, the other side of the Capitol, \nis going out of session.\n  Why isn't it OK to wait until January? We will be back early in \nJanuary and work on this legislation then.\n  I am sure I know the answer, but I ask of the chairman if that isn't \nnearly as easy as it sounds, even if, contrary to custom in January, we \nwould do anything legislatively.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator points out the reality, which is what is \nlikely to happen in January. There is another reality that what will \nhappen in January is it will be very difficult to get to this bill \nbecause of the crushing business of CRs and other crushing business in \nJanuary, even if we meet in January.\n  The shortest answer I could give to my friend from Arizona is the \nfollowing: I am in combat. I am in combat somewhere in the world and I \nam going to read: Combat pay stops on December 31.\n  There are dozens of these kinds of authorizations that are listed in \nGeneral Dempsey's letter, dozens of them, that just stop on December \n31. Take only that one. Think about that and what kind of an impression \nwe are giving to our men and women who are in combat, in harm's way, \nwhen they read: Combat pay stops.\n  Yes, maybe it will be extended in January or in February, but that is \nactually unsatisfactory. It will be outrageous for us not to pass this \nbill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Does the Senator from Oklahoma have a response?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes. I wish to note that the average time it takes to \ndebate on the floor and to pass the NDAA is 9 days. That is the average \nover the last 10 years.\n  As I look at the calendar for January, we return on January 6 and we \nhave the CR on January 15. We are going to be spending that time on the \nCR. Then, of course, we will be faced with the debt ceiling. I don't \nsee that is going to happen. I think it is going to happen in some \nother way, but it is not going to happen in these reforms.\n  I very much appreciate the Senator from Arizona calling this to \nattention, that we can't wait until January. It is not going to work. \nWe know it is going to expire December 31. We also know it can't happen \nin January because there flat isn't time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I don't know if my colleagues wish to respond, but I wish \nto make two comments: One is that I am deeply disappointed--deeply, \ndeeply disappointed--in the majority leader for not taking up this \nlegislation much earlier. The majority controls the calendar. That is \none of the key elements of the majority winning elections and majority \nin the Senate.\n  For us to wait since June, when we passed the bill out of the Armed \nServices Committee, until only a short time ago and then only allowing \na few days is a grave disservice--not so much to the Members of the \nSenate--and a lack of prioritization of the importance of this \nlegislation.\n  I am deeply disappointed the majority leader of the Senate, because \nof his manipulation of the calendar, has put us in this position.\n  Having said that, I spent time--as I know the Senator from Oklahoma \nand the Senator from Michigan, our distinguished chairman--in the \ncompany of the men and women who serve. One of our obligations, as \nmembers of the Armed Services Committee, is to spend time with the \nmilitary. I know the Senator from Oklahoma and the chairman do as well.\n  Their morale isn't good. They have seen sequestration take place, \nacross-the-board cuts that have been done with a meat ax and not a \nscalpel.\n  All three of us would agree there are enormous savings that could be \nenacted in our Nation's Defense Department. We haven't even received an \naudit of the Defense Department. Year after year we demand that an \naudit be conducted by the Department of Defense by a certain year, and \nit has never happened.\n  We are not apologists. In fact, I believe the chairman and the \nranking member have been zealous in their efforts to reduce waste, \nmismanagement, and duplication in the Armed Services and the Defense \nDepartment through their work on the Armed Services Committee.\n  The morale of our men and women who are serving is being harmed. It \nis not something that shows up in dollars and cents, but it does show \nup over time.\n  I say to the Senator from Michigan it does show up over time in their \nwillingness to remain in the military. I was recently in Fort Campbell, \nKY, with the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander. We had an excellent \nbriefing from the colonels, the generals, and the chief master \nsergeants of the U.S. Army.\n  Their unanimous view was that they believe we in the Congress of the \nUnited States are not taking care of them. They have always looked to \nus to provide them with the pay, the benefits, the housing, the \nequipment, and the training that is necessary to do their job.\n  They don't believe we are doing that anymore. They believe, when we \nenact sequestration with a meat-ax cut across the board--don't ask me \nabout it. Ask General Odierno and the Chiefs who testified before the \nArmed Services Committee about the devastating effect of cuts to \nreadiness, training, acquisition and, most of all, on the morale of the \nmen and women who are serving. They literally don't know, some of them, \nwhat they are going to be doing the next day. The next day they don't \nknow if they will be able to fly their airplanes, run their tanks or \nhave the exercises that have been planned for months and even years. \nThey don't know because we are almost day-to-day trying to apportion \nfunds that are remaining in the most efficient and beneficial way.\n  I stand before my colleagues in the Senate and the two leaders in the \nauthorization committee, and I am embarrassed--embarrassed--and a bit \nashamed that we have done this to these good men and women who are \nwilling to put their lives in harm's way to defend us. We can't even \npass a bill that authorizes what they need to defend this Nation. It is \nshameful.\n  I wish to thank the chairman and ranking member for the hard work \nthey have done on this legislation and the thousands of hours they have \nspent\n\n[[Page S8552]]\n\non behalf of defending this Nation and the men and women who serve it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from Arizona for everything he has \nbeen doing for so many decades for this country, including our \ncommittee. It is invaluable. We are going to get this bill passed. That \nis our determination.\n  It will be a shock to every American if we are unable to pass the \nDefense authorization bill. It will be totally intolerable. I know \nSenator Inhofe and I will help Senator McCain and others get this bill \ndone this year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. One last comment I wish to make is people listen to us \nspeak on the floor and do not understand the full impact. I carry this \ncard with me. The very top military person in the country, the Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Dempsey, told our committee: We \nare putting our military on a path where the force is so degraded and \nso unready that it would be immoral to use force.\n  He is the No. 1 Chief. The No. 2 Chief is Admiral Winnefeld, who \nstated that ``there could be for the first time in my career instances \nwhere we may be asked to respond to a crisis and we will have to say \nthat we cannot.''\n  We can't correct all of that with this bill, but we can keep it from \ngetting worse and get back and do what we have done over the last 52 \nyears and pass the NDAA bill.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/09/senate-section/article/S8552-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8552-S8553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF PATRICIA ANN MILLETT TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE \n                  FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Everyone knew \nthen, just as they know now, that these judges are not needed. The DC \nCircuit has the lowest caseload in the country by far, based on the \nstandards that the Democrats established just a few years ago when a \nRepublican was in the White House. In fact, the caseload on the DC \nCircuit is so low that on April 10, 2013, approximately 2 months prior \nto these nominations, I introduced legislation together with every \nRepublican member of the committee to eliminate one seat of the DC \nCircuit and move two others to different circuits where they had bigger \ncaseloads and needed additional help. That would be the sensible way to \naddress this issue. Don't spend $1 million in taxpayers' money, per \nyear, per judge, on judgeships that are not needed.\n  That is common sense, especially when the judges currently on the \ncourt say--and I quote one of them--in a letter:\n\n       If any more judges were added now there wouldn't be enough \n     work to go around.\n\n  Don't waste $3 million a year. Instead, simply move the seats to \nwhere they are needed, where there is a much bigger caseload. That \nwould be the sensible and the good government approach.\n  But being sensible and good stewards of taxpayer dollars is not what \nthe other side had in mind when they hatched this scheme. Far from it. \nNo, the administration's move here was clear from the very beginning. \nThey knew they could not pass their liberal agenda through a divided \nCongress. The American people had already rejected that agenda at the \nballot box. But the administration still runs the Federal agencies, and \nthrough the agencies the administration can ignore the will of the \nAmerican people and continue to pursue a job-killing agenda.\n  It doesn't matter that the American people do not want their \ngovernment to pass cap-and-trade fee increases. The administration will \nsimply force it upon the American people anyway through the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\n  It doesn't matter that the employer mandate penalty under ObamaCare \ndoes not apply to the 34 States that have not created insurance \nexchanges. The administration forced the employer mandate upon the \nAmerican people anyway through an IRS regulation.\n  This has been the plan of the administration. It cannot get its \nliberal agenda through the Congress, but it has saddled the American \npeople with its job-crushing agenda anyway through agency regulation.\n  But there is a catch to this scheme, a very big catch. Agency \ndecisions are reviewed by the Federal judiciary. That happens to be our \nvery independent third branch of government. So for this scheme to \nwork, the White House needed to stack the DC Circuit with judges who \nwere rubberstamps for its agenda.\n\n  As a result, the administration decided to ram their agenda through \nthe agencies and simultaneously stack the DC Circuit with judges they \nbelieve would rubberstamp that agenda. That is why, on the very same \nday the President made these three nominations, I said:\n\n       It's hard to imagine the rationale for nominating three \n     judges at once for this court given the many vacant emergency \n     seats across the country, unless your goal is to pack the \n     court to advance a certain policy agenda.\n\n  During the last few months we have debated this issue, and throughout \nthe debate the other side has tried their best to obscure the \nobjective. They have manipulated caseload statistics in an effort to \ndeny the obvious: Judges are not needed and will not have enough work \nto go around as is.\n  They twisted the words of the administrative office of the U.S. \nCourts. They claimed that the Chief Justice of the United States \nbelieves these judgeships are needed, when of course statistics show \nthat is not remotely close to being true. They even stooped so low as \nto accuse Republicans of gender bias. But no matter how the other side \nmanipulated the data or tried to conceal their agenda, they could not \novercome the simple and basic facts everyone knew to be true; that is, \nthat under the standard established by the Democrats under the Bush \nadministration, these judgeships are not needed and should not be \nconfirmed.\n  As a result, when the Senate considered these nominations, it denied \nconsent. The other side lost the debate. Under normal circumstances, \nthat would have been the end of this matter but not this time. This \ntime there is a Democrat in the White House, not a Bush in the White \nHouse, and a Republican minority in the Senate.\n  The caseload statistics that carried the day in 2006 when we had a \nRepublican majority in this body no longer matter to today's Democratic \nmajority. This time apparently there are only three Members of the \nmajority who care more for the Senate as an institution than they do \nfor their party or short-term political gain. Of course, the biggest \ndifference is that this time what is at stake is a radical agenda and \nthe other side's effort to remove any meaningful check and balance on \nthat agenda.\n  In short, it is ObamaCare. In short, it is climate change regulation, \nand the method for doing it is Presidential rule by fiat. The other \nside decided they were no longer willing to play by the rules they \nestablished and pioneered in 2006 when we had a Republican President \nand a Republican majority in the\n\n[[Page S8553]]\n\nSenate. They lost the debate, so a couple weeks ago they changed the \nrules of the game in the middle of the fourth quarter. They triggered \nthe so-called nuclear option because salvaging ObamaCare and insulating \ncap-and-trade fee increases from meaningful judicial review were just \ntwo important ideological battles that this administration wanted to \nget done one way or the other.\n  But, as I said, the end game for this scheme has been clear ever \nsince it was formulated. So I wasn't surprised to read media accounts \nconfirming the reasons the Democrats broke the Senate rules in order to \nget these nominees confirmed.\n  For instance, on November 23, The Hill newspaper ran an article with \nthis headline: ``Filibuster change clears path for Obama climate regs \ncrackdown.'' The Hill newspaper had this to say:\n\n       Green groups might be the biggest winners from Senate \n     Democrats' decision to gut the minority party's filibuster \n     rights on nominations. Their top priority--President Obama's \n     second-term changes on climate change--is likely to have a \n     better shot at surviving challenges once Obama's nominees are \n     confirmed for the crucial U.S. Court of Appeals for the \n     District of Columbia.\n\n  The Washington Post wrote:\n\n       Democrats say the shift in the court will be especially \n     important given that Obama's legislative proposals have \n     little chance to prevail in the GOP controlled House. . . . \n     The most contentious issues likely to face the appeals court \n     are climate change regulations being pursued by the EPA. . . \n     . The measures represent Obama's most ambitious effort to \n     combat climate change in his second term--coal-fired power \n     plants are a key source of emissions--at a time when such \n     proposals have no chance of passage in Congress.\n\n  The same Washington Post article acknowledged the importance of \nremoving the judicial check on ObamaCare.\n\n       The court is expected to hear a series of other legal \n     challenges as well, including lawsuits related to elements of \n     the Affordable Care Act, the Consumer Financial Protection \n     Bureau and new air-quality standards.\n\n  Here is how one liberal environmental media outlet described the \nchange:\n\n       When the Senate Democrats blew up the filibuster Thursday, \n     they didn't just rewrite some rules. They struck a mortal \n     blow to a tradition that has blockaded effective action on \n     climate change.\n\n  According to media reports, it was these same liberal interest groups \nthat pressured the majority leader to break the rules in order to \nchange the rules. According to The Hill newspaper:\n\n       [The] Sierra Club was part of a coalition of liberal groups \n     and unions that pressured Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid \n     to limit the use of the filibuster through a majority vote.\n\n  So if there was any doubt whatsoever about why the other side took \nsuch drastic action--changing the very historic process of the Senate--\nthere should not be any doubt any longer. The other side could no \nlonger stand up to the more extreme wing of their party. Under pressure \nfrom those interest groups, the other side willy-nilly tossed aside \nsome 225 years of Senate history and tradition.\n  What is more, by joining the majority leader and voting to break the \nrules, every Senator who did so empowered the President to install \njudges whose appointments are specifically designed to rubberstamp the \nPresident's regulatory agenda. No one is going to be able to hide from \nthis vote. Not only is this a power grab, it is much more than that. It \nis the erosion of a constitutional principle which has been established \nsince 1787--and stated very clearly in the Federalist Papers--why the \nseparation of powers is so important to our government. It was to make \nsure that no one person has all the power. The White House is so \ncommitted to a policy agenda that the American people don't want that \nit co-opted the majority of the Senate in its scheme to remove a \nmeaningful judicial check on the executive branch of government and \ntheir agenda.\n  This is about a White House trying to rig the game so it can impose \nits cap-and-trade fee increases on the American people even though the \nAmerican people don't support it. This is about a last-ditch effort to \nsalvage ObamaCare and regulations, such as the IRS rule imposing the \nemployer mandate penalty in 34 States, which is in direct conflict with \nthe statute. How will they do it? By installing judges the White House \nbelieves will rubberstamp their edict.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand up to this White House, stand up to the \nradical liberal interest groups. Don't cast your vote for cap-and-trade \nfee increases and for judges that will rubberstamp that and don't cast \nanother vote for ObamaCare. Instead, vote against this nomination. It \nis not needed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nPatricia Millett to serve on the D.C. Circuit, the second most \nimportant court in the nation. Ms. Millett, who is currently in private \npractice, is recognized as one of the leading appellate lawyers in the \ncountry. She has argued 32 cases before the Supreme Court and dozens \nmore in other appellate courts.\n  Ms. Millett served in the Solicitor General's office under both \nDemocratic and Republican presidents. Seven former Solicitors General \nincluding prominent Republicans Paul Clement, Ted Olson and Ken Starr--\nsent a letter in support of Ms. Millett saying she ``has a brilliant \nmind, a gift for clear, persuasive writing, and a genuine zeal for the \nrule of law. Equally important, she is unfailingly fair-minded.''\n  At her hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, no Senator \nquestioned Ms. Millett's qualifications or fitness for the Federal \nbench. She is simply an outstanding nominee. Ms. Millett is also a \nproud product of Illinois. She grew up in Marine, a small town in the \nsouthern part of the state. Her mother was a nurse and her father was a \nhistory professor at Southern Illinois University--Edwardsville.\n  Ms. Millett graduated summa cum laude from the University of Illinois \nand magna cum laude from Harvard Law School. She clerked for 2 years \nfor Judge Thomas Tang on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  She is part of a military family. Her husband Robert King served in \nthe Navy and was deployed as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Ms. Millett also comes highly recommended by distinguished members of \nthe Illinois legal community.\n  I received a letter from Patrick Fitzgerald, the former U.S. Attorney \nfor the Northern District of Illinois, expressing ``strong support'' \nfor Ms. Millett's nomination and urging ``prompt consideration of her \ncandidacy on the merits.''\n  I also received a letter from 28 prominent attorneys including former \nIllinois Governor James Thompson, a Republican, and current Illinois \nState Bar Association president Paula Holderman.\n  They expressed their strong support for Ms. Millett, saying that \n``she embodies the evenhandedness, impartiality, and objectivity \nrequired for the federal judiciary, as evidenced by her more than 10 \nyears of service in the Solicitor General's office in both the Clinton \nand Bush Administrations.''\n  The bottom line is that Ms. Millett is an outstanding nominee with \nbroad support from across the ideological spectrum. There is no \nquestion that she is well-qualified to serve on the bench, and she will \nserve with distinction.\n  I urge my colleagues to support her nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there are some tough times around here, \nbut I usually look for the good news. There is good news. Would anyone \nhave believed 6 months ago that most of the chemical weapons in Syria \nwould be dismantled at this point? In our wildest expectations we could \nnot have expected that. But for the technicalities and specifics of the \ninspection,\n\n[[Page S8554]]\n\nthat clearly appears to have occurred or is well on its way to \noccurring.\n  We have had 43 straight months of private sector job growth in the \neconomy. When Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers went down, we were in a \nfinancial death spiral. Little by little we are coming out of it. Of \ncourse, the news just announced last Friday on the jobs report gives \nanother indication that the economy is beginning to take hold, and we \nsee that in the confidence that is being expressed. We see that in the \nreal estate market, and we certainly see that in the financial markets \nin New York.\n  Let me give you another piece of good news that most people would not \nthink about. There has been the discovery of a former Martian lake. As \nwe reach out into the cosmos to try to find any indication of life, \nscientists are now thinking that this Martian lake might have harbored \nlife billions of years ago--about the time some of the scientists \nsuggest that small microcosm of life might have started on this planet. \nIf this proves out, we are going to Mars not just with robots. \nEventually, in the 2030s, we will go with humans, and when we get \nthere, we will find out if that is true. If it is true, was there life \nthat developed? If there was life that developed, was it civilized? If \nit was civilized, what happened and what can we learn from that that \nmight help us as a civilized life? So I see good signs.\n  I see the good signs of Senator Kerry as our Secretary of State and \nwhat he is doing in trying to bring the parties together in the Middle \nEast. So instead of everything being doom and gloom, I see good things.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/09/senate-section/article/S8554-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8554-S8556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            EXTENDING THE UNDETECTABLE FIREARMS ACT OF 1988\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Senator Schumer and I are here for another reason. We \ndon't want to make a mistake. For some number of years, there has been \non the books a law which will expire at midnight tonight that has \nprotected us from weapons going through detectors that are not made of \nmetal which the detectors can't detect. Of course, not only are we \ntalking about government buildings and other secure facilities, but \nclearly we are talking about airports as well.\n\n  So now computer technology has advanced to the point, ever since we \nhad that old law, that a person can actually, with a computer, through \n3D processing, laying down plastic layer upon plastic layer, create a \nweapon that cannot be detected with most of the detectors we have \ntoday. That old law needs to be updated, but apparently there are those \nwho do not want it updated. So, as a last gasp, we are appealing to the \nSenate, before the stroke of midnight tonight when this law will be \nerased, to continue the old law that will at least go after the \nplastic-type weapons, plastic guns, of which their manufacture--it is \nrequired that they have some part of metal in them in order to detect \nthem. But the technology has surpassed that. They can now manufacture \nthem with 3D printing to have no metal parts and they will still shoot \na bullet. That is what we are going to have to update. So with the \nsimple click of a mouse, things are changed and it makes it practically \ninvisible to metal detectors and other screening devices.\n  I thank the senior Senator from New York, who has taken the lead on \nthis issue. He has recognized this problem. He has asked me to join \nhim.\n  The House of Representatives last week passed similar legislation to \nnot do what we ought to do to update the law but to continue the \ncurrent ban on such weapons for another 10 years. They obviously pose a \nvery serious threat to our national security as well as to Americans' \npersonal security, and we need to do everything we can to keep them out \nof the hands of people who want to do harm to others.\n  Mr. President, I am looking forward to the comments of the senior \nSenator from New York.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I would like to wait for Senator \nGrassley--here he is. I will speak for a minute and then propound my \nunanimous consent request, and then Senator Grassley will propound his \nrequest, I presume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I wish to thank my good colleague from \nFlorida who has been a great partner on this very important issue. He \noutlined it well. I will just speak for a few minutes on this subject.\n  The bottom line is very simple. There are bad people who always want \nto evade the law, and there are good people--most Americans, the vast \nmajority--who want to protect the law. Our job is to prevent the bad \npeople without hurting the good people. We will have different views on \nthe issue of gun control as to where to draw that line, but it seems to \nme on this issue there should be no dispute whatsoever. As the Senator \nfrom Florida outlined, there is new technology that for the first time \nwill allow guns to be made that function without metal. That presents a \nserious danger--some might even say a mortal danger--to our safety \nbecause if a person can pass a gun through a metal detector with the \nvery purpose to stop guns from getting into delicate areas, such as \nairports, sports stadiums, courts, and schools, it can create real \nhavoc. To allow plastic guns that can fire one bullet, two bullets, \nthree bullets, four bullets into these places creates real danger for \nour citizenry.\n  There were some wise people back in 1988, even before these guns \ncould be developed, who passed a law that said we should not allow them \nto exist. It was a good law. The trouble is, as my colleague from \nFlorida has outlined, technology has advanced, so not only are these \nguns real, but they can be made so that the law that exists and expires \ntonight can be evaded.\n  If one were to add an easily removable piece of metal to one of these \nplastic guns, walk with it, with that metal on it--legal under present \nlaw--take it off as a person puts the gun through a metal detector, so \nit is all plastic, and then quietly insert it back on the gun after it \ngoes through a metal detector, one would have a gun on both sides of \nthe metal detector that is legal under present law, the law that \nexpires tonight, and a person can then evade the very purpose that we \nhave metal detectors at our airports, sports stadiums, and other \nplaces--to prevent guns from being smuggled in.\n  So what we would ideally like to do, the Senator from Florida and I, \nis say that those types of guns, as well as guns that are purely \nplastic, should be illegal and that a gun must have some metal in it \nthat can't be removed easily--and those guns would be legal, but those \nguns wouldn't be smuggled through metal detectors.\n  Now, years ago, it seemed as though this was all fiction. I remember \nthat in the movie ``In the Line of Fire,'' John Malkovich, seeking to \nkill the President, takes months to make a gun out of plastic. It was \nscience fiction. But in the last few years that science fiction has \nbecome a reality. Three-D printers--a technology overall that is \nmiraculous--can create a trachea for a baby so the baby can live. \nThree-D printers can create car parts at a much cheaper price. But they \ncan also create plastic guns. Technology allows them to be sold for \n$1,000 or a little more than $1,000, so just about anyone can get one, \ncertainly a terrorist intent on doing evil. So the ban takes on new \nurgency.\n  Today there is good news and bad news. The good news is that the \nHouse of Representatives has passed a bill to extend that ban for 10 \nyears. The bad news is that the dangerous loophole I mentioned is still \nin the bill. Under existing law--the law that expires tonight--one can \nmake one of these undetectable guns perfectly legal by simply attaching \na metal handle at the last moment when you want to slip it somewhere \nwhere it could be very dangerous and then remove the metal part and \nmake the gun invisible to the metal detector. All the Senator from \nFlorida and I wish to do is simply require that the metal piece be \npermanently affixed to the gun. Any gun without a permanent metal piece \nwould be illegal--a simple fix that will save lots of lives. \nUnfortunately, the House bill that passed keeps the present loophole in \nthe law.\n\n  I haven't heard any argument against our amendment other than: Nose \nin the camel's tent; this will allow people to do other bad things. But \nI haven't heard one specific argument against our closing the loophole\n\n[[Page S8555]]\n\nin the law the way we want to do it. Unfortunately, from what I am \ntold, there will be an objection to that and we will just pass a 10-\nyear extension. That is better than nothing, but it doesn't get us \nacross the finish line. The House bill is a step in the right \ndirection, certainly better than letting the law expire, but it still \nhas a glaring loophole in it.\n  So I hope we can pass a bill that not only extends the current ban \nbut closes the loophole that allows for the manufacture of guns that \ncan evade detection by simply removing a piece of metal. It is a simple \nfix to the existing statute that won't interrupt any lawful commerce in \narms. One can be the most fervent believer in the Second Amendment, and \nthe amendment we propose does not interfere with anyone's right to have \na gun--none. All we do is keep the legislative language up to speed \nwith technological developments.\n  In conclusion, a few years ago these undetectable plastic guns were \nscience fiction. Now they are frighteningly real. That is why we have \nto extend the ban and hopefully close the loophole.\n  I again thank my colleague Senator Nelson, as well as my colleague in \nthe House, Congressman Israel, and so many others who have joined us in \nthis, including Senator Murphy, Senator Whitehouse, and Senator Schatz, \nwho have been partners in trying to get this done.\n  Now I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of H.R. 3626, which is at the desk; that the Nelson-\nSchumer, et al. amendment, which is also at the desk, be agreed to; the \nbill, as amended, be read three times and passed; and that the motions \nto reconsider be made and laid upon the table with no intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is this objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 3626, which was received \nfrom the House. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third \ntime and passed and that the motion to reconsider be made and laid upon \nthe table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is this objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3626) was read the third time and passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I don't think I find fault with anything \nSenator Schumer said, except as a matter of timing and when to consider \nthose things. Before making any changes to current law, Congress needs \nto gain an understanding of printed gun manufacturing technology and \nits relation to permanent metal parts. There are other technical issues \nthat should be resolved before any legislation passes that reflects \nscientific and manufacturing process realities.\n  Today is the day the current plastic gun ban expires. The House had \nalready passed a 10-year extension on a bipartisan vote. The only way \nto be sure the current ban remains on the books is to pass the House \nbill, which the Senate just did. Since the Democrats wish to extend \ncurrent law, there are no current circumstances that demanded immediate \nchanges to the law.\n  Every previous extension of the bill has occurred on a bipartisan \nbasis and has lasted for at least 5 years so that Congress does not \nneed to constantly revisit it. Before Thanksgiving, my colleague, the \nSenator from New York, offered only a 1-year extension. Ten years is \nmuch better, and the 1-year extension proposal contained none of the \nsubstantive provisions the Senator from New York offered with mere \nhours to go before current law expires.\n  After the Senate passes the House bill--which we did--Congress then \nhas a responsibility to review the issue, hold hearings and obtain \nexpert testimony, and consider alternative legislation, including what \nthe Senator from New York has suggested. The date of expiration of the \ncurrent ban has been set for many years. If anybody in the Senate is so \nconcerned about what they consider to be a loophole in the law, this \nobviously should have been done through hearings and the introduction \nof legislation long ago. We did not even see the language of the \nproposed amendment I objected to until this afternoon. Dropping a bill \nat the eleventh hour without any investigation into the technological \nsituation demonstrates that their real objectives were things other \nthan just getting an extension.\n  Under current law, ``the Attorney General shall ensure that rules and \nregulations adopted pursuant to this paragraph do not impair the \nmanufacture of prototype firearms or the development of new \ntechnology.'' That is a quote from the proposed language that I \nobjected to--or that is in present law, but the amendment of the \nSenator from New York strikes that language. It seems to me that the \nJustice Department's regulations should not impair new technology or \nfirearm manufacturing, so I don't know why that change should have been \nsuggested. I am willing to listen to anybody's arguments to the \ncontrary, but that is the way I see it, and I am glad we have taken the \naction we have.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Iowa. \nObviously, I disagree. I think we should be closing this loophole. The \nlanguage may have been available this afternoon, but the concept was \nout there for weeks and weeks, if not longer. But I appreciate his \nlanguage, and he said he did not object to any specifics that I have \nmentioned here.\n  So I look forward. We are going to work hard with the Senator from \nIowa and others, with whom I disagree on interpretations of the Second \nAmendment in general, to try and come to an agreement here to close a \nloophole that we do not think touches any Second Amendment rights in \nany way at all. If we can work together over the next few months, \nweeks, with hearings and other things, and convince our colleagues that \nwe have no intent other than to close this loophole and make sure the \nvery law the Senator from Iowa wished to renew is simply made whole, \ngiven the new technology and the loophole is closed, I look forward to \nthat opportunity.\n  So I appreciate my colleague's remarks. I wish we had passed this \namendment. I think it would have made the bill better, stronger, with \nfewer loopholes, but that does not mean we cannot try to do that over \nthe next several months. I appreciate the opportunity to do so with my \nfriend, the only other ``Charles E.'' in the Senate.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, undetectable plastic guns used to be a \nhypothetical security threat. But now the threat is real.\n  3-D printer technology has evolved to the point where a person can \nmake a functioning plastic handgun in a matter of hours. These guns are \nlethal, and the technology used to make them is getting better--and \ncheaper--every day.\n  It is a serious concern that the plastic in these guns does not set \noff walk-through metal detectors. Many of our buildings are protected \nby these walk-through detectors--courthouses, schools, government \nbuildings, sports arenas, concert venues, and more.\n  The Undetectable Firearms Act sensibly bans guns that are not \ndetectable by these types of metal detectors. It is essential that we \nreauthorize this important law.\n  I am glad the House of Representatives passed an extension of this \nlaw last week. It is important that we not let this law expire.\n  But it is also important for Congress to update this law to close a \npotentially dangerous loophole.\n  Under the current law, a plastic gun can be legal if the gun owner \nsimply clips a piece of metal onto the gun, even if the metal is \nunnecessary to the functionality of the gun. This is a problem because \nthe person could simply unclip the metal from the gun to pass through a \nmetal detector and then have a fully-functioning gun inside a secure \nlocation.\n  We need to close this loophole and make sure that the functional \ncomponents of guns are detectable by walk-through metal detectors.\n  I do not mean to be alarmist about the risk that these plastic guns \npose, but the risks are real.\n\n[[Page S8556]]\n\n  Earlier this year the Jerusalem Post reported that an Israeli \njournalist tried to prove this point by bringing a plastic gun to a \npress conference at the Israeli Knesset. He got the gun through \nsecurity, and he filmed himself pointing the gun at Prime Minister \nNetanyahu.\n  Fortunately the gun was unloaded and the journalist had no intent to \nharm anyone. But we should take steps to protect against the risks of \nthese undetectable guns before a tragedy occurs.\n  I will support efforts to extend the current law, but I also urge my \ncolleagues to work to close this loophole as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I thank Senator Schumer and Senator \nNelson for their work on the extension of the Undetectable Firearms \nAct.\n  Plastic guns printed from 3D printers are one thing: dangerous. They \nhave no place in our society. These 3D-printed guns can be used to \ndodge security checks the way Tom Brady dodges opposing defenses. \nMembers of the law enforcement community, police men and women, the \nATF, TSA, FBI, and Secret Service all support this legislation because \nit will make our communities safer. I share their concerns and the \nconcerns of so many of my constituents in Massachusetts. I come here \ntoday to express my support for this bill because the safety of our \nchildren and communities must be our top priority. No parent, student, \nor traveler should be worried that a plastic 3D gun could be left \nundetected and find its way into an airplane, a train, or a classroom.\n  I am pleased we are passing this legislation today, but we must all \nremember that this is the bare minimum. Passing this legislation keeps \nplastic guns from becoming legal, but it does not crack down on the \ntorrents of assault weapons filling our streets or ensure that all gun \nsales must include a background check. Neither does it close the \nloophole that allows a plastic gun with a single piece of removable \nmetal to evade the ban.\n  Even after this bill passes, we must continue to fight for \ncommonsense gun safety regulations. In 1994, I worked with my \ncolleagues and now-Vice President Biden to enact tougher gun control \nlaws that helped remove dangerous Chinese assault weapons from our \nstreets. At the time, it seemed like an insurmountable task, but we got \nthose weapons of war off our streets. Today we face a challenge that \nseems similarly insurmountable. So I hope that in the coming days and \nweeks the Senate and Congress acts in a bipartisan manner to curb the \nepidemic of gun violence in our country. I will work with any Member of \nthis Chamber, on either side of the aisle, to enact comprehensive gun \ncontrol legislation that will keep our neighborhoods, our communities, \nour cities, and our public safe. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to ensure that we finally put tough gun safety laws on the \nbooks and get these dangerous weapons off our streets and out of our \nneighborhoods.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, on December 3, 2013, the House of \nRepresentatives passed a 10-year reauthorization of the Undetectable \nFirearms Act. This law prohibits firearms that are undetectable by \nwidely deployed security screening technologies such as x-ray and metal \ndetectors. These are the standard technologies used by law enforcement \nofficials to protect the public in State and Federal government \nbuildings, courthouses, airports, and a host of other public spaces and \nevents and these are the same technologies that protect the public and \nelected officials in the Capitol and congressional office buildings, \nwhere so many congressional staff and members of the public work and \nparticipate in the democratic process in an open and accessible \nenvironment. It is not difficult to appreciate why lethal weapons \ncapable of evading such detection cause significant concern for the law \nenforcement community. This law has been the widely supported policy of \nCongress since 1988, when the legislation was signed by President \nReagan. Ten years ago, Senator Hatch and I came together to reauthorize \nthis law in 2003.\n  While today's legislation is an important step to reauthorize this \nlaw, we have more work to do. Law enforcement experts have urged \nCongress to make modest changes necessary to close a loophole that \nallows an individual who makes a firearm using 3D printing technology \nto easily evade the reach of the current law. I support those changes \nin order to better protect the public and update the current law in a \nresponsible way.\n  Unfortunately, these recommendations have been met by Republican \nobjections. As the expiration of this law has crept closer and the \nissue has gained the greater attention of law enforcement officials and \nMembers of Congress, I worked in the Senate to find bipartisan support \nfor a reauthorization of the law that would include these needed \nupdates. I was disappointed that no Republican senator was willing to \nengage in a joint effort to responsibly update the law.\n  Today, a functioning, all-plastic, undetectable gun manufactured in \nthe home using publicly available technology is not theoretical; it is \nreality. Unfortunately, the legislation we pass today fails to provide \nlaw enforcement officials with the best tools possible to keep pace \nwith current and rapidly developing technology. This reauthorization \ndoes give Congress time to consider necessary updates to the law that \nlaw enforcement experts believe are critical to close the loopholes \nthat have been exposed by emerging technologies.\n  I hope that as we go forward, Members of Congress on both sides of \nthe aisle will closely examine the improvements we need to make to this \nlaw and will act responsibly in addressing them. Given this law's long \nhistory of bipartisan support, we should work together to carefully \nconsider the recommendations that law enforcement experts have made to \nmake this law better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I too thank Senator Grassley for \narranging so we could proceed with the current law. I have found \nSenator Grassley to be someone who will listen, who will deliberate, \nand who will try to do what he thinks is in the best interests of the \npeople, in this particular case, the security interests of the people. \nI would ask Senator Grassley to consider, as we meet about this over \nthe course of the next several weeks or months, since we both fly in to \nWashington, DC--and if you are on flights like this Senator is, there \nmay be a good chance there is an air marshal on that flight because the \nflight is so sensitive coming in to a city where you are only seconds--\nif an airplane aborts a landing, you are only within seconds of that \nairplane being near some of the centers of the U.S. Government, such as \nthe Capitol, such as the White House, such as the Supreme Court. If a \nperson were able to sneak a plastic gun through, then it seems to me \nthat poses a much greater threat to the security interests of this \ncountry and its people.\n  If it is, in fact, legal to have a gun where you can remove that \npiece of metal and someone has been able to sneak that through the \nmetal detectors at the place of origin of that person's flight, then it \nseems to me we are asking for trouble. In the great tradition of the \nSecond Amendment of protecting people and letting them have their \nrights to guns, this is an aberration of that right that we need to \nduly consider and protect against.\n  I thank Senator Grassley for coming here and extending the law today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/09/senate-section/article/S8556-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN.

Madam President, I come to the floor this evening to \ntalk about the importance of Congress doing its job and passing a \nbudget. We need a budget that is going to provide certainty for our \neconomy, that will eliminate reckless spending cuts, and that will \nfoster job creation.\n  We hear this week that Senate Budget Committee Chair Patty Murray and \nHouse Budget Committee Chair Paul Ryan may be close to just such an \nagreement. I think that is very good news because we need a budget deal \nso we can put an end to the manufactured crises that have hurt too many \nfamilies and businesses in New Hampshire and across this country.\n  I know I speak for so many of us here in the Senate when I say our \nprimary focus really should be on continuing to put in place an \nenvironment that creates jobs, that lays a foundation for economic \ngrowth. And that is one of the things that getting a budget deal would \nhelp do.\n  We have recently seen some signs of progress in the economy. The jobs \nreport on Friday was positive with over 200,000 private-sector jobs \nadded in November, and we have now had 45 straight months of private-\nsector job growth. But we all know we are not out of the woods yet. We \nhave a lot more work to do, and we need to build on the momentum that \nis there to get more people back to work.\n  When I travel around New Hampshire, my constituents tell me they are \nvery frustrated with the gridlock in Washington, and what they want is \nfor us to come together here in Congress, to agree on a budget, and to \ntake action that supports economic growth.\n  Granite Staters are absolutely right. With a potential budget \nagreement, we have an opportunity to eliminate some of the uncertainty \nin our economy, to eliminate some of those harmful cuts that are part \nof sequestration--the automatic budget cuts--and to finally set some \npriorities that will help us create jobs.\n  Sadly, too much in the past few months has had the Congress moving \nfrom one manufactured crisis on the budget to another. It has cost the \neconomy severely. It has hurt job creation. As economist Mark Zandi \nrecently noted: ``As long as lawmakers stay deadlocked over the \ndirection of the federal budget, the economic recovery will not gain \nmomentum.''\n  So I am very hopeful we can reach a deal that will provide the \nAppropriations Committee with a roadmap for the rest of 2014 and 2015.\n  I have heard from a lot of small businesses in New Hampshire that one \nof the challenges they are currently facing post government shutdown--\nand certainly for so many small businesses and families, they were hurt \nby that government shutdown, which cost the economy about $24 billion, \nand they are now looking at what the potential impact in the future \nwill be from sequestration. Those spending cuts have halted Federal \ncontracts, in many cases, for small businesses. They have caused \nuncertainty that is affecting job creation and hiring.\n  One of the New Hampshire business owners with whom I met recently \nsaid: ``You hear about how CEOs are hesitant to hire--this is why''--\nthis uncertainty around sequestration, around what we are going to do \nabout a budget for the country.\n  These indiscriminate cuts from sequestration have not just hurt job \ncreation. They have also affected programs that are critical to \nfamilies in New Hampshire and across the country.\n  One of those programs I had a chance to visit last week is the Meals \non Wheels Program. I helped deliver meals in Rockingham County. The \nPresiding Officer knows Rockingham County very well. It is just across \nthe boarder from Massachusetts, which she represents. I had really \nambivalent feelings about delivering those meals to seniors because on \nthe one hand people were so appreciative and we got to help people who \nneeded those hot meals, but on the other hand what I heard from those \nseniors was the effect that sequestration and spending cuts were having \non the program. Those spending cuts have slashed $81,000 from \nRockingham Nutrition's Meals on Wheels budget. According to Debra \nPerou, the agency's executive director, Rockingham Nutrition is \ndelivering 17,000 fewer meals as a result of those cuts. She told me it \nwas a very tough day when they had to try to figure out who was going \nto get cut from getting those meals on wheels.\n  The seniors with whom I met in Salem told me they were frustrated \nthat nothing was happening to eliminate those reckless spending cuts.\n  I met a former engineer from Raytheon, Larry Somes and his wife \nLillian. Lillian not only has dementia developing, but she has macular \ndegeneration. It has made it difficult for her to cook. Larry's pension \nfrom Raytheon does not go as far as it did 25 years ago when he \nretired. He said: ``Congress isn't doing anything [to help].''\n  Well, Larry is not alone, sadly. In Salem, 25 percent of Meals on \nWheels recipients are older than 85. For these seniors--who are unable \nto cook for themselves--Meals on Wheels makes it possible for them to \nkeep their housing and independence.\n  One of the things the seniors did this fall was to do a campaign \nwhere the program asked all of the seniors who received Meals on Wheels \nif they would write a message about how they felt about the program on \na paper plate and send it to their elected officials so we would know \nwhat they are thinking. So I brought some of those messages, and they \nare short so they will not take much time to read. But I think it is \nimportant to read some of these messages so all of us have a chance to \nhear how our seniors are feeling.\n  This one is not signed, but it says:\n\n       Seniors need Meals on Wheels to keep them in their homes \n     and healthy. Put yourself in their position. Do you like to \n     eat? Do you want to be in your home?\n       Thank you Meals on Wheels. I am crippled and walk with a \n     walker. I can't cook much anymore. I'm a diabetic so I have \n     to eat, eat right. Thanks to everyone who cooks and delivers. \n     God bless you.\n       Keep Meals on Wheels. The homebound people are in need and \n     look forward to getting a healthy meal and seeing someone \n     every day.\n\n  That is the other aspect that is so important about Meals on Wheels. \nIt is not just about delivering that hot meal. It is about making sure \nsomeone is checking in on our older Americans who are living alone, who \nsometimes do not see people because they are housebound. These messages \nare telling about how important this program is.\n  As Maria and Bill say:\n\n       As this plate is empty, so will my wife's meals be. She has \n     a serious medical problem and needs these meals. Think of \n     this when you sit in your dining room tonight to have your \n     meal. Thank you for your help keeping these meals coming.\n\n  Then from Denise, she says:\n\n       Please don't take my food away. I need it.\n\n  That says it all.\n  The work Rockingham Christian and Meals On Wheels does is critical \nfor seniors in that part of New Hampshire. They are joined by nine \nother Meals On Wheels Programs around New Hampshire. They serve \nthousands of people throughout the State. Last year alone Meals On \nWheels delivered more than 1.2 million meals to 11,596 people in New \nHampshire. The services are critical not only for improving the lives \nof seniors but also for reducing health care spending. The yearly cost \nof Meals On Wheels for a single senior is equivalent to the cost of 9 \ndays in a nursing home or 1 or 2 days in the hospital. This is not a \nprogram that is important to seniors because it keeps them healthy and \nkeeps them in their homes; this is a program that is cost-effective \nbecause if we are not able to keep seniors in their homes with \nsomething to eat, they are going to wind up in nursing homes and they \nare going to wind up in hospitals.\n  Programs such as Meals On Wheels are not where we should be cutting. \nWe\n\n[[Page S8558]]\n\nshould focus on wasteful and duplicative programs, not those with a \nproven track record of success. That is why a budget agreement is so \ncritical. This year the Senate Appropriations Committee passed a bill \nthat provided full funding for Meals On Wheels, but without a budget \nagreement, we have not been able to restore cuts to this very vital \nprogram.\n  We all know sequestration was designed to never go into effect. It \nwas designed to be so harmful and reckless that we in Congress would \nfind a better, smarter way to reduce our deficit. But because of \nsequestration, too many families and small businesses in New Hampshire \nhave felt firsthand the dramatic effects of us failing to do our job. \nWith the potential budget agreement coming from Senator Murray and \nCongressman Ryan, we will have an opportunity to reduce these impacts, \nto finally get to work replacing the harmful cuts from sequestration \nwith a responsible plan that will grow our economy and create jobs.\n  Finally, it is my hope that a budget agreement will also include an \nextension of unemployment benefits for the millions of Americans who \nlost their jobs through no fault of their own. In New Hampshire, our \nunemployment rate is lower than the national average and has been \nconsistently throughout this recession, but that does not help if you \nare in a household where the breadwinners are unemployed. That \nhousehold has a 100-percent unemployment rate. So despite the \nsignificant progress for our economy since the recession, the \nunemployment rate remains unacceptably high. For millions of Americans, \nfinding a job remains very difficult in this market. Unemployment \nbenefits remain a vital lifeline while they seek new work. So if we do \nnothing before the end of this year, about 1.3 million Americans will \nlose their extended unemployment benefits starting in January. Millions \nmore will exhaust their benefits over the course of 2014. In New \nHampshire, an estimated 8,500 individuals will be affected.\n  Failing to extend these benefits will not only hurt these families, \nbut it will also affect our economic recovery because failing to extend \nunemployment for these Americans would result in 240,000 fewer jobs \ncreated in 2014. To put that into perspective, the recent jobs report \nshowed that our economy gained 200,000 jobs in the month of November. \nFailing to extend unemployment benefits would be the equivalent of \nsacrificing an entire month of job creation.\n  At this fragile point in our economic recovery, we should not be \nletting this critical program expire for these Americans. I hope we can \nreach an agreement. I hope that agreement will begin to roll back those \ncuts from sequestration, will extend unemployment benefits for those \nfamilies who really need them, and that we can get this done in a \ntimely fashion so that the government continues to operate.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I am not going to respond in any detail to \nmy friend, and he is my friend. There is no way of explaining how the \nRepublicans could arbitrarily refuse to nominate four of the most \nqualified people, frankly, because they turned down one woman twice for \nthe DC Circuit. This is, some say, a court more important than the U.S. \nSupreme Court. The Republicans, without any question about their \nintegrity, their education, their experience, said no. Why? Because \nthey don't want President Obama to have these people in this important \ncourt. They want to keep the court with the majority of Republicans. \nThat is wrong. It is wrong, and there were many reasons we did what we \ndid, but it was the right thing for the country and it is the right \nthing for democracy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to consider the \nfollowing nominations: Calendar Nos. 330, 347, 348, 349, 350, 382, 383, \n384, 385, 386, 434, 435, 436, and 437; that the nominations be \nconfirmed; the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon \nthe table, with no intervening action or debate; that no further \nmotions be in order to any of the nominations; that any statements \nrelated to the nominations be printed in the Record; that the President \nbe immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then \nresume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Reserving my right to object, again I will make my \ncomments after the majority leader has completed his business, but all \nSenate Republicans wanted with the DC Circuit judges was to do what \nDemocratic Senators insisted on doing in 2006, transferring judges from \na court where they are not needed to courts where they are needed.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Toby has served for the \nlast 2 years as a congressional budget liaison for the Secretary of the \nArmy and will soon depart for his next duty assignment.\n  A native of Hobbs, NM, Toby earned his commission from Tarleton State \nUniversity in 2003. Major Williford's assignments have been diverse and \ninclude 24 months of combat experience. While a lieutenant, he served \nin F Company, 1-66 Armor Battalion and Headquarters and Headquarters \nCompany 4th Forward Support Battalion as a platoon leader, executive \nofficer, and support operations officer, both stateside and in combat \nduring Operation Iraqi Freedom. After promotion to captain, Toby served \nin the 17th Combat Support Sustainment Battalion as commander of the \n539th Transportation Company and deployed to Kuwait for his second \ncombat tour.\n  After returning from his second deployment, Toby began his studies as \nan Army congressional fellow, earning a master's of professional \nstudies in legislative affairs from the George Washington University. \nHe was then assigned as a congressional fellow in my office in 2011. \nToby was subsequently assigned as a congressional budget liaison \nofficer in the office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for \nFinancial Management and Comptroller with responsibility for the \nammunition and missile procurement portfolios. Toby advised the Army's \nsenior leaders, fostering and strengthening the relationship between \nCongress and the U.S. Army.\n  Major Williford's leadership throughout his career has positively \nimpacted his peers and superiors, soldiers and civilians alike. As a \ncongressional budget liaison officer, he worked directly with the House \nand Senate Appropriations Committees to educate and inform \nRepresentatives, Senators, and staff about the diverse and important \nammunition and missile procurement initiatives of the U.S. Army.\n  On behalf of a grateful nation, I join my colleagues today in \nrecognizing and commending MAJ Toby M. Williford for over a decade of \nactive service to his country in the U.S. Army. We wish Toby, his wife \nAmanda, and their four children, Addison, Aubrey, Tate, and Alyssa, all \nthe best as they continue their journey of service to our great \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/09/senate-section/article/S8561-3", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WITNESSES TO HUNGER\n\n Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I stand today to recognize the 5-\nyear anniversary of Witnesses to Hunger. Launched in 2008, Witnesses to \nHunger is a research and advocacy project founded by the Center for \nHunger-Free Communities at Drexel University in Philadelphia, PA.\n  In 2008, Dr. Mariana Chilton provided cameras to 42 single-parent \nwomen in Philadelphia, simply asking that they use them to take \npictures to tell us about their lives and their children. These women, \nseeing the opportunity to spread awareness and create change, accepted \nDr. Chilton's challenge and started documenting the poverty and hunger \nthat they face on a daily basis. Their photographs provide a window \ninto the lives of mothers who understand the challenges of raising a \nfamily on a limited income.\n  Since inception this project has grown, expanding throughout \nPennsylvania and the country. Over the last 5 years, the Witnesses have \ngrown by more than 29 participants. By encouraging advocacy and \ncommunity engagement, Witnesses to Hunger has empowered mothers in \ncities across the country by uniting their voices. Living it each day, \nthese remarkable mothers understand the trials of hunger and raising a \nfamily more than anyone else. These powerful photographs serve to start \na dialogue and bring much needed attention to the issues that impact \ntheir lives daily.\n  Photography is an opportunity for these women to share their lives \nwith others. I had the privilege of bringing the Witnesses to Hunger's \nexhibit to Capitol Hill in Washington DC, the State Capital in \nHarrisburg, PA and to several other cities within the Commonwealth. I \nam humbled to have played a small part in sharing the stories of their \nlives. These women have begun a movement that has inspired countless \nothers and will inspire many more yet to come. They inspire me and \nchallenge me to do more in the Senate. I am incredibly grateful for the \nguidance they provide. We need more projects like Witnesses to Hunger \nto continue to raise awareness of the struggles that everyday mothers \ngo through to raise a family in communities across the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/09/senate-section/article/S8561-4", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO PATRICIA E. GRANT\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I wish to honor the life of \nPatricia E. Grant, a Hall of Fame golfer, a commended veteran, and a \nwoman some have called ``the type of American our country needs to look \nup to.''\n  Born March 12, 1921, her family moved to Cushing, OK, where Pat won \nthe Oklahoma State High School Golf Championship as a 13-year old \nfreshman, repeating the win three times before her high school \ngraduation. While attending Oklahoma Baptist University, where she \nreceived a scholarship in exchange for teaching golf to fellow \nstudents, Pat won the Women's Oklahoma Golf Association State Amateur \nChampionship four times and was the first female to be inducted into \nthe OBU Athletic Hall of Fame. In 1946, she became the only person in \nhistory to win the contest 5 years in a row, and even went on to a \nsixth win in 1949. Ultimately, Pat won golf tournaments all over the \nworld and was inducted into the Women's Oklahoma Golf Hall of Fame in \nApril 2010.\n  When World War II broke out, Pat enlisted in the U.S. Army, alongside \nher sister Mary Margaret. Pat held many assignments across the globe, \nincluding that of assisting the chief legal counsel during the \nNuremberg Trials. She received 23 letters of commendation while in the \nArmy, and retired after 22 years of active duty with the rank of \nLieutenant Colonel, one of only 60 women to attain the rank at the \ntime.\n  Not quite ready for retirement, Pat earned her law degree in 1966 and \npracticed family law in Texas for 30 years. She was named Woman of the \nYear by the Texas Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs \nin 1972 as a result of her service.\n  After retiring for good in 1995, Pat remained active, playing golf \ninto her 70s, learning how to belly dance, and piloting an ultralight \naircraft every Saturday morning. She passed away November 26, 2013, \ngreatly loved by friends and family.\n  Mr. President, I ask that you join me today in celebrating the life \nof Pat Grant.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/09/senate-section/article/S8561-5", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8561-S8562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n AGREEMENT ON SOCIAL SECURITY BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE SWISS \n       CONFEDERATION, CONSISTING OF A PRINCIPAL AGREEMENT AND AN \n                    ADMINISTRATIVE AGREEMENT--PM 25\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with accompanying \nreports and papers; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to section 233(e)(1) of the Social Security Act, as amended \nby the Social Security Amendments of 1977 (Public Law 95-216, 42 U.S.C. \n433(e)(1)),\n\n[[Page S8562]]\n\nI transmit herewith an Agreement on Social Security between the United \nStates of America and the Swiss Confederation, signed at Bern on \nDecember 3, 2012, (the ``U.S.-Swiss Agreement''). The Agreement \nconsists of two instruments: a principal agreement and an \nadministrative arrangement, and upon entry into force, will replace: \nthe Agreement between the United States of America and the Swiss \nConfederation on Social Security with final protocol, signed July 18, \n1979; the Administrative Agreement between the United States of America \nand the Swiss Confederation for the Implementation of the Agreement on \nSocial Security of July 18, 1979, signed December 20, 1979; and the \nSupplementary Agreement between the two Contracting States, signed June \n1, 1988.\n  The U.S.-Swiss Agreement is similar in objective to the social \nsecurity agreements already in force with most of the European Union \nmember states, Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan, Norway, and the \nRepublic of Korea. Such bilateral agreements provide for limited \ncoordination between the United States and foreign social security \nsystems to eliminate dual social security coverage and taxation and to \nhelp prevent the lost benefit protection that can occur when workers \ndivide their careers between two countries. The principal updates \nencompassed in the Agreement include amendments to rules for \nentitlement to Swiss disability pensions paid to ensure equality of \ntreatments between U.S. and Swiss nationals, updates to personal \ninformation confidentiality provisions, and modifications necessary to \ntake into account changes in U.S. and Swiss laws since 1988.\n  The U.S.-Swiss Agreement contains all provisions mandated by section \n233 of the Social Security Act and other provisions that I deem \nappropriate to carry out the purposes of section 233, pursuant to \nsection 233(c)(4) of the Social Security Act.\n  I also transmit, for the information of the Congress, a report \nprepared by the Social Security Administration explaining the key \npoints of the U.S.-Swiss Agreement, along with a paragraph-by-paragraph \nexplanation of the provisions of the principal agreement and \nadministrative arrangement. Annexed to this report is the report \nrequired by section 233(e)(1) of the Social Security Act on the number \nof individuals affected by the Agreement and the effect of the \nAgreement on the estimated income and expenditures of the U.S. Social \nSecurity program. The Department of State and the Social Security \nAdministration have recommended the U.S.-Swiss Agreement and related \ndocuments to me.\n  I commend the U.S.-Swiss Agreement on Social Security and related \ndocuments.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, December 9, 2013.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/09/senate-section/article/S8562-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 3, 2013, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on November 22, 2013, during the \nadjournment of the Senate, received a message from the House of \nRepresentatives announcing that the House agreed to the following \nconcurrent resolution, without amendment:\n\n       S.

A bill to improve timber management on Oregon and California \nRailroad and Coos Bay Wagon Road grant land, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a bill to end the \ngridlock on the Oregon and California, O, lands and secure a new \nfuture. I recently unveiled my legislation in Oregon alongside Governor \nKitzhaber, premier forest scientists, and a cross-section of supporters \nfrom timber, county, collaborative group and environmental interests. \nWith the introduction of this bill, I look forward to working with \nsupporters and interested parties, as well as the entire Oregon \ndelegation, to end decades of uncertainty and broken forest policy with \na science-driven solution.\n  The 2.1 million acres of O grant lands have a history known too \nwell by Oregonians. After the Oregon and California Railroad violated \nthe terms of its land grant, Congress revested the lands to federal \nownership in 1916. In 1937, Congress directed how the Department of the \nInterior was to manage these lands and laid out a formula for \ndistributing timber receipts to the 18 Oregon counties with O lands. \nThe high logging harvests of the 1980s made way for the spotted owl \ntimber wars, and today the lands are ground zero for the battle between \nthose seeking to halt logging in the Northwest and those seeking to \nreturn to the unsustainable logging levels of a bygone era.\n  My bill ends the O gridlock by using science to guide management of \nthe O lands while upholding bedrock federal environmental laws. This \nbill provides the jobs that Oregonians need, certainty of timber supply \nthat timber companies require, and continued environmental protections \nthat our treasures deserve. It is legislation that I believe can pass \nboth houses of Congress and be signed by the President.\n  The first step the bill takes is to divide the O lands--with \nroughly half set aside for forestry emphasis and the other half for \nconservation emphasis--to put a stop to the uncertainty and conflicting \npriorities that have contributed to Federal management failure on these \nlands and produce wins on both sides of the historic timber conflict. \nThe forestry emphasis lands will employ proven forestry practices, \nknown as ``ecological forestry,'' to mimic natural processes and create \nhealthier, more diverse forests. Modeling using Bureau of Land \nManagement analysis confirms that ecological forestry will roughly \ndouble the harvest on O lands compared to the last 10 years, meaning \nmore jobs for rural Oregon.\n  On the conservation side, my bill protects nearly a million acres of \nland, while designating wilderness lands, wild and scenic rivers, and \nother special areas. It creates 87,000 acres of wilderness and 165 \nmiles of wild and scenic rivers. In all, it will permanently conserve \nnearly a million acres of O lands, which would be the single biggest \nincrease in Oregon's conservation lands in decades. That includes \nspecial areas protected for recreation, which is an increasingly \nimportant part of our rural economy, and is responsible for 141,000 \njobs in Oregon alone. Perhaps the most important conservation win in \nthe bill is the first-ever legislative protection for old growth trees \nand stands on O lands.\n  This strategy of dividing the lands into conservation and timber \nemphasis and protecting old growth takes the most controversial \nharvests off the table. Timber harvests and thinning projects must \nprotect water quality, highly erodible land, wetlands, endangered or \nthreatened species, and tribal cultural sites. Mills and timber \ncompanies that rely on federal forests will have new certainty of a \nsustainable yield from the harvested lands. This bill upholds the \nEndangered Species Act and other bedrock environmental laws while \nproviding expedited procedures and strict timelines for legal and \nenvironmental reviews. Two large scale environmental impact \nstatements--one each for moist and dry forests--will study 10 years of \nwork in the woods, rather than a single project. Anyone with concerns \nwill have a chance to sue over those studies, but once the \nenvironmental review is approved, any timber sale consistent with the \n10-year study can go ahead, without triggering a new legal stumbling \nblock or procedural boulder that brings everything to a stop.\n  Above all, forest policy should be dictated by science, not lawyers. \nThe forestry principles used in this bill are based on the work of Drs. \nNorm Johnson and Jerry Franklin, two respected Northwest forestry \nscientists, and built off of forestry approaches used around the globe. \nThe bill also establishes the first ever legislative protections for \nO streams thanks in large part to the work of one of the Northwest's \nforemost water resources experts, Dr. Gordon Reeves. The Northwest \nForest Plan's stream protections are extended to key watersheds and \nfour drinking water emphasis areas, with additional lands designated \nfor conservation, to protect drinking water. Science also guides how \nthe agency can treat trees near streams and a scientific committee will \nevaluate stream buffers and reserves in areas dedicated to timber \nharvests, increasing or decreasing the boundaries as needed to address \nthe ecological importance of streams. This acknowledges that one size \ndoes not fit all.\n  The bill also creates new tools to reduce fire danger in the dry \nforests of Southern Oregon. In areas that have grown prone to \ncatastrophic fires, this bill reduces tree density and provides new \ntools for treating forest lands near residences. For the first time, \ncounty governments will have the flexibility to reduce fire danger \nwithin a quarter mile of homes, and private landowners can more easily \nprotect against fire within 100 feet of their own homes.\n  The O solution that I present today will indeed secure a new future \nfor the O lands. Management will be based on science, not lawyers. \nCounties will be able to count on dependable forest revenues. \nCommunities will have steady jobs, and mill's timber to process, in \nplace of a struggle to survive. My bill certainly doesn't provide \neverything all sides want, but it can get everyone what they need. I \nlook forward to working with Congressmen DeFazio, Walden and Schrader \nand our colleagues in the Senate and House of Representatives to pass \nan O solution into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/09/senate-section/article/S8572-1", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8572-S8573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 312--CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAN TO FULFILL \n THEIR PROMISES OF ASSISTANCE IN THIS CASE OF ROBERT LEVINSON, ONE OF \n    THE LONGEST HELD UNITED STATES CIVILIANS IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY\n\n  Mr. NELSON (for himself and Mr. Rubio) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Madam President, if there is no further business to come \nbefore the Senate, I ask unanimous consent it adjourn under the \nprevious order, following the remarks of approximately one-half hour of \nSenator Lamar Alexander.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I wonder if I might ask the majority \nleader a question.\n  Mr. REID. Of course.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. If I may ask it through the Chair, as I understand it, \nthere are a total of 13 district judges on the calendar, and the \nmajority leader is the only one in the Chamber who has the right to \nbring a judge from the calendar to the floor.\n  If I heard him correctly, he filed cloture on four district judges. \nThe way I understand the Senate procedure is that means we have an \nintervening day tomorrow and we can start voting on Wednesday.\n  Because we changed the rules at the majority leader's request to make \nit easier to confirm district judges, there is only, in effect, 1 hour \nof debate on each district judge, 2 hours equally divided. Then, if \nDemocrats decide they don't want to use their hour, we could use our \nhour if we wanted to--and that there never has been in the history of \nthe Senate a district judge denied his or her seat by a filibuster, not \nPresident Obama, not anyone else.\n  If that is the case, why doesn't the majority leader bring up all the \ndistrict judges? Let's bring up all 14 of them, bring them to the \nfloor, have 1 hour of debate on each one? Why don't we do that?\n  Mr. REID. We tried to do that. The distinguished Senator from \nTennessee objected.\n  The truth is that the Senate has gotten out of whack. If there was a \ncontroversy with one of these judges, then you could have some reason \nto stall. In years past, we have done it by unanimous consent. I think \nit is unfortunate that this Senate has come to this, but that is where \nwe are.\n  We could approve 14 of these by my friend not objecting to them. He \nis on the record as saying he doesn't think there should be judges who \nare objected to; district court judges should be filibustered.\n  But here is the situation. During the entire time we have been a \ncountry, there have been 23 district court judges filibustered, in the \nentire time we have been a country. Twenty of them have been during the \nObama administration.\n  So this is a game Republicans have played to do everything they can \nto make Obama a failed President, and they are not doing it. He is a \nvery successful President and has a long list of things he has done in \nspite of the Republicans.\n  So I don't know the point my friend is trying to make, but let's \napprove all these. They are all going to get approved anyway. So what \nwe are going to do is go through this process.\n  I saw my friend, the Senator from Arkansas, come through here. He \nhelped, along with this Senator whose idea it was, from Tennessee--\nbecause Senator Frist was the leader and he backed off that and I \nunderstand why--where we had this nuclear option come up before, the \nConstitutional option, and there was an agreement made by my Republican \ncolleagues that they would not filibuster a judge unless there were \nextraordinary circumstances. Does anyone understand--does anyone not \nunderstand why the whole country is upset about this?\n\n  Extraordinary circumstances? Look at these circuit court judges. It \nis outrageous that they do not like them just because they do not like \nthem. Their qualifications are superb. Their educational backgrounds? \nThey went to the best law schools in America. They all have good work \nrecords. But they objected to them.\n  My friend, for whom I have great admiration, the senior Senator from \nthe State of Tennessee, has a stellar record. He has been Governor of a \nState, he has been a Cabinet Secretary, and he has been a very fine \nSenator. But in his heart he knows that what is going on here in the \nSenate has been wrong. He may criticize the majority leader for working \nto change the rules here, but they have been changed before, and they \nare going to be changed again.\n  It simply is not working. Who can complain about a majority vote? Who \ncan complain about that? Someone talks about this filibuster as if it \nis something engraven someplace along with the Ten Commandments, but it \nis not. It is not in the Constitution. It is something we have \ndeveloped here in the Senate. It originally came about to help get \nlegislation passed. But my friends, the Republicans, the last number of \nyears have used it to defeat legislation.\n  These nominations should have been approved. We should not have had \nto go through all this and we will not have to in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/12/09/senate-section/article/S8574-4", "month": "12", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8574-S8579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CHANGING SENATE RULES\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I appreciate the courtesy of the \nmajority leader in allowing me to ask him a question. I have more to \nsay about this whole subject. But let me go back to my point. There are \n13 district judges on the calendar. On November 21, when we last met, \nthere were 13 district judges. There is only one person in this Chamber \nwho can bring a judge from the calendar to the floor for confirmation. \nThat is the majority leader. Why did he not bring them all up? Why \ndidn't he move them? Because under our rules all he has to do is make a \nmotion that so-and-so district judge be confirmed. If he files cloture, \nwe have to wait 1 day, and then we have 2 hours of debate.\n  Never in the history of the country, according to the Congressional \nResearch Service, has a district judge been denied his or her seat \nbecause of a failed cloture vote, because of a filibuster. I know this \nfrom personal experience because a judge named McConnell from Rhode \nIsland was nominated by President Obama at the recommendation of the \nRhode Island Senators, and there were a number on this side who said we \nshould filibuster the judge.\n  I thought not. I argued to all of the Republicans that we never had \ndone that in history and we ought not to do it, we ought not to start \nit. So what has happened? I believe, with all due respect, the majority \nleader is manufacturing a crisis. There is no crisis with those 13 \ndistrict judges. He is the one who could bring them up. He could have \ndone it on Thursday, November 21st, the day he changed the rules. \nFriday would be the intervening day. The maximum amount of debate the \nDemocrats could require on each judge would be 1 hour, if they yield \nback their hour. So in 13 hours, before midnight tonight, they could \nall be district judges. They were sitting on the calendar waiting for \nthe majority leader to move.\n\n[[Page S8575]]\n\n  The same is true with the sub-Cabinet members. But let's just stay \nwith the district judges for a minute. I know I am right about this \nbecause I have sat down with the Senate historian. I sat down with the \nCongressional Research Service. I said, has there ever been a \nPresident's nominee for a Federal district judge who has not been \nconfirmed because of a failed cloture vote? The answer is zero--not for \nPresident Obama, not for President Bush, not for President Clinton, not \nfor any President.\n  Because Senator Reid, the distinguished majority leader, believed \nthat the district judges were moving too slowly through the Senate, we \nchanged the rules this past year. We said that with district judges, \nonce there is a cloture vote--and remember, no judge has ever been \ndenied his seat because of a cloture vote. Once there is a cloture \nvote, there can only be 2 hours of debate, one for the minority and one \nfor the majority. So this is a manufactured crisis. That is what was \ndone in order to do what the Democratic majority did on November 21, \nwhich is the most stunning development in the history of the Senate in \nterms of a rules change, and I intend to talk about that tonight. I \nwant to go through some very specific facts--not speeches, not \nsomething made up, but facts.\n  I am glad that the majority leader moved four district judges but \nevery one of the other nine might ask, Mr. Majority Leader, why did you \nnot move my name? Why are you leaving me out? Because you could move it \non Monday, wait a day, and on Wednesday you could confirm every single \none of the judges there?\n  The reason was because the majority leader wanted to make it look \nlike there was a problem here so he could do as Senator Levin said we \ndid on November 21--in effect create a Senate without rules--over the \nobjection of 48 Senators the Democratic majority established a \nprecedent that the Senate can change the rules any time it wants to for \nany reason it wants to. So I want to speak a little bit tonight about \nhow I and other Senators are expected to serve in a Senate with no \nrules.\n  Yesterday was a pretty exciting day in the National Football League. \nThere were a lot of close games. The Ravens and the Vikings scored 5 \ntouchdowns in 2 minutes and 1 second. In Pittsburgh, Miami was ahead \nwhen the Steelers Anthony Brown raced into the end zone after a series \nof lateral passes. It was one of those things where it is the last play \nof the game and they start playing, passing to each other. It rarely \nworks. Every now and then it does, and it appeared to in this case \nbecause Brown was the last one with the ball. He got into the end zone \nbefore time expired, but the officials ruled he had stepped out of \nbounds before scoring.\n  What if Pittsburgh had said yesterday: Wait a minute, we are the home \nteam. We will change the rules and say if you go step out of bounds \nonly once as you are running toward the end zone with lateral passes on \nthe last play of the game then you score, so Pittsburgh wins the game?\n\n  Or what if they had said: We are the home team. We will just add 5 \nminutes and see if we can win the game in that 5 minutes? They would \nhave been happy in Pittsburgh yesterday but maybe not for long.\n  But what happens when Miami becomes the home team and Pittsburgh goes \nto Miami to play and Miami changes the rules in the middle of the game \nso Miami can win? What would happen to the game of professional \nfootball if the home team could change the rules in the middle of the \ngame to get the result it wanted? The National Football League knows. \nThey spend a lot of time on rules. They know if there is no integrity \nfor the rules there is no integrity for the game, and pretty soon the \nfans do not watch the game because the game has no integrity.\n  That is why the NFL goes to such great lengths about its rules. There \nare officials all over the field. They are standing, you know, right in \nthe middle of the play. There is an instant review of every call they \nmake. When they make a call they huddle to see if they interpreted the \nrule right. If a coach doesn't like it, he has an opportunity to \nchallenge the ruling. There is someone up in a box who looks at that \nand reviews it. Today, Monday morning in New York, in the National \nFootball League office, senior retired officials get together and they \nreview every single call and every single no-call that was made \nyesterday in every league game. They grade every single official based \non those calls, and rarely does anyone get 100 percent. The NFL is in a \nconstant review of the rules because if there is no integrity to the \nrules, they know there is no integrity to the game, and there will be \nno fans.\n  I say this because on Thursday, the last day we were here, November \n21, before Senators went home for Thanksgiving, the Democratic majority \ndestroyed the rules of the Senate. With all of the Republican Members \nopposed and 3 Democratic Members opposed, the Senate voted 52 to 48 to \ninvoke the so-called nuclear option, allowing a majority of Senators \npresent and voting--so not necessarily 51--to approve Presidential \nnominees except for Supreme Court Justices. For those positions they \neliminated the filibuster, which required 60 votes to proceed to an up \nor down majority vote.\n  That is what Senator Reid went through a few minutes ago. He was \nsaying that we will move for cloture, we will have an intervening day, \nand then we will have a cloture vote. Before Thursday, before November \n21, that took 60 votes. Although, as I said, in the case of Federal \ndistrict judges it had never been used to deny a seat. But now it only \ntakes a majority of those present and voting. This was the most \ndangerous restructuring of Senate rules since Thomas Jefferson wrote \nthe rules because it creates a perpetual opportunity for what Alexis de \nTocqueville called, when he traveled our country in the 1830s, one of \nthe greatest threats to our democracy, and that is the tyranny of the \nmajority.\n  This stunning rules change by the Senate majority can best be \ndescribed as ObamaCare 2. One of the things that Americans really \ndidn't like about the new health care law, ObamaCare, was that it was \npassed in the dead of night by a purely partisan vote during a \nsnowstorm. It showed that those who had the votes could do whatever \nthey wanted no matter what the minority thought, and we can see the \nresults: millions of Americans having their policies canceled. Next \nyear, tens of millions will--those who get their insurance through \nemployers. This is another example of that kind of power play. This \ntime the goal was to help the administration and the Democratic \nmajority advance its radical agenda, unchecked through the courts and \nthe executive agencies.\n  As the Senator from Michigan, Senator Levin said--quoting a former \nRepublican Senator, Senator Vandenberg--Senator Levin is a Democrat--\nsaid on that Thursday, ``If a majority of the Senate can change its \nrules at any time, there are no rules.''\n  ``If a majority of the Senate can change its rules at any time, there \nare no rules.''\n  Similar to the Pittsburgh game, if the home team can change its rules \nat any time there are no rules to the game. Every child knows that \nthere have to be rules to the game. So I have this question: How am I \nand how are other Senators supposed to serve in a Senate with no rules? \nHow is this different from what could have happened in Pittsburgh if \nthey changed the rules in the middle of the game? Or if the Red Sox, \nfinding themselves behind in the ninth inning, added a few innings just \nto make sure they beat the Cardinals in the World Series. In the \nSenate, future majorities could do whatever they want, end the \nfilibuster for legislation, removing any obstacle to the tyranny of the \nmajority. Just as if there were no integrity of the rules of football \nand there would be no integrity of the game and there would be no fans, \nif there were no integrity to the rules of the Senate, there is no \nintegrity for the Senate and no respect for this part of our system of \ngovernment.\n  I think I was not overstating it when I said this is the most \ndangerous change to the rules since Thomas Jefferson wrote them. When \nhe did write the rules, he had this to say about why we have rules. His \nwords are in the Senate rules book that every single one of us has and \nhopefully have read at least the beginning parts of. This is worth \nreading. It is entitled ``The Importance of Adhering to Rules.''\n  Remember the argument here is not about the filibuster, it is about \nhow the rules were changed. The Importance of Adhering to Rules. I am \ngoing to read\n\n[[Page S8576]]\n\na little bit of this. According to Thomas Jefferson, when he wrote the \nSenate rules:\n  Mr. Onslow, the ablest among the Speakers of the House of Commons, \nused to say, ``it was a maxim he had often heard, when he was a young \nman, from old and experienced members, that nothing tended to throw \npower more into the hand of administration and those who acted with the \nmajority of the House of Commons, than a neglect of, or departure from, \nthe rules of proceeding: that these forms, as instituted by our \nancestors, operated as a check and control on the actions of the \nmajority; and that they were in many instances a shelter, and a \nprotection to the minority, against the attempts of power.\n  This is Thomas Jefferson writing about the importance of rules when \nhe wrote the Senate rules.\n  Continuing:\n\n       So far the maxim is certainly true, and is founded in good \n     sense, that as it is always in the power of the majority, by \n     their numbers, to stop any improper measures proposed on the \n     part of their opponents, the only weapons by which the \n     minority can defend themselves against similar attempts from \n     those in power, are the forms and rules of proceeding which \n     have been adopted as they were found necessary from time to \n     time, and are become the law of the House; by a strict \n     adherence to which, the weaker party can only be protected \n     from those irregularities and abuses which these forms were \n     intended to check, and which the wantonness of power is but \n     too often apt to suggest to large and successful majorities.\n\n  I would think a majority that claims to protect the rights of \nminorities would be interested in these words of Jefferson and \nespecially in the following words:\n\n       And whether these forms be in all cases the most rational \n     or not, is really not of so great importance. It is much more \n     material that there should be a rule to go by, than what that \n     rule is; that there may be a uniformity of proceeding in \n     business, not subject to the caprice of the Speaker, or \n     captiousness of the members. It is very material that order, \n     decency and regularity be preserved in a dignified public \n     body.\n\n  That was Thomas Jefferson on the importance of Senate rules when he \nwrote them at the beginning of our country. The majority has set a \nprecedent that destroys those rules--that destroys the integrity of the \nrules because a Senate in which a majority can change the rules at any \ntime for any reason is a Senate with no rules. That is why it is not \ntoo much to say that the Democratic majority has created a perpetual \nopportunity for the tyranny of the majority. The majority can do \nanything it wants any time it wants.\n  In this case, what it wanted to do was stack the Federal court that \nhears most of the challenges to its radical regulatory agenda with \njudges who believe in that agenda. Who knows what the next power play \nwill be. First it was ObamaCare, then ObamaCare 2, the change of the \nrules. What we do know is that this majority has set an unprecedented \nprecedent. They have set the precedent to do whatever they want to do \nanytime they want to do it. They have created a Senate without rules.\n  Now let's talk a little bit about what the justification might be for \nsuch a stunning action because there are so many words thrown around \nthat don't represent facts at all that--somehow--I wonder about this. \nFor example, the Democrats complain that their radical action was \nwarranted because the Senate is broken. I agree with that. I will \nexplain in a few moments why I think so. Their reason is that President \nObama's appointees have been unfairly denied seats by failed cloture \nvotes or filibusters. The charge was--and you heard the majority leader \na few minutes ago--things have gotten so bad that this Republican \nmajority has treated President Obama unfairly by denying his nominees \ntheir seats by failed cloture votes or filibusters. The Democrats have \ngotten themselves in a room and convinced each other that this is true, \nbut it is flat out not true.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service--and I have \nresearched this for several months and asked them this question: Has \nthere ever been any Supreme Court nominee, by any President, who has \nbeen denied his or her seat by a filibuster? The answer is no. It is \nzero. Now, there is one possible exception. Abe Fortas was nominated by \nPresident Lyndon Johnson as Chief Justice. The nomination was in \ntrouble on both sides of the aisle, and to help his friend Abe Fortas \nsave face, President Johnson engineered a cloture vote in 1968. I think \nthe vote was 45 to 43. They called that a win to help ``Abe save \nface.'' But certainly President Obama's nominees have not been denied \ntheir seats by a failed cloture vote, and neither have any other \nPresidents.\n  Have there ever been any Cabinet members of President Obama or any \nother President who have been denied their seats by a failed cloture \nvote or by a filibuster? According to the Congressional Research \nService, the answer is no. The number is zero. There have been no \nCabinet members who have been denied their seats in the Obama \nadministration by a failed cloture vote.\n  Have there ever been any Federal district judges denied their seats \nby a failed cloture vote for President Obama or any other President? \nThe answer is zero. Except for perhaps Fortas, there has never been a \nSupreme Court Justice, Cabinet member, or Federal district judge \nnomination in the history of President Obama--and never in the history \nof this country has a President's nomination been denied by a \nfilibuster. Interesting.\n  Then why did we go to this stunning radical move on November 21? \nWell, maybe it was because of sub-Cabinet members. How many of those \nhave been denied their seats by a filibuster, according to the \nCongressional Research Service? Two of President Obama's, three of \nPresident George W. Bush's, and two of President Clinton's. That is a \ntotal of seven in the history of the Senate when a filibuster has said \nto a sub-Cabinet member that we are going to deny them their seat \nbecause of a filibuster or a failed cloture vote. So President Obama \nhas been treated about exactly the same as his last two predecessors.\n  In all of those I just mentioned, among Cabinet members, district \njudges, Supreme Court Justices, and sub-Cabinet members, we only found \ntwo Obama nominees who have been denied their seats by a failed cloture \nvote. Now, that is a fact. That is not a piece of Republican \npropaganda. That comes from the Congressional Research Service.\n  Why is there a fuss about this? Well, maybe it is because of the \nFederal circuit judges. Well, let's talk about that. As for appeals \ncourt judges, Republican filibusters have blocked five. Why did that \nhappen? That happened as a result of what happened in 2003, the year I \ncame to the Senate. Then, Democrats got together and said: We think \nPresident Bush's nominees are too conservative, so for the first time \nin the history of the Senate we are going to block 10 of President \nBush's nominees basically because they are too conservative. I knew \nsome of those judges. I used to clerk on the Fifth Circuit Court of \nAppeals for Judge John Minor Wisdom. I knew the respect he had for \nJudge Pryor. I knew Mr. Pickering, who had really been a pioneer for \ncivil rights in the State of Mississippi in the 1960s and 1970s when it \nwas hard to do that.\n\n  The truth is that the majority of Democrats said: We are going to \nblock 10 of the Bush judges. It has never been done before, but we are \ngoing to do it with a cloture vote.\n  Well, as you can guess, everyone on the Republican side--and the \nmajority then--got very excited. The majority leader, Senator Frist, \nsaid: We are going to change the rules and do something that Senator \nLott--a majority leader at one time--said was the nuclear option.\n  There was great consternation. In 2006 Senator Reid said--and he \nrecounts this very well in his book--``to do so would be the end of the \nSenate.''\n  I made two speeches. I suggested that, well, this is a terrible thing \nto do. A President ought to have an up-or-down vote on his circuit \njudges. So why don't we see if we can't get a few Republicans and a few \nDemocrats and just take it out of the hands of the leaders and agree we \nwill only use the filibuster on circuit judges in extraordinary \ncircumstances, which was the result. I said at the time that I would \nnever vote for a filibuster on a circuit judge. I adjusted my view to \nbe the same as the Senate precedent that came out of the Gang of 14. Of \nthe 10 Bush judges, 5 were not confirmed and 5 were confirmed. In 2003 \nthe Democratic Senators for the first time in history refused to \nconfirm five Presidential nominees for the Federal court\n\n[[Page S8577]]\n\nof appeals by a cloture vote--by a filibuster--and the expected \nhappened. Over time, the Republicans now have blocked five nominations. \nSo Republicans and Democrats are even.\n  When you start something, things have a way of coming back around. \nWhat the Democrats said was fair to do in 2003 and 2004 the Republicans \nnow say is fair to do. If the Democrats think the Republican nominees \nare too conservative, they will block five of them. If we think \nPresident Obama's nominees are too liberal, then we will block five of \nthem. We put in the trash heap the tradition that we will never use the \nfilibuster on Federal courts of appeals judges.\n  The majority leader and others have said: Well, that is not the only \nproblem. The problem is that President Obama has had to wait too long \nto get his judges confirmed.\n  Again, that is not true either. This is another case where the \nDemocrats apparently have gotten themselves in a room and convinced \nthemselves that something that isn't true is true. According to the \nCongressional Research Service, President Obama's second-term Cabinet \nnominees have been confirmed at about the same pace as President Bush's \nCabinet nominees and President Clinton's Cabinet nominees.\n  The other day I heard the majority leader use the example of the \ndistinguished Secretary of Defense and a former Member of this body, \nSenator Hagel, as an example of delay. Well, let me comment on that, if \nI may. Senator Hagel's nomination was reported to the Senate floor. The \nday after it was reported by the Armed Services Committee, the majority \nleader filed cloture and called that a filibuster.\n  Now, many Republican Senators--I watched the Senator from Arizona and \nthe Senator from South Carolina and others say on the floor to the \nmajority leader: That is premature. You are cutting off debate before \nwe have had a chance to consider the Secretary of Defense of this \ncountry. If you will allow us more time--at that time we were going \ninto the Presidents Day recess for a week--we will cut off debate the \nday we come back and then we will have an up-or-down vote.\n  But, no, the majority leader and the White House said: Ram it \nthrough.\n  They insisted on a vote, the vote was turned down, and he called that \na filibuster. I call it cutting off debate--cutting off debate \nprematurely. Why in the world wouldn't you allow a Secretary of Defense \nto be on the floor for more than 1 day before you cut off the debate \nprematurely and call it a filibuster?\n  The majority leader said: Well, we could be attacked.\n  I think he must have forgotten we had a perfectly adequate Secretary \nof Defense in place--Leon Panetta--until the next one was confirmed, \nand he was going to be confirmed because the majority had the majority \nof votes to do that and a Cabinet member has never been denied his or \nher seat because of a cloture vote.\n  I want to keep coming back to that. A Cabinet member has never been \ndenied confirmation because of a failed cloture vote. A Cabinet member \nwill be confirmed after a while--after you have questions. But in that \ncase, they filed cloture after 1 day.\n  Now, in my case, 20 years ago when President Bush nominated me as the \nEducation Secretary, there was a Democratic Senate. I was announced in \nDecember, nominated in January, and it was March before some of the \nDemocratic Senators saw fit to give me a vote, and I was confirmed by \nunanimous consent. During that time I tried to get ready for our \neducation program. It gave me some time to work. When President Reagan \nnominated Ed Meese to be the Attorney General, it took a year before \nthe Senate confirmed Ed Meese, but he was confirmed. There have been \nsome Cabinet members who have withdrawn their names because they have \nbecome embarrassed or for some other reason.\n  If the question is whether a failed cloture vote has ever been used \nto deny a Cabinet member his or her seat, the answer is no. In the case \nof Secretary Hagel, I would think 1 day is not quite long enough to \nfile a motion to cut off debate and claim it is a filibuster.\n  What about judges? Has the Senate been slow on judges? This year the \nSenate has confirmed 36 of the President's second-term nominees to \ncircuit and district courts compared with 14 for President Bush as of \nNovember 21st in his second term in 2005. These things are never exact \nbecause there are vacancies for a variety of reasons. That is a pretty \nbig difference. It is very hard to argue that it is unfair. But the \nmajority leader did argue successfully that the minority was holding up \ndistrict judges in order to negotiate for other points. He did that the \nsecond time a bipartisan group of us sat down to talk about how to \nchange the Senate rules so we could move along better. So what the \nSenate agreed to do earlier this year was to change the rules to make \nit easier to confirm district judges.\n\n  Here is the procedure: Remember, first they have to be on the \ncalendar. How do they get on the calendar? A committee majority puts \nthem on the calendar. What party has the majority in the Judiciary \nCommittee? The Judiciary Committee majority is Democratic. That puts \nthem on the calendar. So Democrats put them on the calendar. Only the \nmajority leader can take them off the calendar, and when he does that, \nhe has no motion to proceed; he just takes them right off just like he \ndid tonight. If he wants to, he can just bring them up and ask \nunanimous consent that they be approved, which they often are.\n  I am told by the Republican leader's office that when the majority \nleader rammed the rules change through on November 21, there were about \n40 or so noncontroversial--so-called--nominees who were about to be \nconfirmed, including many district judges. But tonight the majority \nleader has selected 4 of the 13 district judges who are on the calendar \nand made a big show out of the fact that we are going to take an \nintervening day tomorrow and then we are going to vote on them, I \nguess, beginning on Wednesday. Under the rules change he asked for, the \ndebate on each one of those can only be 2 hours, and it is divided \nevenly, which means the Democrats have an hour and the Republicans have \nan hour. If the Democrats want to speed things up, they can give their \nhour back. On a noncontroversial judge, Republicans normally wouldn't \nsay anything, except a word or two of praise. But let's say the \nRepublicans are upset by the rules changes and we are going to say we \nwill take that whole hour. The Democrats could say 2 or 3 minutes of \npraise for the district judge and we could confirm those four in 4 \nhours. That is half a day's work.\n  The question I asked the majority leader was, What about the other \nnine? What about the other nine district judges who are sitting on this \ncalendar, put there by the Democratic majority of the Judiciary \nCommittee, and only one person in the Senate can bring them up for a \nvote, and he didn't bring them up. Why doesn't he bring them up? He \ncould bring them up today. Tomorrow would be the intervening day and we \ncould vote on Wednesday and vote on them all. He could have brought \nevery single district judge up Thursday before recess, when he turned \nthe Senate into a place that has no rules; Friday would have been the \nintervening day, and we could have been voting all day today, and by \nthe time we went home for supper, every district judge would be \nconfirmed because of the earlier rules change that limited post-cloture \ndebate on district judges to 2 hours. The only reason I can see to go \nthrough all of this is to manufacture a crisis to make the American \npeople think that somehow the minority is abusing its privileges.\n  I read the Executive Calendar on November 21 very carefully. \nRemember, this is the document that is on every Senator's desk. A \nnominee has to be on here in order to be confirmed. If a person is an \nexecutive nominee, the only person who can bring it up is the majority \nleader. It is the same with legislation. So legislative matters require \na motion of consent. There were only 16 on the calendar who had been \nthere 3 weeks and only 8 more who had been there more than 9 weeks, and \n2 of the 8 were being held up by Democratic Senators. That is hardly a \ncrisis.\n  Finally, let me address the claim the majority leader didn't take \nseriously; that is, Republicans have unfairly blocked the President \nfrom filling vacancies on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. \nRemember, I pointed out the Democrats started this by saying that if \nPresident Bush nominates judges that are too conservative,\n\n[[Page S8578]]\n\nwe will block them, so the Republicans now have blocked an equal number \nof President Obama's judges. But that is not the primary reason for \nblocking them. The primary reason is stated in a letter written on July \n27, 2006, to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, a Republican, \nSenator Specter, from all of the Democratic members of the Judiciary \nCommittee. President Bush had nominated someone for this same court, \nthe District of Columbia Federal Circuit Court, and this is what the \nDemocratic Senators said in 2006:\n\n       We believe that Mr. Keisler should under no circumstances \n     be considered--much less confirmed--by this Committee before \n     we first address the very need for that judgeship, receive \n     and review necessary information about the nominee, and deal \n     with the genuine judicial emergencies identified by the \n     Judicial Conference.\n\n  In other words, what the Democrats were saying--and it included a \nnumber of the most distinguished Members of this body--the chairman \nSenator Leahy, Senator Schumer, Senator Feingold, Senator Feinstein, \nSenator Kohl, Senator Kennedy, Senator Durbin, Senator Biden--they were \nsaying that this court, the DC court, is an important court, but it \ndoesn't need any more judges. Before we add any more judges to a court \nthat is underworked, we ought to consider transferring those judgeships \nto courts that are overworked.\n  That argument had been made since at least 2001 by Senator Grassley \nfrom Iowa, and finally, with some bipartisan cooperation in 2007, he \nachieved some success. With President Bush's agreement, the Republican \nPresident, he agreed with the Democratic Senators that the DC Circuit \nshould under no circumstances--those are their words in their letter--\nhave more judges. They reduced by one the number of judges, and they \ntransferred a judge to the Ninth Circuit, which was overworked.\n  So what Republicans have said about the three judges whom the \nPresident has nominated to the DC Circuit is, before we consider any of \nthem, consider Senator Grassley's bill. Do in 2013 what you said we \nshould do in 2006 and 2007 and which we did in a bipartisan way.\n  So how can this be dismissed when Republicans are asking to do in \n2013 exactly what the Democrats successfully insisted on in 2006, which \nis to transfer judges from the courts where they are not needed to the \ncourts where they are needed. In fact, the DC Circuit has a lower \ncaseload by comparison today than it did in 2007 when, by a bipartisan \nagreement, it was considered underworked. The Democrats didn't think it \nwas unfair then to insist that we not appoint more judges to a court \nthat was underworked. It must be they are trying to manufacture a \ncrisis now.\n  So if there is no good reason to change the rules in such a dramatic \nway as the majority did on November 21, why would the majority leader \ninsist on cramming through in a power play a rules change that in 2006 \nhe said would be the end of the Senate? Because the vote was not about \nthe filibuster. All of that is pretext. The vote was about allowing \nthe majority to do whatever it wants to do any time it wants to do it.\n\n  One of the things the American people detest about ObamaCare, as I \nsaid earlier, is that it was crammed through in the middle of the night \nin a partisan power play and we can see the results. Unlike the civil \nrights bill which had broad bipartisan support--I can remember Senator \nDirksen and President Johnson working together on it when it required \n67 votes in the Senate, and because it achieved that consensus, Senator \nRussell, the great opponent of the bill, went home to Georgia and said: \nIt is the law of the land and we should now support it.\n  When we cram a big social change--or any big change--through the \nCongress, we are going to get the kind of result we get with ObamaCare \ntoday: millions of people losing their policies, tens of millions will \nnext year, great concern, Web site not working. That is what we get \nwhen we cram things through in a partisan way, and the Democrats have \ndone it again.\n  So if the filibuster was not the problem, then why is the Senate not \nfunctioning better? Why are we so low in public opinion polls? Frankly, \nit is because of the Senate leadership. I have had the privilege over \nthe years of watching the Senate. I came here for the first time in \n1967 as an aide to Senator Howard Baker, the future majority leader of \nthe Senate. I watched Senator Mansfield and Senator Dirksen. I watched \nSenator Byrd and Senator Baker. I watched Senator Daschle, Senator \nLott, Senator Frist. I wasn't in the Senate all of that time--I have \nonly been here since 2003--but I have seen it over that time up close. \nAll of them could operate this body very well under the rules we had \nuntil Thursday of 2 weeks ago, until November 21.\n  I was at the Rules Committee meeting when Senator Byrd, former \nmajority leader and acknowledged as the great historian of the Senate, \ncame. He could barely speak, but he had one last message for the Senate \nand it was: Don't change the filibuster. He called it the necessary \nfence against the excesses of the executive and the popular will. That \nwas what Senator Byrd said. He also said that under the rules we had \nuntil November 21, a majority leader could operate the Senate if he \nwanted to.\n  The current majority leader seems to be unable to do that, and we saw \nan example of it here tonight. He brings up 4 district judges, while \nthere are 13 on the calendar. He could have brought them up on November \n21 and we could have been voting on all of them today. He could bring \nthem all up today and we could vote on all of them Wednesday, but he is \nparceling them out as if there were a crisis somewhere. Why is he doing \nthat? I don't see why he is doing that. It is not the way to make the \nSenate function. It is not what Senator Byrd would do. It is not what \nSenator Baker would do. I saw them come in and open the Senate to \namendments, put a bill on the floor, ask for amendments. Here came 300 \namendments. Ask for unanimous consent to cut off amendments. They got \nunanimous consent because nobody could think of any other amendments, \nand then Senator Byrd would say--and Senator Baker did as well--all \nright, let's start voting, and vote, vote, vote, vote. Then we could \nget to about Wednesday or Thursday and Senators would think, well, \nmaybe my amendment is not so important, and by Friday, when it was \nclear the majority leader was going to finish the bill that week, they \nwould drop the amendments, and we got it done.\n  So the Senate wasn't a perfect place--things were still bumpy. There \nwas Senator Metzenbaum sitting in the front row objecting. There was \nSenator Williams before him, Senator Allen before him, exercising their \nrights, but the majority leaders were able to work with that. The \nSenate worked on Mondays and Fridays, it worked at night, and the \nthreat of that usually caused people who were trying to not show a \nproper amount of restraint and use of their privileges to back down.\n  Instead, what the current majority leader does--and we heard him \ntonight--is complain about obstructionism when there isn't any, \ncertainly not on nominations. I am not going to say Senators on both \nsides of the aisle haven't abused their privileges and slowed down the \nSenate. But he complains about obstructionism when, in fact, he has \nbecome the obstructionist in chief by making it more difficult for \nthose of us who are elected from our States to represent the people who \nhave a right to be heard. Seventy-seven times this majority leader has \ncut off amendments in a body whose whole purpose is to amend, debate, \nand vote. I call it a gag rule, with the majority cutting off the right \nof American voices to be heard on the Senate floor. There have been 114 \ntimes when he has filed a motion to cut off debate on the same day he \nhas introduced a bill, and he calls that a filibuster. I call it a gag \nrule. He has bypassed Senate committees in an unprecedented way: 76 \ntimes in the last 7 years.\n  He set himself up as the king of the Senate: May I offer an amendment \non Iran, a Senator might ask. No. May I offer an amendment on Egypt? \nNo. How about an amendment on ObamaCare? No. What about a bill on the \nNational Labor Relations Board? No. Can we work on appropriations \nbills? No. Only one person is deciding what happens here when, in fact, \nthe history of the Senate has been a place of virtually unlimited \ndebate on virtually any amendment. That has been the history of the \nSenate. It is different than the House of Representatives. It has been \ndifferent than any other body in the\n\n[[Page S8579]]\n\nworld. It operates by unanimous consent, and it requires restraint \nwhich hasn't always been exercised, but majority leaders who have been \neffective have found their way to deal with that.\n  I have spent the last 3 years doing my best to help make this place \nfunction. I cannot say where this rules change on November 21 will \nlead, but it is heading in a dangerous direction--a direction that is \ndangerous for the Senate and dangerous for our country.\n\n  This is a country that prizes the rule of law. Other countries around \nthe world that do not have it wish they did, they wish they had a \ncountry with the rule of law. So in a country that prizes the rule of \nlaw, we now have a Senate without any rules because the Senate majority \nhas decided, for the first time, that a majority can change the rules \nat any time, for any reason it wants, which makes this a body without \nrules.\n  In a country that yearns for solutions on Iran, on health care, on \nour debt crisis, we have a king of the Senate saying: No amendments, no \ndebate. I will make all the decisions.\n  I know of only one cure for this dangerous trend, and that is one \nword, an election--the election of six new Republican Senators so power \nplays such as ObamaCare and the November 21 rules change will be ended \nand the Senate will again be alive with bills, amendments, and debates, \nreflecting the will of the American people on the important issues of \nour time.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter from \nthe year 2006 from the Democratic Senators on the Judiciary Committee \nsaying there should be no new judges added to the DC Court of Appeals \nbecause it is underworked.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 27, 2006.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Specter: We write to request that you \n     postpone next week's proposed confirmation hearing for Peter \n     Keisler, only recently nominated to the DC Circuit. Court of \n     Appeals. For the reasons set forth below, we believe that Mr. \n     Keisler should under no circumstances be considered--much \n     less confirmed--by this Committee before we first address the \n     very need for that judgeship, receive and review necessary \n     information about the nominee, and--deal with the genuine \n     judicial emergencies identified by the Judicial Conference.\n       First, the Committee should, before turning to the \n     nomination itself, hold a hearing on the necessity of filling \n     the 11th seat on the DC Circuit, to which Mr. Keisler has \n     been nominated. There has long been concern--much of it \n     expressed by Republican Members--that the DC Circuit's \n     workload does not warrant more than 10 active judges. As you \n     may recall, in years past, a number of Senators, including \n     several who still sit on this Committee, have vehemently \n     opposed the filling of the 11th and 12th seats on that court:\n       Senator Sessions: ``[The eleventh] judgeship, more than any \n     other judgeship in America, is not needed.'' (1997)\n       Senator Grassley: ``I can confidently conclude that the DC \n     Circuit does not need 12 judges or even 11 judges.'' (1997)\n       Senator Kyl: ``If . . . another vacancy occurs, thereby \n     opening up the 11th seat again, I plan to vote against \n     filling the seat--and, of course, the 12th seat--unless there \n     is a significant increase in the caseload or some other \n     extraordinary circumstance.'' (1997)\n       More recently, at a hearing on the DC Circuit, Senator \n     Sessions, citing the Chief Judge of the DC Circuit, \n     reaffirmed his view that there was no need to fill the 11th \n     seat: ``I thought ten was too many. . . I will oppose going \n     above ten unless the caseload is up.'' (2002)\n       In addition, these and other Senators expressed great \n     reluctance to spend the estimated $1 million per year in \n     taxpayer funds to finance a judgeship that could not be \n     justified based on the workload. Indeed, Senator Sessions \n     even suggested that filling the 11th seat would be ``an \n     unjust burden on the taxpayers of America.''\n       Since these emphatic objections were raised in 1997, by \n     every relevant benchmark, the caseload for that circuit has \n     only dropped further. According to the Administrative Office \n     of the United States Courts, the Circuit's caseload, as \n     measured by written decisions per active judge, has declined \n     17 percent since 1997; as measured by number of appeals \n     resolved on the merits per active judge, it declined by 21 \n     percent; and as measured by total number of appeals filed, it \n     declined by 10 percent. Accordingly, before we rush to \n     consider Mr. Keisler's nomination, we should look closely--as \n     we did in 2002--at whether there is even a need for this seat \n     to be filled and at what expense to the taxpayer.\n       Second, given how quickly the Keisler hearing was scheduled \n     (he was nominated only 28 days ago), the American Bar \n     Association has not yet even completed its evaluation of this \n     nominee. We should not be scheduling hearings for nominees \n     before the Committee has received. their ABA ratings. \n     Moreover, in connection with the most recent judicial \n     nominees who, like Mr. Keisler, served in past \n     administrations, Senators appropriately sought and received \n     publicly available documents relevant to their government \n     service. Everyone, we believe, benefited from the review of \n     that material, which assisted Senators in fulfilling their \n     responsibilities of advice and consent. Similarly, the \n     Committee should have the benefit of publicly available \n     information relevant to Mr. Keisler's tenure in the Reagan \n     Administration, some of which may take some time. to procure \n     from, among other places, the Reagan Library. As Senator \n     Frist said in an interview on Tuesday, ``[T]he DC Circuit . . \n     . after the Supreme Court is the next court in terms of \n     hierarchy, in terms of responsibility, interpretation, and in \n     terms of prioritization.'' We should therefore perform our \n     due diligence before awarding a lifetime appointment to this \n     uniquely important court.\n       Finally, given the questionable need to fill the 11th seat, \n     we believe that Mr. Keisler should not jump ahead of those \n     who have been nominated for vacant seats identified as \n     judicial emergencies by the non-partisan Judicial Conference. \n     Indeed, every other Circuit Court nominee awaiting a hearing \n     in the Committee, save one, has been selected for a vacancy \n     that has been deemed a ``judicial emergency.'' We should turn \n     to those nominees first; emergency vacancies should clearly \n     take priority over a possibly superfluous one.\n       Given the singular importance of the DC Circuit, we should \n     not proceed hastily and without full information. Only after \n     we reassess the need to fill this seat, perform reasonable \n     due diligence on the nominee, and tend to actual judicial \n     emergencies, should we hold a hearing on Mr. Keisler's \n     nomination.\n       We thank you for your consideration of this unanimous \n     request of Democratic Senators.\n           Sincerely,\n     Patrick Leahy.\n     Russell D. Feingold.\n     Dianne Feinstein.\n     Herb Kohl.\n     Charles Schumer.\n     Edward M. Kennedy.\n     Richard Durbin.\n     Joseph R. Biden, Jr.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.
