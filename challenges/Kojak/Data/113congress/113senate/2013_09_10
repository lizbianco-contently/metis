Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 166, S.J. \nRes. 21.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to S.J. Res. 21 to authorize the limited \n     and specified use of the United States Armed Forces against \n     Syria.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, following my and Senator McConnell's \nremarks, there will be a period of morning business until 11 a.m. this \nmorning. At 11 a.m. we will resume consideration of the motion to \nproceed to the Syria resolution. The time until noon will be divided \nand controlled between the two leaders or their designees. The Senate \nwill recess from noon until 2:15 p.m. to allow for our caucus meetings.\n  The leader and I have talked this morning--and prior to this \nmorning--with regard to the energy efficiency bill. We automatically go \nto that bill at 11 a.m. We are trying to work out a way we can go to \nthat bill. Senators Shaheen and Portman have worked for more than a \nyear to come up with a bill. We have not done an energy bill in a long \ntime, so there is a desire on both sides to move forward on this.\n  Senator Shaheen and Senator Portman have bipartisan amendments they \nwant to offer to their bill, and I have expressed to the Republican \nleader that we need to move to that when we finish the Syria issue. I \nwould like permission to move to that bill at the appropriate time. \nOnce we get on the bill and we get the CR from the House, for example, \nI told the Republican leader--and everyone who wants to hear--that we \ndon't have to finish the energy efficiency bill all at one time. We \nwant to have an amendment process, and we will do that. I don't want to \nfile cloture on the motion to proceed again, so we have instructed our \nstaffs to try to come up with something before 11 a.m. that we can \nagree on.\n  I repeat. There will be amendments offered, and we will have adequate \ntime to work on this. We may not be able to do it all at one time, but \nwe will do it and finish this legislation.\n\n\n                                 Syria\n\n  Mr. President, we are engaged in a very important debate. The Syria \ndebate is one that cannot be taken lightly, and I don't believe anyone \nhas taken it lightly. The discussion and bipartisan resolution under \nconsideration is simply too important to be rushed through the Senate \nor given short shrift. So it is right and proper that the President be \ngiven an opportunity to meet with Senators from both parties, as he \nwill today. He will meet with us at 12:30 p.m. When he finishes with \nus, it is my understanding he will report to Senator McConnell's \nconference.\n  In addition to that, he is going to address the Nation tonight. He is \ngoing to speak directly to the American people about the potential for \nlimited military action to Syria. He will do that at 9 p.m. tonight.\n  As I said last night, it is appropriate to allow other conversations \nto go on. We now have--as a result of some work done by other \ncountries--France, Russia, and we understand Syria is involved in this \nas well. This is aimed at avoiding military action. We will have to see \nif this works out.\n  It is very important to understand that the only reason Russia is \nseeking an alternative to military action is that President Obama has \nmade it plain and clear that the United States will act, if we must. \nOur credible threat of force has made these diplomatic discussions with \nSyria possible, and the United States should not withdraw from the \ndirection we are taking as a country.\n  If there is a realistic chance--and I certainly hope there is--to \nsecure Syria's chemical weapons without further atrocities of the Asad \nregime, we should not turn our backs on that chance. But for such a \nsolution to be plausible, the Asad regime must act quickly and prove \nthat their offer is real and not merely a ploy to delay military action \nor action by the body of the Senate.\n  Any agreement must also assure that chemical weapons in the hands of \nSyria can be secured and done in an open process, even in the midst of \nthis ongoing war we have in Syria. Any agreement must ensure that Syria \nis unable to transfer its dangerous chemical\n\n[[Page S6302]]\n\nweapons to the hands of terrorists in that area. Such an attempt would \nbe met with a rapid and robust response from the United States.\n  I am pleased the administration is considering this offer. I am \npleased other countries are involved in addition to Russia. It is my \nunderstanding that France is heavily involved, as of a few hours ago, \nand I think that is the right direction at this time. We will move \nforward but under the general criteria I have suggested and outlined.\n  The Senate should give these international discussions time to play \nout but not unlimited time. That is why, although there is support to \nmove forward and debate this bipartisan resolution reported by Senators \nMenendez and Corker--they did a terrific job for the committee last \nweek--I didn't rush to file cloture, as I indicated last night, on the \nmotion to proceed. We don't need to prove how quickly we can do this \nbut how well we can do this.\n  The Syrian regime should fully understand that the United States is \nwatching very closely. The Asad regime should be warned our country \nwill not tolerate this breach of human decency and long-held \ninternational consensus against the use of chemical weapons.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Agreement--S. 1392\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order with \nrespect to S. 1392, which is the energy efficiency legislation, be \nmodified so that the motion to proceed be agreed to at a time to be \ndetermined by me with the concurrence of the Republican leader--not \nconsultation with him but concurrence with him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                                 Syria\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, first, I would like to welcome the \nPresident to the Capitol today. Members on both sides of the aisle are \neager to hear from him and to share their own thoughts. We look forward \nto a spirited and constructive exchange.\n  It is often said that of all the questions we face as lawmakers, none \nis more serious or indeed more difficult than the question of whether \nto commit ourselves to military action. That is why it is so important \nfor us to have this debate, to lay out the arguments for and against \nmilitary action in Syria, to let the public know where we stand on this \nissue and why.\n  If debates such as this are always challenging, in some ways this one \nhas been even more difficult, not because of some political calculus--\nthough cynics will always suspect that--no, this debate has been made \nmore difficult because even those of us who truly want to support the \nCommander in Chief have struggled to understand the purpose of the \nmission.\n  Over the past several days I have spoken with a lot of people--a lot \nof Kentuckians--and most of them are not exactly clear about the \nmission or shy about saying so. What I have told them is that I \nunderstand their concerns, and I share them. I also appreciate the war \nweariness out there, but then I tell them there are other potential \nconcerns we cannot ignore either. Chief among them is the fact that the \ncredibility of the Commander in Chief matters, and related to that is \nthe fact that we cannot afford, as a country, to withdraw from the \nworld stage. So no one should be faulted for being skeptical about this \nproposal, regardless of what party they are in, or for being \ndumbfounded--literally dumbfounded--at the ham-handed manner in which \nthe White House announced it.\n  There is absolutely no reason to signal to the enemy when, how, and \nfor how long we plan to strike them--none. As I have said before, we \ndon't send out a save-the-date card to the enemy. Yet there are other \nimportant considerations to keep in mind as well that go beyond the \nwisdom or the marketing of the proposal.\n  I have spent a lot of time weighing all of these things. I thought a \nlot about America's obligations and the irreplaceable role I have \nalways believed, and still believe, America plays in the world. I have \nalso thought a lot about the context, about this President's vision and \nhis record and what it says about whether we should be confident in his \nability to bring about a favorable outcome in Syria because how we got \nto this point says a lot about where we may be headed. That is why, \nbefore announcing my vote, I think it is important to look back at some \nof the President's other decisions on matters of foreign policy and \nnational security and then turn back to what he is proposing now in \nSyria because, in the end, these things simply cannot be separated.\n  It is not exactly a State secret that I am no fan of this President's \nforeign policy. On the deepest level I think it comes down to a \nfundamentally different view of America's role in the world. Unlike the \nPresident, I have always been a firm and unapologetic believer in the \nidea that America isn't just another Nation among many; that we are, \nindeed, exceptional. As I have said, I believe we have a duty as a \nsuperpower, without imperialistic aims, to help maintain an \ninternational order and balance of power that we and other allies have \nworked very hard to achieve over the years.\n  The President, on the other hand, has always been a very reluctant \nCommander in Chief. We saw that in the rhetoric of his famous Cairo \nspeech and in speeches he gave in other foreign capitals in the early \ndays of his administration. The tone, and the policies that followed, \nwere meant to project a humbler, more withdrawn America. Frankly, I am \nhard pressed to see any good that came from any of that.\n  Any list would have to start with the arbitrary deadlines for \nmilitary withdrawal and the triumphant declaration that Guantanamo \nwould be closed within a year, without any plan of what to do with its \ndetainees. There were the executive orders that ended the CIA's \ndetention and interrogation programs.\n  We all saw the so-called ``reset'' with Russia and how the \nPresident's stated commitment to a world without nuclear weapons led \nhim to hastily sign an arms treaty with Russia that did nothing to \nsubstantially reduce its nuclear stockpile or its tactical nuclear \nweapons. We saw the President announce a strategic pivot to the Asia-\nPacific region, without any real plan to fund it, and an effort to end \nthe capture, interrogation, and detention of terrorists, as well as the \nreturn of the old idea that terrorism should be treated as a law \nenforcement matter. After a decade-long counterinsurgency in \nAfghanistan, we have seen the President's failure to invest in the kind \nof strategic modernization that is needed to make this pivot to Asia \nmeaningful. Specifically, his failure to make the kind of investments \nthat are needed to maintain our dominance in the Asia-Pacific theater \nin the kind of naval, air, and Marine Corps forces that we will need in \nthe years ahead could have tragic consequences down the road.\n  His domestic agenda has also obviously had serious implications for \nour global standing. While borrowing trillions and wasting taxpayer \ndollars here at home, the President has imposed a policy of austerity \nat the Pentagon that threatens to undermine our stabilizing presence \naround the globe. Of course, we have seen how eager the President is to \ndeclare an end to the war on terror. Unfortunately, the world hasn't \ncooperated. It hasn't cooperated with the President's vision or his \nhopes. Far from responding favorably to this gentler approach, it has \nbecome arguably more dangerous. We have learned the hard way that being \nnice to our enemies doesn't make them like us or clear a path to peace.\n  I understand the President ran for office on an antiwar platform, \nthat his rise to political power was marked by his determination to get \nus out of Afghanistan and Iraq, and to declare an end to the war on \nterror. I know he would rather focus on his domestic agenda. But the \nongoing threat from Al Qaeda and its affiliates and the turmoil \nunleashed by uprisings in north Africa and the broader Middle East, not \nto mention the rise of Chinese military power, make it clear to me, at \nleast, that this is not the time for America to shrink from the world \nstage.\n  The world is a dangerous place. In the wake of the Arab spring, large \nparts of the Sinai, of Libya, of Syria, are now basically ungoverned. \nWe have seen prison breaks in Iraq, Pakistan, Libya, and the release of \nhundreds of prisoners in Egypt. Terrorists have also escaped from \nprisons in Yemen, a\n\n[[Page S6303]]\n\ncountry that is no more ready to detain the terrorists at Guantanamo \nnow than they were back in 2009. And the flow of foreign fighters into \nSyria suggests that the civil war there will last for years, regardless \nof whether Asad is still in power.\n  Yes, the President deserves praise for weakening Al Qaeda's senior \nleadership. But the threat we face from Al Qaeda affiliates is very \nreal. These terrorists are adaptable. They are versatile, lethal, \nresilient, and they aren't going away. Pockets of these terrorists \nextend from north Africa to the Persian Gulf and it is time he faced up \nto it.\n  It is time to face up to something else as well: International order \nis not maintained by some global police force which only exists in a \nliberal fantasy. International order is maintained--its backbone is \nAmerican military might, which brings me back to Syria.\n  For 2 years now Syria has been mired in a ferocious civil war with \nmore than 100,000 killed with conventional arms. That is according to \nU.N. estimates. This tragic situation has prompted many to look to the \nUnited States for help. So 1 year ago President Obama made a \ndeclaration: If Asad used or started moving chemical weapons, he would \ndo something about it.\n  Well, as we all know, on August 21 of this year, that redline was \ncrossed. The President's delayed response was to call for a show of \nforce for targeted, limited strikes against the regime. We have been \ntold the purpose of these strikes is to deter and degrade Asad's \nregime's ability to use chemical weapons. So let's take a closer look \nat these aims.\n  First, no one disputes that the atrocities committed in Syria in \nrecent weeks are unspeakable. No one disputes that those responsible \nfor these crimes against the innocent should be held to account. We \nwere absolutely right, of course, to condemn these crimes. But let's be \nvery clear about something: These attacks, monstrous as they are, were \nnot a direct attack against the United States or one of its treaty \nallies. And just so there is no confusion, let me assure everyone that \nif a weapon of mass destruction were used against the United States or \none of our allies, Congress would react immediately with an \nauthorization for the use of force in support of an overwhelming \nresponse. I would introduce the resolution myself. So no leader in \nNorth Korea or Iran or any other enemy of the United States should take \nany solace if the United States were not to respond to these attacks \nwith an action against Syria. We will never--never--tolerate the use of \nchemical weapons against the United States or any of its treaty allies.\n  Second, in the course of administration hearings and briefings over \nthe past several days, Secretary of State Kerry has revealed that Asad \nhas used chemical weapons repeatedly--repeatedly--over the last year. \nSo there is a further question here about why the administration didn't \nrespond on those occasions.\n  Third, Asad, as I have indicated, has killed tens of thousands of \npeople with conventional weapons. Is there any reason to believe he \nwon't continue if the President's strikes are as limited as we are told \nthey would be?\n  Fourth, what if, in degrading Asad's control of those weapons, we \nmake it easier for other extremist elements such as those associated \nwith the al-Nusra Front and Al Qaeda to actually get hold of \nthem themselves or what if, by weakening the Syrian military, we end up \ntilting the military balance toward a fractured opposition that is in \nno position to govern or control anything right now?\n\n  I think the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Dempsey, \nput this particular best when he recently suggested in a letter to \nCongress that the issue here isn't about choosing between two sides in \nSyria, it is about choosing one among many sides; and that, in his \nestimation, even if we were to choose sides, the side we chose wouldn't \nbe in a position to promote their own interests or ours. That is the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs.\n  Then there is the question of how Asad himself will react to U.S. \naction in Syria. If Asad views an air campaign as preparation for \nregime change, then he may lose all constraint in the use of his \narsenal, chemical or otherwise, and lose any incentive whatsoever to \nmove to the negotiating table. It is very clear that the unintended \nconsequences of this strike could very well be a new cycle of \nescalation, which then drags us into a larger war that we are all \nseeking to avoid. Some have even suggested that the humanitarian crisis \nsurrounding the Syrian civil war could actually be made worse as a \nresult of even targeted U.S. strikes.\n  In the end, then, the President's proposal seems fundamentally flawed \nsince, if it is too narrow, it may not deter Asad's further use of \nchemical weapons. But if it is too broad, it risks jeopardizing the \nsecurity of these same stockpiles, potentially putting them into the \nhands of extremists.\n  That is why I think we are compelled in this case to apply a more \ntraditional standard on whether to proceed with a use of force, one \nthat asks a simple question: Does Asad's use of chemical weapons pose a \nthreat to the vital national security interests of the United States? \nAnd the answer to that question is fairly obvious; even the President \nhimself says it doesn't.\n  One could argue, as I have suggested, that there is an important \nnational security concern at play, that we have a very strong interest \nin preserving the credibility of our Commander in Chief, regardless of \nthe party in power, and in giving him the political support that \nreinforces that credibility. This is an issue I take very seriously. It \nis the main reason I have wanted to take my time in making a final \ndecision. But, ultimately, I have concluded that being credible on \nSyria requires presenting a credible response and having a credible \nstrategy. For all of the reasons I have indicated, this proposal \ndoesn't pass muster.\n  Indeed, if, through this limited strike, the President's credibility \nis not restored because Asad uses chemical weapons again, what then? \nAnd new targets aimed at toppling the regime which end up jeopardizing \ncontrol of these same chemical weapons stashes--allowing them to fall \ninto the hands of Al Qaeda and others intent on using them against the \nUnited States or our allies. Where would the cycle of escalation end?\n  Last night we learned about a Russian diplomatic gambit to forestall \nU.S. military action through a proposal to secure and eventually \ndestroy the Syrian chemical weapons stockpile. This morning there are \ninitial reports that suggest Syria is supportive of them. Let me remind \neveryone that even if this is agreed to, it is a still a long way off \nto reaching an agreement at the United Nations, to Syria gaining entry \nto the chemical weapons convention, and to eventually securing and \ndestroying the stockpile. As we have seen in my own State of Kentucky \nwhere we have been working for 30 years to finally destroy a stockpile \nof chemical weapons, destroying chemical weapons is extremely \nchallenging and requires a great deal of attention to detail and \nsafety. Nonetheless, this proposal is obviously worth exploring.\n  But, more broadly--and this is my larger point--this one punitive \nstrike we are debating could not make up for the President's \nperformance over the last 5 years. The only way--the only way--for him \nto achieve the credibility he seeks is by embracing the kind of \nserious, integrated, national security plan that matches strategy to \nresources, capabilities to commitments, and which shows our allies \naround the world that the United States is fully engaged and ready to \nact at a moment's notice in all the major areas of concern around the \nglobe, whether it is the Mediterranean, the Persian Gulf, or in the \nSouth China Sea, and, just as importantly, that he is willing to invest \nin that strategy for the long term.\n  In Syria, a limited strike would not resolve the civil war there, nor \nwill it remove Asad from power. There appears to be no broader strategy \nto train, advise, and assist a vetted opposition group on a meaningful \nscale, as we did during the Cold War. What is needed in Syria is what \nis needed almost everywhere else in the world from America right now: a \nclear strategy and a President determined to carry it out.\n  When it comes to Syria, our partners in the Middle East--countries \nsuch as Turkey, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Israel--all of them face real \nconsequences from instability, refugee\n\n[[Page S6304]]\n\nflows, and the growth of terrorist networks. Responding to this crisis \nrequires a regional strategy and leadership. What we have gotten \ninstead is an administration that seems more interested in telling us \nwhat the mission is not--more interested in telling us what the mission \nis not--rather than what it is. We have gotten the same timid, \nreluctant leadership that I have seen from the President for nearly 5 \nyears.\n\n  As I have said, this decision was not easy. When the President of the \nUnited States asks you to take a question like this seriously, you do \nso. Because just as our credibility in Syria is tied up with our \ncredibility in places such as Iran and North Korea, so too is the \ncredibility of the Commander in Chief tied up, to a large extent, with \nAmerica's credibility in general. There is no doubt about that. So let \nme repeat: I will stand shoulder to shoulder with this President or any \nother in any case where our vital national security interests are \nthreatened, our treaty allies are attacked, or we face an imminent \nthreat.\n  As for Israel, very few people, if anyone, expect that Syria would \ntest its readiness to respond on its own, which just goes to show you \nthe importance of credibility on the world stage. As Prime Minister \nNetanyahu put it last week, the enemies of Israel have very good reason \nnot to test its might. But the Prime Minister should know nonetheless \nthat America stands with him.\n  I have never been an isolationist, and a vote against this resolution \nshould not be confused by anyone as a turn in that direction. But just \nas the most committed isolationist could be convinced of the need for \nintervention under the right circumstances when confronted with a \nthreat, so too do the internationalists among us believe that all \ninterventions are not created equal. And this proposal just does not \nstand up.\n  So I will be voting against this resolution. A vital national \nsecurity risk is clearly not at play, there are too many unanswered \nquestions about our long-term strategy in Syria, including the fact \nthat this proposal is utterly detached from a wider strategy to end the \ncivil war there, and on the specific question of deterring the use of \nchemical weapons, the President's proposal appears to be based actually \non a contradiction: either we will strike targets that threaten the \nstability of the regime--something the President says he does not \nintend to do--or we will execute a strike so narrow as to be a mere \ndemonstration.\n  It is not enough, as General Dempsey has noted, to simply alter the \nbalance of military power without carefully considering what is needed \nto preserve a functioning state after the fact. We cannot ignore the \nunintended consequences of our actions.\n  But we also cannot ignore our broader obligations in the world. I \nfirmly believe the international system that was constructed on the \nashes of World War II rests upon the stability provided by the American \nmilitary, and by our commitments to our allies. It is a necessary role \nthat only we can continue to fulfill in the decades to come. And \nespecially in times like this, the United States cannot afford to \nwithdraw from the world stage. My record reflects that belief and that \ncommitment regardless of which party has controlled the White House. We \neither choose to be dominant in the world or we resign ourselves and \nour allies to the mercy of our enemies. We either defend our freedoms \nand our civilization or it crumbles.\n  So as we shift our military focus to the Asia Pacific, we cannot \nignore our commitments to the Middle East, to stability in the Persian \nGulf, to an enduring presence in Afghanistan, to hunting down the \nterrorists who would threaten the United States and its people. And \nwhen the Commander in Chief sets his mind to action, the world should \nthink he believes in it. When the Commander in Chief sets his mind to \nan action, the world should think he believes in it. Frankly, the \nPresident did not exactly inspire confidence when he distanced himself \nfrom his own redlines in Stockholm last week.\n  It is long past time the President drops the pose of the reluctant \nwarrior and lead. You cannot build an effective foreign policy on the \nvilification of your predecessor alone. At some point, you have to take \nresponsibility for your own actions and see the world the way it is, \nnot the way you would like it to be.\n  If you wish to engage countries that have been hostile, so be it. But \nbe a realist, know the limits of rhetoric, and prepare for the worst.\n  For too long this President has put his faith in the power of his own \nrhetoric to change the minds of America's enemies. For too long he has \nbeen more interested in showing the world that America is somehow \ndifferent now than it has been in the past; it is humbler; it is not \ninterested in meddling in the affairs of others or in shaping events.\n  But in his eagerness to turn the page, he has blinded himself to \nworrisome trends and developments from Tunisia to Damascus to Tehran \nand in countless places in between.\n  A year ago this month four Americans were senselessly murdered on \nsovereign U.S. territory in Benghazi. Last month the President ordered \nthe closing of more than two dozen diplomatic posts stretching from \nwest Africa to the Bay of Bengal. As I have indicated, and as the \ndecision to close these embassies clearly shows, the terrorist threat \ncontinues to be real. Expressions of anti-Americanism are rampant \nthroughout Africa and the Middle East, even more so perhaps than when \nthe President first took office.\n  So the President's new approach has clearly come with a cost. And for \nthe sake of our own security and that of our allies, it is time he \nrecognized it. Because if America does not meet its international \ncommitments, who will? That is one question that those on the left who \nare comfortable with a weakened America cannot answer, because the \nanswer is too frightening. No one will. That is the answer.\n  If this episode has shown us anything, it is that the time has come \nfor the President to finally acknowledge that there is no substitute \nfor American might. It is time for America to lead again, this time \nfrom the front. But we need strategic vision, in the Middle East and in \nmany other places around the world, to do it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation Of Leader Time\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I listened carefully to the statement made \nby the Republican Senate leader. He is a member of the loyal opposition \nand it is no surprise that he is critical of the policies of President \nBarack Obama. That is the nature of the debate, the American debate, \nwhich takes place on the floor of this Chamber on a regular basis. But \nin fairness to this President, there are some things that were not \nmentioned.\n  This President, under his leadership, has brought the war in Iraq to \na close. This President is bringing the war in Afghanistan to a close. \nThis President, with the best military minds and the best military \ntalent in the world, has made Osama bin Laden a piece of history. He \nwas captured and killed. The man who, sadly, led an attack on the \nUnited States that cost almost 3,000 innocent lives has been dispatched \nbecause of the leadership of this President and the wonderful abilities \nand talents and resources of the United States military.\n  So to stand here and criticize this President as some reluctant \nwarrior is unfair. Yes, I would say in some instances I want a \nPresident to be a reluctant warrior, to think twice before America is \nengaged in a war, to think twice before this country commits its troops \nto a foreign theater. Certainly, as of this moment, having lost more \nthan 5,000 brave Americans in Iraq and Afghanistan, we know the \nterrible price that is paid by the men and women who so bravely \nrepresent this country. And I would like every President to think twice \nbefore committing\n\n[[Page S6305]]\n\nthose troops to battle. Reluctant? Yes. But wise? Yes, I want a wise \nwarrior too.\n  I listened to the Senator from Kentucky criticize the President \nbecause he is, quote, telegraphing his punches when it comes to what is \ngoing to happen in Syria. Well, you cannot have it both ways. This \nPresident could make a unilateral decision and attack without even \nconsulting Congress and thereby maintain the element of surprise or he \ncould do as this President has done and follow what he considers to be \nour constitutional requirement of a national debate before we engage in \nmilitary action.\n  So I would say to the Senator from Kentucky, do not criticize the \nPresident for letting us know what he might do when he turns this over \nto Congress to debate. It is something most of us in Congress should \nwelcome.\n  I also take exception to this notion that we have somehow abandoned \nour commitment to the world--this notion that what we hope to do in the \nPacific is unreachable, or the closing of embassies because of danger \nis problematic or that there is austerity in the Department of Defense.\n  It is hard to reconcile those statements from the Republican side of \nthe aisle with the fact that repeatedly we have asked for a conference \ncommittee on the budget to work out our budget differences when it \ncomes to funding the Department of Defense and our Nation's national \ndefense and time and again the Republicans have objected--objected to \neven sitting down and trying to work out differences so we can restore \nsome of the funds cut through sequestration.\n  You cannot have it both ways. Do not criticize the President for not \nspending enough money when it comes to our Nation's defense and then \nstand by the sequestration which continues to cut even more from that \nsame Department and many others.\n  As for the war on terror, what the President has said is there comes \na moment, and we have reached it, where we cannot always be on a war \nfooting. It causes a nation to make decisions which in the long haul \nmay not stand the test of time and history. The President has said, \nyes, there is a war on terrorism, but we have to resume our leadership \nin this world with the view of a stable nation, not always thinking \nabout the wartime status we face.\n  I listened to the Senator from Kentucky, who talks about saving money \nand cutting budgets, trying to hang on to that relic of times gone by \nat Guantanamo, where we are spending so much money--hundreds of \nthousands of dollars for each prisoner to be kept at Guantanamo--when \nwe know full well that at least half of them should be released--\ncarefully released--and should not be maintained at Guantanamo.\n  Today, we have hundreds of convicted terrorists safely incarcerated \nin the Federal penitentiaries of America, including one in Illinois in \nMarion, and the people in the nearby community would not even know it \nbecause they are safely incarcerated.\n  Let me say a word too about this issue of Syria. You cannot, on the \none hand, criticize this President for stepping up and saying we need \nto take action, if necessary, to stop the use of chemical weapons and \nthen, on the other hand, say he is a reluctant warrior and that he does \nnot support it. How in the world do you reconcile those two points of \nview?\n  The President has shown leadership. What he has asked is for the \nCongress to follow. What I heard from the Republican Senator from \nKentucky is he is not interested in following that leadership.\n  Let me also add, this Putin overture, that we find some peaceful way \nto resolve this--I hope it turns out to be true and something that \nworks. And if it does, give credit where it is due. This President \nstepped up and said we have to challenge the use of chemical weapons in \nSyria. Even if it does not affect the United States directly or its \nallies directly, we have to stand up to them. And if this Putin \noverture leads to some containment or destruction of those chemical \nweapons, give the President credit for it. Do not criticize him for not \nleading. He has shown more leadership on this issue than, frankly, many \npoliticians of either party wanted to face.\n  I think when it comes to a credible strategy, this President has one.\n  It is a strategy which is ending two wars, which has put an end to \nthe leader of that terrible terrorist attack on the United States on 9/\n11. It is a strategy which has improved the image of the United States \nsince this President has come to power over the last several years. It \nis a strategy we can build on in the future. But we need to make \ncertain that what we do is done with an eye toward the reality of this \nworld in which we live. It is a dangerous world. It is one where the \nUnited States may be called on to lead at times when we do not want to \nlead. We cannot be isolationist. The United States has a responsibility \nin this world. That responsibility has to be used very carefully. This \nPresident understands that.\n  I hope that at the end of the day we can, in fact, see a peaceful \nresolution of the chemical weapons issue in Syria. I hope we can find a \nway to harken back to Ronald Reagan where we can trust that will happen \nbut verify it as well. That would be the right ending. I think the \nPresident has taken the right position.\n  I would like to add something. When it comes to the nation of Israel, \nour closest and best ally in the Middle East, they understand what we \nare trying to do with chemical weapons in Syria. They have made it \nclear through their friends in the United States and other ways that \nthey support it without fear of retaliation by Syria. They are ready, \naccording to Prime Minister Netanyahu, for whatever Syria chooses to \ndo. We should not be any less forceful or less committed when it comes \nto ending the threat of chemical weapons and other weapons of mass \ndestruction in the Middle East.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I know that--and what we have heard this \nmorning--what is rightfully at the forefront of all of our minds this \nweek is the debate about whether to authorize the use of force in \nSyria. This is a very serious matter, as we all know. It raises a \nnumber of geopolitical and national security issues.\n  The decision to undertake military action is not one to be taken \nlightly. I am very aware that people are war-weary, that they are \nconcerned about the consequences of the use of military force. \nConsequently, I believe we should pursue every possible diplomatic \nsolution prior to engaging in military action.\n  I welcome the possibility of international cooperation to secure and \ndestroy Syria's chemical weapons stockpile. I hope that Russia is being \nserious and that they will take real, legitimate actions to quickly \nfollow through on what they have raised with their effort to try to \nencourage Asad to give up his chemical weapons to international \ncontrol. I am working with some of my colleagues on the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee on an amendment to the resolution that would \nincorporate this new development and pressure the Syrians to ensure \nthat we see credible concrete steps in any possible effort to place \ntheir chemical weapons under international inspection. I look forward \nto hearing from the President today and this evening, and I look \nforward to the debate later this week as we consider the situation in \nSyria.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/10/senate-section/article/S6305-2", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6305-S6306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ENERGY SAVINGS AND INDUSTRIAL COMPETITIVENESS ACT\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes this \nmorning to talk about legislation that was previously scheduled to be \ndebated on the Senate floor this week--the Energy Savings and \nIndustrial Competitiveness Act, also known as Shaheen-Portman. I know \nthe Presiding Officer has been very involved in energy issues for all \nof his time in public life, and I do appreciate the work he did as a \nMember of the House. I know he is following this debate very closely. I \nappreciate that.\n  This bill is one Senator Rob Portman and I have been working on for 3 \nyears.\n\n[[Page S6306]]\n\nI appreciate that he has come to the floor today to talk about it as \nwell. We have had 3 years of meetings, negotiations, and broad \nstakeholder outreach in an effort to craft the most effective piece of \nenergy legislation, with the greatest possible chance of passing both \nChambers of Congress and being signed into law.\n  Shaheen-Portman is a bipartisan effort that reflects an affordable \napproach to boost the use of energy efficiency technologies. It will \nhelp create private sector jobs, save businesses and consumers money, \nreduce pollution, and make our country more energy independent. It will \nhave a swift and measurable benefit on our economy and our environment. \nIn the last few weeks we saw a study from experts at the American \nCouncil for an Energy Efficient Economy which found that this \nlegislation has the potential to create 136,000 domestic jobs by 2025, \nall while saving consumers billions of dollars and reducing pollution.\n  Efficiency is the cheapest and fastest approach to reduce our energy \nuse. Energy savings techniques and technologies lower costs and free up \ncapital that allows businesses to expand and our economy to grow. \nPerhaps equally important, energy efficiency has emerged as an \nexcellent example of a bipartisan and affordable opportunity to \nimmediately grow our economy and improve energy security. In addition \nto being affordable, efficiency is widely supported because its \nbenefits are not confined to a certain fuel source or a particular \nregion of the country. It is clearly one of the policy areas where we \nreally can come to a common agreement.\n  It is no wonder that energy efficiency legislation--Shaheen-Portman--\nenjoys such large and diverse support. It has received more than 250 \nendorsements from a wide range of businesses, environmental groups, \nthink tanks, and trade associations, from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \nand the National Association of Manufacturers to the Natural Resources \nDefense Council.\n  I am hopeful the Senate will return to Shaheen-Portman when we have \nfinished debating the serious issue of Syria. I appreciate the \ncommitment of our leadership on both sides of the aisle in the Senate \nto do so. I recognize this will be the first time a major energy bill \nhas reached the Senate floor since 2007; therefore, it only makes sense \nfor us to have a robust energy debate that allows for amendments from \nboth sides of the aisle to be considered. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to find an agreement on the way forward.\n  I thank my good friend Senator Portman for his partnership in \nbringing this bill to the floor. I also thank the majority and minority \nleaders as well as Chairman Wyden and Ranking Member Murkowski for all \nof their support as we have gone through this process and hopefully \nwill bring this bill to the floor in the next couple of weeks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we rise at a time of great debate here in \nthis Chamber and in this country about what the appropriate response \nshould be by the United States to the horrific use of chemical weapons \nby the Government of Syria. That is a debate which will unfold over the \nnext days here. We will see, as the situation continues to develop, \nwhat actually comes to the floor.\n  But the President of the United States has asked for our input here \nin the Senate. Today we are focused on really the most important \nquestion an elected representative is asked to respond to; that is, \nwhether to commit America to military combat. To that end, we have all \nspent time looking over intelligence reports. We have participated in \nclassified intelligence briefings. I have also had the opportunity to \nmeet with top members of the administration. From the information I \nhave received, I do believe the Government of Syria used chemical \nweapons against its own people.\n  I believe an international response is appropriate, but I do not \nbelieve the administration's proposal of a U.S. military strike is the \nright answer. There is no guarantee it will prevent Asad's use of \nchemical weapons. I do not believe it will end the senseless bloodshed \nin Syria. I do not believe it will bring stability to the region that \nis so critical to our national security. I do not believe it will \nenhance Israel's security. I do not believe, most fundamentally, that \nit is nested in a broader strategic plan for the region.\n  The situation we face in Syria today is partly the result of a failed \nforeign policy. It is time for a change of course. We need a \ncomprehensive long-term strategy first, not a strike and then the \npromise of a strategy, which is what the administration has proposed. \n``Strike first, strategy later'' is a recipe for disaster. If the \ncurrent resolution comes to the floor as a result, the current \nresolution being considered, I would not be able to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/10/senate-section/article/S6306-2", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6306-S6307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ENERGY SAVINGS AND INDUSTRIAL COMPETITIVENESS ACT\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. America must also look to its interests here at home. \nSenator Shaheen just talked about that. Without a doubt, the ongoing \nchaos in Syria has served to remind us once again of the volatility and \nthe instability that has plagued the Middle East for many years. It \nshould also serve as a wake-up call.\n  As a country, we have for way too long been dependent on dangerous \nand volatile parts of the world for our foreign energy needs, \nparticularly foreign oil. We have seen the impact in the price of oil, \neven in the last couple of weeks. We certainly have seen it in our \neconomy, the roller coaster we have seen with energy prices up and \ndown. As a result, the need for American energy independence is not \njust a matter of the economy or economic security or energy security, \nit is also a matter of national security.\n  Given these realities, it is incumbent upon us now more than ever to \npursue a true ``all of the above'' domestic energy strategy. We have to \nfind ways to produce more energy here at home. Just as important, we \nhave to figure out how to use less by wasting less. We will save money, \nwe will save energy, we will make our economy more competitive and \ncreate more jobs, and, yes, we will reduce our dependence on foreign \noil.\n  The piece of legislation on which I joined with the senior Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, which we introduced just before we left for the \nAugust recess, takes important steps toward that goal of reducing the \namount of energy we waste in this country. Senator Shaheen just talked \nabout it. It is called the Energy Savings and Industrial \nCompetitiveness Act. It was meant to be on the floor today. We were \nsupposed to be debating it. It is absolutely critical that we are \ndebating Syria instead, but I do hope we can take up this legislation \nafter the discussions about what we do with regard to the situation in \nSyria.\n  This bill, the energy security bill, is bipartisan. It is bicameral \nin the sense that there is support in the House and the Senate for it. \nIt is, as Senator Shaheen said, a bill that reduces our energy waste \nand moves us toward energy independence. According to the recent study \nshe talked about, it is estimated to aid in the creation of 136,000 new \njobs, saving consumers over $13 billion a year by the year 2030. That \nis why it is no surprise that it is supported by such a broad group, as \nSenator Shaheen talked about. That support, by the way, is one big \nreason it passed the Energy Committee with a strong bipartisan vote of \n19 to 3.\n  Simply put, the legislation we proposed makes good environmental \nsense, it makes good energy sense, and it makes good economic sense \ntoo. It is a rare example around here of bipartisanship, which ought to \nbe encouraged in a number of areas, but certainly this is one where we \ncan find common ground.\n  I want to thank the majority leader this morning, and the minority \nleader, for working out a unanimous consent agreement that allows us to \nmove forward on this commonsense approach in the coming days. In that \ndebate, we will talk more about the legislation, how it helps \nmanufacturers on the global stage, and how the savings companies will \naccrue from energy efficiency will lead to better paying jobs. We will \ntalk about how our legislation helps to train the next generation of \nworkers in the skills they need to compete in the growing energy \nefficiency field. We will talk about how it makes\n\n[[Page S6307]]\n\nthe Federal Government practice what it preaches, to reduce the waste \nin the largest user of energy in the world, which is our Federal \nGovernment. We will describe how our bill accomplishes these goals with \nno new mandates, no mandates on the private sector, no new spending, \nentirely offset. And again, it is a commonsense approach that is \nbipartisan. I look forward to that discussion. I look forward to seeing \nthe Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act become law so \nthis Nation can take a big step toward achieving the true goal of an \n``all of the above'' energy strategy and indeed make us less dependent \non those dangerous and volatile parts of the world.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz).

Mr. President, this week we have a very difficult set of \nquestions to answer relating to Syria and the ongoing crisis there. But \nin particular we have a question to answer as it relates to what the \nUnited States should do. I rise this morning to express strong support \nfor this authorization to degrade Bashar al-Asad's chemical weapons \ncapability and deter the future use of these horrific weapons. I made \nthis determination based upon the evidence and the national security \ninterests of the United States, both our national security interests \ntoday as well as in the future.\n  The resolution that is before the Senate right now does not allow for \nthe deployment of U.S. combat troops on the ground in Syria. I will not \nsupport--nor do I think there will be much support in this Chamber--any \nmeasure that would involve U.S. boots on the ground in Syria and this \nresolution specifically speaks to this concern. I am quoting, in part, \nthe resolution:\n\n       The authority granted in section 2(a) does not authorize \n     the use of the United States Armed Forces on the ground in \n     Syria for the purpose of combat operations.\n\n  It is important we make that point.\n  As we have all seen, especially in the last few days, the situation \nin Syria is in flux, especially in the last 24 hours. The Russian \nGovernment put forth a proposal yesterday which would have \ninternational monitors take control of Syria's chemical weapons in \norder to avert a U.S. military strike. I am open to this diplomatic \ndiscussion--however not without caution and not without skepticism. \nDiplomatic solutions are always a preferred path and military strikes \nshould always be the last resort.\n  I think prior to this proposal we were at this point of a last \nresort. But the only reason this proposal is on the table is because of \nthe credible threat of force that is being debated in Washington--but \neven more significantly being debated across the country. The \nauthorization itself should still go forward because it will keep the \npressure on the Syrian regime for a diplomatic solution.\n  Let's take a couple of minutes on our own national security \ninterests. In March of 2011, as reported by the U.S. State Department, \nmultiple news sources, including CNN, reported--and I will submit for \nthe Record a report from CNN--that the Syrian Government authorities \nhad arrested 15 schoolchildren in the city of Daraa for spray-painting \nantigovernment slogans. These young people were reportedly tortured \nwhile in custody and authorities resorted to force when their parents \nand others in the community called for their release. Within 1 week the \npolice had killed 55 demonstrators in connection with the early efforts \nto provide opposition to the Asad regime. The regime committed \ncountless atrocities during the next 2 years of this conflict, \nculminating in the unspeakable use--the indiscriminate use of chemical \nweapons on August 21.\n  I submit for the Record a report from CNN, dated March 1, 2012, and \nask it be printed in the Record.\n  This report is March of 2012, but it looks back in a retrospective \nfashion on what happened in those early days of the opposition coming \ntogether in 2011. I will read a pertinent part, part of what CNN said \nabout what happened when these schoolchildren were demonstrating \nagainst the regime. They talked in this report about the young people, \nas I mentioned, not just protesting but spray-painting their beliefs \nagainst the regime. At the time, not a lot of people around the world \nwere focused on what was happening in Syria. Let me quote in pertinent \npart what at one point one of the citizens on the street was saying, \nthat the people in Daraa:\n\n     . . . didn't want to go against the regime. People thought \n     that this [leader, Mr. Asad] was better than his dad. Nobody \n     wanted to go face-to-face with him.\n\n  But then of course it was young people, in this case even \nschoolchildren, who led the way to take him on. I submit this for the \nrecord because this opposition started on the streets of Syria, in this \ncase in Daraa, starting with young people, but it of course continued \nfrom there. We know that the regime itself has the largest chemical \nstockpile in the region, one of the largest in the world. We know Mr. \nAsad used these weapons against his own people, not only on August 21 \nbut on multiple occasions prior to that in a much more limited way. We \nalso know he has the capacity, the will, and unfortunately the track \nrecord to use these weapons against innocent civilians.\n  We also should remember we have troops and other military and \ndiplomatic personnel in the region, in the Middle East. Even Syria's \nacquisition--even Syria's very acquisition of chemical weapons \nthreatens our national security. In 2003, the Congress of the United \nStates--some people have forgotten about this--the Congress of the\n\n[[Page S6308]]\n\nUnited States in 2003 passed the Syria Accountability and Lebanese \nSovereignty Restoration Act of that year. This act explicitly states \nthat Congress found--the U.S. Congress made a finding that ``Syria's \nacquisition''--and I am underlining that word ``acquisition''--``of \nweapons of mass destruction threatens the security of the Middle East \nand the national security interests of the United States.''\n  This Congress 10 years ago made a determination that the acquisition \nof chemical weapons was a threat to our national security. We are in a \ndifferent world now. Syria not only acquired them but has now used them \nmultiple times on its own people, the most recent being the horrific \nscenes that we all saw in some of the videos that are now part of the \npublic record. So there is clear and convincing evidence of the direct \ninvolvement of the Asad regime, the forces of the Asad regime and \nsenior officials, in the planning, execution, aftermath, and attempts \nto cover up the August 21 attack. This is graphically evident in the 13 \nauthenticated videos released by the Senate Intelligence Committee \ncompiled by the Open Source Center showing the results of chemical \nweapons use in the Damascus suburbs on August 21. These videos were \nshown to the Intelligence Committee on Thursday and played on CNN on \nSaturday. So many Americans have seen them. If anyone would like more \ninformation about those, go to my Web site and I am certain many others \nas well.\n\n  It is clear that the regime violated international law as it relates \nto chemical weapons. We know the regime committed a barrage of terror \nacross the country with the sole aim of remaining in power. We have to \nask ourselves, when a dictator or terrorist organization uses chemical \nweapons in violation of international law, should that regime or \nterrorist organization pay a price? I argue that they must pay a price.\n  We simply can't condemn this crime against humanity; it is in the \nnational security interest of the United States for the administration \nto have the authorization to act. The regime in Iran, the terrorist \norganization Hezbollah, and the regime in North Korea are watching very \nclosely, so it is imperative that we take steps to address this threat.\n  Let me talk about the regime in Iran and Hezbollah. What happens in \nSyria is of great consequence to our security interest as it relates to \nthat regime in Hezbollah. When I say ``that regime,'' I am speaking \nabout the Iran regime. Their support for Hezbollah, through Syria, has \nresulted in constant plotting against the United States and its allies. \nThe Asad regime in Syria is the conduit of this relationship between \nHezbollah and the Iranian regime itself.\n  I support this authorization of targeted and strategic military \naction in order to hold the Syrian regime accountable and because it \nwill diminish the ability of Iran and Hezbollah to conduct acts of \nterror. It will also protect American lives if we hold them \naccountable, as well as, of course, the Syrian people. Indeed, other \nthan Al Qaeda, Hezbollah has killed more Americans than any other \nterrorist organization in the world, including 241 marines in 1983. \nHezbollah has consistently partnered with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary \nGuard Corps to bolster Asad's campaign of repression and violence in \nSyria, which has further destabilized the region. The regime in Iran \nhas provided funds, weapons, logistical support, tactical advice, and \nfighters to the Syrian Government forces. Just this year Iran's support \nto Asad has increased, with reported daily resupply flights to Syria.\n  The Syrian regime possesses a stockpile of chemical weapons that we \ncannot allow to fall into the hands of terrorists. Iran and Hezbollah--\nI think some people in Washington missed this--are not on the \nsidelines; they are already on the battlefield. I would argue that Iran \nand Hezbollah are on two battlefields. Certainly, they are on the \nbattlefield in Syria but also the daily battlefield of terrorist acts \nplotting against the United States and other countries as well.\n  Failure to bring action and failure to hold Syria accountable after \nsuch a horrific crime will only serve to embolden the Iranian regime, \nto embolden the terrorist organization Hezbollah and others, to expand \nterror across the world. Iran's status as the world's leading state \nsponsor of terrorism is well established, and its proxies have \nperpetuated attacks against the United States, Israel, and our allies.\n  Emboldened by Iran's support, Hezbollah has conducted terrorist \nattacks since its inception in the early 1980s--including Western \ntargets. Hezbollah has become more aggressive in the last few years and \nhas executed attacks not only in the Middle East but on two other \ncontinents--South Asia and Europe. Just 2 years ago a plot was \nuncovered to blow up a restaurant in Georgetown--right here in \nWashington, DC--to kill the Saudi Ambassador to the United States, \nalong with U.S. officials and average citizens who are American. When \nthe Iranian-backed attacker was questioned, he referred to the \npotential killing of Americans as ``no big deal.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe report by the Department of Justice entitled ``Two Men Charged in \nAlleged Plot to Assassinate Saudi Arabian Ambassador to the United \nStates.''\n  The list goes on. We know that in June of 1996 there was the bombing \nof Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia where 19 U.S. Air Force personnel were \nkilled. That is another example of an Iran-backed terrorist activity. \nIt goes back, as I mentioned, to 1983 when 241 marines were killed by a \ntruck bombing in Beirut. There are also new reports on evidence that \nstrongly suggests that an Iran-backed plot was underway to kill a U.S. \nAmbassador in 2011. Hezbollah has consistently partnered with Iran to \ndo just that.\n  The national security interest of the United States is even more \nsignificant than that. It is not simply the green light it would send \nto Iran and Hezbollah as it relates to terrorism. If we don't take the \nright action here, it would send a message and green light to Iran as \nit relates to their nuclear program. We know the Iranian regime is \nintent on developing nuclear weapons capability. I support a variety of \nmeasures to prevent Iran from acquiring that capability. Condemnation \nonly of Syria would embolden Iran and undermine our efforts to prevent \nthe Iranian regime from developing and possessing a nuclear weapon.\n  Every Member of Congress will have to weigh the consequence of giving \nthe green light to the use of chemical weapons and contemplate what it \nwill mean for enemies, such as the Iranian regime and Hezbollah, who \nplot against the United States every day. I am like a lot of Members of \nCongress in that after receiving several intelligence briefings, I have \nmore confidence than ever before that we have a significant national \nsecurity imperative to authorize the President to act as it relates to \nSyria. I have no doubt that Mr. Asad used the chemical weapons against \nhis people and it is evident that he crossed more than one redline. So \nI support this limited and proportional scope of authorization for the \nuse of force.\n  By the way, this authorization would probably be the most limited \nauthorization in recent American history.\n  I believe Congress must stand united on this issue, and we have to \nmake sure we not only hold the regime accountable but make sure we are \ndoing everything possible to send the right message.\n  I have two more points before I conclude. One of the best rationales \nfor the reason we are taking the steps I hope we will take was set \nforth in an op-ed printed in the New York Times last weekend by \nNicholas Kristof, and it is dated September 7, 2013. The op-ed is \nentitled ``Pulling the Curtain Back on Syria,'' and I ask unanimous \nconsent to have this op-ed printed in the Record.\n  I think one of the most important lines in here--and, of course, I \nwill not read the entire op-ed--is what Mr. Kristof wrote:\n\n       In other words, while there are many injustices around the \n     world, from Darfur to eastern Congo, take it from one who has \n     covered most of them: Syria is today the world capital of \n     human suffering.\n\n  There are few journalists--there are few Americans--who have more \ncredibility on the issue of what is happening to children and \nvulnerable populations around the world than Nicholas Kristof. For him \nto say the world capital of human suffering is in Syria is a powerful \nand compelling statement.\n\n[[Page S6309]]\n\n  That brings me back to where I started. I started walking through the \nearly days of this opposition to a repressive regime against Mr. Asad, \nand the people who led the way and made a case against his regime in \nlarge measure were the children or young people. One of the harrowing \nand very disturbing elements of this entire crisis--this war that has \nraged on for more than 2 years now--is the impact it has had on \nchildren.\n  I received a report today that came from Save the Children. They have \nenormous credibility not only on children's issues worldwide, but there \nare Save the Children personnel on the ground in Syria.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the document entitled \n``Briefing note: The children crisis in Syria'' be printed in the \nRecord as well.\n  That documents in great detail the human suffering of children and \nthe impact this has had on millions of Syrian children. But, of course, \nmaybe the most graphic and disturbing example of that was the footage \nthat virtually every American has had an opportunity to view which \nshows the hundreds and hundreds of children who were killed instantly \nin this horrific chemical weapons attack. By one estimate, more than \n400--maybe as many as 426--children were killed.\n  When we confront this issue, we cannot simply say: Oh, this is just \nanother horrific situation around the world. When we consider what this \nregime did to schoolchildren--arrested them and by many accounts \ntortured them from the beginning of this opposition all the way through \nto the attack on August 21--and what will continue to happen to \nchildren in Syria and in places around the world, we are summoned by \nour conscience to act in some fashion and hold this regime accountable.\n  I want to be open to this possibility that maybe there is a \nbreakthrough, that we can remove this terrible threat from Syria and \nwipe out the chemical weapons threat by giving total and complete \ncontrol of chemical weapons to an international force, but the burden \nof proof is on Syria and the Russian Federation. They have to deliver \nvery specifically in a very short timeframe if they expect us to agree \nto this. We should be hopeful and consider this opportunity, but at the \nsame time we cannot divorce ourselves from the reality of what \nhappened, the consequence of not acting, and also the long-term and \nshort-term national security interests of the United States, which I \nthink are overwhelming and compelling in this instance.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate recess.\n\n                      From CNN.com, Mar. 1, 2012]\n\n               Daraa: The Spark That Lit the Syrian Flame\n\n                           (By Joe Sterling)\n\n       Syria is burning--scorched for nearly a year by tenacious \n     political resistance, a merciless security crackdown and \n     cries for democracy.\n       The spark that lit the flame began about a year ago in the \n     southern city of Daraa after the arrests of at least 15 \n     children for painting anti-government graffiti on the walls \n     of a school.\n       The community's blunt outrage over the children's arrests \n     and mistreatment, the government's humiliating and violent \n     reactions to their worries, and the people's refusal to be \n     cowed by security forces emboldened and helped spread the \n     Syrian opposition.\n\n\n                     Fate of neighborhood uncertain\n\n       Daraa soon became a rallying cry across the country for \n     what began as a rural and provincial-driven uprising.\n       Syrians compare the dramatic dynamics in the rural city to \n     the moment Tunisian street vendor Mohamed Bouazizi torched \n     himself in December 2010. Bouazizi's act and death spawned \n     demonstrations that led to the grassroots ouster of Tunisian \n     President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and fueled other protests \n     across the Arab world.\n       Mohamed Masalmeh--a Halifax, Nova Scotia-based Syrian \n     activist whose family hails from Daraa--said Daraa residents \n     broke the people's ``wall of fear'' by defying what he and \n     others call a police state and taking to the street.\n       ``What people did in Daraa was unheard of,'' he said.\n       Omar Almuqdad, a journalist from Daraa now living in \n     Turkey, said, ``They started protesting day after day.''\n       ``It was the flame of the revolution.''\n\n\n                      A slow burn into a firestorm\n\n       Discontent in Syria has slow-burned for decades.\n       A clampdown on a Muslim Brotherhood uprising by the current \n     president's predecessor and father--President Hafez Assad--\n     killed thousands in Hama in 1982.\n       When Bashar al-Assad took the presidency after his father \n     died in 2000, he gave lip service to reforms.\n       But activists who emerged from the so-called Damascus \n     Spring after the death of Hafez and those in 2005 who urged \n     reforming what they said was an ``authoritarian, totalitarian \n     and cliquish regime'' found themselves in trouble with the \n     authorities.\n       There was sectarian and ethnic unrest in the last decade, \n     too, with a Druze uprising flaring in 2000 and a Kurdish \n     rebellion erupting in 2004.\n       When the Arab Spring unfolded last year, Syrians imbibed \n     the contagious revolutionary fervor spreading across the \n     Middle East.\n       But the anger smoldered under the surface because of the \n     Goliath-sized, all-seeing and all-knowing security and spying \n     apparatus.\n       Protests popped up in Syria as video images of public \n     defiance in Egypt, Libya and Tunisia swept the world--small \n     outpourings seen by observers as tests to build a Syrian \n     nerve to take to the streets.\n       And then--Daraa.\n       Remote Daraa sits just a few miles from the Jordanian \n     border. It has had its economic struggles, such as drought \n     and drops in subsidies and salaries. Nevertheless, it had \n     been a reliable bastion of support for the regime and its \n     Baath party.\n       Tribal and predominantly Sunni, Daraa is like many small \n     towns. People know one another and the relationships are \n     close in the city and in the nearby villages and towns.\n       When the schoolchildren were arrested in late February \n     2011, they were accused of scrawling graffiti on a school \n     that said ``the people want to topple the regime.'' Masalmeh, \n     the activist, said security went to a school, interrogated \n     students and rounded up suspects.\n       It wasn't as if this vandalism was rare. Such graffiti was \n     becoming so common in the region that ID was needed to buy \n     spray cans.\n       But these arrests struck a chord. Residents found out their \n     boys were being beaten and tortured in prison.\n       The families of the boys approached authorities and asked \n     for their sons' release. Activists and observers say \n     authorities shunned and insulted the people. One official \n     reportedly said: ``Forget your children. If you really want \n     your children, you should make more children. If you don't \n     know how to make more children, we'll show you how to do \n     it.''\n       ``At some point, the insult is so far below the belt. \n     People do respond to it. They just don't bow down anymore,'' \n     Amnesty International's Neil Sammonds said.\n\n\n                             Protests grow\n\n       On March 16, a female-led sit-in in Damascus demanded the \n     release of prisoners unfairly jailed. Some of the \n     participants were Daraans, with strong ties back to their \n     home province, and part of the educated, urbanite youth \n     living in Damascus.\n       ``Police dragged protesters by the hair and beat them,'' \n     said Mohja Kahf, a novelist, professor and activist in \n     Arkansas with contacts across Syria. ``This built on the \n     gathering outrage over the Daraa children who are \n     prisoners.''\n       A day later, a sit-in in Daraa, with some detained. The \n     next day, on March 18, a protest against the arrests of the \n     children, according to The Human Rights Watch.\n       ``Security forces opened fire, killing at least four \n     protesters and within days, the protests grew into rallies \n     that gathered thousands of people,'' the group said.\n       Activists regard these as the first deaths in the Syrian \n     uprising.\n       People began rallying in other cities across Syria that \n     day--Jassem, Da'el, Sanamein and Inkhil. Kahf said the \n     government responded with live fire only in Daraa.\n       But the more people demonstrated in Daraa, the tougher \n     security forces cracked down. And as the crackdown worsened, \n     the more resolute the protesters became.\n       The people in Daraa ``didn't want to go against the \n     regime,'' Masalmeh said. ``People thought this guy--Bashar--\n     was better than his dad. Nobody wanted to go face-to-face \n     with him.\n       ``It's not like they fought with arms at that moment,'' he \n     said. ``They were just defiant. `All that we want is our \n     children.' ''\n       The youths were eventually freed, but YouTube videos and \n     demonstrations were already spreading.\n       Al-Assad addressed the Daraa unrest in a March 30 speech \n     before lawmakers, blaming the unrest on sedition. ``They \n     started in the governorate (province) of Daraa,'' al-Assad \n     said, adding ``the conspirators took their plan to other \n     governorates.''\n       ``That speech had a catastrophic impact,'' the \n     International Crisis Group's Peter Harling said. ``People who \n     wanted to support the regime at the time were shocked by the \n     speech.''\n       The dismissiveness of al-Assad and the lawmakers who \n     applauded his words awakened many Syrian people, says the \n     Human Rights Watch's Nadim Houry. Two days later, weekly \n     anti-government protests began across Syria.\n       Calls for reforms soon morphed into calls for the removal \n     of the al-Assad regime.\n       ``Courage is contagious,'' Houry said.\n       The government launched a full-scale siege on Daraa April \n     25, with other towns such as Homs to follow.\n       Mass arrests unfolded and tales of torture spread across \n     the country. The protest movement grew and solidified into an \n     opposition.\n       Paul Salem, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center, \n     points out ``it's conceivable\n\n[[Page S6310]]\n\n     that if the events didn't happen in Daraa,'' the uprising \n     ``might not have occurred.''\n       But the deep-seated political and economic reasons \n     underlining Syrian discontent was an omen. Protest in Syria \n     was ``going to happen'' at some point, Salem said.\n       So, out of Daraa, a spark. And a year later, the uprisings \n     blaze on.\n       ``The impact of small events on history can be huge,'' \n     Salem said.\n                                  ____\n\n       The following is an official release from the Department of \n     Justice on the alleged plot.\n\nTwo Men Charged in Alleged Plot to Assassinate Saudi Arabian Ambassador \n                          to the United States\n\n       Washington.--Two individuals have been charged in New York \n     for their alleged participation in a plot directed by \n     elements of the Iranian government to murder the Saudi \n     Ambassador to the United States with explosives while the \n     Ambassador was in the United States.\n       The charges were announced by Attorney General Eric Holder; \n     FBI Director Robert S. Mueller; Lisa Monaco, Assistant \n     Attorney General for National Security; and Preet Bharara, \n     U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.\n       A criminal complaint filed today in the Southern District \n     of New York charges Manssor Arbabsiar, a 56-year-old \n     naturalized U.S. citizen holding both Iranian and U.S. \n     passports, and Gholam Shakuri, an Iran-based member of Iran's \n     Qods Force, which is a special operations unit of the Iranian \n     Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) that is said to \n     sponsor and promote terrorist activities abroad.\n       Both defendants are charged with conspiracy to murder a \n     foreign official; conspiracy to engage in foreign travel and \n     use of interstate and foreign commerce facilities in the \n     commission of murder-for-hire; conspiracy to use a weapon of \n     mass destruction (explosives); and conspiracy to commit an \n     act of international terrorism transcending national \n     boundaries. Arbabsiar is further charged with an additional \n     count of foreign travel and use of interstate and foreign \n     commerce facilities in the commission of murder-for-hire.\n       Shakuri remains at large. Arbabsiar was arrested on Sept. \n     29, 2011, at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport \n     and will make his initial appearance today before in federal \n     court in Manhattan. He faces a maximum potential sentence of \n     life in prison if convicted of all the charges.\n       ``The criminal complaint unsealed today exposes a deadly \n     plot directed by factions of the Iranian government to \n     assassinate a foreign Ambassador on U.S. soil with \n     explosives,'' said Attorney General Holder. ``Through the \n     diligent and coordinated efforts of our law enforcement and \n     intelligence agencies, we were able to disrupt this plot \n     before anyone was harmed. We will continue to investigate \n     this matter vigorously and bring those who have violated any \n     laws to justice.''\n       ``The investigation leading to today's charges illustrates \n     both the challenges and complexities of the international \n     threat environment, and our increased ability today to bring \n     together the intelligence and law enforcement resources \n     necessary to better identify and disrupt those threats, \n     regardless of their origin,'' said FBI Director Mueller.\n       ``The disruption of this plot is a significant milestone \n     that stems from months of hard work by our law enforcement \n     and intelligence professionals,'' said Assistant Attorney \n     General Monaco. ``I applaud the many agents, analysts and \n     prosecutors who helped bring about today's case.''\n       ``As alleged, these defendants were part of a well-funded \n     and pernicious plot that had, as its first priority, the \n     assassination of the Saudi Ambassador to the United States, \n     without care or concern for the mass casualties that would \n     result from their planned attack,'' said U.S. Attorney \n     Bharara. ``Today's charges should make crystal clear that we \n     will not let other countries use our soil as their \n     battleground.''\n\n\n                            The Alleged Plot\n\n       The criminal complaint alleges that, from the spring of \n     2011 to October 2011, Arbabsiar and his Iran-based co-\n     conspirators, including Shakuri of the Qods Force, have been \n     plotting the murder of the Saudi Ambassador to the United \n     States. In furtherance of this conspiracy, Arbabsiar \n     allegedly met on a number of occasions in Mexico with a DEA \n     confidential source (CS-1) who has posed as an associate of a \n     violent international drug trafficking cartel. According to \n     the complaint, Arbabsiar arranged to hire CS-1 and CS-1's \n     purported accomplices to murder the Ambassador, and Shakuri \n     and other Iran-based co-conspirators were aware of and \n     approved the plan. With Shakuri's approval, Arbabsiar has \n     allegedly caused approximately $100,000 to be wired into a \n     bank account in the United States as a down payment to CS-1 \n     for the anticipated killing of the Ambassador, which was to \n     take place in the United States.\n       According to the criminal complaint, the IRCG is an arm of \n     the Iranian military that is composed of a number of \n     branches, one of which is the Qods Force. The Qods Force \n     conducts sensitive covert operations abroad, including \n     terrorist attacks, assassinations and kidnappings, and is \n     believed to sponsor attacks against Coalition Forces in Iraq. \n     In October 2007, the U.S. Treasury Department designated the \n     Qods Force for providing material support to the Taliban and \n     other terrorist organizations.\n       The complaint alleges that Arbabsiar met with CS-1 in \n     Mexico on May 24, 2011, where Arbabsiar inquired as to CS-1's \n     knowledge with respect to explosives and explained that he \n     was interested in, among other things, attacking an embassy \n     of Saudi Arabia. In response, CS-1 allegedly indicated that \n     he was knowledgeable with respect to C-4 explosives. In June \n     and July 2011, the complaint alleges, Arbabsiar returned to \n     Mexico and held additional meetings with CS-1, where \n     Arbabsiar explained that his associates in Iran had discussed \n     a number of violent missions for CS-1 and his associates to \n     perform, including the murder of the Ambassador.\n\n\n               $1.5 Million Fee for Alleged Assassination\n\n       In a July 14, 2011, meeting in Mexico, CS-1 allegedly told \n     Arbabsiar that he would need to use four men to carry out the \n     Ambassador's murder and that his price for carrying out the \n     murder was $1.5 million. Arbabsiar allegedly agreed and \n     stated that the murder of the Ambassador should be handled \n     first, before the execution of other attacks. Arbabsiar also \n     allegedly indicated he and his associates had $100,000 in \n     Iran to pay CS-1 as a first payment toward the assassination \n     and discussed the manner in which that payment would be made.\n       During the same meeting, Arbabsiar allegedly described to \n     CS-1 his cousin in Iran, who he said had requested that \n     Arbabsiar find someone to carry out the Ambassador's \n     assassination. According to the complaint, Arbabsiar \n     indicated that his cousin was a ``big general'' in the \n     Iranian military; that he focuses on matters outside Iran and \n     that he had taken certain unspecified actions related to a \n     bombing in Iraq.\n       In a July 17, 2011 meeting in Mexico, CS-1 noted to \n     Arbabsiar that one of his workers had already traveled to \n     Washington, D.C., to surveill the Ambassador. CS-1 also \n     raised the possibility of innocent bystander casualties. The \n     complaint alleges that Arbabsiar made it clear that the \n     assassination needed to go forward, despite mass casualties, \n     telling CS-1, ``They want that guy [the Ambassador] done \n     [killed], if the hundred go with him f**k 'em.'' CS-1 and \n     Arbabsiar allegedly discussed bombing a restaurant in the \n     United States that the Ambassador frequented. When CS-1 noted \n     that others could be killed in the attack, including U.S. \n     senators who dine at the restaurant, Arbabsiar allegedly \n     dismissed these concerns as ``no big deal.''\n       On Aug. 1, and Aug. 9, 2011, with Shakuri's approval, \n     Arbabsiar allegedly caused two overseas wire transfers \n     totaling approximately $100,000 to be sent to an FBI \n     undercover account as a down payment for CS-1 to carry out \n     the assassination. Later, Arbabsiar allegedly explained to \n     CS-1 that he would provide the remainder of the $1.5 million \n     after the assassination. On Sept. 20, 2011, CS-1 allegedly \n     told Arbabsiar that the operation was ready and requested \n     that Arbabsiar either pay one half of the agreed upon price \n     ($1.5 million) for the murder or that Arbabsiar personally \n     travel to Mexico as collateral for the final payment of the \n     fee. According to the complaint, Arbabsiar agreed to travel \n     to Mexico to guarantee final payment for the murder.\n\n\n                     Arrest and Alleged Confession\n\n       On or about Sept. 28, 2011, Arbabsiar flew to Mexico. \n     Arbabsiar was refused entry into Mexico by Mexican \n     authorities and, according to Mexican law and international \n     agreements; he was placed on a return flight destined for his \n     last point of departure. On Sept. 29, 2011, Arbabsiar was \n     arrested by federal agents during a flight layover at JFK \n     International Airport in New York. Several hours after his \n     arrest, Arbabsiar was advised of his Miranda rights and he \n     agreed to waive those rights and speak with law enforcement \n     agents. During a series of Mirandized interviews, Arbabsiar \n     allegedly confessed to his participation in the murder plot.\n       According to the complaint, Arbabsiar also admitted to \n     agents that, in connection with this plot, he was recruited, \n     funded and directed by men he understood to be senior \n     officials in Iran's Qods Force. He allegedly said these \n     Iranian officials were aware of and approved of the use of \n     CS-1 in connection with the plot; as well as payments to CS-\n     1; the means by which the Ambassador would be killed in the \n     United States and the casualties that would likely result.\n       Arbabsiar allegedly told agents that his cousin, who he had \n     long understood to be a senior member of the Qods Force, had \n     approached him in the early spring of 2011 about recruiting \n     narco-traffickers to kidnap the Ambassador. Arbabsiar told \n     agents that he then met with the CS-1 in Mexico and discussed \n     assassinating the Ambassador. According to the complaint, \n     Arbabsiar said that, afterwards, he met several times in Iran \n     with Shakuri and another senior Qods Force official, where he \n     explained that the plan was to blow up a restaurant in the \n     United States frequented by the Ambassador and that numerous \n     bystanders could be killed, according to the complaint. The \n     plan was allegedly approved by these officials.\n       In October 2011, according to the complaint, Arbabsiar made \n     phone calls at the direction of law enforcement to Shakuri in \n     Iran that were monitored. During these phone calls, Shakuri \n     allegedly confirmed that Arbabsiar should move forward with \n     the plot to murder the Ambassador and that he should \n     accomplish the task as quickly as possible, stating on Oct. \n     5, 2011, ``[j]ust do it quickly, it's late . . .'' The \n     complaint alleges that Shakuri also told Arbabsiar that he\n\n[[Page S6311]]\n\n     would consult with his superiors about whether they would be \n     willing to pay CS-1 additional money.\n       This investigation is being conducted by the FBI Houston \n     Division and DEA Houston Division, with assistance from the \n     FBI New York Joint Terrorism Task Force.

Kristof)\n\n       When I was a law student in 1982, I escaped torts by \n     backpacking through Syria and taking a public bus to Hama, \n     where the government had suppressed a rebellion by massacring \n     some 20,000 people.\n       The center of Hama was pulverized into a vast field of \n     rubble interspersed with bits of clothing, yet on the fringe \n     of it stood, astonishingly, a tourism office. The two Syrian \n     officials inside, thrilled to see an apparent tourist, \n     weighed me down with leaflets about sightseeing in Hama and \n     its ancient water wheels. After a bit of small talk, I \n     pointed out the window at the moonscape and asked what had \n     happened.\n       They peered out at the endless gravel pit.\n       ``Huh?'' one said nervously. ``I don't see anything.''\n       It feels to me a bit as if much of the world is reacting \n     the same way today. The scale of the slaughter may be five \n     times that of 1982, but few are interested in facing up to \n     what is unfolding today out our window in Hama, Homs, \n     Damascus and Aleppo.\n       As one woman tweeted to me: ``We simply cannot stop every \n     injustice in the world by using military weapons.''\n       Fair enough. But let's be clear that this is not ``every \n     injustice'': On top of the 100,000-plus already killed in \n     Syria, another 5,000 are being slaughtered monthly, according \n     to the United Nations. Remember the Boston Massacre of 1770 \n     from our history books, in which five people were killed? \n     Syria loses that many people every 45 minutes on average, \n     around the clock.\n       The rate of killing is accelerating. In the first year, \n     2011, there were fewer than 5,000 deaths. As of July 2012, \n     there were still ``only'' 10,000, and the number has since \n     soared tenfold.\n       A year ago, by United Nations calculations, there were \n     230,000 Syrian refugees. Now there are two million.\n       In other words, while there are many injustices around the \n     world, from Darfur to Eastern Congo, take it from one who has \n     covered most of them: Syria is today the world capital of \n     human suffering.\n       Skeptics are right about the drawbacks of getting involved, \n     including the risk of retaliation. Yet let's acknowledge that \n     the alternative is, in effect, to acquiesce as the slaughter \n     in Syria reaches perhaps the hundreds of thousands or more.\n       But what about the United Nations? How about a multilateral \n     solution involving the Arab League? How about peace talks? \n     What about an International Criminal Court prosecution?\n       All this sounds fine in theory, but Russia blocks progress \n     in the United Nations. We've tried multilateral approaches, \n     and Syrian leaders won't negotiate a peace deal as long as \n     they feel they're winning on the ground. One risk of bringing \n     in the International Criminal Court is that President Bashar \n     al-Assad would be more wary of stepping down. The United \n     Nations can't stop the killing in Syria any more than in \n     Darfur or Kosovo. As President Assad himself noted in 2009, \n     ``There is no substitute for the United States.''\n       So while neither intervention nor paralysis is appealing, \n     that's pretty much the menu. That's why I favor a limited \n     cruise missile strike against Syrian military targets (as \n     well as the arming of moderate rebels). As I see it, there \n     are several benefits: Such a strike may well deter Syria's \n     army from using chemical weapons again, probably can degrade \n     the ability of the army to use chemical munitions and bomb \n     civilian areas, can reinforce the global norm against \n     chemical weapons, and--a more remote prospect--may slightly \n     increase the pressure on the Assad regime to work out a peace \n     deal.\n       If you're thinking, ``Those are incremental, speculative \n     and highly uncertain gains,'' well, you're right. Syria will \n     be bloody whatever we do.\n       Mine is a minority view. After the Afghanistan and Iraq \n     wars, the West is bone weary and has little interest in \n     atrocities unfolding in Syria or anywhere else. Opposition to \n     missile strikes is one of the few issues that ordinary \n     Democrats and Republicans agree on.\n       ``So we're bombing Syria because Syria is bombing Syria?'' \n     Sarah Palin wrote, in a rare comment that liberals might \n     endorse. Her suggestion: ``Let Allah sort it out.''\n       More broadly, pollsters are detecting a rise in \n     isolationism. The proportion of Americans who say that ``the \n     U.S. should mind its own business internationally'' has been \n     at a historic high in recent years.\n       A Pew survey this year asked voters to rate 19 government \n     expenses, and the top two choices for budget cuts were ``aid \n     to the world's needy'' and the State Department. (In fact, \n     0.5 percent of the budget goes to the world's needy, and, \n     until recently, the military had more musicians in its bands \n     than the State Department had diplomats.)\n       When history looks back on this moment, will it view those \n     who opposed intervening as champions of peace? Or, when the \n     textbooks count the dead children, and the international \n     norms broken with impunity, will our descendants puzzle that \n     we took pride in retreating into passivity during this \n     slaughter?\n       Isn't this a bit like the idealists who embraced the \n     Kellogg-Briand Pact that banned war 85 years ago? Sure, that \n     made people feel good. But it may also have encouraged the \n     appeasement that ultimately cost lives in World War II.\n       O.K., so I've just added fuel to the battle for analogies. \n     For now, the one that has caught on is Iraq in 2003. But \n     considering that no one is contemplating boots on the ground, \n     a more relevant analogy in Iraq may be the 1998 Operation \n     Desert Fox bombing of Iraqi military sites by President Bill \n     Clinton. It lasted a few days, and some say it was a factor \n     in leading Iraq to give up W.M.D. programs; others disagree.\n       That murkiness is not surprising. To me, the lessons of \n     history in this area are complex and conflicting, offering no \n     neat formula to reach peace or alleviate war. In most cases, \n     diplomacy works best. But not always. When Yugoslavia was \n     collapsing into civil war in the early 1990s, early efforts \n     at multilateral diplomacy delayed firm action and led to a \n     higher body count.\n       Some military interventions, as in Sierra Leone, Bosnia and \n     Kosovo, have worked well. Others, such as Iraq in 2003, \n     worked very badly. Still others, such as Libya, had mixed \n     results. Afghanistan and Somalia were promising at first but \n     then evolved badly.\n       So, having said that analogies aren't necessarily helpful, \n     let me leave you with a final provocation.\n       If we were fighting against an incomparably harsher \n     dictator using chemical weapons on our own neighborhoods, and \n     dropping napalm-like substances on our children's schools, \n     would we regard other countries as ``pro-peace'' if they sat \n     on the fence as our dead piled up?\n                                  ____\n\n\n              Briefing Note: The Children Crisis in Syria\n\n       The crisis in Syria is a humanitarian tragedy of a scale \n     that is almost impossible to imagine. The recent chemical \n     attack in Al Ghouta adds to an already too bleak picture; \n     even before the recent massacre, Syria was the most dangerous \n     place to be a civilian.i\n       The lack of humanitarian access, and hence of witnesses, \n     makes the human price hard to quantify, but our teams in the \n     region responding to this humanitarian crisis report \n     increasingly dire conditions and the daily arrival of \n     thousands of exhausted and terrified refugees. These data \n     indicate the scale of the crisis:\n       Altogether at least 100,000 people have been killed ii, \n     including more than 7,000 children iii of whom 1,700 are \n     under the age of 10.iv The fighting continues to take the \n     lives of an average of 5,000 people each month.v\n       The UN estimates that today one third of Syrians have been \n     forced to abandon their homes.vi Two million are refugees and \n     another 4.5 million are internally displaced. Children \n     account for more than half of those displaced.vii\n       The UN estimates that 8.8 million (including 6.8 million in \n     Syria itself viii) are urgently in need of assistance across \n     the region, predicting 10 million by end 2013.ix\n       At least four million Syrians--half of them children--are \n     in need of emergency food assistance.x\n       In Northern governorates, 80% of school facilities have \n     ceased to function,xi with as many as 3,900 schools damaged \n     or destroyed by the conflict throughout the country.xii\n       Medical supplies are severely lacking throughout the \n     country and the World Health Organization has warned that \n     disease outbreaks are ``inevitable'' in the midst of summer \n     heat, with deteriorating access to water and sanitation.xiii\n       In addition to pervasive insecurity, bureaucratic \n     restrictions imposed by the Government severely limit aid \n     agencies' ability to reach all civilians in need: between \n     January and July 2013 only 20 UN convoys crossed the conflict \n     lines into opposition-controlled areas.xiv The UN estimates \n     that 6.8 million--one in every three Syrians--are trapped in \n     conflict areas and in need of assistance.xv However, a recent \n     NGO assessment in northern Syria puts the figure much higher, \n     finding that 10.5 million people in these districts alone are \n     not getting enough essential supplies.xvi Despite the huge \n     efforts of humanitarian agencies, the volume of aid crossing \n     Syria's borders and conflict lines is still not enough and \n     millions are still receiving no assistance. Children are \n     dying as a result.xvii\n       With price inflation--with basics such as wheat and flour \n     up as much as 100% xviii--the lack of food is reported by \n     Syrian parents as the second biggest source of stress, after \n     insecurity.xix Our teams have heard testimonies of mothers \n     forced to feed their infants with water mixed with sugar due \n     to a\n\n[[Page S6312]]\n\n     lack of baby milk. Other reports testify to the bleak living \n     conditions of those internally displaced in Northern Syria, \n     who have so little resources that they are forced to eat \n     herbs and collect stagnant rainwater to drink and wash.xx\n       For the sake of the millions of children facing a future of \n     fear and hunger, safe and unimpeded humanitarian access is \n     needed to all areas of Syria by the most effective routes \n     possible. Save the Children calls on governments to:\n       Build consensus across the international community, \n     including in the UN Security Council, to demand all parties \n     to the conflict fulfill their obligation to allow \n     humanitarian aid--including UN aid--to all areas where \n     children need it, across conflict lines and across Syria's \n     borders;\n       Increase funding. Overall the UN is calling for over $5 \n     billion to meet needs inside Syria and among refugees in \n     neighboring countries. Only 41% xxi of the appeal is funded. \n     Governments must increase support for humanitarian operations \n     throughout Syria by any possible channel, as well as scale up \n     support for refugees and host communities in neighboring \n     countries.\n\n\n                                ENDNOTES\n\n       i.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, today there are hopeful signs that the \ninternational community will act to secure Syria's chemical weapons \nwhich have caused so much pain and so much suffering, including the \nsuffering of little infants and children. A peaceful resolution to the \nAssad regime's use of these lethal, outlawed weapons would certainly be \nthe best outcome. I commend the resolve of President Obama, without \nwhich we wouldn't be looking at a potential diplomatic solution.\n  I wish to lay out for the record why we must act in response to the \nuse of chemical weapons. Of course, I prefer it to be done through the \ninternational community. But I wish to be clear: There are certain \nnorms, there are certain rules, there are certain laws that must be \nrespected and obeyed; otherwise, we lose our humanity, and this is an \nexample.\n  Famous leaders throughout history have called war various things. \nThey have called war a contagion. They have called war hell. They have \ncalled war a scourge, murder, a crime, despicable. But even in the \nchaos and in the darkness of war, there are rules. There are red lines. \nThere are boundaries. There are limits. There are norms and there are \nlaws. That is why in our Nation, as difficult and as painful as it has \nbeen, we have held our servicemembers accountable when they acted \noutside those norms. We did it just last month with the conviction of a \nsoldier for war crimes committed in Afghanistan.\n  The use of chemical weapons is way outside international laws, rules, \nboundaries, limits, and norms, and has been so since the end of World \nWar I, when the world uniformly condemned them. We know--we know \nwithout a shadow of a doubt--that they have been used by Syria in a big \nway, and it is time for all Members of Congress and, frankly, all \nmembers of civilized society to look into our hearts, to look into our \nsouls, and to look into our consciences. The painful way to do it is to \nlook at the shocking acts committed against innocent, men, women, and \nchildren in Syria. Look at those videos, as difficult as it might be, \nof children and their families dying horrible, ghastly deaths, writhing \nin pain, gasping for air, foaming at the mouth as the gas attacks their \nnervous systems.\n  Do we have a conscience? I pray we do. Albert Einstein once said: \n``The world is a dangerous place not because of those who do evil, but \nbecause of those who look on and do nothing.''\n  Let me repeat it. ``The world is a dangerous place not because of \nthose who do evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.''\n  Doing nothing can sometimes be an attractive alternative. I \nunderstand it. But each of us who looks at these videos, who reads \nabout what happened, each of us must ask ourselves, as human beings, as \ncitizens of our great Nation: Can we respond to these atrocities by \ndoing nothing? Can we sit back and do nothing in the face of Syria's \nuse of chemical weapons on its own people, its own children?\n\n[[Page S6313]]\n\n  When the President said he had a red line on this, he wasn't speaking \nfor himself alone; he was speaking for the world that disavowed these \nweapons. I have to say that, to me, the Senate has a red line on this. \nAnyone who voted for the Syria Accountability Act in 2003, be it in the \nHouse or Senate, drew a red line, because in it, we condemned and we \ndecried the development of chemical weapons by the Assad regime, and we \ntied that program to our own national security. There is no way our \nnational security is unaffected when these weapons are used and no one \nis held accountable.\n  Did we mean it when we voted for the Syria Accountability Act? Did we \nmean it when we passed the Chemical Weapons Convention in 1997, which I \nwas proud to vote for. Did we mean it? Words are good, but tyrants do \nnot heed words. History is replete with tyrants who stood in the face \nof the worst condemnation and annihilated people. If we stand by and do \nnothing, what message do we send to those who have these weapons?\n  I mentioned the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention in \n1997, and I will tell my colleagues, as we look at the world--and there \nis a lot to complain about and be ashamed of and worry about--one of \nthe good things is that since we passed the Chemical Weapons Convention \nand ratified it, 80 percent of the chemical weapons of the world have \nbeen destroyed.\n  I think we should listen again to colleagues who spoke during the \nSenate debate on the Chemical Weapons Convention. Here is what Joe \nBiden, our Vice President, said:\n\n       Norms are created so that we have standards for civilized \n     conduct by which to judge others. Without them, we leave the \n     rogue countries to behave as free actors.\n\n  Our own Pat Leahy said:\n\n       We will advise and consent so the President can ratify this \n     treaty. I truly believe we will. It will show the moral \n     leadership that the Senate should show and the United States \n     should show. We will act as the conscience of this Nation, \n     and we will advise and consent to this treaty. We will show \n     the moral leadership because we began this by saying we would \n     act unilaterally, if need be, renouncing our own use of \n     chemical weapons with or without a treaty. That was true \n     leadership.\n\n  So we hear the words ``morality'' and ``conscience'' and \n``leadership.'' These shouldn't be just words. We should show that \ncourage. Here are words from John Warner, our former colleague. He \nsaid:\n\n       I first learned of chemical weapons at the knee of my \n     father who was a surgeon in the trenches in World War I. He \n     described to me in vivid detail how he cared for the helpless \n     victims of that weapon . . . we cannot turn back now from \n     that leadership role.\n\n  Sixteen years later, in this very Chamber where I stood and proudly \ncast my vote for the Chemical Weapons Convention, we are facing a clear \nviolation of law and humanity.\n  How do we react? If we do nothing, what is the signal to Assad? What \nis the signal to Kim Jong Un in North Korea, who has what has been \ndescribed as a massive array of chemical weapons in an area where we \nhave 28,000 American troops keeping the peace. The message we send if \nwe do nothing is not a good one. It will send a message that says we \ndon't mean what we say; We don't stand behind the laws we pass or the \nconventions we ratify. These chemical weapons kill people like \ncockroaches. When we read history, we know these weapons were used on \nthe Iranians by Saddam Hussein and one Iraqi military official called \nthese weapons an ``annihilation insecticide.''\n  That is what they have been called. These weapons cause excruciating \ndeath. That is why a monster such as Hitler chose them to wipe out \nmillions of those he considered subhuman. We all know the history. He \ndidn't use them on troops; he used them on those groups that he \nconsidered subhuman. Yet, while the rest of the world was eliminating \nchemical weapons, Syria was stockpiling precursor chemicals and \nbuilding one of the largest chemical weapons arsenals in the world.\n  A Syrian Foreign Ministry spokesman said in 2012 that Syria reserved \nthe right to use these weapons against external forces. His statement \nalready is a violation of international law. He said: We reserve the \nright to use these weapons against external forces. But he went on to \nsay--and we have his name: ``Any stock of WMD or unconventional weapons \nthat the Syrian Army possesses will never, never be used against the \nSyrian people or civilians during this crisis, under any \ncircumstances.'' Remarkably, Syria violated its own red line.\n  Chris Miller is a U.S. Army veteran and he is an expert in the area \nof chemical and biological weapons. Here is what he wrote in ``The \nGuardian.'' He said we must: ``jealously guard what progress has been \nmade in working toward a more peaceful world.''\n  He added:\n\n       The steady worldwide reduction of chemical weapons is a \n     prime example of that progress--one that we cannot allow to \n     be eroded so easily.\n\n  I can't underscore this enough. In a world full of challenges and \ndisappointments and for people such as the Presiding Officer and me who \nbelieve so much that we can have a peaceful world, this is one of the \nfew areas we can point to--where 80 percent of the world's arsenal of \nchemical weapons has been destroyed. If we turn our back on this tyrant \nand on this use, clearly, the chemical weapons will go right back into \nproduction. They will be marketing chemical weapons, and we know what \nwill happen when they get into certain hands. We should not ignore \nhistory or we are doomed to repeat it.\n  The British soldier and poet Wilfred Owen wrote this in an effort to \ndepict the horrors of chemical warfare in World War I. This is what he \nsaid: ``If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood / Come gargling \nfrom the froth-corrupted lungs.''\n  He saw it firsthand in World War I, where 90,000 troops were killed \nby these heinous weapons, including 6,000 French, British, Canadian, \nand Belgian troops killed by German forces in one battle alone. Nations \nflocked to sign the Geneva Protocol after World War I. Syria joined \nthem, and now more than 1,000 Syrian civilians lay dead due to Assad's \ndecision to bring back these horrors.\n  How will we react?\n  Our former colleague and respected national security leader Dick \nLugar says chemical weapons ``may be the greatest threat to our country \nof any security risk that we have, much more than any other government, \nfor example, or another Nation because they can be used by terrorists, \nby very small groups''--Dick Lugar, who played such a great role in \nsecuring nuclear weapons after the Cold War; Dick Lugar, who \nunderstands what could happen if we turn our back now.\n  I respectfully say to my colleagues: Don't look away. Don't \nrationalize inaction. We cannot stay silent. If we fail to act in the \nface of such a brazen violation of international norms, in the face of \nan assault on conscience, then outlawing these weapons becomes \nmeaningless and we put the security of all of us at risk. If we fail to \nact, we make it more likely that these weapons will be used again in \nSyria and elsewhere. If we fail to act, we send a terrible message to \nbrutal regimes such as North Korea and Iran, which are seeking to \ndevelop nuclear weapons. In the case of North Korea, they have what has \nbeen described by Secretary Hagel as a massive amount of chemical \nweapons. If we fail to act, we make it more likely that these horrific \nweapons could be used against our allies such as Israel and our troops. \nThat is for sure. If we fail to act, we make it more likely that \nchemical weapons will fall into the hands of terrorists and others who \nwould do us harm. If we fail to act, we send a message that the \ncivilized world will permit the use of these ghastly and inhumane \nweapons, not just on the battlefield but against children and families \nsleeping in their beds.\n  I ask my colleagues and the American people, do not look away. It is \neasier to look away.\n  We had a chance to see some of the videos, Madam President, as you \nknow, during our luncheon meeting. We cannot sit by and do nothing in \nthe face of such horror. We cannot.\n  So here is the thing: We have a chance now--because of President \nObama's resolve, because of the resolve of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, because of the resolve of many people inside government and \noutside government, we have the resolve to do something. And the best \nsomething would be an international response.\n  I am proud of our President for making sure this alternative was in \nVladimir Putin's mind when they met. And\n\n[[Page S6314]]\n\nI am glad Secretary Kerry said: Look, there is an alternative. Let them \nhand over their weapons. Let's dismantle them and do it right and \nverify it and hold them accountable, and we get past this. That is the \nroute I believe we all want to see happen. We want to see the world \nstand up against this inhumanity, but let's not be naive about it. When \nyou are dealing with tyrants, you have to enforce that kind of a plan.\n  I am hopeful today but not sanguine. I am hopeful that the United \nNations will take this as an opportunity to stand firm, to say that the \noutlawing of chemical weapons meant something in reality, not just on \npaper. And when we said people should not die like cockroaches, we \nmeant it. So I am hopeful we will have a small pause here and we will \ngive diplomacy a chance to work between the nations, and I praise our \nleadership in the Obama administration and France's leadership and \nBritish leadership. I hope the Russians meant it when they said: Let's \ntry to resolve this in a way that will result in the absolute \ndestruction of the chemical weapons Syria has. I hope they mean it.\n  We cannot walk away from an inhumane act that caused innocent \nchildren to die in unspeakable ways because, I will tell you, if we \nwalk away, then I think the message is that there are no limits on \ngross violations of international norms, there are no limits on gross \nviolations of international laws, and there are no limits on violations \nof human decency.\n  I am very pleased the President took this to the Congress. I think it \nwas right. But I want to be clear: The President, as our Commander in \nChief, has the authority--if he believes there is an imminent threat or \ndanger to us, he has the authority to act. And I think Richard Lugar is \nsending us a very powerful message when he says one of our greatest \nnational security threats--he said even greater than a threat posed by \nany nation--is the possibility that a small terrorist group could get \ntheir hands on these weapons. I will tell you, Madam President, that is \nan unacceptable situation, and I know the President worries about this \nevery day, and every night when he goes to sleep, it is on his mind. \nOne way to make sure the chance of that happening is lessened greatly \nis to make sure one of the largest caches of these weapons is \ncontrolled internationally and then destroyed. That will, in fact, mean \nwe will have a more peaceful world.\n  There is a civil war going on in Syria. No one wants to get in the \nmiddle of it--least of all those of us who voted against the Iraq war \nbecause we saw what would happen. And years and years and years later, \nunfortunately, we were proven right. I was proud to vote no on that \nwar. I think I have a little credibility here for not wanting to go to \nwar, for making sure the intelligence is right, for making sure there \nis a limited mission, for making sure this is well thought out.\n  I would say in closing that the best ending to this crisis is for the \ninternational community to take hold of this--together, all of us--and \nwork to see that these weapons of mass destruction are first accounted \nfor, then controlled, and then destroyed. If we can do that, then the \nhorrifying deaths we have witnessed and we have seen on tape today and \nthe American people have been witnessing--at least there will be \nsomething good that could come out of this because otherwise, if there \nis no action, their deaths will not mean anything, they will be \nforgotten.\n  So we need to keep a credible plan before us, which means we want to \nsee international rules apply, we want to see the international \ncommunity take hold of this and have a good outcome. But I will tell \nyou this--and I believe this with every fiber of my being--such a gross \nviolation of humanity cannot go unanswered.\n  Thank you very much.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that time during \nall the quorum calls be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I wanted to use this opportunity to say \na few words about the issue that is on everybody's minds; that is, \nSyria. I want to tell you that approximately 95 percent of the \nthousands of e-mails and phone calls my office has received are against \nU.S. military intervention in the bloody and chaotic civil war in \nSyria.\n  The truth is the numbers in Vermont may be higher than the national \naverage in terms of opposition to this war. But there is probably no \nState in this country where U.S. military intervention in this bloody \nand complicated civil war in Syria is being supported. It is an \ninteresting phenomenon.\n  We have a very divided Nation politically, but on this issue it \nappears the vast majority of Democrats, Republicans, Independents, the \nvast majority of progressives--I am a progressive--conservatives, \nmoderates, have all come together to express deep concern about the \nUnited States being involved in the third military intervention in the \nMiddle East in 12 years.\n  Let me tell you why I believe the American people feel so strongly \nagainst military involvement in Syria. Clearly, it has much to do with \nthe fact that the United States has already been at war for 12 years. \nThere are kids in this country who are halfway through primary school \nwho have never known an America that has not been at war.\n  What the American people also understand is these wars have been \nenormously costly in many ways. Not only have these wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan cost us the lives of some 4,600 brave American men and \nwomen who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, but as chairman of the \nVeterans Affairs' Committee I can tell you that today we have tens of \nthousands of veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan who are dealing with \ntraumatic brain injury, who are dealing with post-traumatic stress \ndisorder, problems they are going to be carrying with them for the rest \nof their lives.\n  The human cost of those wars has been enormous. But it is not only \nthe human cost, it is the financial cost as well. Today, at a time when \nworking families are struggling to keep their heads above water \neconomically, we are throwing thousands and thousands of little kids \nwho desperately need preschool education off of Head Start. We should \nbe expanding Head Start. But because of sequestration we are throwing \nthem off of Head Start. We are denying nutrition programs, the Meals on \nWheels Programs, that go to some of the most vulnerable and fragile \nseniors in this country. We are throwing them off basic nutrition \nprograms.\n  We are forcing massive cuts through furloughs on tens of thousands of \nFederal employees, including members of the Vermont National Guard. At \nthe end of the day, by the time we take care of the last servicemember \nwho served in Iraq and Afghanistan, those wars will have cost us at \nleast $3 trillion.\n  But it is not only the human cost of those wars that troubles the \nAmerican people. It is not only the financial cost of these wars that \ntroubles the American people. It is the deep sense that exists across \nthe political spectrum that foreign policy and going to war are a lot \nmore complicated and unpredictable and have unintended consequences, \nfar more so than many of our leaders in past years have believed.\n  Afghanistan is a small country that in 2001 virtually had no army \nwhen the United States invaded it; no army against the most powerful \nmilitary force in the history of the world.\n  What is the problem? Twelve years later we are still in Afghanistan. \nAll of us remember President George W. Bush standing on an aircraft \ncarrier telling us that in Iraq the mission was accomplished. Mission \naccomplished.\n  Well, it didn't turn out quite that way. Thousands of deaths later \nfor\n\n[[Page S6315]]\n\nAmerican servicemembers, tens of thousands of deaths later for the \npeople of Iraq, peace and democracy in that country has not yet been \naccomplished. It is a lot more complicated than people thought it would \nbe.\n  Today people worry what are the long-term implications and what are \nthe unforeseen consequences of the United States being involved in a \nhorrendous, bloody, and complicated war in Syria. All of us know Asad \nis a ruthless dictator who has exploited his people terribly and used \nchemical weapons against them. But not every American knows that some \n20 to 25 percent of the opposition to Asad turns out to be Islamic \nfundamentalists, some of them affiliated with Al Qaeda.\n  What are the long-term implications and unintended consequences of \nbeing involved in a war in that area? I know the President has been \nvery clear about saying he is talking about strikes that are very \ntargeted, very minimal. But once you break the egg, once you get \ninvolved, we have to bear and will bear a certain amount of \nresponsibility for what happens during the war and even after the war \nif Asad is overthrown.\n  This is why the American people are extremely concerned about the \nUnited States unilaterally going into Syria without the support of the \ninternational community and without the support of the United Nations.\n  Having said all of that, in my mind there is another reason, a deeper \nreason, as to why there is so much opposition to the President's \nproposal and the proposal that came out of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, which was more open-ended and spoke about regime change. \nThat has everything to do with the fact that the favorability rating of \nthe Congress is today somewhere between 8 and 15 percent.\n  The vast majority of the American people don't know. They don't care \nwho controls the Senate, whether it is the Democrats. They don't know \nwho controls the House, the Republicans. By and large, the American \npeople have given up believing that the Congress and the White House \nare listening to their needs, which are very serious at this moment, or \nare interested or capable of responding to their needs.\n  What the American people are saying, and they are saying it very \nloudly, is we have a Congress and a White House which continues to \nignore the enormous crises facing the middle class and working families \nof our country. What they are saying is: Yes, Mr. President, we agree \nwith you, what Asad is doing in Syria is unspeakable; that he is \ngassing his own kids is beyond belief. We understand that. We want the \ninternational community to address that.\n  But what they are also saying is: Mr. President, Members of Congress, \nthink about our children, the kids in West Virginia, the kids in \nCalifornia, the kids in Detroit, the kids in Vermont. What about our \nkids? What kind of future are they going to have in an economy in which \nthe middle class continues to disappear and poverty remains at an \nalmost all-time high for the last 60 years?\n  Today real unemployment in this country is not 7.4 percent, the \nofficial unemployment rate. Real unemployment is close to 14 percent.\n  Youth unemployment is a tragedy. Kids are graduating high school, \ngoing out and looking for jobs, and they want to get a sense of \nindependence. There are no jobs for them. Youth unemployment in this \ncountry is close to 20 percent.\n  For minorities, the number is considerably higher. Black youth \nunemployment in this country is close to 40 percent. Parents are \nworried that their kids are graduating from high school and there are \nno jobs available to them.\n  Before I came to Washington the other day, I talked to a physician in \nthe State of Vermont who said: Bernie, do you know what. In Vermont, \nbeautiful Vermont, rural Vermont, we are facing a heroin epidemic. Kids \nare shooting up heroin in Vermont, not to mention the rest of the \ncountry, because they don't see much of a future facing them.\n  Parents are worried that their kids are graduating college, often \ndeeply in debt, and that either they can't find a job or the jobs they \ndo obtain often do not require a college degree. The fact is most of \nthe new jobs being created in this country are part-time jobs with \nminimal benefits, and they are often low-wage jobs.\n  What the Department of Labor is telling us is that, in fact, most of \nthe new jobs we see coming down the pike for our kids do not require a \ncollege degree. They are low-wage jobs.\n  The people are saying from one end of this country, yes, we are \nconcerned about Syria, but we are also concerned about Los Angeles, \nDetroit, and St. Johnsbury, VT. Please, Mr. President, create jobs for \nthe working families of this country. What they are begging the \nCongress to do is to address the needs our people face.\n  What they understand, and I think this has a lot to do with why there \nis so much opposition to getting involved in this war in Syria, is that \nthe Congress has virtually done nothing to improve the economy for \nworking families, and they worry very much that if all of our time, \nenergy, and resources are devoted to Syria, we are never going to \naddress the serious problems facing the working families of this \ncountry.\n  Tens of millions of our fellow Americans today are working longer \nhours for lower wages, and many of them are earning wages that are \nsimply too low to support a family. We have been happy to hear in \nMichigan, for example, the automobile industry is doing better; more \npeople are being hired. That is the good news.\n  Do you know what the bad news is. The new jobs in the automobile \nindustry are barely more than 50 percent in pay of what the old jobs \nwere. All over this country the new jobs that are being created are not \npaying what the jobs in this country used to pay. We have millions of \npeople working for a disgracefully low minimum wage of $7.25 an hour.\n  People are saying: Mr. President, Members of Congress, yes, we are \nworried about Syria, but why don't you work to make sure every person \nwho has a job in this country can earn a wage which enables him or her \nto take care of their family?\n  The media doesn't pay a lot of attention to it, Congress doesn't pay \na lot of attention, but the American people also understand it is not \nonly high unemployment and low wages, something else is going on in \nthis country. They know that while the middle class is disappearing and \n46 million Americans are living in poverty, they understand the people \non top today, the people whose lobbyists surround this institution, the \npeople who make huge campaign contributions to the political parties, \nare doing very well. They are doing extraordinarily well. Corporate \nprofits are at an all-time high. The people on Wall Street, whose \ngreed, recklessness, and illegal behavior caused the worst economic \ndownturn since the Great Depression, well, guess what. They are doing \nphenomenally well. They are making record-breaking profits. The rich \nare doing well and corporate America is doing well. They are making all \nkinds of campaign contributions.\n\n  The American people are looking around and saying, What are you doing \nfor us? What are you doing to protect the seniors and their Social \nSecurity? What are you doing to protect the children of this country, \nto make sure they get a decent education? What are you doing to make \nsure the United States joins the rest of the industrialized world so \nall of our people have health care as a right?\n  One of the reasons I think there is so much lack of support for this \nwar is the American people feel it is high time for us to pay attention \nto their needs.\n  We have recently heard, and the news is being updated almost \nmomentarily, that Russia, for whatever reasons, has decided finally to \nplay a positive role in this crisis. They are urging Syria to allow the \ninternational community to take possession of their chemical weapons. \nWe believe that France right now is prepared to go to the Security \nCouncil with a resolution similar to what the Russians are talking \nabout.\n  I can't tell you how honest the Russians are being in this effort, \nwhat their ulterior plans may be. But I think now is the opportunity to \nwork with Russia, to work with China, to work with the Security Council \nand the United Nations. It would be an extraordinary victory, in my \nview, for the people of Syria, who are going through horror after \nhorror right now,\n\n[[Page S6316]]\n\nfor the entire world, and for the future of the world, if we could take \nthose terrible chemical weapons out of Asad's hands and destroy them. I \nwould hope very much the President and our Secretary of State will be \nworking with the international community to make that happen.\n  Let me conclude. I think we are in a very interesting and, in fact, \nmomentous moment in the history of the United States of America. The \npeople are coming together to say we have enormous crises in our own \ncountry and if we don't get our act together, we are going to see the \ndecline of a once-great Nation. We are going to see, for the first time \nin the modern history of our country, our children having a lower \nstandard of living than we do.\n  I would hope the lesson we learned of this entire episode is the \nAmerican people do not want us unilaterally getting involved in another \nwar in the Middle East. I would hope also the lesson we learned is the \nAmerican people are saying very loudly and clearly this country faces \nenormous crises: economically, global warming, health care, education, \nincome and wealth inequality, and they want us to start addressing \nthose needs. I hope that out of this very difficult moment the silver \nlining is we learn something from what the American people want and we \nbegin to do what they say.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about \nthe very serious vote before us--the vote to authorize force against \nSyria. Let's be clear: This is a vote to authorize an act of war. The \nAmerican people are watching. They know what this is--a dilemma with no \neasy answers. They know it could spiral out of control. It has happened \nbefore and it could happen again.\n  The use of chemical weapons is an outrage. What happened in Syria was \ndespicable. The horror is clear. The world cannot look away. This crime \nis a crime against humanity. It demands an international response--\nstrong and unequivocal. On this we can all agree. However, what should \nthat response be?\n  The President has presented a plan for military strikes on the Syrian \nregime--an attack that has been presented to the American people as \nlimited in scope but with very great consequences. So we are confronted \nwith urgent appeals to strike, but I believe there are strong reasons \nnot to do so.\n  First, we should pursue all diplomatic and economic options to \npressure both Asad and his backers to change course. We have not yet \ndone that to the fullest extent.\n  We all know the Russian Government is aiding and abetting the \ncriminal regime in Syria, supplying military support, providing \ndiplomatic cover, and preventing an international response to this \natrocity. The world is rightly outraged. That outrage should be loud \nand clear, and the full force of international condemnation must be \nexerted, not just against Asad.\n  As of this week there are signs Russia may be getting the message. If \ntheir proposal to help secure Syria's chemical weapons is sincere, then \nwe should welcome this opportunity. We should work with the \ninternational community to make this a reality. The inability to use \nchemical weapons in this conflict will restore the international norm \nwe seek to uphold and prevent a recurrence of the horrors we have seen.\n  If Russia aims to be a responsible world power and not a rogue \nnation, they will seek solutions, not obstruction. They are a signatory \nto the Chemical Weapons Convention. Let's hold their feet to the fire \nto do what is right. The President's mandate is stronger with \ncongressional approval, and the mandate of the United States is \nstronger with international support. I would urge Ambassador Power and \nSecretary Kerry to keep up the pressure on Russia. Make the forceful \ncase to the Security Council. Continue to share the evidence with the \npeople of the world.\n  This situation will not be solved with Tomahawk cruise missiles fired \ninto Syria. It will require a concerted international effort to push \nAsad and the various rebels to pursue a political solution. For us to \ngo it alone, to take unilateral action, will put us on shaky ground \nlegally and strategically.\n  Second, the proposal to use military force could embroil the United \nStates in a complex Middle Eastern civil war. There is a cancer in \nSyria, from Asad to Al Qaeda. The civil war is a twilight zone \ncomprised of multiple players internationally, regionally, and within \nSyria. Many of the rebels do not share our values. Some--we don't know \nhow many--are enemies of the United States and our allies. Many of \nthese rebel groups have also committed terrible atrocities. Tilting the \nbalance too far in their favor is not in our Nation's interest and will \nnot leave Syria safer for innocent civilians.\n  These strikes have been presented as limited and targeted, but last \nweek there were reports about expanding military targets, of regime \nchange. Even the resolution we are considering today includes veiled \nlanguage--the language that could make it the policy of the United \nStates to tilt the momentum in the civil war and endorse the policy of \narming the Syrian rebels--a policy I and others believe is very \ndangerous--about whom we know too little.\n  Third, there is a real risk that even limited U.S. military \ninvolvement may make Asad feel more desperate, putting our allies--\nIsrael, Turkey, and Jordan--at risk of attack. This could spark a \nregional war, creating a situation on the ground where Asad may be \nmore, not less, inclined to use chemical weapons.\n  As with so many elements here, the question occurs, what then? Here \nis the reality. There is no simple solution, and the American people \nknow this. I understand there is a natural instinct to want to \nretaliate, to strike out. No one can forget the horrific images, the \nterrible suffering of the victims. But we need a clear strategy that \nwill not mire the United States in a bloody and uncertain civil war. I \nremain unconvinced that we have such a strategy in place.\n\n  The Iraq war, which I voted against, began as an international effort \nto kick Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. There followed years of a no-fly \nzone and airstrikes to prevent Saddam from threatening his neighbors or \nreconstituting his arsenal of chemical weapons. As we all know, these \nlimited military actions led to one of the biggest blunders in U.S. \nhistory.\n  Americans are understandably skeptical after the fiasco of Iraq. They \nwant to know if we are going down the same path in Syria, into a civil \nwar that is more complex and potentially damaging to the United States \nand its interests. Limited attack or broader, there is no easy way out \nof the quicksand. Have we not learned at least that after 12 years of \nwar?\n  I have listened to the administration's arguments closely, as well as \nthe opinions of New Mexicans. The American people do not believe a \nlimited strike will deter Asad; they fear this strike will just lead us \nfurther toward direct involvement. They rightly ask, for what purpose \nand to what end? Public officials should not always let polls be their \nguide before making important decisions for our country, but I agree \nwith the majority of Americans and New Mexicans--we must exhaust our \npolitical, diplomatic, and economic options first. This is not a lack \nof resolve. America has the greatest military on Earth. No one should \ndoubt that we will defend our interests and our allies. But a military \nstrike in Syria is the wrong response in the wrong place at the wrong \ntime.\n  I come to the floor not to push my colleagues one way or another. \nEach of us must make up his or her own mind. I come here simply to \nexplain my reasons for voting no on this authorization for the use of \nmilitary force in Syria.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S6317]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, make no mistake about it, the resolution \nbefore us, in my judgment, is one of the most difficult decisions a \nMember of the Senate will ever have to make. The authorization of force \nis an awesome responsibility that each of us has. None of us wants to \nsee American troops in harm's way. None of us wants to see the need for \nthe use of military force. This is a difficult judgment for us to make.\n  The Constitution envisions that both the President and Congress are \ninvolved in the deploying of U.S. military. Certainly the President, as \nCommander in Chief, and the Congress, under the War Powers Act, have a \nresponsibility to authorize the use of force. Today in this country \nAmericans are tired of war. We have been involved in Iraq and \nAfghanistan for way too long. We thought these campaigns would be short \ncampaigns. They turned out to be very long. There has been a tremendous \nloss in human life and fiscal resources as a result of the wars in \nwhich the United States has participated. But the public also \nunderstands that we have a responsibility to use our military to \nprotect the national interests of the people of this country. They \nunderstand that America's military strength keeps the people in this \ncountry safe, and they expect that the President and the Congress will \nuse that military force in order to protect the national security of \nthe people of this country.\n  What is in our national security interest and why would the President \ncome to Congress asking us to consider the use of military force in the \ncurrent circumstances in Syria? People understand, they recognize that \nif we are about to be attacked, there is a need to use force.\n  The United States plays a unique role in the international community, \nfor we understand that standing up for basic internationally recognized \nhuman rights is a responsibility we all have. I supported President \nClinton when he asked for the authorization of force for the United \nStates, along with the international community, to be involved in \nrestoring order in the republics of the former Yugoslavia, where there \nwas ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and Kosovo. But for the leadership of \nthe United States additional communities would have been destroyed and \npeople would have lost their lives. We stood up because it was in the \ninterests of the United States to stand up for the enforcement of basic \ninternationally established human rights.\n  Let's evaluate what is happening in Syria today and understand that \nalthough what is happening there may be far from our shores, the impact \nvery much could be felt here in the United States. I serve on the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee. We were called back into session \nlast week because of the President's request for the Congress to act on \nhis request for the use of force. We held hearings that were open to \nthe public, and we held classified hearings in order to better \nunderstand what had happened in Syria.\n\n  I think it is now clear beyond any doubt that the Asad regime in \nSyria used chemical weapons. The evidence is clear. It was not the \nfirst occasion they used chemical weapons. They had used chemical \nweapons in the past but not to the magnitude they did on August 21 of \nthis year which resulted in more than 1,400 deaths, many of whom were \nchildren. The videos of that image are now available publicly. People \ncan see the horrific act that was imposed upon the people of Syria by \nits President, President Asad.\n  The action of Syria on August 21 violated international norm. Since \nchemical weapons were used in World War I, the international community \nhas come together and said: Even in war we will not permit the use of \nchemical weapons. It is so horrific, so indiscriminate in its killing \nand in its maiming that as an international community we will stand and \nsay: No, you cannot use chemical weapons.\n  The evidence is clear that President Asad of Syria used chemical \nweapons in a mass way and killed over 1,400 people. That action \nrequires the response of the international community, for if it goes \nunchallenged it is more likely President Asad will continue to use \nchemical weapons. He just considers it one of the weapons in his \ntoolbox, and he will call it out more and more if it goes unchallenged \nby the international community.\n  The people of Syria are not the only ones at risk. These chemical \nweapons could easily be used against American allies in that region. It \ncould be used against Turkey. It could be used against Jordan. It could \nbe used against Israel.\n  If the use of weapons of mass destruction in Syria goes unchallenged \nand if President Asad can get away with the use of chemical weapons, \nwhat message does that send to the regime in Iran and its ambition to \nbecome a nuclear weapons state and perhaps use nuclear weapons? What \nmessage does it send to the Government of North Korea, which is openly \ntesting the use of nuclear weapons?\n  We have a direct interest in preventing the use of weapons of mass \ndestruction, and we have to work with the international community to \nsay this will not go unchallenged. We not only have a moral \nimperative--and we do have a moral imperative--but we also have an \nissue of our national security interest. If these weapons of mass \ndestruction get in the hands of terrorist organizations and groups, it \nthreatens the security of Americans and it threatens the security of \nour allies. We have a responsibility to protect the national security \nof the people of this country.\n  I have engaged many people in Maryland who have talked to me about \ntheir concerns about the use of the American military in Syria. They \nrecall what happened when the Congress authorized the use of force in \nIraq where there was evidence of chemical weapons, and then we went in \nand found no chemical weapons. There were statements made about how \nthis would be a limited operation. Our troops were there for a decade. \nSo there is obviously concern about the information being made \navailable to us and what is being asked of the Congress of the United \nStates.\n  When force was authorized against Iraq and that resolution was \npending on the floor, I served in the other body, in the House of \nRepresentatives. I had a chance to see firsthand the information about \nIraq and its risk factors to the interest of the United States. Some \nmay recall that the popular sentiment was for America to authorize the \nuse of force--for Congress to authorize the use of force. I voted no on \nthat resolution because I was convinced America did not have a national \nsecurity interest to use military force. So I will explain the \ndifference between the circumstances in Iraq over a decade ago and what \nwe are facing today in Syria.\n  The original justification for the United States entering its combat \ntroops in Iraq was that Iraq was deeply involved with the then-\ngovernment of Afghanistan and the attack on our country on September \n11. I looked for that information, and I saw no information between the \nIraqi Government and the attack on our government. Yet those statements \nwere made and it was used as justification for the use of military \nforce.\n  Here the justification is the use by Syria of chemical weapons, and \nthat has been established. I believe the international community has \nnow understood the evidence is clear that the Asad regime used chemical \nweapons in contravention to international norm.\n  When we were authorizing the Iraq use of force, there were no \nrestrictions on the U.S. military. As everyone knows, we used ground \ntroops. We used hundreds of thousands of ground troops in our campaign \nin Iraq. American lives were put directly at risk, and it put America \ndirectly in harm's way.\n  The request made by the President of the United States for military \naction in Syria does not include--and, in fact, the resolution that has \ncome out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee makes it clear that \nthere will be no ground combat troops from the United States of \nAmerica. We will not be drawn into a ground war.\n  The Iraqi resolution that was approved over a decade ago had no time \nlimit on that authorization. As we saw with that authorization and with \nthe Afghanistan authorization, those campaigns went for over a decade, \nwith American troops at risk.\n  The authorization that has come out of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee contains a 60-day limitation on the authorization of the use \nof force. It can be extended once for an additional\n\n[[Page S6318]]\n\n30 days. This is a limited campaign. It is very clear this \nauthorization is restricted to the specific objective to degrade and \ndeter the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime and to prevent \nthe transfer of chemical weapons to terrorist organizations.\n  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee recommended resolution is \nlimited. It is limited to that mission. It is limited in the type of \nmilitary operation--no ground troops. It is limited in time and is not \nto exceed 60 to 90 days. It is limited to the fact that use of force \nshould be the last option--not the first but the last option.\n  I have said many times on the floor of the House, and now on the \nfloor of the Senate, that the use of military should be the last \nresort. There are other options that need to be explored first. So the \nresolution that has come out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nrequires the President to pursue diplomatic ways to resolve the issue \nbefore he can use force. He must certify to Congress that he has done \nthat before he can use force.\n\n  Mr. President, you understand this directly because you raised some \nof these issues. We now have an opportunity that we hope will work. We \nnow have the attention of Russia and Syria since they know America is \nserious about reacting to Syria's use of chemical weapons. They know we \nwill not stand by.\n  They have now acknowledged that chemical weapons in great numbers \nexist in Syria. And, quite frankly, I think they have acknowledged the \nuse of chemical weapons in Syria. Of course, the videos speak for \nthemselves and the physical evidence is overwhelming.\n  Now the suggestion is they will turn over those chemical weapons to \nthe international community. If that is done, we have achieved our \nobjective in the resolution that is before us. The resolution before us \nis to degrade and deter the use of chemical weapons by Syria. If they \nturn their chemical weapons over to the international community, we \nhave achieved our objective. However, any such plan must be verifiable, \nenforceable, and timely.\n  Excuse me if I seem a little bit suspicious of the suggestions made \nby Russia and Syria. I want to make sure they are verifiable, they are \nenforceable, and that they are timely. We anticipated a diplomatic \neffort when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee recommended this \nresolution to the floor of the Senate.\n  There are many Members of the Senate, including the Presiding \nOfficer, who are looking at ways we can come together to support the \nPresident's effort to stand up against the use of chemical weapons. I \nhope we will be able to come together with language in this resolution \nthat will allow the Syrian Government to turn over its chemical weapons \nin a timely and enforceable way so military force will not be \nnecessary.\n  Make no mistake about it, but for the leadership of President Obama \nand their fear of the use of American military force, we would never be \nat this opportunity right now where we have a viable diplomatic channel \nwe can pursue. I wanted to acknowledge that we anticipated diplomacy \nwould be used, as it always should be, before the use of our military. \nWe hope our military will not be necessary, but we have to react to the \nuse of chemical weapons.\n  Let me explain some of what we don't want to see happen. Earlier I \nreferenced the hearings we had in the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee. I congratulate Senator Menendez and Senator Corker, the \nchairman and ranking Republican on our committee. We had a very open \nhearing, we had access to classified information, and then we had an \nopen discussion in our committee where all views were heard.\n  We tried to recommend a resolution we thought was responsible for the \nCongress to weigh in on. It was not the resolution the President \nsubmitted to us. It was one that was much more limited to the \nauthorization we thought was appropriate. I think it has served its \npurpose from the point of view of putting Syria on notice that the \nUnited States is prepared to join the international community to say: \nChemical weapons will not be allowed to be used. We also made it clear \nwe will not be drawn into a civil war.\n  President Asad has done some horrible things in that country. In my \nview, he has lost the legitimacy of leading the country, but it is up \nto the Syrians to solve their civil conflict. American troops will not \nbe drawn into the civil problems within Syria itself. They are going to \nhave to resolve that issue.\n  As the United States has said, and as the international community has \nsaid, there needs to be a political solution to the future of Syria. \nYes, there are some good people in the opposition and there are some \npeople we are concerned about in the opposition. At the end of the day, \nit is up to the Syrians, through a political process, to determine \ntheir own government. What we should expect is a government that will \nrespect the human rights of all the people of Syria and will respect \nthe right of Syrians to determine who their leader should be. All \nethnic communities should be able to live in peace in Syria, and that \nis our objective, to get to that political solution. We will not be \ndrawn into a broader conflict.\n  As I said earlier, the people I have talked to in Maryland don't want \nwar. The people I have talked to in this Nation do not want the United \nStates drawn into another war, and neither do I.\n  One more point about the response to the use of chemical \nweapons. Yes, our first priority is to make sure these chemical weapons \naren't used again. The best way to do that is to get control of the \nweapons and make sure they are not used and, hopefully, destroyed.\n\n  President Asad needs to be held accountable. He has committed war \ncrimes. He has committed crimes against humanity. He needs to be held \naccountable for the criminal actions he has perpetrated on the people \nof Syria. As we know, over 100,000 have lost their lives, many of whom \nwere civilians who were put in harm's way by the Syrian Government \nagainst international norms. I encourage my colleagues to join me in \nthe effort of calling on an international tribunal to take President \nAsad, in this case, and establish the international justice so that he \nis held accountable for his actions.\n  One last point about the resolution before us. It is important to \nwork with the international community. I hope we will find more \ncountries standing up for the importance of international participation \nregarding condemning the use of chemical weapons. One of the hopes we \nhave in this new opportunity for a diplomatic solution is for the \nUnited Nations to assume its appropriate role. The United Nations \nSecurity Council will have an opportunity as early as today to pass an \nenforceable resolution condemning what happened in Syria and accepting \nthe offer to take control of all of its chemical weapons and do it in a \nway that is enforceable and in a way that accomplishes its goal. I hope \nthe United Nations Security Council will act. I hope the international \ncommunity will join us. United States leadership is needed, and \nPresident Obama is providing it. But the key point is we must respond \nto the use of chemical weapons.\n  I think this debate is strengthening our country. I understand there \nare different views. I urge my colleagues to come together to support a \nresolution that puts America on record supporting President Obama in \nsaying we will not permit the use of chemical weapons to go \nunchallenged, that our objective is to make sure the world is safer, \nand we are prepared to work with the international community in order \nto achieve those objectives.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the time until \n7 p.m. be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or \ntheir designees, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 \nminutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a \ncolloquy with my dear friend Senator\n\n[[Page S6319]]\n\nHeitkamp of North Dakota so we can talk about the serious situation we \nhave before us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Manchin and Ms. Heitkamp pertaining to the \nintroduction of S.J. Res. 22 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I thank the Senator and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Madam President, I come to speak to the important debate \nwe are having about the most sobering issue I face as a Senator, as a \nWisconsinite, and as an American--the issue of military action by the \nUnited States.\n  Let me start by saying that the Asad regime's use of chemical weapons \nagainst the Syrian people is morally reprehensible and a serious \nviolation of longstanding international law. The various treaties and \nconventions addressing these issues have been ratified by most of the \nworld's nations. There is a reason why almost the entire world has \ngathered under the Chemical Weapons Convention to ban these weapons. It \nis because chemical weapons are truly barbaric in nature. They are a \nglobal threat, and they therefore require a global response.\n  The President has made the right choice to seek congressional \nauthorization for any potential military action in Syria. The gravity \nof these issues before us is significant and they deserve a full \ndebate. President Obama should be praised for understanding and \nappreciating that fact. We must demand that all Presidents--not just \nthis President--come to Congress to get approval before taking military \naction in another country in instances where we are not facing an \nimminent threat. I have made that case with both Democratic and \nRepublican Presidents.\n  I strongly believe our response to this situation must not be a \nunilateral military action. This is not America's responsibility alone, \nand it is not in our interest to set the precedent that it is our \nresponsibility alone.\n  Syria violated international laws and should be held accountable by \nthe international community. America must not act alone. The use of \nchemical weapons is a global atrocity that demands a global response, \nand that is why I oppose going to war in Syria and I oppose authorizing \nmilitary involvement in Syria's civil war--not for 1 day, not for 60 \ndays, not for a decade. I do not believe we should involve ourselves \nmilitarily in the middle of a brutal years-long civil war. That would \nnot strengthen America's national security. But the answer is not to do \nnothing. The answer, rather, is to create a situation where these \nviolations of humanitarian norms and crimes against humanity can be \ndealt with effectively by the U.N. and other international \ninstitutions.\n  We must continue to focus on building a global coalition to support \nthe encouraging developments in the past few days and to resolve this \ncrisis without the use of unilateral military engagement in Syria. By \nworking through the United Nations and its institutions, we strengthen \ninternational frameworks that can help resolve the conflict in Syria \nand build a safer and stronger international community moving forward.\n  I firmly believe that the recent potential for progress in today's \nU.N. discussions is a testament to American democracy. By President \nObama fulfilling his constitutional duties to come to Congress and by \nour serious debate here on Capitol Hill, I believe America has helped \ndrive a more constructive international debate and engagement on Asad's \nregime's atrocities. We must now give the opportunity of a path forward \nwithout military involvement in Syria a chance to succeed.\n  Madam President, I yield back my time and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, we are back from the August recess, \nand I am here now for the 42nd time to try to awaken this body to the \nthreat of climate change. Today I have come to talk about some of what \nwent on during the recess while we were away in my home State of Rhode \nIsland and around the globe.\n  Here is some of what happened in Rhode Island.\n  On August 14, Nancy Sutley, Chair of the White House Council on \nEnvironmental Quality, joined me in Rhode Island to deliver a clear \nmessage. As she said: ``Climate change poses a very real threat to \npublic health, both now and in the future.''\n  Warmer temperatures in the Northeast mean harmful ozone can form very \nquickly. That leads to the bad air days we hear about on the news, when \nchildren with asthma and other vulnerable citizens are urged to stay \nindoors, often on what appear to be beautiful, sunny, summer days. \nNancy Sutley and I heard from Nick Friend, a 15-year-old from East \nProvidence, and Kenyatta Richards, an 8-year-old from Warwick, about \nthe six Rhode Island bad air days we have had already this year that \nthreatened Nick's and Kenyatta's health, and thousands more children.\n  In Narragansett, a lovely Rhode Island beach town, I visited two \nsites that sustained significant damage during Hurricane Sandy to see \nhow that town is using recovery aid to repair roads and public housing. \nPeople in Narragansett realize rebuilding is not enough; that we need \nto start adapting for future storms.\n  The oceans are warming, undeniably, and as they warm they expand. So \nsea levels rise, leading to more erosion and flooding. Tide gauges in \nNewport show an average sea level increase of nearly 10 inches since \n1930. So storm surges such as the damaging surge last year from \nHurricane Sandy will batter our shores further inland, and we have to \nadapt to that.\n  In Westerly, RI, town officials and the University of Rhode Island's \nCoastal Resources Center held an informational meeting about the \neffects of sea level rise on the town's coastal wetlands, planning for \n1, 3, and 5 feet of coastal sea level rise, so Westerly can create a \ncommunitywide adaptation plan.\n  Cranston, RI, was hit hard by the floods of 2010. In August, during \nthis recess, demolition crews began tearing down homes in a \nneighborhood near the Pawtuxet River to buffer the surrounding homes to \nprotect against future flooding. Cranston also announced a series of \nclimate change workshops to increase awareness about the threats facing \ncity residents and to help them plan ahead. So that is some of what \nhappened in Rhode Island.\n  Nationally, in August the Rim Fire burned in California near Yosemite \nNational Park, the third largest wildfire on record in California. No \none can say climate change caused this fire. Wildfires have been \nhappening forever. But hotter, drier years make for worse wildfire \nseasons. Spring and summer temperatures are edging up, snow is melting \nearlier, wildfire season is lengthening, and the intensity of the \nwildfire season is increasing, as State and Federal fire and forest \nmanagers forewarned our bicameral task force in a hearing just before \nthe recess.\n  During August, nearly all of New Mexico experienced drought, with the \nmajority of that State in severe, extreme or exceptional drought. In \nlate August, the Bureau of Reclamation announced the first reduction of \noutflows from Lake Powell since the reservoir was filled in the early \n1960s. Tens of millions of people who rely on the Colorado River for \nwater will be affected.\n  Reports are that a late August heat wave in the Midwest caused school \nclosures in Minnesota, and students were released early from schools in \nColorado, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota. \nAgain, it is the loaded dice phenomenon. We can't\n\n[[Page S6320]]\n\nassign specific blame for this heat wave to climate change, but on a \nplanet with hotter summers, we can expect worse and more frequent heat \nwaves. So that is nationally.\n  Globally, NOAA announced that July 2013 was the sixth warmest July on \nrecord.\n  I was traveling in Asia during the recess with Senator John McCain \nimmediately following record-setting heat. In mid-August temperatures \npassed 105 degrees Fahrenheit in Shanghai, China, the hottest \ntemperature measured in the city since records began to be kept about \n140 years ago. The temperature in Shimanto, Japan, hit 105 degrees \nFahrenheit, the hottest ever recorded in that Nation.\n  South Korea's President Park talked with us about climate change and \nits importance in Northeast Asia. While we were there in South Korea, \nthe Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy had warned of power \nshortages due to high temperatures, and we met with public officials in \nrooms with air-conditioners shut off to save power.\n  Senator McCain and I heard from China's leading climate official, \nVice Chairman Xie, about China's plan to invest almost $475 billion on \nclean energy and emissions-reducing projects through 2015--nearly $500 \nbillion between now and 2015 and about seven regional cap-and-trade \nprograms that will eventually include other large cities such as \nShanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin. For my colleagues who say China must \nact first on climate change: They are acting, and we should not look to \nthem for an excuse to delay action here at home.\n  Indeed, a report recently by the Pew Charitable Trusts described \nChina as--let me quote this--China: ``The epicenter of clean energy \nfinance, attracting $65.1 billion in investment . . . it garnered 25 \npercent of all solar energy investment . . . 37 percent of all wind \nenergy investment . . . and 47 percent of the investment in the `other \nrenewable energy category.' ''\n  That is what the Pew Report said about China.\n  The report compared that to the ``disappointing U.S. performance in \nthe worldwide race for clean energy jobs, manufacturing, and market \nshare.'' That is not a race we want to lose. Yet we are exhibiting \ndisappointing performance against China.\n  August was also a month for the usual climate denial. One of our \nSenate colleagues reportedly self-declared that he was a global warming \ndenier and said he believes evidence points to the Earth entering a \nmini ice age.\n  One California Representative told constituents: ``Just so you know, \nglobal warming is a total fraud.''\n  A conservative Representative from Iowa told his constituents:\n\n       [Climate change] is not science. It's more of a religion \n     than science.\n\n  A Representative from Florida said: ``Our climate will continue to \nchange because of the way God formed the Earth.''\n  August even brought a climate denier opinion piece to my home State \n``Providence Journal:'' ``Climate science is in turmoil,'' the piece \nsaid, ``because global surface temperatures have been flat for 16 \nyears.''\n  Rhode Island's PolitiFact unit quickly determined that this claim \n``cherry-picked numbers and leaves out important details that would \ngive a very different impression.''\n  In truth, there have been steps in the upward march of global surface \ntemperature before. My skeptical colleagues should read about these \nsteps and what may cause them in mainstream news outlets, which explain \nthat while these pauses do happen, they have not and do not herald the \nend of climate change. Setting aside surface temperature for a moment, \nwe continue to see warming, rising, and acidifying oceans.\n  The recess brought the latest issue, for instance, of ``National \nGeographic,'' whose cover story is ``Rising Seas.'' Let me read two \nexcerpts:\n\n       A profoundly altered planet is what our fossil-fuel-driven \n     civilization is creating, a planet where Sandy-scale flooding \n     will become more common and more destructive for the world's \n     coastal cities. By releasing carbon dioxide and other heat-\n     trapping gases into the atmosphere, we have warmed the Earth \n     by more than a full degree Fahrenheit over the past century \n     and raised sea level by about eight inches. Even if we \n     stopped burning all fossil fuels tomorrow, the existing \n     greenhouse gases would continue to warm the Earth for \n     centuries. We have irreversibly committed future generations \n     to a hotter world and rising seas.\n\n  Here, focusing on a specific location:\n\n       Among the most vulnerable cities is Miami. I cannot \n     envision southeastern Florida having many people at the end \n     of this century, says Hal Wanless, chairman of the department \n     of geological sciences at the University of Miami. We're \n     sitting in his basement office, looking at maps of Florida on \n     his computer. At each click of the mouse, the years pass, the \n     ocean rises, and the peninsula shrinks. Freshwater wetlands \n     and mangrove swamps collapse--a death spiral that has already \n     started on the southern tip of the peninsula. With seas four \n     feet higher than they are today--a distinct possibility by \n     2100--about two-thirds of southeastern Florida is inundated. \n     The Florida Keys have almost vanished. Miami is an island.\n\n  That is from that extremist publication National Geographic.\n  August also brought news that the IPCC will announce that it is now \nmore certain than ever that human activity is the main cause of recent \nclimate change. Let me be very clear about this: There is a broad and \nstrong scientific consensus that climate change is ongoing and that \nhuman actions are a cause. It is a consensus of a breadth and strength \nthat it is disgraceful and stupid for us to ignore it. That consensus \nshould come as no surprise because the science behind it--behind the \nproposition that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere warms the Earth--\ndates back to the Civil War. It ain't news. We have known it for more \nthan a century. Even the contrarian scientists brought in by the \ndeniers to testify in Congress agree that carbon dioxide is a \ngreenhouse gas that warms the Earth.\n  The science is credible. The danger is credible. Now it is about time \nfor Congress to become credible. It is time to wake up. It is time to \ndo our duty here in Congress to our country and to our fellow man. It \nis time for us to get serious and protect Americans from the looming \nharms of climate change.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, two weeks ago, thousands of people \ngathered on the National Mall in front of the Lincoln Memorial to \ncelebrate the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, where Martin \nLuther King, Jr. gave his historic ``I Have a Dream'' speech. That \nremarkable moment in this Nation's history was a peaceful day of unity \nand we rightfully remember the inspiring words of Dr. King.\n  We are reminded this week of just how quickly that hope and positive \nsigns of progress were challenged by a stunning act of violence. Just a \nfew days after Dr. King inspired a nation with his dream for his four \nchildren, four other children in Birmingham were killed at their church \nbecause of the color of their skin. On September 15, 1963, a bomb was \nplanted by members of the Ku Klux Klan at the 16th Street Baptist \nChurch in Birmingham, Alabama. Addie Mae Collins, 14, Denise McNair, \n11, Carole Robertson, 14, and Cynthia Wesley, 14, were innocent victims \nof racial hatred. The inhumanity of those who conspired and killed \nchildren in a church may seem unimaginable in our Nation today, but, as \nColbert King of the Washington Post noted recently, ``Before al-Qaeda, \nthere was the Ku Klux Klan.''\n  We celebrate the significant strides we have made with determined \nefforts in forging a more just and equal America since the KKK's reign \nof terror, and yet we cannot forget that these events occurred just \ndays after the March on Washington. It occurred in the lifetime of 88 \nof 100 members of this Senate body. It is our recent history, not \nancient history.\n\n[[Page S6321]]\n\n  The tragic deaths of those four little girls, along with the other \nshining examples of bravery, patriotism and resolve during the Civil \nRights movement, catalyzed passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and \nthe Voting Rights Act of 1965. These laws helped to transform our \nNation and ensure that our most basic promises to our citizens are more \nthan just words on a page, honored only in their breach.\n  The inspiring possibilities described so eloquently by Dr. King, and \nthe depravity and horror of the Birmingham church bombing just weeks \nlater, reveal an important lesson about our history. The path to \nprogress in our Democracy is winding, and sometimes very, very \ndifficult. We know from our shared experience that we cannot be the \nNation that we strive to be by setting the dial on autopilot and \nassuming that all will be well. There are so many reminders of the \nwinding path to progress, and recently we experienced a considerable \ndetour.\n  Three months ago, a narrow majority of the Supreme Court held that \nthe coverage provision of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act was \nunconstitutional. Section 5, often called the ``heart of the Voting \nRights Act,'' provided a remedy for unconstitutional discrimination in \nvoting by requiring jurisdictions with the worst histories of \ndiscrimination to ``preclear'' all voting changes before they could \ntake effect. The remedy is both necessary and important because it \nstops the discriminatory voting practice before our fellow Americans' \nrights are violated. By striking down the coverage provision for \nSection 5, the Supreme Court's ruling leaves this vital protection \nunenforceable.\n  While certain barriers to participation have been eliminated, we \ncontinue to see discriminatory voting measures such as arbitrary \nregistration rules, polling-place manipulation, voter purges, \nchallenges or other devices to deny access to the ballot, as well as \nvote dilution tactics. Since the Court's recent decision in Shelby \nCounty, several states have already decided to impose new barriers to \nvoting, thereby reversing the gains that we have made through the last \nfive decades.\n  These include measures taken by Texas, North Carolina, and Florida to \nundermine their citizens' right to vote and to participate in our \ndemocracy. But on this day, when we reflect on the contributions of our \nchildren to the cause of liberty, perhaps no story is more worth \nretelling than the story of the Prairie View A students. It is a \nstory that bridges the past with both the present and the future. \nStudents from that historically black university have been fighting for \ntheir voting rights for more than four decades now, and if not for the \nVoting Rights Act, many of these students would have been denied their \nfundamental right to vote.\n  The history is well-documented in a recent Houston Chronicle article \nby Renee Lee. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record. \nIn the 1970s, the Justice Department filed an action against Waller \nCounty and its state officials for using a questionnaire to deny \nPrairie View students the right to vote. In 1992, 19 students were \nindicted for improperly voting, which ultimately led to a U.S. Supreme \nCourt ruling that authorized college students to register and vote in \ncommunities where they live while at school.\n  In 2004, the NAACP and four Prairie View students filed a federal \ncase after the county district attorney tried to enforce residency \nrequirements that would keep students from voting. A Section 5 \nenforcement suit was filed by civil rights organizations around the \nsame time after county officials shortened the early voting period at \nthe campus in violation of Section 5. This effort to narrow student \nparticipation came at a time when a student leader sought elective \noffice. Testimony about this recent chapter at Prairie View A was \nsubmitted to Congress in support of the 2006 Reauthorization of the \nVoting Rights Act. It was compelling evidence that voting \ndiscrimination persists in that community and that even a Supreme Court \nruling was not sufficient protection.\n  Two years after the reauthorization of Section 5, in 2008, nearly \n1,000 Prairie View students marched in protest for the lack of an early \nvoting place on campus. The county had reduced the number of early \nvoting polling sites from six to one, requiring students to walk miles \nto the nearest polling location. If you did not know the long and \ntortured history of the schemes to block Prairie View A voters from \ntheir constitutionally protected rights, moving a polling place may \nseem like merely a matter of administrative convenience, but in voting, \nboth history and context matter. The Justice Department under Attorney \nGeneral Michael Mukasey ultimately entered into a consent decree with \nWaller County that required officials to restore three polling sites. \nAnd now, the students from this historically black university are once \nagain fighting to exercise their fundamental right to vote by demanding \nan accessible polling place. The Prairie View A story illustrates \nthat sometimes discrimination starts early, and that some officials are \nsurprisingly persistent in their efforts to erect barriers in the path \nof our youngest voters. The Voting Rights Act stands as a guardian \nagainst these schemes to discourage young voter participation.\n  But now, following the Shelby County ruling, and with a college \nleader seeking elective office in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, local \nofficials have borrowed the Prairie View A disenfranchisement \nplaybook. There, a party chairman challenged the eligibility of \nMontravius King from standing for office by claiming that Mr. King did \nnot meet the residency requirement because he lived in a dorm. The \npremise of this challenge is flatly contradicted by Supreme Court \nprecedent and the decades of advocacy over Prairie View A students' \nvoter access. Nevertheless, North Carolina local officials were \ninitially able to disqualify Mr. King's candidacy. There were also \nindications that some in Elizabeth City, North Carolina intended to \nemploy new voter challenge procedures in the state to prevent students \nfrom the historically black college from voting. It is perhaps no \nwonder, then, that part of the officials' plan also involved removing \nthe polling place from the campus. Last week, local election board \nreversed itself only after a huge public outcry, but these events \nreveal that some things have changed and some, unfortunately, have not. \nI ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article from \nthe Washington Post by Mary Curtis, which documents the efforts by \nNorth Carolina's state officials to infringe on the fundamental right \nto vote.\n  When President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law in 1965, \nhe declared that: ``Through this act, and its enforcement, an important \ninstrument of freedom passes into the hands of millions of our \ncitizens.'' We must remain vigilant and protect the rights of all \nAmericans to exercise this fundamental right.\n  The recent Supreme Court decision placed the burden on Congress to \nrespond with a legislative fix. It is therefore our duty and \nconstitutional obligation to not waver from the path of greater \npolitical inclusion that we have set for ourselves and the Nation \nthrough our bipartisan support of the Voting Rights Act.\n  We must restore the vital protections that were weakened by the \nSupreme Court's ruling. We must provide additional remedies for states \nand counties, anywhere in the Nation, that not only have a history of \ndiscriminating against their voters, but continue to do so. We must \nextend the reach of these protections to states that commit serious \nvoting rights violations in the future. We must amend the existing \nprovisions of the Act to make those protections more effective. And we \nmust provide greater transparency for changes to voting procedures so \nthat voters are made aware of these changes. These are the kinds of \nbipartisan solutions that we should all be able to agree on.\n  As we continue the fight to combat discrimination, we should remember \nthe words of Dr. King. We should remember the aspirations of students \nlike Montravius King. We should remember the contributions of the \nStudent Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and Congressional leader John \nLewis. And we should remember that those four girls who died in the \n16th Street Baptist Church Bombing, and who are being posthumously \nhonored today with Congressional Gold Medals, were part of a movement \nthat helped make America better, stronger and\n\n[[Page S6322]]\n\nmore just. The way to truly honor them is not by words alone but \nthrough our actions and leadership. While we commemorate the sacrifice \nof these four girls, our work does not end with this commemoration. Our \nwork is ahead of us and we must act together in a bipartisan manner to \nprotect the fundamental right to vote for all Americans. All of our \nchildren are depending on it.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Aug. 29, 2013]\n\nPast is Present as North Carolina Honors 1963 March and Battles Voting \n                                  Laws\n\n                          (By Mary C. Curtis)\n\n       Charlotte.--In North Carolina, commemorations of the 50th \n     anniversary of the March on Washington and Martin Luther \n     King's dream credited past struggles while a current battle \n     over voting laws took center stage.\n       In an uptown Charlotte park Wednesday, the crowd used the \n     examples of civil rights pioneers in a continuation of the \n     Moral Monday protests against conservative laws from the \n     Republican-controlled state legislature. Similar gatherings \n     were planned in each of the state's 13 congressional \n     districts. While many issues, including education and health \n     care spending, were reflected in comments and emblazoned on \n     signs, the new state voter-ID bill was a unifying cause.\n       Later Wednesday evening, several Democratic and Republican \n     legislators took questions from their Mecklenburg County \n     constituents in a raucous forum called, ironically as it \n     turned out, ``Solving It Together.'' At the top of the list \n     in hundreds of questions submitted beforehand--voter-ID laws.\n       The new laws have already garnered national publicity, and \n     not the kind North Carolina likes. At the state CEO Forum in \n     Raleigh last week, former secretary of state Colin Powell \n     criticized the voting legislation, saying, ``These kinds of \n     actions do not build on the base.'' He made those remarks \n     after GOP Gov. Pat McCrory, who had signed the bill into law, \n     addressed the group, though McCrory later said he left before \n     the retired general spoke.\n       Besides requiring photo ID, the bill shortens early voting \n     by a week, ends preregistration for 16- and 17-year-olds, \n     eliminates same-day voter registration, Sunday voting and \n     straight-ticket voting, prohibits university students from \n     using their college IDs and increases the number of poll \n     watchers who can challenge a voter's eligibility, among other \n     provisions. It is currently being challenged in court and \n     Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.) has asked Attorney General Eric \n     Holder to take action as the Justice Department has in Texas.\n       Actions of GOP-controlled elections boards in North \n     Carolina have also been grabbing headlines, from the closing \n     of a polling place at Appalachian State University to the \n     ruling that a student at historically black Elizabeth City \n     State University cannot run for city council using his \n     college address to establish residency.\n       At Charlotte's Marshall Park, a program of speakers and \n     singers, as well as the sunny weather, duplicated the mood of \n     the 1963 Washington march. Under a voter registration tent, a \n     pledge card from the state NAACP urged attendees to be part \n     of the ``Forward Together, Not One Step Back'' movement voter \n     empowerment effort. The Rev. William Barber, head of the \n     state NAACP, was on the program.\n       Amy Gollinger, a physician from Davidson, N.C., held a sign \n     reading ``Protect every American's Right to Vote,'' which she \n     alternated with ones that said ``Protect women's rights'' and \n     ``Why deny Medicaid to struggling families?'' referencing \n     McCrory's decision to refuse federal Medicaid funds. She said \n     Wednesday was a ``perfect time'' to protest. ``Even though \n     we've come far since 1963, our state legislature has shown we \n     have much further to go, '' she said. ``It's unbelievable \n     we've gone from one of the most progressive states to one of \n     the most regressive. I hope it empowers voters to get out and \n     make a change.''\n       Sitting next to Gollinger with a sign reading ``Stop the \n     attacks on public education!'' James Davidson of Charlotte \n     said, ``I'm here for Martin Luther King,'' and called \n     proposals from the legislature ``going back to Jim Crow.'' He \n     said he hoped new laws would spur citizens to action. ``They \n     went to sleep and didn't get out to vote,'' he said.\n       At the Mecklenburg legislators' forum at Central Piedmont \n     Community College, the crowd in the packed auditorium loudly \n     registered its approval, disapproval or disbelief as \n     representatives of the state House and Senate explained \n     actions on voting, education and the back-and-forth over \n     attempts to change control of Charlotte Douglas International \n     Airport from the city to a state authority to a commission.\n       In heavily Democratic Charlotte, audience sentiment at the \n     forum, sponsored in part by local media outlets, was loudly \n     skeptical of the Republican-led changes.\n       Voting rights led the discussion, with one questioner at \n     the microphone asking for data on the fraud that is given as \n     reason for the photo-ID law (the answer came in anecdotal \n     examples) and another quoting former president Bill Clinton's \n     words at the Washington commemoration of the 1963 march, ``A \n     great democracy does not make it harder to vote than to buy \n     an assault weapon.''\n       From somewhere in the crowd came the tweet that there was \n     much more debate onstage than in the North Carolina General \n     Assembly, where GOP super-majorities were accused of rushing \n     through bills.\n       It seemed less Old South vs. New South than voter voices \n     vs. ALEC (the American Legislative Exchange Council), with \n     one question comparing North Carolina's bills to model \n     legislation from the conservative nonprofit. State Rep. Bill \n     Brawley, a Republican and active ALEC member, said he \n     believed in the organization's goals of limited government, \n     free market capitalism and federalism; Rep. Ruth Samuelson, a \n     Charlotte Republican, said she has attended one of the \n     group's meetings. All of the legislators said they serve \n     their constituents, not any organization.\n       State Sen. Dan Clodfelter, a Charlotte Democrat, said he \n     remembered a time when ``we weren't afraid in this state to \n     be different from the states around us,'' when ideas ``didn't \n     come out of anybody's playbook.''\n       After the forum, voters lingered to continue the contact \n     with officials some thought had not been listening closely \n     enough during the legislative session. Clodfelter was wistful \n     as he spoke of the times North Carolina passed pioneering \n     laws, such as the Racial Justice Act, which allowed death-row \n     inmates to appeal their sentences and have them converted to \n     life in prison without parole if they could prove racial bias \n     in their cases. (It was repealed this year.) ``Now we're \n     known for the wrong kind of things,'' he said. When one of \n     his Republican colleagues noted that the Democrat had \n     Wednesday's crowd on his side, Clodfelter said he answered, \n     ``You made them that way.''\n       State Sen. Jeff Tarte, a Republican who had managed to be \n     conciliatory in his conservatism during the panel, insisted \n     he ``loved'' the night's verbal battles. ``It's what the \n     American system is all about,'' he said, though since his \n     party passed its legislative agenda, it was easy for him to \n     be magnanimous.\n       Samuelson sat on the edge of the stage as the crowd \n     filtered out. She defended her support of the voting bill, \n     and noted a New York Times editorial ``The Decline of North \n     Carolina'' that criticized the general Assembly's actions and \n     caused quite a stir in this image-conscious state. She said \n     studies have found that ``after this bill,'' it's easier to \n     vote in North Carolina than New York.\n       When asked what she thought of congressman and civil rights \n     veteran John Lewis's attack on voter-ID laws, particularly on \n     the date marking the 50th anniversary of his appearance with \n     other civil rights leaders at the 1963 March on Washington, \n     she said, ``I appreciate the sacrifices they made, I \n     appreciate the emotion around this issue,'' then added, ``I'm \n     trying to protect the integrity of their vote. . . . They \n     worked hard for that vote; I want to make sure it doesn't get \n     stolen.''\n       State Sen. Malcolm Graham, a Charlotte Democrat, had said \n     onstage that in North Carolina you're more likely to get \n     struck by lightning than be affected by voter fraud. He said \n     that when his daughter returned to historically black \n     Winston-Salem State University this year, she and other \n     students were greeted with stories that a county board of \n     elections chair wanted to eliminate the school's early voting \n     site. ``Our national brand as a state has been tarnished,'' \n     he said.\n       After the forum, Graham said he believed the passion would \n     extend past Wednesday night. ``This thing has legs,'' he \n     said. The test, he said, would be the tough reelection Hagan \n     faces in 2014. ``That's the line in the sand the Democrats \n     have to draw.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Houston Chronicle, Aug. 1, 2013]\n\n     Prairie View A Student Fights for Voting Poll Site on Campus\n\n                           (By Renee C. Lee)\n\n       A Prairie View A University student leader is calling on \n     officials to add a campus polling place to remedy what she \n     and a civil rights leader described as decades of voter \n     suppression.\n       Priscilla Barbour, president of the Student Government \n     Association at the historically black university, sent a \n     letter to Texas Secretary of State John Steen and Waller \n     County Registrar Robyn German last week requesting that \n     action be taken by Oct. 1. Barbour says students' voting \n     rights are being violated because the nearest polling \n     location is more than a mile away.\n       The Oct. 1 first deadline, she said, would allow time to \n     make students aware of the new polling place before the \n     November elections.\n       Barbour, a senior, hopes her request will end a battle that \n     former Prairie View students have failed to win over the \n     years.\n       ``We've always had problems,'' said Barbour, who is active \n     with the Texas League of Young Voters. ``Voting is supposed \n     to be something that's convenient, something you have the \n     right to do without walking a great distance or standing in \n     line.''\n       The political science major said students were forced \n     during last year's general election to wait in a long line to \n     vote at the polling location at the local community center.\n       The city of Prairie View accommodates students by placing a \n     polling location on campus, but Waller County officials have \n     refused to do the same, she said.\n       German, the county's new registrar, could not be reached \n     for comment Wednesday.\n\n[[Page S6323]]\n\n     Steen's spokeswoman, Alicia Pierce, said Steen was drafting a \n     letter to German.\n       ``We don't generally determine polling locations,'' Pierce \n     said. ``That decision is made at the county level, but the \n     secretary is willing to meet with Miss Barbour. We'll be glad \n     to work with her.''\n       Gary Bledsoe, president of the NAACP state chapter, said \n     Waller County has a history of voter intimidation and \n     suppression of black voters.\n\n\n                          Repeated complaints\n\n       The lack of polling places on campus, lost voter \n     registration applications and problems with ballot boxes are \n     among the many voting issues that have come up time and again \n     in the county, he said.\n       ``Students are entitled to a voting poll on campus,'' \n     Bledsoe said. ``They have been fighting for one for many \n     years. It's a righteous request.''\n       Barbour's action follows a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling \n     that struck down a key provision in the Voting Rights Act. \n     The law protects minority voters from discrimination at the \n     polls and, until June, required nine states with a \n     discriminatory history, including Texas, to get federal \n     approval before making changes to election laws.\n       The ruling gave Texas and other states the green light to \n     push through voter ID laws, which civil rights leaders say \n     will inhibit minority voting.\n       Prairie View has been at the center of voting right issues \n     as far back as the 1970s, when the U.S. attorney general \n     filed action against Waller County and state officials for \n     the use a questionnaire that denied Prairie View students the \n     right to vote.\n       In 1992, 19 students were indicted for improperly voting, \n     which led to a Supreme Court ruling that authorized students \n     to register and vote in communities where they live.\n       The NAACP and four students filed a federal lawsuit in 2004 \n     after the county district attorney tried to enforce residency \n     requirements that would keep students from voting. Another \n     suit was filed around the same time after county officials \n     shortened the early voting period at the campus without \n     Justice Department approval.\n       The district attorney rescinded his action as part of a \n     settlement and county officials added an extra early voting \n     day on campus after being questioned by the Justice \n     Department.\n\n\n                            Previous protest\n\n       In 2008, nearly 1,000 Prairie View students marched in \n     protest of the lack of an early voting place on campus. The \n     county, citing budget concerns, reduced the number of early \n     voting polling sites from six to one, requiring students to \n     walk miles to the polling location. The Justice Department \n     instructed county officials to add three polling sites.\n       Barbour said she was a apprehensive about sending her \n     letters but figured she had nothing to lose.\n       ``Even if nothing's accomplished, now the tone is set,'' \n     she said. ``I'm not the first to tackle the issue and I'm \n     sure I won't be the last.

Andrew was born with \nDown syndrome, and his family started Andy's Dandys as a means for \nAndrew to have meaningful employment and to provide jobs for other \nyoung adults with special needs. His work is in line with the best of \nVermont's spirit of service to others, and for that I ask that the \narticle by Lynn Monty from the August 22, 2013, edition of the \nBurlington Free Press be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From the Burlington Free Press, \n                             Aug. 22, 2013]\n\n Richmond Bakery Cooks Up Job-Training Program and Successful Business\n\n       A mother's creative approach to helping her son transition \n     to adulthood, and all-natural dog treats, are the recipe for \n     success at Andy's Dandys.\n       Lucie Whiteford launched the Richmond bakery to help her \n     son Andrew (Andy) Whiteford, 21, who was born with Down \n     syndrome, find meaningful employment after high school \n     graduation.\n       The business was inspired by her boy's affection for his \n     rescued hound named Rosie and his love for reading recipes \n     and baking.\n       ``I hope for him to be fulfilled, happy, healthy, as \n     independent as he wants to be, and to continue to be in a \n     social environment surrounded by people who understand him \n     and love him,'' Whiteford said of her son.\n       This Bridge Street bakery is on a mission to illustrate \n     employability, while producing a high-quality Vermont \n     product. The original goal of supporting Whiteford in his \n     growth from high school to adult work life has evolved to \n     serving other young adults with special needs, and teaching \n     them real work-based skills that they can take with them in \n     their job search for future employment.\n       ``The mission of Andy's Dandys is to employ and train \n     people to be employable,'' business partner Lesha Rasco said. \n     She is Whiteford's special educator at Mount Mansfield Union \n     High School where he will graduate next year.\n       ``It's the revenue stream that makes the mission part \n     possible,'' Rasco said. ``In the future we hope that it will \n     build.''\n       Rasco designs and implements individualized work training \n     programs at Andy's Dandys for other young adults with special \n     needs. She has been an instrumental part of Whiteford's \n     growth and of developing his business.\n       The business has grown organically, Rasco said. ``Lucie has \n     been buying things and paying herself back.''\n\n\n                      Baker, decorater, deliverer\n\n       Andrew Whiteford bakes and decorates Andy's Dandy treats \n     and also makes deliveries and works to promote the business \n     at trade shows and seasonal events.\n       Andy actually goes by Andrew.\n       ``His name is Andrew. We don't call him Andy,'' Lucie \n     Whiteford said.\n       ``Call me Andy,'' Andrew Whiteford said with a smile.\n       ``He is yanking my chain,'' Lucie Whiteford said. ``The \n     business was named Andy's Dandys because we wanted some link \n     to Andrew, because this was for him, and because it has a \n     nice ring to it. Should we decide to one day make something \n     other than pet treats, we won't have to change the name.''\n       On a recent morning, a baker's apron was folded in half, \n     and tied around his waist, not around his neck, just the way \n     he requested. Andrew Whiteford was just as meticulous about \n     dipping each one of the many freshly baked molasses dog bones \n     into bright orange yogurt frosting, as he was about donning \n     his apron.\n       ``There are all kinds of colors, like blue, orange, and \n     sometimes brown,'' he said. ``I want to sell these in Las \n     Vegas and on a Hawaii beach someday. I am not joking. It's \n     true.''\n\n\n                        Preservative free treats\n\n       Joking or not, Andy's Dandys has taken off.\n       The business started in 2008. Andrew Whiteford began by \n     selling the treats in school and at Saint Michaels's College, \n     where his father Tim Whiteford is an associate professor of \n     education.\n       By fall of that year a few hundred of the colorful dog \n     treats sold from a couple Chittenden County convenience \n     stores. Overall, 8,500 treats sold that year.\n       The bakery uses human-grade ingredients and the treats are \n     preservative-free.\n       Today, the bakery turns out thousands of treats each week, \n     which sell at about 95 stores in Vermont, New Hampshire, \n     upstate New York, and Maine. Thirty-two thousand treats sold \n     in 2012.\n       ``This year we are pacing about 20 percent ahead of where \n     we were last year, and last year was a 100 percent increase \n     over 2011,'' Lucie Whiteford said.\n\n\n                    Custom shaped for your business\n\n       The bakery has started offering custom-shaped treats that \n     reflect a business' name or product. For example, a flying \n     pig dog treat for the Northfield Savings Bank instead of the \n     standard milk-bone biscuit, she said.\n       ``It's about offering customers a Vermont-made product to \n     demonstrate support for a small Vermont business such as \n     ours,'' she said. ``They gave us a shot, and I understand \n     that customers really love them.''\n       Lucie Whiteford came on staff full-time last month after \n     leaving her position as an account executive at Fox 44 TV. \n     She hopes to begin drawing a salary as the new quarter starts \n     in September.\n       ``It's profitable now which is why I was able to leave my \n     job to do this full time,'' she said. ``Now that I can work \n     on this business full time, I expect to be able to double \n     sales again in a year's time.''\n\n\n                           The biggest reward\n\n       More than revenues, Lucie Whiteford's biggest reward is \n     watching her son succeed in adulthood. She said raising a \n     child with a disability has been enlightening and rewarding.\n       ``We celebrate what most people consider mundane \n     accomplishments, such as learning to speak well enough to be \n     understood, learning to button a shirt or tie a shoe,'' she \n     said.\n       Andrew Whiteford has always pushed himself to achieve goals \n     singing a solo at the senior recital, snowboarding down a \n     black diamond trail, and teaching himself how to dip dog \n     treats with two hands at once, his mother said.\n       ``He continues to exceed our expectations, reminding us \n     that we should be mindful about not setting the bar low just \n     because he has a disability,'' she said. ``As a family we \n     have all grown so much in terms of learning patience, \n     patience and more patience.''\n       Andrew Whiteford has come into his own in the past few \n     years, his sister Marie Johnson said. ``He has a definite \n     interest in this business now,'' she said. ``He has developed \n     a sense of ownership.''\n       Their mother agreed. ``Andrew turned a corner this summer. \n     He decided he wanted to\n\n[[Page S6324]]\n\n     come here and work with me. It was what it was all for, and \n     me sticking with it, and having it be a part of our lives, \n     and having it become the thing he has decided to do it, I \n     couldn't be happier,'' she said.\n       Andy's Dandys manufactures and packages the treats at the \n     Bridge Street shop, and will be opening a retail store at \n     that location in mid-September.\n\n\n                               Correction\n\n       This story has been updated to reflect the following \n     correction: Lucie Whiteford launched the Richmond bakery \n     Andy's Dandys. Her name was misspelled in two instances in a \n     previous version of this story.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/10/senate-section/article/S6324-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MARK WOODS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise today to congratulate my good \nfriend Mr. Mark Woods. Mark is currently the superintendent of one of \nthe Commonwealth of Kentucky's most important preserves of natural \nbeauty, the Cumberland Gap National Historic Park, a post he's held for \n16 years. The Cumberland Gap National Historic Park sits at the border \nof Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia, although of course, the most \nbreathtaking parts are within the Bluegrass State.\n  Kentuckians will be sorry to see Mark go due to his recent and much \ndeserved promotion: Later this month, Mark will assume his new duties \nas superintendent of the Blue Ridge Parkway. The Blue Ridge Parkway \nruns for over 450 miles through Virginia and North Carolina along the \nBlue Ridge Mountains. It is the most visited attraction of the entire \nU.S. National Park Service--more than Yellowstone, Yosemite, or the \nGrand Canyon.\n  Mark is a 33-year veteran of the National Park Service and has worked \nin parks in South Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia as well as Kentucky. \nI am sure his family is very proud of him for this career \naccomplishment. Although I will miss working with Mark in Kentucky, I \nam pleased that citizens everywhere can still benefit from his \nknowledge and experience when they visit our national parks.\n  I know my colleagues join me in congratulating Mr. Mark Woods for \nthis opportunity and thanking him for his dedication to the National \nPark Service. Mr. Woods's career and accomplishments to date were \nrecently profiled in a newspaper article. I ask unanimous consent that \nsaid article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to appear as \nfollows:\n\n                  [From the Asheville Citizen-Times, \n                             Aug. 7, 2013]\n\n               SC Native Named New Parkway Superintendent\n\n                           (By Karen Chavez)\n\n       Asheville.--A 33-year National Park Service veteran with \n     Southern Appalachian roots has been chosen as the new \n     superintendent of the Blue Ridge Parkway.\n       Mark Woods, 53, now superintendent at Cumberland Gap \n     National Historic Park, which sits in Kentucky, Virginia and \n     Tennessee, will take over leadership of the busiest national \n     park site in the country September 22 at parkway headquarters \n     in Asheville.\n       ``Mark has got some great experience,'' said Bill Reynolds, \n     National Park Service spokesman in Atlanta. ``He spent most \n     of his career in the Southeast.''\n       Woods, who was raised in Greenville, S.C., received a \n     bachelor's degree in sociology from Lander University in \n     Greenwood, S.C., in 1982. He is married and has three \n     children.\n       He began working as an interpretive ranger for the National \n     Park Service in 1980 at parks including Ninety Six National \n     Historic Site (Ninety Six, S.C.), Kings Mountain National \n     Military Park (Blacksburg, S.C.), Andrew Johnson National \n     Historic Site (Greeneville, Tenn.), and Cumberland Island \n     National Seashore (St. Mary's, Ga.)\n       Woods will replace Phil Francis, who retired as \n     superintendent of the parkway in April. Monika Mayr, deputy \n     superintendent since 2009, has been acting superintendent \n     since April, and had applied for the position.\n       The parkway has not had a female superintendent in its 78 \n     years.\n       Mayr, a 30-year park service veteran, said she has known \n     Woods for many years and thinks he will be a good fit.\n       ``He's a very good leader,'' she said. ``He has always \n     wanted to work at the parkway because he loves the resources \n     here and he knows the staff is really good.''\n       Woods also gets a hearty endorsement from Francis, who \n     oversaw the parkway for eight years and still lives in \n     Asheville.\n       ``I've known him over 20 years. He's well respected,'' \n     Francis said.\n       ``He's a very able leader of Cumberland Gap. It's not as \n     big as the parkway, but he's already had to deal with some of \n     the same issues on a different scale. Sequestration cuts \n     happened at all national parks, so he's had to make those \n     same kinds of decisions.''\n       The federal sequester forced all national parks to reduce \n     their budgets by 5 percent for the remainder of the year, \n     starting in March.\n       Woods will inherit the aftermath of the nearly $800,000 \n     budget cut, which was accomplished through facility closures, \n     cuts to seasonal and permanent staff, cutbacks on visitor \n     services such as ranger programs and a decrease in the mowing \n     operation and maintenance of the parkway's scenic overlooks.\n       He must also contend with a $450 million deferred \n     maintenance backlog, which has been growing for more than a \n     decade.\n       ``Mark has a tremendous background in working with gateway \n     communities,'' Reynolds said. ``He also has background in \n     facility design and construction, viewshed protection, \n     wilderness management and general management planning. A \n     broad range of excellent knowledge and experience has made \n     him well suited for this job.''\n\n\n                   SIMILAR PARKS ON DIFFERENT SCALES\n\n       Woods has been superintendent of Cumberland Gap, known as \n     the gateway to the western frontier, since 1997.\n       ``Cumberland Gap is the first doorway to the West, the path \n     that Daniel Boone and the pioneers used to access the West,'' \n     said Carol Borneman, supervisory park ranger at Cumberland.\n       The park and the parkway have some similarities. Much like \n     the parkway, Cumberland Gap sits in the Appalachian \n     Mountains, and is steeped in Southern Appalachian history and \n     culture.\n       Cumberland Gap was authorized by Congress in 1940 to \n     preserve the natural gap through the mountain that pioneers \n     used to reach the western frontier centuries ago. It contains \n     24,000 acres with nearly 85 miles of forested hiking trails. \n     For 50 years, a major highway passed through the Gap.\n       But in one of the largest restoration projects undertaken \n     by the National Park Service, Borneman said, a highway tunnel \n     was built through the Gap in 1996, the old highway was ripped \n     out and the Gap restored to its Daniel Boone days as a \n     walking path. From one overlook in the park, Borneman said, \n     the Smokies can be seen on a clear day.\n       The culture, history and views drew 860,000 visitors in \n     2012.\n       Things will likely seem a little more crowded for Woods \n     when he gets to the Blue Ridge Parkway. The most visited of \n     the more than 400 units of the National Park Service, \n     including such popular parks as Yellowstone, Yosemite, the \n     Grand Canyon and the Great Smoky Mountains national parks, \n     the parkway had 15.2 million visitors in 2012.\n       The parkway stretches 469 miles from Shenandoah National \n     Park in Virginia through the Blue Ridge Mountains, ending in \n     Cherokee, and contains 81,000 acres of land and 1,200 miles \n     of boundary.\n       Established in 1935 as a scenic motor road, cars and \n     traffic continue to be one of its biggest issues. October is \n     generally the busiest month on the parkway, and Woods will \n     arrive just in time for the heavy fall foliage traffic.\n       He will also face a major closure in one of the parkway's \n     most popular areas in the height of summer tourist season. A \n     20-mile stretch just north of Asheville, through the Craggy \n     Gardens area to Mount Mitchell State Park, has been closed to \n     traffic since July 12 due to slope failure, presumably from \n     the excessive spring and summer rain, staff say.\n       Crews are now working on a temporary fix to open the \n     roadway by Labor Day for the fall leaf-peeping traffic, then \n     will close again while the road is permanently fixed.\n       Borneman said Cumberland Gap is sad to see Woods leave.\n       ``He is an incredible superintendent, so in tune to park \n     resources, and such a proponent of working with local \n     communities,'' she said. ``The parkway is lucky to be getting \n     him.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/10/senate-section/article/S6324-2", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6324-S6325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ARIEL RIOS REFLECTING POOL\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Madam President, I am pleased to be an original \ncosponsor of the Missing Children's Assistance Reauthorization Act of \n2013.\n  This bill will reauthorize the efforts of the National Center for \nMissing and Exploited Children. This legislation will ensure that NCMEC \nwill continue to be able to receive reports of missing children for law \nenforcement, provide DNA analysis to locate missing children, partner \nwith the FBI and Department of Justice to combat child sex trafficking, \nfight child pornography. NCMEC also should be allowed to continue to \nperform its role as the congressionally-authorized national \nclearinghouse to assist missing and exploited children, working with \nagents from the FBI, Secret Service, Marshals Service, Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement, the Postal Inspection Service, and the Naval \nCriminal Investigative Services.\n  There is a greater need than ever before for transparency and \naccountability when taxpayer moneys are granted to private, nonprofit, \nand other governmental agencies. I am pleased that the bill contains \nthe accountability measures that I demand for all grants that are \nawarded by the Department of Justice. These include two audits of NCMEC \nuse of these funds over the life of the reauthorization, penalties for \nmisuse of funds, prohibition on receipt of funds by an organization \nthat holds offshore accounts to avoid taxes, limitations on conference \nexpenditures, and prohibition of the use of taxpayer funds to lobby for \ngrant funding. These provisions will ensure that taxpayers can have \nconfidence that their money will be used properly and for public \npurposes.\n  NCMEC performs important services to combat terrible crimes against \nvulnerable victims. With the inclusion of transparency and \naccountability safeguards, I look forward to the enactment of this \nlegislation in advance of the expiration of the current authorization.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/10/senate-section/article/S6325-2", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO NICK GEALE\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I am pleased today to praise the \nservice of Nick Geale, who was until July the director of oversight and \ninvestigations on the minority staff of the Senate Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions--HELP--Committee, of which I am ranking member. In \nJuly, Nick was confirmed by this body as a member of the National \nMediation Board, where he will surely continue his hard work, \nthoughtful deliberation, and fair application of the law on behalf of \nworkers and employers in the railroad and airline industries.\n  Nick joined the HELP Committee in 2009 under the previous ranking \nmember, Senator Mike Enzi of Wyoming, for whom he first served as \noversight and investigations counsel before becoming director of \noversight and investigations. I was fortunate that he agreed to stay \nwhen I became the Ranking Member and appreciate his service. In his \nrole here, Nick investigated waste, fraud, and abuse in government \nprograms and agencies, often working with agency inspectors general and \nthe Government Accountability Office in that capacity. He also led the \nHELP Committee's investigations into the implementation of Federal \nprograms and to ensure proper enforcement of Federal laws. He \nthoroughly evaluated and advised the HELP Committee on the President's \nnominees and assisted the HELP Committee's staff in policy matters and \nhearings.\n  Nick came to the HELP Committee from the U.S. Department of Labor, \nwhere he served as an attorney to the Solicitor and then as counsel to \nthe Deputy Secretary under the leadership of Secretary Elaine L. Chao. \nIn both those roles, he assisted the agency in implementing labor \npolicies for the more than 180 laws under its jurisdiction and helped \nmanage the Department's 15,000 employees. Nick also has a distinguished \nacademic background. He graduated cum laude from Claremont McKenna \nCollege in 1996 and received a J.D. from Georgetown University Law \nCenter in 1999.\n  Maybe more important than noting his worthy accomplishments in public \nservice is to note his character and his attitude toward his work, the \ntaxpayers he served, and the colleagues he worked alongside. Nick \nworked hard to ensure that every taxpayer is treated fairly. With his \npractical experience in labor and employment matters, litigation, and \nalternative dispute resolution, Nick has been an eloquent and effective \nhelp to the committee. His dedication and friendship to those he worked \nwith, on both sides of the aisle, is a testament to the character he \nhas and will continue to have as he transitions to this next phase of \nhis career.\n  I thank him for the passionate service on behalf of the HELP \nCommittee, the U.S. Senate, and the American taxpayer. I wish him the \nbest in his service on the National Mediation Board.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/10/senate-section/article/S6325-3", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6325-S6326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WORLD WAR II VETERANS VISIT\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado.

Madam President, I wish to commend the Summit Project and \nits leader Maj. David Cote for their meaningful effort to sustain and \nhonor the memories of Maine's veterans who have fallen since September \n11, 2001. Founded on Memorial Day, 2013, the Summit Project aims to \ncarry stone memorials representing each of those heroes up mountains in \nMaine beginning on Memorial Day, 2014, and continuing annually. This \nthoughtful endeavor is already helping Gold Star families heal and will \nundoubtedly preserve the memory of their loved ones as the years pass.\n  Maine servicemembers and their families have made monumental \nsacrifices during the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. To date, 68 \nMainers or members of the Armed Forces with ties to Maine have made the \nultimate sacrifice during the wars in those countries. I am profoundly \ngrateful for the service of these brave Americans and for the service \nof their fellow soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines who continue to \nprotect our freedom on battlefields far from home.\n  Preserving a living memory of our fallen heroes is especially \nimportant in my home State of Maine. As Major Cote writes on the Summit \nProject's Web site, ``Mainers are veterans. Maine's patriotism and \ncommitment to service in our Armed Forces is nothing short of \nextraordinary.''\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs reports that 130,196 veterans live \nin our State, which means that nearly one in every ten Mainers is a \nveteran. These distinguished citizens, their families, and their \nfriends know that, to paraphrase the words of President Kennedy, ``A \nnation reveals itself not only by the men and women that it produces, \nbut also by the men and women it honors, the men and women it \nremembers.'' The Summit Project reveals the character of Maine: a \ncharacter notable for its integrity, service to others, honor, and \nloyalty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/10/senate-section/article/S6326-2", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        RIDE OF THE BROTHERHOOD\n\n Mr. VITTER. Madam President, today I wish to honor a very \nspecial organization, Ride of the Brotherhood. Established earlier this \nyear by Air Force veteran and Louisiana native Ed Lewis, Ride of the \nBrotherhood, seeks to raise funds for our Nation's veterans and \nchildren's charities. In March 2015, the organization will hold its \nfirst major event called ``The Return'' to honor the 50-year \nanniversary of those who bravely served in Southeast Asia during the \nVietnam War.\n  On March 8, 1965, American troops landed on China Beach and marched \nto Da Nang Air Force Base to secure the air base, freeing South \nVietnamese troops fighting against the Viet Cong. Those 3,500 Marines \nwere the first combat troops dispatched to support the Saigon \ngovernment's efforts to defeat the Communist insurgency.\n  To mark this occasion, 10 Vietnam veterans will travel on motorcycles \nfrom Louisiana to California, fly to Vietnam, and ride along the coast \nstopping at important locations to pay respects to those lost during \nthe war. On March 8, 2013, the 50-year anniversary, the group intends \nto be at China Beach before traveling to Da Nang. Upon their return, \nthey will ride cross-country from California to the Vietnam Memorial \nhere in Washington, DC, before returning to New Orleans for a ``Welcome \nHome'' celebration.\n  ``The Return'' will provide closure for those veterans making the \ntrip, and for some, their only opportunity to see the great memorials \ndedicated to their service. Because the entire journey will be \ndocumented, family, friends, and many others will have an opportunity \nto witness the experiences of the men who fought in Vietnam, Laos, \nCambodia, and Thailand. In addition, the trip will highlight the \npositive relations that now exist between the United States and the \nVietnamese people.\n  I am humbled to have the opportunity to express my appreciation to \nMr. Ed Lewis for his service to our country and I ask my colleagues to \njoin me in honoring these great Americans and thanking them for their \ndevotion to our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/10/senate-section/article/S6326-3", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT RELATIVE TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH \nRESPECT TO THE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON THE UNITED STATES OF SEPTEMBER 11, \n                              2001--PM 17\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1622(d), \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date.

A bill to amend the Energy Independence and Security Act of \n2007 to improve United States-Israel energy cooperation, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak for a \nfew minutes about an exciting new area of collaboration between the \nUnited States and Israel, our critical ally and friend in the Middle \nEast. Especially given the current state of affairs in the Middle East, \nthe United States' clear and unyielding support for Israel is more \nimportant now than ever before. For the past few years, I have been a \nleader in the effort to enhance US-Israel collaboration on energy \ndevelopment, which is why I am excited today to introduce a bill that \nwill expand this critical relationship, along with Chairman Wyden and \nRanking Member Murkowski.\n  In December 2010, Israel made the largest natural gas discovery in \nthe world in the past decade off its coast in the Mediterranean. The \ndiscovery, known as the Leviathan field, is estimated at 16 trillion \ncubic feet of natural gas, bringing Israel's total natural gas reserves \nto an estimated 30 trillion cubic feet. This will likely be able to \nsatisfy Israel's domestic gas demand with enough left over to export \nfor years to come--in fact, it is estimated that if only half of this \nnatural gas was produced, Israel would have 100 years of its natural \ngas needs met.\n  Not only is the Leviathan discovery a game changer for Israel, both \neconomically and geopolitically, but it is also an incredible chance \nfor the U.S. to share our energy expertise to support a critical ally \nwhile creating economic opportunities here at home. The Gulf Coast, \nwhich provides one third of all domestically produced oil in the \nnation, arguably has the most advanced offshore energy industry in the \nworld; Israel, until very recently has had almost none. With limited \ndomestic production capacity, a non-existent regulatory framework, and \na lack of related academic programs, Israel can greatly benefit from \ncollaboration with the U.S., and we are uniquely qualified to lead this \neffort to help Israel successfully develop this natural resource. As \nIsrael is a leader in the research and development, hi-tech and startup \nspaces, enhanced collaboration between the two countries can be \nmutually beneficial.\n  The United States-Israel Energy Cooperation Enhancement Bill \nrecognizes the important relationship and potential for further \ncollaboration between the United States and Israel on energy \ndevelopment, including natural gas and alternative fuels, and seeks to \nbolster that relationship by encouraging increased cooperation in the \nacademic, business, governmental, and other sectors.\n  The bill first recognizes energy collaboration with Israel as a \nstrategic interest of the United States and officially encourages \ncollaboration between the U.S. National Science Foundation and the \nIsrael Science Foundation. It then further encourages cooperation \nbetween both countries' academic communities in energy innovation \ntechnology, technology transfer, and analysis of the geopolitical \nimplications of new natural resource development. It also urges \nbusiness development engagement in the private sectors and regular \nengagement between the two countries' relevant agencies, departments \nand ministries to share best practices.\n  Additionally, the United States-Israel Energy Cooperation Enhancement \nBill expands two already existing joint grant making programs, the \nBinational Industrial Research and Development Program, BIRD, and the \nBinational Science Foundation, BSF. Under the bill, these two programs \nwould now include projects focused on natural gas, which are expected \ngiven Israel's recent discoveries, as well as entrepreneurial \ndevelopment and the advanced hi-tech sector. The legislation also \nreauthorizes the BIRD and BSF programs through fiscal year 2024.\n  Finally, the bill allows for the authorization of a United States-\nIsrael Offshore Technology Center to further academic and technology \nresearch and development collaboration. This is the direct result of \nnumerous conversations, meetings, and visits I have had over the past \nfew years, and I am especially excited about the potential of this type \nof formal academic collaboration. Israeli universities have some of the \nworld's leading engineering departments, but have no petroleum \nengineering faculty. Imagine the synergy if we could combine Israeli \nengineering expertise with our universities, who have the leading \npetroleum engineering departments in the world.\n  This bill builds off of my previous efforts to enhance collaboration \nbetween the United States and Israel on energy development and \nexploration. For several years, I have been working to strengthen the \nrelationship between our two countries and to help our domestic energy \nindustry. In October 2011, with the help of the Department\n\n[[Page S6330]]\n\nof Commerce and the Southwest Louisiana Economic Development Alliance, \nI organized the first ever oil and gas trade mission to Israel and \nbrought 12 Louisiana oil and gas companies to the region. The mission \nwas such a success that the Department of Commerce and I ran another \ntrip in October 2012 that brought 15 American companies and \nuniversities. Additionally, in June of 2012, I hosted a delegation of \n10 high-ranking Israeli officials in Washington and Louisiana to meet \nwith US industry experts and federal officials, including then \nSecretary of the Interior Ken Salazar. The delegation also attended the \nCentral Gulf of Mexico oil and gas lease sale in New Orleans and \nvisited Port Fourchon and the Liquified Natural Gas, LNG, facility in \nCameron Parish. By seeing our work first-hand and learning about the US \nregulatory framework, they left with a keener understanding of our \nindustry.\n  The United States-Israel Energy Cooperation Enhancement Bill will \ncontinue to advance this important goal. Through energy collaboration, \nacademic cooperation, and continued government dialogue, we will create \njobs for our domestic oil and gas industry and support a critical ally \nin the Middle East in its quest for energy independence and security. I \nthank my colleagues Chairman Wyden and Ranking Member Murkowski for \ntheir leadership on this issue and for cosponsoring the bill, and I \nurge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1491\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 22. A joint resolution to promote a diplomatic solution in \nSyria, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, approximately 9 days ago most of us were \non call and being briefed by the administration on what was evolving \nand how desperate and dire the situation was. At the time it was being \nproposed as an imminent strike that had to be done for the defense of \nthis Nation, and we listened to that.\n  Immediately after that conversation we had with many Senators and \nSecretary Kerry, my dear friend Senator Heitkamp called me and said: I \nwould hope we have another option. We were looking for an option. The \nonly thing we had before us was a vote to either support an imminent \nstrike or not support a strike. It has been proposed if we don't show \nthe strength of this great country of ours that it could weaken our \nstanding in the world and our intentions might not be taken seriously \nthe next time and also weaken the Presidency, which none of us want to \ndo, no matter what side of the fence you might be on.\n  So we kept looking and talking. I canceled all my appointments in \nWest\n\n[[Page S6331]]\n\nVirginia and Senator Heitkamp did the same in North Dakota and we came \nback as soon as possible. We attended every meeting, every briefing. I \nwent to my Armed Services Committee meeting and also the Foreign \nRelations Committee meeting to hear the testimony from all of the \npeople in the administration who were making their case.\n  At the end of the day, it still did not rise to the level, in my mind \nand I think in the mind of Senator Heitkamp as well, that we were at a \npoint to where it would be of imminent danger to the United States. So \nwith that, we brought all the people together, and Senator Heitkamp--\nand I want her to chime in here--and myself kept pushing and pushing \nthe people who had the knowledge and who had been down that road \nbefore--military leaders, past and present, diplomats, and also think \ntanks--and we finally came up with something that could be done.\n  I would defer to Senator Heitkamp on this, but we kept saying if the \nproblem is chemical weapons, why haven't we addressed that? All we knew \nwas there was an imminent strike. We were not going to be able to take \nout, nor did we intend to take out or change the regime. We could not \nput boots on the ground, nor did we have a desire--nobody had a \ndesire--for our military men and women to go back in. So we couldn't \nsecure those weapons.\n  Senator Heitkamp might want to say how we came to the position we \ncame to and why we felt it was so important.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. I think the first thing to talk about is the ability, \nfirst and foremost, to look at the mission and look at the event that \nled to the need for a discussion in this body and a discussion in this \ncountry about our relationship in Syria, and that was the use of \nchemical weapons by the Asad regime in their own home country against \ntheir own people.\n  We know that activity is not only a crime against the Syrian people, \nbut it is a crime against humanity. It is a crime against an \ninternational standard that has been in place since World War I and has \nbeen greatly honored because of the devastating effects of using \nchemical weapons.\n  So when Senator Manchin and I looked at this--and we had long \ndiscussions with experts in the region--our first concern was securing \nthose chemical weapons and what we could do to make sure those weapons \nwould never again be used on any citizen of Syria and that we would not \nencourage or in any way give permission to another country to engage in \nthat activity. That is fundamentally the greatest interest we have in \nsecuring some kind of resolution in the Congress--to address that \nconcern.\n  Unfortunately, what we saw was not a targeted resolution that \naddressed that specific problem. Plus, what we were presented with when \nwe returned were two options: Do nothing, which both of us concluded we \ncould not let an attack such as this go unresponded to. So do nothing \nor agree to imminent strikes, and that was not an option either of us \nsaw as appropriate, nor was that an option we could agree to, so we \nlooked for common ground, listening not only to the experts in the \nadministration--the diplomats, the military experts, the national \nsecurity folks--but also bringing a broader group of people together to \ndiscuss what is our mission, how do we accomplish this. The result of \nall of that is the resolution the Senator has before him, the \nresolution he and I have advanced for a discussion in this body.\n  It seems critical to me that 1 week ago the interjecting of the \nchemical weapons ban and the Chemical Weapons Convention into this \ndiscussion in a very meaningful way, looking at what is in fact \ninternational law, was absolutely critical. Today, we have a very fluid \nand much different landscape diplomatically. We would like to think \nthese kinds of discussions that have occurred all across the country \nhave driven this, along with the President's discussion with Putin, \nalong with the administration's efforts.\n  So today we have a situation where we are glad to see some \ninvolvement, we are glad to see some movement, but it is absolutely \ncritical we remind everyone that actions speak louder than words. We \ncannot trust, I don't think, agreements between Russia or Syria until \nwe actually see Syria surrendering these weapons. But today we have an \noption on the table that is what we call the Manchin-Heitkamp \nalternative resolution, which can in fact engage us in a broader \ndiscussion, engage the international community.\n  I would say that truly was the motivation behind our work. I think \nthe Senator would agree with that.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I sure do. First of all, we all applaud President Obama \nfor bringing it to Congress. We think this is the right place for these \ntypes of decisions, with the consequences we are facing and what the \nrepercussions could be. But we have come to a conclusion that any type \nof imminent strike and the reaction from that would be greater than \ninaction right now. But doing nothing is unacceptable, which is how we \ncame to this.\n  Basically, we call this the Chemical Weapons Control Act. The thing \nabout the Chemical Weapons Convention, we felt--and we have heard from \ndiplomats on this--this was the proper course. It was basically giving \nthe Asad regime 45 days. Our resolution is very straightforward. The \nAsad regime has 45 days to sign and comply, and that means to identify, \nto secure, and to start eliminating and destroying. He cannot use, nor \ncan he continue to produce, these types of weapons.\n  Also, in that 45-day period, we have asked the administration and the \nPresident to lay forth a plan for Congress to evaluate what Syria would \nlook like at the end. If they do not sign, what are we to do and how \nwould Syria look? If they do sign and that still hasn't brought any \npeace and an end to a civil war, that needs to be looked at also.\n  We have all heard from our constituents. In talking to our colleagues \nwe have even heard a lot more. We have had some who have said: Listen, \nwe don't want a strike under any circumstances. No way on God's green \nEarth do we believe a strike will produce anything but repercussions.\n  I have said this, and the Senator and I have talked about this: If \nyou believe that money or military might would change the course and \ndirection of that part of the world, which we define as the Middle East \nor North Africa, then we would have had success by now. We have spent \n12 years--the longest war in our history--and we have spent over $1.6 \ntrillion and the results have not been beneficial whatsoever and we \nhave lost thousands of lives.\n  I have also said being a superpower means more than showing the rest \nof the world we have the super might to use whenever we feel it is \nnecessary. Being a superpower comes with not only having the super \nmilitary power, it comes with having the super negotiation ability, the \nsuper diplomacy, the super patience, and the super humanitarian aid, as \nneeded. We have the ability to do all of that.\n  That is what we have asked for. Now we are seeing an evolving \nsituation--not only in 24 hours, but with every 24 minutes it seems \nlike something is changing. The Russians have said they would ask \nAsad's regime in Syria to sign or be involved. Syria says they have \naccepted. We have heard now they have said they will comply and join \nthe CWC. These are the changes we have to continue to try to bring to \nfruition.\n  On that, we are very happy. I know the Senator and I have spoken \nabout that--and our colleagues are looking at different options--that \nwe didn't have different options as of Monday morning. There were no \noptions. It was are you going to vote to strike or not vote to strike. \nI am pleased we are moving and I think cooler heads will prevail.\n  I believe the President is open to making sure the players are \nsincere and real, meaning what they are saying. I believe now that they \nhave announced to the entire world, the international world, that we \nwill sign and be honest brokers, let's put them on the spot and see if \nthey will sign that and be part of this and become part of the 21st \ncentury, if you will.\n  I have and I will continue to work with my colleague. I think the \nGeneva Protocol of 1925 prohibits the use of chemical and biological \nweapons in conflict, but it did not go far enough. We know that. Syria \nsigned the Geneva Protocol in December of 1969. They signed that one, \nbut then they would not and have not been a signatory of the Chemical \nWeapons Convention of 1993. That is what we are speaking of. That one \nis the modern-day equivalent of the Geneva Protocol. The international \ncommunity began negotiating\n\n[[Page S6332]]\n\nthe CWC in 1980 to close the loopholes of the Geneva Protocol. The CWC \nopened for signature in 1963 and after the required 65 ratifications \nwere received, entered into force in 1997. We have, I think, five \ncountries that have not signed. Most countries, 191, have signed. That \nis what we are asking for them to comply with, which we think is the \nbest way, because there is an implementation organization which \noversees it and it is not the United States or Russia or not any other \ncountry taking the lead but basically it is a way to have the entire \ninternational community come back into play.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. To add another point to what Senator Manchin has spoken \nabout, which is that the results have not been satisfactory--I think \nthe other point we need to make is the results of all that interaction \nover this decade-plus of activity in this region have not been what was \npromised. It has made the American people perhaps cynical and very \nhesitant to rely on what is being said today.\n  As one of the great honors, but also amazing pieces of sadness in my \nfirst days of being a Senator-elect, I attended two funerals for two \nNational Guardsmen who were killed in action in Afghanistan. I remember \nsitting at the funerals and remember telling myself: Before you vote \never to engage in that kind of conflict, you absolutely need to look at \nalternatives. You owe it to our men and women in uniform. You owe it to \nthe people of this country who have lost not only the lives of their \nbrothers and sisters and family and friends but the people who have \nalso invested American treasure.\n  What we are seeking is a discussion, a broader discussion beyond two \nopposite and unacceptable alternatives. What we are seeing this week--\nmuch to our appreciation--is in fact not just our proposal but other \nproposals coming forth, a broader discussion about what all the options \nare, and taking a look at how we can work together as a United States \ngovernment, speak with one voice, and walk together to resolve this \nconflict.\n  We cannot ignore that we have a national security interest in working \ntogether. We have a national security interest in addressing and \nresolving the current issues in front of us. That discussion cannot be \ndone among a small group of Senators. It cannot be done in back rooms \nwith a promise of ``trust us,'' because some of that trust has been \nbroken over time. So a broad, open discussion as we are having here \ntoday I think is absolutely critical to reestablishing Americans' trust \nthat we can in fact make the right decision in their interests and \nreally in the interests of protecting our servicemen from chemical \nweapon attacks.\n  That is obviously a great concern of ours. We need to continue to \nhave this dialog and we need some kind of response. The question is how \nmeasured and what that response should be.\n  I have very much appreciated the Senator's willingness to work with \nme and I thank the rest of the Members who have approached us who want \nto talk about this proposal and other proposals for their willingness \nto broaden their thinking about what those options are.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I am so proud to be working on this with the Senator. \nOur staffs have worked well together. They are most competent and they \nhave done a yeoman job. The resolution we have come with basically is \nthe only one out there, an option today that basically controls the \nchemical weapons. It actually controls these chemical weapons from ever \nbeing used on another human being--which we all deplore. With that, \nmaybe we can help, now, move on to trying to help resolve this civil \nwar. The carnage is unbelievable.\n  They said there were 99,000 people killed in Syria with conventional \nweapons and 1,000 with chemicals. To me, every person is a life we \ncould save, we ought to try to save. With that being said, we have to \ngive them a chance to come be involved, and that is what we have done.\n  At this time last week we never thought we would have been here. This \ntime 2 days ago we would not have thought we could be here. But we are \nmoving in the right direction.\n  Let me make it clear what the resolution the Senator and our staffs \nhave worked on does. The section, our title, is this, basically:\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n  The section of our coining, this section of our title\n\n       . . . may be cited as the ``Chemical Weapons Control and \n     Accountability Resolution of 2013.''\n\n  Basically exactly what it says. The statement of policy is this:\n\n       It is the policy of the United States that\n       (1) the Government of Syria must become a signatory to the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention and take concrete steps to comply \n     with the terms and conditions of the Convention;\n       (2) the failure by the government of Bashar al-Assad to \n     sign and comply with the Convention clearly demonstrates a \n     willful disregard of international norms on the use of \n     chemical weapons; and\n       (3) if the Government of Syria does not sign and comply \n     with the convention within 45 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this resolution, all elements of national power \n     will be considered by the United States Government.\n\n  That reaffirms the war powers the President has. I know there are \nsome who do not believe that is constitutional or do not believe it is \nlaw, but we have checked it and researched it, and it is. We reconfirm \nthat. It does not say that imminent strikes will happen at the end of \n45 days. It will be up to the President to determine whether \nnegotiations are moving in the right direction, if all players are \nbeing sincere in coming on board, but it gives him the chance to be the \nPresident, to do whatever he is elected to do. Whomever he or she may \nbe, you want the President's office to be able to exercise the powers \nthey have by law. That is what we have done here.\n  Everybody has a different approach. Some may say 45 days or you don't \nneed that. Fine. We are open to all that. We have said that before. But \nthe experts who helped us put this together put in timetables they \nbelieved were reasonable and believed they were attainable.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. There are some who may question whether this is \ncapitulation or whether in fact this is a lack of showing of American \nunity. How would the Senator respond to those concerns?\n  Mr. MANCHIN. We have heard our colleagues and had some good \nconversations with our colleagues. We have had other people saying for \nreal, all you are doing is trying to stall.\n  I said no. I don't believe anyone really questions the might of the \ngovernment. I don't think it weakens the U.S. Government, to show super \nrestraint, knowing the volatility of that part of the world.\n  Also, past experience in my State of West Virginia--and I know in the \ngreat State of North Dakota--we know when you try something and put in \nso much effort trying to change that part of the world and have not had \nthe success, nowhere near, and spent $1.6 trillion and the sacrifice of \nAmericans--maybe that is not something we should repeat. We all know \nthat. We get no support basically from our constituents.\n  Those of us who are privy to all these high-powered meetings, if you \nwill, have not been convinced that there will be change. With that \nbeing said, I say to my friends, if you believe anyone would discount \nthe might of this Nation? I don't think so. The resolve of us to \nprotect our country and our Americans? I don't think so. Or to support \nour allies, our true friends and allies? I don't think so.\n  But you know, back home we have a saying: Sometimes you don't have a \ndog in the fight. We can't really find a friend in that fight. That is \nthe problem. That is the hard sell. With that being said--I have said \nthis before--the Arab League, they should step forward. That is in \ntheir backyard. We should give all the support. We have humanitarian \naid. We will give all the support we possibly can, but they need to \ntake the lead. It cannot always be the Americans being the policemen of \nthe world and everyone saying: OK, call 911, which goes right to \nWashington. They will take care of it.\n  I discount it when they start saying it doesn't show your strength, \nwe might not have that strength of reputation or it might weaken the \nPresident. No, I don't think so. Not at all.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. I think what we would say to the enemies of this \ncountry: Do not take from this democratic process and discussion a lack \nof resolve. We will stand together shoulder to shoulder. This is the \nprocess the Constitution gave us and the President\n\n[[Page S6333]]\n\nhas asked us to engage in. It shows the strength of this country, that \nwe can have open debate, open disagreements, but at the end of the day \nwe will stand together and stand strongly against our enemies. There \nshould be no comfort taken in any way, shape, or form by the enemies of \nour country that it somehow weakens our country. In fact it strengthens \nour country to have this discussion and then stand shoulder to shoulder \ntogether.\n  I do want to mention that during those times last week when we were \nattending the classified briefings, and a lot of those briefings were \nbicameral as well as bipartisan--I know we have that reputation today \nof being hyperpartisan and we cannot have meaningful and open \ndiscussion, it degenerates into pettiness and partisanship. I can tell \nyou from my experience of sitting through every one of those briefings \nwhat I heard was reasoned discussion. What I heard was rational \nquestioning. What I heard was an equal measure of restraint on both the \nDemocrat and the Republican side and a search for common answers and \ncommonality. It was that discussion that led us to introducing this \ntype of resolution.\n  For those who say this is just another example of dysfunctionality, \nit is too bad they could not look in at those discussions because I \nthink they would have seen a Congress that was very engaged. They would \nhave seen individual Members who were not looking to score political \npoints but were looking for information so they could exercise the \njudgment that their people, their districts, or their States elected \nthem to exercise.\n  That is the process going through. It is a critical process but it \ncannot be done yes or no, no other options, and we are not going to \nhave a broader discussion. That is why we are grateful for what is \nhappening on the ground. We will wait to see if it is real. We will \nwait to see. It is not enough--talk is never enough. We have to see \naction.\n  But in the meantime we will continue to have these discussions about \nwhat is in America's national security interests and how we exercise \nour collective will with a resolution that reflects our values and our \ncommitment to this country and its national security.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I believe that as the world watches what is unfolding \nnow, they are watching a superpower make a decision. We are using super \nrestraint. We are using super compassion, if you will. But we are super \nresolved and we have the super might to do what we need to do. I don't \nthink anyone should take that lightly.\n  I do not think anyone would take for granted that we will not defend \nthis country and every citizen of this country with everything we have \nand try to spread humanity, if you will, all over the world. But it \ntakes more than us as we move outside the borders of the United States \nof America. We need an international community working with us. We need \nsome of them stepping to the plate; not just the rhetoric that we hear \nbut basic stuff. We need the United Nations to be functioning again, to \nhave a functioning role and have a strong support role and be able to \nstep to the plate and do it in a fashion that protects the civilized \nworld. Those are the things we have asked for.\n  I think this gives it a chance. Today we have seen a breakthrough, if \nPresident Asad has said: I will sign and I will be a member and I will \ncomply and I will have inspectors come in and I will make sure these \nweapons are secure and we will start destroying them, taking them off \nthe shelf. Russia can play a part in that. They can pull their ships \nup, load them up, take them out, take them to a secured area. That is \ngetting them out of that part of the world, and then hopefully we can \nget people working together to stop the war we have, to stop the \ncarnage, too.\n  It starts here. People are looking to the United States and I think \nthey have been looking for the leadership we have been able to give, \nnot just in the military and not just in financial, but in some good, \nsolid, concrete decisions that bring this suffering that is going on in \nSyria to an end.\n  I am very proud to work with the Senator from North Dakota on this \nissue. We are asking all of our colleagues to be involved in any way, \nshape, or form. We will work with them. If there is anyone who has \nideas that can make this better and an even more perfect document, then \nwe are all for that. I know the Senator from North Dakota feels that \nway, and I know her team feels that way also.\n  I thank Senator Heitkamp for the work she has done and also the \nfriend she has been. I believe we are close to getting this in the \nright direction where cooler heads prevail, and I think the world will \nbe safer.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. I thank the Senator from West Virginia for the work he \nhas done and the leadership he has shown. I believe that when we work \ntogether, collaborate, and actually begin the discussion about what is \nin America's national security interest and how we can fashion a \nposition and a resolution that reflects that national security interest \nand open the opportunity for a broader dialog--not just two choices but \na broader dialog--we can build consensus in this body. If we can build \nconsensus in this body and if we can work forward to build consensus in \nAmerica, we can, in fact, move this issue forward, and it might be an \nexample of what we can do with our future.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his participation, \ninclusion, and the work he has done. I believe it has not only offered \na very significant alternative, but it has also set an example of where \nwe can go.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I don't believe military action is going to correct what \nis going on with Syria. It is going to be diplomacy and democracy that \nwill hopefully work there. We are trying to put that forward first. \nMore people are coming on board, and we appreciate that. We thank all \nof our colleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  This is not a partisan issue.
