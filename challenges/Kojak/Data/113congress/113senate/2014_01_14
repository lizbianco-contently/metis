Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 266.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 266, S. 1846, a bill to \n     delay the implementation of certain provisions of the \n     Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we will have further discussion on this \nmatter today; that is, the matter I moved to. On our side, we have \ncleared the bill. We could complete it quickly. We are waiting to hear \nfrom the Republicans. This is one of the bills where, if we need to do \nsome amendments on it, we can do some amendments on it.\n  The point is, I think we should try to get this done. We have been \nwaiting for a long time to get this done. This is truly a bipartisan \nbill. As I explained to the Republican leader yesterday, I have had a \nnumber of Republicans come to me to see if there is a way this bill \ncould be moved quickly. It has become a desperate situation, with so \nmany problems. Construction has been, in some areas, brought to a halt. \nSo hopefully we can work something out on this in the immediate future.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the Republican \nleader, the Senate will resume consideration of the unemployment \ninsurance extension. The time until 12:30 will be equally divided and \ncontrolled between the two leaders or their designees, with the \nmajority controlling the first 30 minutes and the Republicans the \nsecond 30 minutes. The Senate will then recess from 12:30 until 2:15, \nas we do every Tuesday, for our caucus meetings. At 2:30, there will be \nup to two rollcall votes; first, a cloture vote on the Reed of Rhode \nIsland substitute amendment. If cloture is not invoked, there will be a \nsecond cloture vote on the underlying bill.\n  We have had some good discussions, and I am going to--as I know the \nRepublican leader will--discuss if there is a way to move forward on \nunemployment insurance. I hope there is. At 2:30 today, after our \ncaucuses, we will come out and see if there is a consent agreement we \ncan present to the Senate to move forward with the legislation. I hope \nthat is possible, and we are certainly trying.\n\n\n                         Unemployment Insurance\n\n  Mr. President, each day Bloomberg releases a list of the 300 richest \nindividuals in the world--the Bloomberg Billionaires index. The list \nincludes 67 fortunate and really fabulously wealthy Americans. More \nthan any other country in the world, we have 67 of the 300. Last year, \nthe members of the billionaire index added $524 billion in new wealth \nto their net worth.\n  Listen to that, Mr. President: Last year, the billionaire's index--\nthese 67 people--added $524 billion of new wealth. Not million but \nbillion--$2 billion per person last year.\n  These are 300 fortunate individuals, flooded with their already flush \ncoffers, with another $2 billion each, while millions of American \nfamilies struggle to pay their rent. I don't begrudge these people at \ntheir making a lot of money. Their good fortune is something that \nspeaks well of our country. We are truly a land of opportunity. But I \ndo believe it is time for average Americans to share in that \nprosperity, particularly as the economy recovers.\n  If this were just a quirk in the indexes of how rich people are, that \nwould be one thing, but in the last 30 years this same top 1 percent \nhave seen their wealth increase--their incomes triple--while the middle \nclass has gone down 10 percent in the same 30 years. It is time for \naverage Americans--and I believe this so sincerely--to share in that \nprosperity in some way, especially as the economy is now recovering.\n  For most Americans, hard work isn't paying off the way it does for \nthe top 1 percent. For many it has been impossible to even find steady \nfull-time work since the recession began. That is why we must not \nabandon the 1.4 million Americans who are out there struggling--\nunemployed people who have been cut off from these crucial benefits now \nfor the last 2 weeks, and they are looking forward to maybe being cut \noff forever.\n  This small stipend--an average of $300 per week--is helping them keep\n\n[[Page S300]]\n\nfood on the table and, literally, roofs over their heads while they \nlook for work. I read here on the floor a letter from someone in \nNevada, a woman, who said she doesn't know where she is going to go, \nwhat she is going to do. She, as have many people, has looked for work \nso very hard. As part of the unemployment compensation, an individual \nhas to have been fired or laid off through no fault of their own and \nthen they have to look for work every week.\n  Americans do want to go back to work. They do not want to set a bad \nexample for their kids. They do not want to live off the system--\nwhatever that means. But there is still only one job for every three \npeople searching all over America. Some places are worse off than \nothers. In Nevada, a man wrote to me--1 of almost 20,000 Nevadans who \nlost unemployment benefits last month--and he said he had applied for \n700 jobs in the last 10 months--not 70, not 7, but 700. He has been \nable to get a dozen interviews but still can't find work.\n  But he hasn't given up hope. He hasn't given up the hope of finding a \ngood-paying job, and he hasn't given up hope that Congress will restore \nemergency unemployment benefits until he does find a job. Neither have \nthe 200 Nevada veterans who attended a job fair I put on last week. It \nwas held at the University of Nevada over the weekend. It is shameful \nthat tens of thousands of veterans of this Nation's armed forces lost \ntheir unemployment benefits last year.\n  It is inspiring to hear the stories of hard-working Americans who \nsimply won't give up until they find a job. So I hope Senators will \nremember the perseverance of these brave individuals as they continue \nto seek a compromise here in this body that would restore emergency \nunemployment benefits to 1.4 million Americans.\n  This says it all: 67 of the richest people in the world living in \nAmerica got a $2 billion tip last year. For 1.4 million Americans, they \nlost $300 on average per week. That is not fair. This is America, the \nland of opportunity. People who work hard are supposed to be rewarded--\nbut not during the last 30 years.\n  The middle class has lost 10 percent of their income, and that \ndoesn't take into consideration the poor--the poor. There are more poor \nthan ever in America. The middle class, we know, is being squeezed out \nof existence. It is time for us to take care of these people who are \ndesperate for help. That is what the government is all about.\n  Looking back at my home life, I feel government has been good for the \npeople who live in my little town of Searchlight. It is a town mostly \nof old people. Many of them are getting pensions from wherever they \nworked. They get Social Security. But the government has done so many \ngood things. Let us not denigrate government. This is a time when \npeople have no opportunity. They need government help. They are \ndesperate. All they want is one job, but they know if there is a \nvacancy over here, there are going to be scores--and we have seen this \nin the news accounts of job opportunities--thousands of people showing \nup for sometimes just a handful of jobs.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                         Unemployment Insurance\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on the unemployment insurance bill, \nthere have been productive conversations between the majority leader \nand several Members on this side. The Republicans have offered numerous \ncommonsense proposals to get to a conclusion. Ideally, we would have \nspent the past week voting on those proposals, so there is really no \ngood reason for us to be in the position that we are in right now.\n  Let me just underscore some of the things on my side that we would \nlike to see in the final product. First, the Senate should actually be \npaying for whatever it passes, and not with spending cuts 11 years from \nnow that we know aren't going to happen. It is also reasonable to \nexpect practical progrowth job creation measures so we can actually get \npeople back to work, and for a solution to be reasonable it should also \nrespect the right of our constituents to be heard on this issue through \na more open amendment process.\n  We have to get away from an attitude that essentially says the views \nof half the American people don't matter in the Senate. These days it \nhas gotten even worse than that; ideas on both sides are often \ncompletely ignored. That is just not how the Senate is supposed to \nwork. So we have an opportunity to begin to start fixing the problem on \nthe bill that is before us. It is the right thing to do. I am hopeful \ncommon sense will prevail.\n  (The further remarks of Mr. McConnell pertaining to the introduction \nof S. 1916 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I should first note I am pleased to see the \nPresiding Officer. It is a pleasure to share the podium with him today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that upon the completion of my remarks, the \nChair recognize the senior Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, after many long days and nights of four-\nparty negotiations across a dozen subcommittees over the past month, on \nSunday night the Appropriations Committee completed work on the fiscal \nyear 2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act.\n  I commend Chairwoman Mikulski, without whom this would not have been \npossible. It was, above all, her relentless pursuit of this goal and \nher unmatched ability to rally her subcommittee troops together to get \nus to this point.\n  I would also note that she was helped by some of the most hard \nworking members of the Senate staff one can imagine. I want to \nespecially commend Tim Rieser of my staff, and Janet Stormes and Nikole \nManatt who worked with him. I could not keep track of the number of \ntimes I received emails or calls at midnight or 1 a.m. from Tim as we \nworked through all the difficult parts of this bill.\n  And it could not have been done without the cooperation of my friend \nfrom Alabama Senator Shelby, the committee's ranking member, who knew \nhow important it was to pass appropriations bills rather than put the \ngovernment on autopilot.\n  This means there will be no sequester in fiscal year 2014, and there \nwill not be another disastrous government shutdown that achieved \nnothing, disrupted the lives of millions of American families, and cost \nthe taxpayers some $24 billion and private industry tens of billions of \ndollars more.\n  As Chairman of the Department of State and Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee, I want to thank Senator Lindsey Graham, who brings a \nlevel of energy and knowledge to our subcommittee few can match. He and \nI\n\n[[Page S301]]\n\nagree on an awful lot more than we disagree.\n  I want to mention a few things in the bill. But first, the big \npicture. For the Department of State and foreign operations, the bill \nprovides $49 billion in discretionary budget authority to protect a \nwide array of U.S. security, humanitarian, and economic interests \naround the world. This total is $2.2 billion below the fiscal year 2013 \nenacted post-sequester level.\n  Of that amount, $6.5 billion is for overseas contingency operations \nin Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq and other areas in political \ntransition, including the Middle East and North Africa, and to respond \nto humanitarian emergencies, particularly in Syria, the Middle East, \nand Central Africa.\n  If anyone should question why these funds are important, look at what \nis happening in Syria, and Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey, where 2 million \nSyrians have fled, and in South Sudan and the Central African Republic, \nwhere hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced because of an \nexplosion of ethnic and tribal violence. The bill provides significant \nincreases in funding for refugees and other humanitarian programs.\n  The bill provides funding above the President's request for security \nat U.S. embassies and other diplomatic facilities; it fully funds our \ncommitment to key allies such as Israel and Jordan; it substantially \nfunds our contributions to the United Nations and other international \norganizations and for U.N. peacekeeping; and it fully funds the U.S. \ncontributions to the Global AIDS Fund.\n  Many Senators care about global health, for good reason. HIV/AIDS and \nother infectious diseases threaten millions of Americans who travel, \nlive, study, and serve in the Armed Forces overseas as well as here at \nhome. Many of the diseases we work to eradicate are only an airplane \ntrip away from our own shores. Billions of people in the poorest \ncountries, especially children, die or suffer from illnesses that can \nbe easily prevented or treated. Our children and grandchildren will be \nimmunized, but many children born in the poorest countries die before \nthe age of five because of these diseases.\n  We provide a total of $6 billion--the highest amount in history--for \nprograms to combat HIV/AIDS, including $1.65 billion for the Global \nFund. We provide historic levels to combat polio, malaria, \ntuberculosis, and neglected tropical diseases, and $175 million for the \nGAVI Alliance which provides lifesaving children's vaccines.\n  For Egypt, which many have been asking about, the bill provides up to \nthe amounts requested for fiscal year 2014--$250 million for economic \naid and $1.3 billion for military aid. But the military aid is only \navailable to pay current defense contracts, and the goods and services \nmay not be delivered to Egypt unless the Secretary of State certifies \nthere is a national referendum and the government is taking steps to \nsupport the democratic transition and there are democratic elections \nand a newly elected government is taking steps to govern \ndemocratically.\n  These are the same commitments the government of Egypt made to the \nEgyptian people. Contrary to some inaccurate press reports, there is no \nwaiver if the Egyptian Government reneges on these commitments. These \nare the toughest conditions the Congress has imposed on aid to the \nEgyptian military.\n  We want to see the restoration of democracy and respect for \nfundamental freedoms in Egypt, including the rights of women, civil \nsociety, and religious minorities. This is discussed in the explanatory \nstatement accompanying the bill. If the military continues its \nrepressive tactics, arresting democracy activists, and does not hold \nfree and fair elections, the certifications will not be possible and \nU.S. aid will be cut.\n  The bill cuts aid for Afghanistan by 50 percent from the current \nlevel. It has become abundantly clear that as U.S. troops withdraw, the \nsecurity environment is worsening. This reality, coupled with the \nrefusal of the Karzai government to sign a bilateral security \nagreement, widespread corruption in that government, and the \ndiminishing ability to monitor how U.S. funds are spent, compel a more \ntargeted, sustainable approach.\n  I am pleased we were able to include the amounts requested for the \nClean Technology Fund and the Strategic Climate Fund, and to protect \ntropical forests which are being destroyed at an alarming rate, and to \ncombat poaching and trafficking of wildlife.\n  There are some things I wish were not in here, particularly a House \nprovision which would weaken limits on carbon emissions from projects \nfinanced by the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment \nCorporation. We should be using public funds to support exports of \nclean, renewable technology, not to fund polluting projects that worsen \nglobal warming.\n  I am also very disappointed that a Senate provision to bring the \nUnited States into compliance with the Vienna Convention on Consular \nRelations was rejected by the House of Representatives. By not \nincluding this provision we jeopardize the essential rights of consular \nassistance for Americans arrested in foreign countries, and we also \nweaken our credibility as a nation that respects the rule of law.\n  I would point out, the next time a constituent of a House Member is \narrested overseas and denied access to the U.S. embassy, they should \nask why they refused to support bringing the U.S. into compliance with \nthe treaty that requires that access. It is hard for us to insist on \nconsular assistance when Americans are arrested abroad, when we don't \nprovide the same right to foreigners arrested here.\n  I do appreciate, however, the way the House--particularly Chairwoman \nGranger and Ranking Member Lowey and their staffs--worked with me, \nSenator Graham and his very able staff, and others. And, we all owe a \ndebt of gratitude to the printing and editorial staff of the Government \nPrinting Office who worked day and night, week after week and on many \nweekends, to produce draft after draft of the documents. It was a \ncollaborative effort from beginning to end, and the outcome is a \nbalanced bill that deserves bipartisan support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. About 20 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that I be given 10 minutes and \nthat Senator Schumer be given the remaining 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, pending before the Congress now is debate \nabout unemployment benefits.\n  On January 1 1.3 million Americans got a notice that they were not \ngoing to receive any more unemployment benefit checks. These are people \nout of work through no fault of their own who are required, under law, \nto be actively pursuing additional employment and regularly reporting \nto the government. For that, they receive average unemployment benefits \nof about $300 a week. Three hundred dollars a week is not a generous \namount in this day and age. It is very difficult for any family to get \nby. They are going to have to dip into their savings to make rent \npayments, utility payments, put gas in the car to look for a job, and \npay for the cell telephone they need in order to go looking for work. \nSo we are now debating as to whether we should extend those \nunemployment benefits which were cut off on January 1. I think we \nshould. Historically we have. Even with lower unemployment rates in the \npast, we have extended unemployment benefits.\n\n  Think about this for a second. The average person unemployed in \nAmerica takes 38 weeks to find a job. However, we are cutting off \nunemployment benefits at 27 weeks in most places. That means people \nwill have 10 or 11 weeks on average without any support.\n  What happens to a family under those circumstances? Awful things \nhappen. They cannot make their rent payments or their mortgage payment \nor the utility payments or their health payments, and they find \nthemselves literally facing bankruptcy. Losing a job is bad enough. \nMaking it worse by cutting off unemployment checks is unacceptable. So \nwe are debating it.\n  Historically, we have extended these unemployment benefits on an \nemergency basis, which means we do not pay for them because we \nunderstand this is an unusual time in our economy when we need to give \na helping hand. We also understand the money that we\n\n[[Page S302]]\n\ngive to these families is frequently spent immediately. They have to \nspend it to get by. As they put money back in the economy, it helps \nother people go to work. So it is a bit of an accelerant. It is a \ncatalyst for more economic growth. It is good for the overall economy.\n  However, we have run into something new. The Republican side of the \naisle has now said if you want to give unemployment benefits to \nAmericans, you have to pay for them. In other words, you have to cut \nspending in other areas to pay for them.\n  Listen to what the Republicans have suggested we should do in order \nto provide unemployment benefits for 1.3 million people who were cut \noff on January 1. Mitch McConnell, the senior Senator from Kentucky and \nRepublican leader, came to the floor and suggested last week that the \nway to pay for the unemployment benefits was to eliminate that section \nof the Affordable Care Act which creates a personal responsibility for \npeople to buy their own health insurance and a tax to be paid if they \ndo not, about $95 a person per year. He says eliminate that.\n  The problem with eliminating it is you do raise some revenue, but on \nthe other hand you cut off the pool of uninsured people who are now \nbuying insurance. By doing this, you eliminate the protection we built \ninto the law for every American family that has someone in the \nhousehold with a preexisting condition. You cannot say to insurance \ncompanies and others cover everyone, even those with preexisting \nconditions, unless you expand the pool of people insured. Senator \nMcConnell wants to cut that off. Senator McConnell's proposal would, in \nfact, eliminate this protection in our bill against discrimination \nbecause your child has asthma, your child has diabetes, your wife is a \ncancer survivor.\n  That was the reality of insurance before this bill. The Republicans \nbelieve that eliminating that protection is the way to pay for \nunemployment benefits. They would penalize 300 million Americans and \ntheir families in order to take care of 1.3 million unemployed on a \ntemporary basis. That is a terrible tradeoff.\n  Then comes Senator Portman from Ohio. He has a little different \napproach. He suggests that if you are disabled in America, adjudged \ndisabled in America, you should never draw unemployment benefits. \n``Double dipping'' is what they call it.\n  Wait a minute. You are getting a government check that says you are \ndisabled, and you are getting another government check that says you \nare unemployed? What is wrong with this picture?\n  I invite him--and I am sure the Presiding Officer has done this--to \nthe sheltered workshops of his State. If you have ever visited a \nsheltered workshop, here is what you will find, and I found it in \nDecatur, IL: Profoundly retarded people and people with serious mental \nchallenges are given a chance to work a little bit. They can make only \nabout $1,000 a month maximum. What kind of work do they get? Much of it \nis very simple manual labor. In my State they make license plates at \nthis facility in Decatur.\n  They told me the story about a person who was brought in there who \nhad suffered from serious mental illness his entire life and was \nnonfunctional. He just stood there. They brought him in and put him on \nthe line with the license plates and showed him a simple task. He \nblossomed. His life opened. He became a different person. He started \naccepting more and more responsibilities. There came a point when there \nwas a blizzard in Decatur, IL, and they closed the sheltered workshop. \nHe was not going to miss a day of work. He walked in the snow and stood \noutside, ready to go to work.\n  The people working in that sheltered workshop are only paid a few \ndollars an hour, but for him it is the most important part of his life, \nand while he is being paid, his unemployment benefits are building up \nto protect him. The day may come when the sheltered workshop can't find \na job for him or closes down. He would then be eligible for \nunemployment benefits. Senator Portman of Ohio says no, we should cut \noff his unemployment benefits to pay for the temporary unemployment \nbenefits of others. I invite Senator Portman to go to a sheltered \nworkshop in his State to meet these people, and I bet he changes his \nmind on that Republican pay-for.\n  Then comes Senator Ayotte of New Hampshire. She says we have a \nterrible situation with the child tax credit. The child tax credit is \navailable for wage earners who can claim a credit on the tax they owe \nand a refundable credit as well, in some circumstances, for their \nchildren. In other words, if you are low-income in America, we reduce \nyour tax burden based on the number of children you have. The obvious \nreason is to give you $1,000 more a year for your child, $20 a week for \nyour child. That, to me, is not unreasonable. It alleviates poverty for \nliterally millions of Americans. Senator Ayotte says for those who are \nfiling a so-called I-10; that is, those who do not have a Social \nSecurity number but work in America and pay taxes as they are required \nto do, she would cut them off so they could not claim this child tax \ncredit for their children even if their child is a U.S. citizen, and \nthat is the requirement under the law. So she would cut off child \nbenefits for citizen children to pay for temporary unemployment \nbenefits.\n  We can clean up the child tax credit situation, and I think there are \nways to do it in a reasonable fashion, but to cut off millions of \nchildren who are legally here in the United States, eligible for this \nchild tax credit--is that what we have come to? Cut off a child tax \ncredit? Eliminate the help for those who are working in sheltered \nworkshops, disabled people cross America? Eliminate the protection \nunder the Affordable Care Act for discrimination against people with \npreexisting conditions? Those are the three Republican alternatives? \nDoes that define the difference between the parties?\n  I am afraid it does. It tells you from our point of view that helping \nfolks who need a helping hand in this country is just part of who we \nare. There is a compassion gap here when you believe the only way you \ncan help some is by hurting so many others who are struggling to get by \nin life, and that is all we heard from the other side of the aisle.\n  I commend those who want to work on a bipartisan basis to solve this, \nbut let's get it done. Let's extend these unemployment benefits. Do it \nas we did 5 different times, without paying for it, under previous \nRepublican Presidents. Let's do it in a fashion that speaks well of our \ncountry. Let's give those folks who are searching for jobs a helping \nhand so their families can stay together during these winter months, \nthese challenging months, so they can get back to work and pay their \ntaxes and be right where they want to be, a part of the workforce of \nthe future.\n  I yield the floor to Senator Schumer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague and friend \nand roommate from Illinois--we are going to miss our landlord deeply--\nfor his articulate enunciation of where we are here. We have always \nextended unemployment benefits, and we have done it, in most instances, \nin a bipartisan way and not paid for it. Under George Bush, 2007, \nunemployment was only 5.6 percent. Now it hovers around 7 percent. He \nmoved it forward. It had bipartisan support.\n  Things have evolved. I guess we do not have that bipartisan support. \nAs Senator Durbin outlined, a lot of the amendments to try to pay for \nthis sort of rob Peter to pay Paul. I have heard a lot of my Republican \ncolleagues say let's talk about how we deal with poverty. These \namendments that we have heard talked about are kind of punitive and do \nnot really deal with the issue.\n  I would like to address another issue, and that is how we come to an \nagreement here and get this place working again. On both sides of the \naisle, there is a great deal of consternation that we are not \nlegislating. We have had this problem for a while. Thursday it came to \na head. There were some harsh words that were issued by some. The \nquestion is how do we get things working again.\n  First, I remind my colleagues there are instances when this place, \nthe Senate in particular, is still working. We had a farm bill, an \nimmigration bill, the WRDA bill. They all had one thing in common and \nthat is the chairman and ranking member agreed on a proposal. When the \nchairman and the ranking member agree on a proposal,\n\n[[Page S303]]\n\nor a large group of Democrats and Republicans agree on a bipartisan \nproposal--in immigration we had great help from the chairman, but \nSenator McCain and I--neither chairman nor ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee--came to an agreement with the help of Senators \nMenendez, Durbin, Bennet, Graham, Flake and Rubio. But we can get \nsomething done, and we can shepherd even the most controversial and \ndifficult legislation through the floor.\n  But there are many instances--these days more than ever because the \nparties are further apart than they used to be and there is less \noverlap--there are instances where the chair and ranking member can't \nor there does not seem to be a bipartisan agreement. What do we do in \nthose instances?\n  I have discussed this with many on the other side of the aisle. There \nis a tradition here. I am here sort of a middle level amount of time, \nabout 14 years. The general theory has been whichever party is in the \nmajority, whichever is in the minority, that the majority gets to set \nthe agenda and the minority gets to offer amendments. There is a lot of \ndiscussion as to why that is not happening anymore, and there are \ndifferent explanations on each side of the aisle. There will be a \ndiscussion in our caucus, and I think in the Republican caucus, at this \nlunch, as to how to try to break that logjam. That is a good thing.\n  I will just make one point here that has been largely forgotten and \nthat is this. There are two parts to this sort of agreement, deal, \narrangement. The first part is the ability to offer amendments. Should \nit be unlimited amendments? Should it be all nongermane amendments? \nThat has to be discussed and worked out. But certainly the minority \nshould get to offer amendments. There is a general theoretical \nagreement among everybody about that.\n  But the other side is that the majority should be able, once the \namendments are disposed of, to get an up-or-down vote on the final \npassage of the bill--that the bill not be filibustered--not just the \nmotion to proceed, but once we go through the amendatory process, the \nbill itself.\n  If friends on the other side of the aisle say I want to offer my \namendment but unless it passes I am going to vote to block the bill \nfrom coming up for an up-or-down vote, that does not seem right. My \npurpose for a brief few moments, coming to the floor, is to remind both \nsides of the aisle, but particularly my Republican colleagues, that to \nget this place moving again requires two things. One, an ability to \noffer amendments. But second, an ability to vote on final passage, have \nan up-or-down vote on final passage once those amendments are disposed \nof one way or the other.\n  We know that our colleagues will offer tough amendments sometimes. \nThat is the nature of things. Many times the amendments are just \noffered with an idea to improve the bill or have a different idea. \nSometimes they are amendments that just make it very difficult to vote \nagainst, but so be it. That is how this place has always been run. I \nthink most of my colleagues on this side of the aisle are willing to \naccept that. But at the same time, we do not want to go through an \namendatory process and then, because we are 55, not 60, never be able \nto get an up-or-down vote on final passage of the legislation.\n  There are two sides to this story. There are two sides to an \nagreement to get the floor of the Senate working again--particularly \nwhen the majority and minority cannot agree on an overall bill. One \nside is an ability to offer amendments; the other side an ability for \nan up-or-down vote once those amendments are disposed of. I don't think \nyou can have one without the other.\n  Just as we could not ask our Republican colleagues for an up-or-down \nvote, if they were not able to offer amendments, I don't think it is \nfair for our Republican colleagues to ask us to go through the \namendatory process, some of which will be difficult, and then not get \nan up-or-down vote on final passage.\n  That is the little piece I wanted to say here. I hope it will help \nbring us together because the greatest fun I have had in this place and \nthe greatest effectiveness I have had in this place is when I worked in \na bipartisan way on bill after bill. It happens less frequently now. \nAlthough, as I said, the immigration bill is an exception to that, and \nother bills are an exception to that. But maybe we can get back to \nworking together if each side tries to understand the grievances and \nthe gravamen of the position of the other.\n  I hope we can do that on this bill and on many other bills in the \nfuture.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, it is no secret that every Republican in \nthis Chamber, every Senator on this side of the aisle voted against the \nPresident's health care law. We said it would do great harm to the \nAmerican people, and we are finding out that is true. It is also no \nsecret that every Democrat in the Senate voted in favor of the health \ncare law. It was partisan, it was a bad idea, and it has failed the \ncountry in many ways.\n  People know about the health care Web site. The Web site was a \nspectacular public failure, and that was just the tip of the iceberg. \nWhen we look under the iceberg, we see that people are being hit with \nhigher premiums and canceled coverage. Five million people lost their \ncoverage around the country. People were not able to keep the doctor \nthey had and liked in spite of the President's promise that if you like \nyour doctor, you can keep your doctor. There are concerns about higher \ncopays and deductibles, and fraud and identity theft is also an issue \nthat is plaguing all of America. I believe the health care Web site is \na spot where we are going to see more problems in that area. Americans \nknow that fraud and identity theft are big concerns. It has been clear \nfrom the start that the health care exchange was vulnerable to con \nartists and hackers. Information from the government actually went out \ntelling people to be careful with their information because of the \nconcerns about con artists and hackers. So that is a problem, and it is \nsomething Washington and this body need to take seriously.\n  Whenever President Obama talks about the health care law, he says \nthat if Republicans have good ideas, please bring them forward, share \nthem, and he will support them. Republicans have offered a lot of ideas \non how to give the American people the health care reform they wanted \nall along. We passed bills in the House of Representatives. We tried to \nbring up bills here in the Senate. Democrats won't even allow us to \nvote on those bills in the Senate.\n  As a doctor, I can tell you what people are looking for with health \ncare reform. They want access to quality, affordable health care--care \nthey need from a doctor they choose at lower costs. They didn't get \nthat with the health care law the President and the Democrats shoved \ndown the throats of the American people. Every time the majority \nleader--at that desk--blocks reform, I believe he is making things \nworse for millions of Americans.\n  We are trying again to take the President at his word that he will \nsupport good Republican ideas. Senator Johanns of Nebraska and I have \nintroduced a commonsense bill that will help protect Americans who use \nthe government insurance exchange. Our bill, called the Health Exchange \nSecurity and Transparency Act, requires the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to notify Americans within 2 business days if their \npersonal information has been stolen due to security breaches on the \nexchanges. We are not saying it is going to happen, but it sure could \nhappen, and if it does people need to be informed.\n  The House passed a version of this bill last Friday, and it was \nclearly a bipartisan bill. Sixty-seven Democrats joined Republicans to \nsupport this good idea. Now I believe it is our turn here in the \nSenate. There shouldn't be anything controversial about this at all. \nThis should be the kind of bill we can pass by unanimous consent.\n  After forcing so many Americans to buy insurance through this \nprogram, I\n\n[[Page S304]]\n\nbelieve it is the government's responsibility to safeguard Americans' \nprivate information. Even Senators who voted for the President's health \ncare law should agree with this. That should be the minimum we require \nfrom Washington--keep Americans' private information private. If the \ngovernment fails to keep that information safe, they should have to \nadmit it and tell people what happened.\n  This bill is a single page. Americans are concerned about their \nsafety online, about having their identity stolen, and this bill would \ngive people at least the reassurance that they would be informed, that \nif there is identity theft, they would know about it.\n  Look at what just happened to the Target stores. It now looks as if \n70 million people had their personal data compromised. Target ran a \nfull-page ad in the Washington Post talking about what happened with \ntheir 70 million customers. They apologized for it. The same ad that \nran here in the Washington Post also ran in the New York Times, the \nWall Street Journal, and other papers around the country. Target has \ntold people about the security breach so they can take appropriate \nsteps and watch for signs of identity theft. Target also said they will \ndo free credit checks for a year and addressed the concerns many \nAmerican people have and said: This is how we will take care of it. All \nthe bill we are offering today says is that if something happens--as \nhappened with Target--on the government's health exchange Web site, \nWashington should do the same. They should tell people that someone has \nhad access to their personal information so people can protect \nthemselves.\n  The health care law was completely inadequate in how it dealt with \npersonal security issues. The Web site has been a debacle, and we know \nthat. It is a hacker's dream. Even before the Web site was launched \nlast March, it was a mess.\n  CBS News reported that deadlines for the site's final security plans \nwere delayed three times over the summer. So we saw that problem. Final \nend-to-end security tests were never finished before the Web site was \nlaunched.\n  In November, after the Web site was launched, four experts testified \nbefore the House about Web site problems. They were asked: Would any of \nyou advise an American citizen to use this Web site as the security \nsystem now exists? Not one of the four experts said they would--none.\n  By December, one of those same industry experts said that the \nsituation was even worse. The so-called fixes caused new security \npatterns and problems. Remember, that was after the White House was \nclaiming it had fixed the Web site. What they had fixed was just the \ntip of the iceberg, and these problems under the tip continue today.\n  So the House passed a bill on Friday by an overwhelming bipartisan \nmajority, and the President still says he opposes it. Why would the \nPresident oppose this bill? Why would he oppose being honest with the \nAmerican people in helping them protect themselves from identity theft? \nPresident Obama has dug in his heels so deep on his health care law \nthat he won't even consider good bipartisan ideas that will help the \nAmerican people. Senator Johanns and I are going to continue to push \nfor a vote and to call on the President to support this bill.\n\n  The President needs to keep his promise to support good Republican \nideas and to protect the American people from identity theft. As I \nsaid, this is just the tip of the iceberg with the Web site. All one \nhas to do is go to this morning's newspapers.\n  The Washington Post, above the fold, front page: ``Insurance sign-ups \nby young adults lag. Key measure for health-care law. Premiums could \njump if more don't enroll.'' Higher premiums, that is what I am hearing \nfrom home in Wyoming.\n  Today's Wall Street Journal: ``Health Sign-ups Skew Older, Raising \nFears of Higher Costs.'' That is not what the President promised. The \nPresident came to the floor of the House of Representatives in a joint \nsession of Congress and said: If you like your coverage, you can keep \nyour coverage. If you like your doctor, you can keep our doctor. He \nsaid insurance premiums would drop for people. He made statements over \nthe past years that under his plan insurance policies would drop $2,500 \nper family. Why is the New York Times saying premiums could jump? The \nPresident says one thing; the rest of the world sees another.\n  The New York Times today, again, front page, above the fold: ``Older \nPeople Lead Sign-Ups For Insurance. Pattern Could Result in Higher \nPremiums.'' There are questions about the law's financial viability.\n  The President put together a program, and those of us who actually \nread the bill ahead of time had great concerns about its success, its \nviability, its ability to deliver what it promised. The President's \npromises, one of which has now been called the lie of the year, \ncontinue. It has been called that by a group that looks at statements \nand is somewhat of a referee as political statements are made. To get \nthat kind of an accomplishment for the President just shows how \nmisleading the efforts have been on the American people.\n  The American people see what they are getting in their mail--\ncancellation notices. They see what happens when they go to the Web \nsite: higher premiums, sticker shock, and now this threat of ongoing \nsecurity concerns, especially in light of what is occurring throughout \nthe rest of the country.\n  It is time for the President to keep his word that he does want to \nwork with Republicans for good ideas, and he could do so by adopting \nthis measure passed by the House on Friday that Senator Johanns and I \nhave presented to the Senate for approval today.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                              TPA Renewal\n\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate my colleagues \non the recent introduction of legislation to promote trade promotion \nauthority.\n  Increasing free trade levels the playing field for U.S. companies. We \nall know that. It increases competition. We know that too. It also \nincreases access to foreign markets, with all the attendant benefits. \nU.S. businesses stand the best chance to see gains in accessing foreign \nmarkets through bilateral and regional free-trade agreements. Given the \ncomplexity of these agreements, the consultation process and the \nexpedited consideration provided by TPA is really the only way to go.\n  According to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the United \nStates is ``the world's largest economy and the largest exporter and \nimporter of goods and services.'' We exported more than $2.2 trillion \nin goods and services last year.\n  For those of us who represent border States, the issue hits very \nclose to home. In recent years Mexico has become America's third \nlargest trading partner and our second largest export market. According \nto the Arizona-Mexico Commission, Arizona's ports of entry serve as \ngateways for $26 billion in U.S.-Mexican trade annually. Arizona \nbenefits from more than $13 billion in bilateral trade with Mexico \nevery year.\n  Given the benefits of vibrant export markets and access to low-cost \nimports, it is difficult to overstate the importance of getting trade \nagreements in place. A U.S. Chamber official recently noted in Roll \nCall that nearly half of U.S. exports go to our free-trade agreement \npartners and that these countries make up just one-tenth of the world \neconomy. Let me repeat that. Half of our exports go to those countries \nwith which we have free-trade agreements. Yet those countries represent \njust one-tenth of the world's economy. That tells us the importance of \ngetting these free-trade agreements in place.\n  In a recent opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal, former U.S. \nTrade Representative Robert Zoellick noted that ``on average, in the \npast five years of a new free-trade agreement, U.S. exports grew nearly \nthree to four times as rapidly as U.S. exports to others.''\n  This is great news given that negotiations on the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership, or TPP, are ongoing. Its successful approval would yield \nthe largest free-trade agreement the United States has ever been a part \nof. Approval of the TPP agreement would provide increased access to \ncritical Asia-Pacific markets for U.S. businesses at a critical time. \nIt is difficult to see how this agreement will be concluded without TPA \nreauthorization.\n\n[[Page S305]]\n\n  Given that a 2010 study prepared by the Business Roundtable found \nthat 38 million jobs--1 in 5 jobs in the United States--are supported \nby trade, the introduction of TPA renewal legislation couldn't be more \ntimely.\n  Again, I congratulate my colleagues for the introduction of this \nlegislation. I look forward to its consideration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                             OSHA Policies\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to acknowledge \nmy colleagues in the Senate for standing up for family farms. I am also \nhere to issue a very straightforward warning to OSHA: The Senate makes \ncrystal clear in the new appropriations bill that OSHA policies and \ninspectors better get in line with the law.\n  Since 1976 Congress has included specific language in appropriations \nbills very specifically prohibiting OSHA from enforcement action on \nfarms with 10 or fewer employees. However, this did not stop the agency \nfrom distorting the definitions of farming practices in sending \ninspectors to small family-owned farming operations anyway.\n  In my home State of Nebraska, OSHA targeted a family farm that grows \ncorn and soybeans and has just one nonfamily employee. It is clearly \nwithin the scope of the congressional exemption. As do most American \nfarms, this farming operation includes grain bins for crop storage \nafter harvest. But according to OSHA's absurd logic, grain storage, \nthey say, is not part of farming operations, so it is not exempt from \nthe regulations. I can't make this stuff up. While OSHA made no claim \nthat anyone on the farm had been injured, the agency said the grain \nbins failed to comply with OSHA regulations, and--get this--they \nslapped the farm with fines totaling $132,000.\n  This is not an issue that is confined to one farm in Nebraska. A 2011 \nmemo from OSHA's enforcement chief to regional administrators \nacknowledged that the law prevents the agency from regulating small \nfarms. They got that right. However, the memo proceeds to recategorize \nfarming operations that happen after harvest, and OSHA said those are \nnot exempt. Under this recategorization, OSHA claimed that its \ninspectors had the authority to regulate small family-owned farms and \ntheir grain storage facilities. This is a blatant overreach and yet \nanother example of this administration's backdoor rulemaking.\n  Whenever I meet with farmers and ranchers in Nebraska, they \noftentimes raise concerns about Federal regulatory overreach. It is \nabsolutely no wonder farmers and ranchers feel as though they have a \ntarget on their backs. OSHA's twisting of the law serves as evidence \nthat farmers' concerns are legitimate.\n  In response to OSHA's regulatory overreach, I wrote a letter to \nSecretary Perez, joined by a bipartisan group of 42 of my Senate \ncolleagues. We requested that OSHA immediately stop its unlawful \nregulation of family farms. We also directed OSHA to issue updated \nguidance correcting its obvious misinterpretation of the law.\n  I am pleased that the Omnibus appropriations bill further reinforces \nour position through report language specifically addressing OSHA's \noverreach while continuing the long-standing small-farm exemption. The \nreport language calls on OSHA to work with USDA before moving forward \nwith any attempts to redefine and regulate post-harvest activities such \nas storing grain. It also makes it clear that the exemption applies to \nthose activities that occur on the farm. That includes the entire \nfarming operation.\n  I thank my 42 colleagues who joined me in signing the letter, as well \nas my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for sending a clear \nmessage that Federal agencies are not above the law. As I stated \nearlier, small family-owned farms have been exempt from OSHA \nregulations for the past 35 years. This is not a new concept. Simply \nput, this language reaffirms the commonsense ideas that Federal \nagencies cannot and should not bypass the law by redefining it to \nexpand their jurisdiction.\n  Let me be clear that we all want farms and ranches to be safe. In \nfact, a safe working environment is especially important for small \nfarmers and ranchers whose families are oftentimes the only ones who \nwork the farm or the ranch. Small family farms and ranches in my home \nState and across this country should be able to continue their work to \nfeed and fuel the world without fear of being targeted by this \nadministration in direct violation of the law. If the administration \nbelieves the law should be changed, they should come to Congress and \nmake their case. They should not ignore the law as if it does not \nexist.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for affirming the law of the land and \nsupporting our Nation's farmers and ranchers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Military COLAs\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to discuss my growing concern about \nthe effects of our actions--or in this case inaction--in Washington on \nour military families and veterans in Virginia. As we all know, the \nSenate and House passed the Bipartisan Budget Act last month, which \nhopefully will be a first step toward getting us back on the right \ntrack toward a functioning Congress. But I was disappointed--and I know \nmany of my colleagues were disappointed--that in that legislation was \nincluded a reduction in military pension cost-of-living adjustments for \nretired and medically retired servicemembers. Our service men and women \ndeserve much better than seeing their pensions arbitrarily cut by \nlawmakers in Washington. What was particularly disappointing was that \nthis action singled out our military families and veterans \ndisproportionately.\n  Yesterday evening, the appropriations committees released their 2014 \nbudget. I was pleased their omnibus budget proposal repeals the COLA \ncuts for a portion of those military families--for those disabled \nmilitary retirees who are medically retired and for survivors of \nmilitary retirees who elected to pay survivor benefit annuities to take \ncare of their families after their deaths. This is progress. But I hope \nwe can finish the job and pass an amendment I have been working on with \nSenators Shaheen and McCain and a series of other proposals to make \nsure we fully roll back this unfair cut to our military families and \nveterans.\n  We know over the last two decades our military has fought two wars. \nTheir families have made unprecedented sacrifices. Unfortunately, this \nsacrifice was again brought home last week when a Navy MH-53E \nhelicopter crashed off the coast of Virginia Beach. Our thoughts and \nprayers are with the families of the missing and fallen: LT Sean \nChristopher Snyder, LT Wesley Van Dorn, and Navy Aircrewman Brian \nAndrew Collins.\n  Virginia is home to one of the Nation's largest concentrations of \nActive-Duty and retired military personnel. I consider it an honor and \na privilege to represent them in Congress. So while we are shutting \ndown government and signing short-term CRs, the pensions of our service \nmen and women are being unfairly singled out. This isn't right, this \nisn't fair, and my hope is that today and over the next few days we \nwill fully correct the mistake we made in the Budget Act last month.\n  In my time in the Senate, working for our military families and \nveterans has been one of my top priorities. I am proud I have \nrelentlessly worked across the aisle on this issue. I would like to \npoint out one particular action where we have made dramatic progress.\n  I have worked with the Puller Clinic at William & Mary Law School in \nHampton Roads to develop a model for veterans legal clinics to help \nsolve the Nation's backlog of veterans' benefits claims. To my mind it \nis an embarrassment that our veterans sometimes have to wait for over 1 \nyear to get their claims processed to receive the benefits they have \nalready earned.\n  Working with the William & Mary Puller Law Clinic, we got the VA to \naccept this model and to be certified by the VA to become the first law \nschool in the country to be able to complete fully developed claims. \nNow 19 universities in Virginia are committed to serving veterans and \nmore than 15 law\n\n[[Page S306]]\n\nschools across the country have adopted the William & Mary model.\n  The incredible thing about this project--and we often use the term \n``win-win-win''--is this truly is a win-win-win. It is a win for the \ntaxpayers because there are no taxpayer funds involved, it is a win for \nour veterans who are able to get their claims processed in a more rapid \nand expeditious manner, and it is a win for the law students who gain \nvaluable experience in both dealing with a large Federal agency--the \nVA--but, more importantly, being able to help one-on-one veterans who \ndeserve to get their benefits.\n  I have also worked with my friends and former Virginia colleague Jim \nWebb to draft legislation for a complete comprehensive look at military \ncompensation and retirement. We have worked with Chairman Levin as \nwell, and this Commission will be reporting later this year. I look \nforward to the results because we do have to recognize our overall \ncompensation and benefits packages need an overall review. I believe \nthis Commission will make strong recommendations on how we can both \nmodernize and achieve fiscal stability for our military.\n  I am proud of the work I have done on veterans' issues in terms of \nthe Puller Clinic, in terms of the overall look at the military \ncompensation package as part of an effort to make sure we honor our \ncommitment to our military. But as we honor that commitment to our \nmilitary, we have to recognize as well that threats to our Nation are \nnot just those posed by outside forces but also the continuing threat \nof our increasing debt and deficit. I often like to cite former \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mullen, who said the \nsingle largest threat to our Nation was not the threat of terrorists \nbut the threat of that $17 trillion debt and deficit, which goes up by \nover $4 billion a night--a debt burden that may weigh down our ability \nto compete in the future.\n  I continue to come to the floor--not always successfully--to suggest \nto my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that we cannot continue to \npunt on this issue; that, ultimately, both political parties are going \nto have to give. We are going to have to find ways to generate \nadditional revenues through a comprehensive reform of our Tax Code. We \nare going to have to find a way to make sure that not only the promise \nof military pensions and benefits but also the promise of Social \nSecurity and Medicare will be here for future generations. That means \nboth political parties will have to be willing to give on their sacred \ncows.\n  We have to make sure as well, if we put together this comprehensive \napproach on debt and deficit, that it will provide the kind of \nfinancial stability to our military families, making sure those \npensions, benefits, and other kinds of compensation packages will be \nthere for themselves and for future people who serve. But that is for a \nfuture battle. Right now we have to finish the work the Appropriations \nCommittee started on getting rid of this unfair attack on the military \nCOLAs that was included in the Budget Act.\n  I hope my colleagues will join my friends, Senator Kaine and Senator \nShaheen and others, to replace the cuts to the military COLAs. The \napproach we have taken would do this by closing a tax loophole that \nallows some corporations to actually avoid paying their fair share of \ntaxes. There may be other alternatives as well. I will look at any that \nare fair and reasonable and make sure our military families don't get \nsingled out.\n  Virginians have served with honor in our military for generations, \nand I want to assure our service men and women there is ample time to \nundo these changes before they take effect. I would remind those who \nare listening this decrease in the COLA doesn't actually take place \nuntil next year, so we still have time to rectify this.\n  I promise to continue using every tool I can to fight these unfair \npension cuts and to make sure the promises we have made to our military \nfamilies and these retirees gets honored.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nthe damage ObamaCare is doing to our struggling economy.\n  After months of unrelenting coverage of ObamaCare's many problems and \nafter Friday's release of December's dismal job report, I am sure \nDemocrats in the Senate would prefer we talk about almost anything \nelse. After all, when you have held most of the power here in \nWashington for the last 5 years, you don't want to mention the fact \nthat your main legacy is a sluggish economy and a disastrous train \nwreck of a health care program.\n  This past Friday we found out December marked the weakest month of \njob growth since January 2011. The economy added just 74,000 jobs in \nDecember--less than half of the monthly job growth needed for a real \nrecovery.\n  Some are saying perhaps this is an aberration, and perhaps it was for \na 1-month period. But the one thing we can't get away from is that \nDecember's drop in the unemployment rate--the slight drop that we saw \nas a percentage--was driven by nearly 350,000 Americans dropping out of \nthe workforce altogether, driving the labor participation rate to its \nlowest level in 36 years. We haven't seen the labor participation rate \nthis low since the Carter administration.\n  Had millions of Americans not stopped looking for work since January \nof 2009, the unemployment rate would be a staggering 10.8 percent. What \nI mean is if the labor participation rate were today what it was in \n2009--in other words, the number of Americans actually in the labor \nforce looking for jobs--the unemployment rate would be almost 11 \npercent, a significantly higher number than what we use as the official \nunemployment rate today. Even without that, the Wall Street Journal \npoints out that ``the unemployment rate remains near levels previously \nseen only during recessions.''\n  Let me repeat that: The Wall Street Journal states that ``the \nunemployment rate remains near levels previously seen only during \nrecessions.'' That is a pretty damning statement.\n  The President and his advisers would like us to believe that \nPresident Obama's policies are growing our economy and putting \nAmericans back to work. But in the 5 years of his Presidency, all \nDemocrats have been able to accomplish is a recovery that looks a lot \nlike other Presidents' recessions.\n  In his weekly address on Saturday, the President said he would do \n``everything I can to create new jobs and new opportunities for \nAmerican families.''\n  How does he propose to do that? By treating the symptoms, not the \ncauses, of economic stagnation. Economic bandaids like the President \nproposes may temporarily help a few Americans, but they will do nothing \nto bring about the real long-term job growth our country needs. \nUnfortunately, the President's policies are actually hurting already \nstruggling middle-class families and making it more difficult for \nbusinesses to grow and create jobs.\n  Chief among the President's failed policies is the massive boondoggle \nknown as the Affordable Care Act. If there is one thing you don't want \nin an economy where businesses are already struggling, it is \nlegislation that places everything from new taxes to burdensome new \nregulations on businesses, and yet that is exactly what ObamaCare does.\n  There is a tax on medical devices, like pacemakers and prosthetics, \nwhich is driving medical device jobs overseas and driving medical bills \nup for American patients. There is a pill tax, which is a tax on \nprescription drugs. There is a tax on businesses that do not provide a \ngovernment-approved health care. There are multiple taxes on health \ninsurance companies, and more.\n  Then there are the scores of new regulations which raise the cost of \ndoing business--regulations like the requirement that any business with \n50 or more workers provide ObamaCare-approved health insurance benefits \nto its full-time employees, which the health care law defines as 30 \nhours or more per week. That is all very well for some employers, but \nfor many employers in industries with small profit margins, providing \nObama-approved health care to full-time workers is the difference\n\n[[Page S307]]\n\nbetween making a profit and making none at all. For employers in \nnonprofit fields like education, it can be the difference between \nstaying in operation or closing.\n  Around the country, school systems, community colleges and \nuniversities, restaurants, and other small businesses are being forced \nto cut workers' hours to avoid the full burden of ObamaCare's mandate. \nIt is no wonder the health care law is so unpopular with the owners of \nbusinesses, both large and small.\n  CBS News reported in December:\n\n       Nearly half of U.S. companies said they are reluctant to \n     hire full-time employees because of the law.\n\n  A survey from the National Association of Manufacturers found that \nmore than 75 percent of manufacturers cite soaring health care costs as \nthe biggest issue facing their businesses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. In addition to being bad for business's bottom line, \nObamaCare is placing a tremendous financial burden on American \nfamilies.\n  The President claimed his health care law would reduce the cost of \nhealth care, but the average family has seen a $2,500 premium increase \nsince the law's passage--and now that the law is being fully \nimplemented, that number is set to soar even higher.\n  One of my constituents, Carrie, emailed me to tell me she may have to \ntake a part-time job to afford the health care premium she was quoted \nfor a family of 6. That is a part-time job on top of the two part-time \njobs she already works and the full-time job her husband works.\n  Another constituent, Matt from Rapid City, SD, emailed to tell me his \ninsurance has gone up 60 percent. Meanwhile, his wife's hours at work \nhave been reduced below the ObamaCare full-time threshold of 30 hours. \n``We have had to cut back on basic needs,'' he told me.\n  Terry contacted me to tell me his insurance policy was cancelled, and \nthat he was offered a replacement policy for twice the cost of his \noriginal policy. ``Now \\1/4\\ of my salary will go to my insurance.'' \nThat is a quarter of his salary.\n  Is this the affordable care Americans were promised?\n  Democrats claim they want to grow the economy, but what do they think \nhappens to the economy when businesses aren't growing and people aren't \nspending? When Americans have to devote more of their income to paying \ntheir health care bills, they cut back on other spending, they go out \nto fewer restaurants, they keep their old car for a few more years, and \nthey put a bucket under the leak instead of paying for a new roof. That \nis a lot of money not going to local businesses.\n  Similarly, when businesses are hit with burdensome taxes and \nregulations, they cut back on hiring and investment, they cut workers' \nhours, and they move jobs overseas. That means fewer jobs for the \nmillions of Americans looking for work and lower wages for families \nalready struggling to get by.\n  If Democrats were really serious about growing the economy and \ncreating jobs, they would stop focusing on economic bandaids and start \na long, hard look at the damage ObamaCare is doing to our economy.\n  As Members of Congress, we need to make it easier to create jobs, not \nharder. We should be repealing burdensome mandates, not creating them. \nWe should be reducing the tax burden, not increasing it, and we should \nbe creating incentives for businesses to expand, not eliminating them.\n  Millions of Americans spend too much time wondering how they are \ngoing to afford their health care premiums or buy a house or send their \nkids to college. We need to give them the economic opportunities they \nneed.\n  Over the past few weeks Republicans in the House and in the Senate \nhave introduced plan after plan to get our economy moving again and \nhelp struggling families find better jobs and increased wages.\n  I recently introduced a plan to exempt long-term unemployed workers \nfrom the ObamaCare mandate, an onerous and unpopular provision which \nwill destroy jobs and reduce hours for hardworking Americans. In fact, \nthis mandate is so unpopular and so unworkable that the administration \nunilaterally delayed it past the next election.\n  Since even the administration doesn't want to enforce it, I think we \ncan all agree that exempting the long-term unemployed will help break \nthe cycle of extended unemployment that plagues the Obama economy.\n  We hope Democrats will abandon their short-term cosmetic fixes and \njoin us in talking about the kind of long-term reform which will truly \ngrow the economy and offer economic opportunity to every American. We \nhave lived in the Obama economy long enough.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I am here to speak in opposition to the \noffset in Ayotte amendment No. 2603. The bipartisan budget that passed \nin December included a Republican provision that changed the annual \ncost-of-living adjustments, or COLAs, for military retirees. I opposed \nthat provision, and I believe there is bipartisan support for repealing \nit. The main question that needs to be debated is how to pay for that \nrepeal. Amendment No. 2603 would pay for fixing the military retirement \nCOLA problem by denying the refundable child tax credit to millions of \neligible U.S. citizen children. That amendment asks, in effect, whether \nmilitary retirees are more deserving of help than U.S. citizen children \nwho are on the edge of poverty. That is a false choice. That is not the \nright approach.\n  The child tax credit is one of our most important programs to reduce \nchild poverty. Tens of millions of families claim the child tax credit \neach year--more than 35 million families in 2009--both using Social \nSecurity numbers and individual taxpayer identification numbers. \nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, the child tax credit \nreduces child poverty by approximately one-fifth. For such an important \nand widely used program as this, we should be careful that any changes \nwe make to the program do not harm low-income children and working \nfamilies. Many of these low-income families are headed by women.\n  Any large program is susceptible to fraud and misuse. When fraud is \nalleged, the cases should be investigated and the people who commit \nfraud should be punished. This means targeted, aggressive auditing and \nenforcement, not wholesale changes to the program that will deny help \nto kids who are legally receiving it today.\n  The proponents of the amendment tell us that individuals are \nfraudulently claiming the child tax credit for kids who live in Mexico \nor for kids who do not exist. That is already a violation of the law. \nThis is fraud. I agree with the sponsor that we should take steps to \nprevent this fraud.\n  The IRS says this amendment would not solve the fraud problem. In \n2012, five Senators wrote to the IRS regarding this matter, and their \nletter asked:\n\n       Does the fact that the person filing the return has a \n     Social Security number indicate whether the child claimed for \n     the credit met the residency requirements required under the \n     law?\n\n  The response from the IRS, in a letter dated July 20, 2012, was:\n\n       The possession of a SSN [Social Security number] by the \n     filer is not relevant in determining whether the child met \n     the residency requirements.\n\n  In other words, imposing a Social Security number requirement does \nnot prevent the fraud that the sponsor seeks to prevent. That makes \nintuitive sense. If a person is going to lie about the existence of a \nkid, they will lie about the SSN too. This amendment does not solve the \nproblem.\n  If this amendment does not solve the problem, then what would be the \nreal impact of this amendment? Here is what the amendment would do.\n  First, it would deny help to roughly 4 million U.S. citizen children \nfrom low-income households by making their families ineligible for the \nchild tax credit. The average family claiming the refundable child tax \ncredit earns only about $21,000 a year, and, as I mentioned earlier, \nmany of these families are led by women. Every dollar matters to these \nfamilies. The child tax credit lifts roughly 1.5 million children out \nof poverty each year. This amendment would plunge many of these \nchildren back into poverty.\n\n[[Page S308]]\n\n  I wish to emphasize that because of the way the child tax credit is \nstructured in the Tax Code, only working families are eligible for the \nrefundable portion. These families are working and paying taxes, but in \nlean years they would be denied help from the child tax credit if this \namendment were to become law. They are paying taxes but would be denied \nhelp. That is not fair.\n  Second, this amendment would render these 4 million U.S. children \nsecond-class citizens because of who their parents are. That is \ncontrary to the principle of equality on which this country was \nfounded. All citizens should be treated fairly and equally. This \namendment says some citizen children will receive help and others will \nnot, depending on who their parents are. That is simply not right.\n  In closing, there is a better way to pay for repealing the military \nCOLA provision that was included in the budget, and that is to close \ncorporate tax loopholes. The proponents cite a news report from Indiana \nin which an undocumented worker admitted he had allowed four other \nundocumented workers to use his address to file tax returns. The four \nworkers did not live there, but he allowed them to use his address \nanyway. I agree that this is fraud and should be stopped.\n  This story reminds me of the story of the Ugland House in the Cayman \nIslands. The Ugland House is a 5-story building that has been \nidentified as the official address for 18,857 companies, all at the \nsame time. Some of the inhabitants of this address are some of the \nlargest publicly traded companies in the United States. As I understand \nit, this is not a violation of U.S. laws. Tens of thousands of \ncorporations can legally use the same building for their official \naddress. It is not fraud but merely tax planning, I am told.\n  Offshore mailing addresses and accounting tricks are allowing \ncorporations to shelter enormous profits from U.S. taxes. According to \nBloomberg News, 83 of the largest companies in the United States held \n$1.46 trillion in profits offshore in 2012. Another report, by JPMorgan \nChase, estimates that the amount of offshore profits is even higher--\nnearly $1.7 trillion. How does this work? They funnel their revenues \nthrough shell companies to escape taxation. Countries such as Bermuda, \nIreland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Switzerland--which combined \naccount for less than one-half of 1 percent of the world's population--\ngenerated 43 percent of the profits reported by American companies in \n2008. Clearly, there is a major tax problem here.\n  While our colleagues rail against five workers using one address to \nfile taxes, we hear nothing about more than 18,000 companies that have \nused one address to file their taxes. Talk about egregious. These \ncorporate tax loopholes resulting in the huge amount of taxes companies \ndon't pay are what this Congress should focus on, not on denying a few \nhundred dollars of help to a U.S. citizen child who is on the edge of \npoverty.\n  Senator Shaheen has filed an amendment that begins to address these \ncorporate tax problems. Her amendment, No. 2618, of which I am a \ncosponsor, will prevent more than 18,000 corporations from pretending \nthey are headquartered in a single building in the Cayman Islands. Like \nthe amendment of Senator Ayotte, the Shaheen amendment will repeal the \nmilitary retiree COLA provision that was in the budget deal. The \ndifference is that the amendment of Senator Shaheen will pay for the \nrepeal by holding corporations accountable for the taxes they owe \ninstead of denying help to U.S. citizen children of working parents, \nmany of whom are women, who are in poverty.\n  We all recognize that we have a responsibility to our veterans, \ntaxpayers, and to future generations. The amendment of Senator Shaheen \nwill allow us to meet all of these commitments at the same time. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting this commonsense approach and \nvote in favor of the Shaheen amendment and not the Ayotte amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I join my colleague from Hawaii in her \nremarks and her opposition to the Ayotte amendment. I wish to start off \nby simply saying that when we are talking about extending unemployment \ninsurance benefits to Americans who have played by the rules, done \neverything right, and through no fault of their own find themselves \nunemployed, many long-term unemployed, and who are trying to get a job \nbut still, despite an economy that is improving, have not seen the job \nmarket increase significantly so that they can attain that job--what \nthey need at this time is not a kick in the pants, they need a helping \nhand so that they can sustain their families during this period of time \nand continue to be in a position to do that which the law requires of \nthem: continue to look for a job and eventually find that job.\n  The reality is that this is not an ideological battle, I hope, in a \ngreater political war. It is about real people and the lives of real \npeople. I don't think we can lose sight of that simple fact. Political \nideology doesn't trump faith and family values. It does not trump \nreason or compassion or the acceptance that we are all in this \ntogether.\n  Having said that, I am encouraged that there is bipartisan support \nfor repealing the military pension cuts. I opposed those. I am \ncommitted to ensuring that our brave men and women and their families \nreceive all the care and resources they deserve, both during their \nservice and throughout their lives. They have fought for our freedom \nand security in the most difficult situations, and our Nation owes them \nthe same level of commitment, and we remain indebted to them for their \nservice.\n  But I have heard the Senator from New Hampshire declare her support \nfor offsetting the cost to fix that by fixing ``an egregious problem in \nthe Tax Code.'' As someone who sits on the Senate Finance Committee, I \ncan tell you that after years of being stymied by Republican opposition \nto closing any tax loopholes, to shutting down any abusive tax \npractices, I would like to have them join us in looking for savings in \nthe Tax Code to achieve a bipartisan goal. But, unfortunately, instead \nof shutting down the abuses in the code, like the huge amounts of money \nstripped out of the United States and piling up in tax havens abroad, \nor instead of ending the wasteful subsidies for very profitable \ncompanies, such as the oil industry, or perhaps the myriad tax shelters \nused by millionaires to avoid paying their fair share, my colleague \ndecided instead to propose legislation that would have a devastating \nimpact on 4 million children who are U.S. citizens and who deserve \nevery right and every protection as any other child under the \nConstitution, all of whom are deserving of our support.\n  Instead of working with Democrats, many of whom have spent a great \ndeal of time studying and pointing out waste, fraud, and abuse in the \nTax Code to find a bipartisan solution, we are presented with a \nproposal that would go much further than she claims and hammer over 2 \nmillion working and tax-paying families.\n  What does the child tax credit do, which is the subject of her \namendment? The child tax credit is for people who have a qualifying \nchild. That is the fundamental essence of the child tax credit. You are \nnot eligible for it if you do not have a qualifying child. What is a \nqualifying child under the law? It must be the son, daughter, \nstepchild, foster child, brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister, or a \ndescendent of the filer. They must live with the filer for more than \nhalf of the year. No. 3, the child must be a U.S. citizen, a U.S. \nnational, or a U.S. resident alien. It is the child who is the \ndeterminative factor. It is the child for which these resources \nultimately we have decided as a Congress and as a society to support.\n  We talk about being family-friendly. We talk about the poverty \nsituation in this country. We talk about the consistently growing gap \nin terms of the haves and the have-nots. This amendment is only going \nto exacerbate that problem for U.S. children.\n  To eliminate the ability of a taxpayer to use a taxpayer ID number in \norder to claim the refundable portion of the child tax credit ignores \nthe fact that the vast majority of these children are U.S. citizens and \nthe child tax credit was enacted to help families financially care for \ntheir children. The refundable portion was introduced because children \nin working families deserve the same support provided by\n\n[[Page S309]]\n\nbenefits in the Tax Code as anyone else. That is why we made it \nrefundable--because we wanted to reward work and we wanted to help with \nthe growth of that child and to deal with their challenges.\n  I agree with the Senator from New Hampshire that the anecdotal \nstories she included in her remarks amount to fraud, and they should be \nstopped. Let's be clear: The stories she told of claiming credits for \nchildren not in the United States or of 1,000 tax returns linked to 8 \naddresses, those actions are already illegal by whomever would make \nsuch a false filing and commit those actions.\n  In fact, what the Senator does is cite reports of IRS investigators \nwho did their job shutting down illegal activity. It seems to me the \nIRS doesn't need her amendment to go after this fraud. They need the \nresources and the investigators to ultimately make sure all elements of \nthe code that have fraudulent activity being taken need to be dealt \nwith. They need Republicans to stop cutting their funds so they can do \ntheir job better. But to use these instances of fraud that were \nsuccessfully pursued to go after American children is not confronting \nfraud. It is disadvantaging children--4 million children to be exact.\n  If we had one computer science company prosecuted for tax evasion, we \ndon't bar all computer science companies from ever taking the research \nand development tax credit again. If we find one entity, one person or \none industry committing fraud, we don't eliminate all of the benefits \nof the provision in the Tax Code for which they committed fraud because \nwe have decided that provision is of a societal benefit. What we do is \nmake sure we go after the individuals who commit the fraud. It doesn't \nmake any sense, just like hammering 4 million U.S. children because of \nfraud perpetrated by some other unscrupulous actor doesn't make a whole \nlot of sense to me.\n  I believe this amendment creates a clear-cut case of priorities. \nSurely nobody here would argue that outside of this instance, there is \nno other part of the Tax Code that allows waste, fraud or abuse. We \ncould sit down and find dozens of wasteful loopholes, fraudulent tax \npractices, and abusive tax shelters that could be shut down in order to \npay for restoring the cuts to military pensions. If my Republican \ncolleagues chose to support these efforts, I think this bill would sail \nthrough the Senate.\n  I say to my friends who are putting up obstacles--because I believe a \nlot of these false choices that are being put out there are not for the \npurposes of a legitimate policy goal but to undermine the efforts of \nachieving the extension of unemployment insurance--I say to them I \nthink you need to stop and think. Think about the people who are \nhurting. Think about their lives, their hopes, and their struggles. \nThink about what their conversations are around the kitchen table at \nnight. Every night in New Jersey and all over the country thousands of \nfamilies who have played by the rules and are looking for work are \nsitting around the table asking heartwrenching questions: How will we \nafford the mortgage and keep our home if we cannot get the assistance \nduring this period of time? Do I have to decide between putting food on \nthe table and keeping a place for my family? What if I have a health \nemergency? These are real-life conversations that are being had by \nAmericans across this country.\n  How are we not putting aside ideology and looking into our conscience \nfor the obvious answer? This is a simple extension of unemployment \nbenefits for those who need our help. It is a no-brainer at a time when \nso many need help now and don't care about politics, don't want or \ndeserve to be pawns in a political battle over the role or size of \ngovernment. They just want help from the very people who represent \nthem.\n  It isn't a time for political games. It is a time for action. We can \nalways argue deficits. We can argue about debt management, we can argue \nabout politics, but for now it is about the American people, their \nlives, their hopes, and their dreams for a better life for themselves \nand their families. It is about the kind of Nation we are and the \nvalues we hold dear.\n  Extending unemployment benefits isn't just the right thing to do \nmorally, it also makes good economic sense. Study after study has shown \nthat unemployment benefits are one of the most effective ways to help \nour economy grow, so much so that every $1 spent produces a benefit of \nat least $1.50 in gross domestic product. That is because people \nreceiving benefits spend the money and immediately stimulate the \neconomy in the form of consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent \nof our GDP. Leaving 1.3 million Americans in the cold without any \nassistance would end up costing our economy 240,000 jobs.\n  Some on the other side say helping people who have been out of work \nis a crutch. I have to be honest with you. I have never met a person in \nmy State who said they wanted to be on unemployment, who found dignity \nin being on unemployment or realized their dreams by being on \nunemployment. They found their dignity by achieving a job that helped \nthem realize their hopes and dreams and aspirations.\n  The American worker is not lazy, and they don't want handouts. With \nthe job market still recovering, there simply are not enough jobs \navailable for them. As we work to make sure there is an economy that \nhas enough jobs for Americans to be able to realize their hopes and \ndreams and aspirations, it is incumbent on us to make sure we continue \nto assist them so those stark choices around the kitchen table aren't \nas horrible as they are today.\n  I hope my colleagues will oppose hurting 4 million American children, \nexacerbating the poverty in our country, and sending a message that \ngoes counter to what the child tax credit is all about. We want to help \nan American child be able to fulfill their hopes and dreams and \naspirations and their God-given potential. The adoption of the Ayotte \namendment would go entirely counter to that belief.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/14/senate-section/article/S309-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 2:30 \np.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I wish to share briefly a few thoughts \nabout where we are. We have before us an unemployment bill and the \npending business is the Reid amendment that would extend unemployment \nbenefits for a full year, and none of it is paid for effectively. All \nof it violates the Budget Act. It is unthinkable that we would pass \nanother $17 billion that would add to the debt of the United States--\nevery billion of it, every single dollar of it borrowed, much of it \nfrom people around the world who are not friendly to us. So this is not \na good way for us to start.\n  It is subject to a budget point of order because it violates our \nspending limits and that has been confirmed. I know the Presiding \nOfficer is a member of the Budget Committee. It has been confirmed by \nSenator Murray and her staff, the Democratic leadership on the Budget \nCommittee, that it violates the budget. So that means if it is not \nfixed--and I understand there is some attempt going on at this time to \nmaybe rewrite it in a way that actually has a legitimate pay-for, to \nprovide assistance to those who are long-term unemployed but paid for \nwithout adding to the debt of the United States.\n  I will remind my colleagues that in December we passed the Murray-\nRyan legislation which set limits on spending, and the President signed \nit into law just 2 weeks ago. As soon as we waltz into the U.S. Senate \nin January of this year, we have a piece of legislation that bursts the \nbudget entirely. It is an utter violation of the spending agreements we \nagreed to. So I hope our colleagues can present something to us that \nwould lay out an effective way to handle those who are unemployed and \nwould also pay for the legislation. That is what we have to do.\n\n[[Page S310]]\n\n  This is how we go broke. This is what has happened. We made a promise \nwhen the legislation passed in December to cap spending and stay within \nthat limit. That is the law that is being violated 1 month later, if \nthis were to pass. Hopefully, it will not pass. I don't believe the \nHouse will pass legislation that adds another $17 trillion to the debt \nand not add--I just don't think that is possible.\n  This is a process that is not healthy. I urge our colleagues to \nunderstand that if this legislation is not fixed--if the Reid amendment \nis not fixed and paid for--I intend to move to object to it, to raise a \nbudget point of order. It will take 60 votes to override the budget we \njust agreed to. I don't believe 60 Members of this Senate will so vote.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what is the issue before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to commit is the pending question.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am going to offer a consent agreement \nbased on the conversations I have had with a number of Republicans, and \na long conversation with my caucus just a few minutes ago. I am going \nto speak for a few minutes because I know everybody has a lot to do, \nbut we have all been working hard to find a way to extend unemployment \ninsurance benefits for 1.4 million Americans who are struggling to get \nby.\n  We have a filibuster before us again--another one. First, Republicans \ncomplained they were filibustering these essential benefits because the \nextension was not paid for. So Senator Reed of Rhode Island came \nforward with a pay-for amendment. Then Republicans complained, they \nwere filibustering because they had not been able to offer amendments. \nSo a proposal was made--and I am going to do that in a short time with \na unanimous consent request--that would give each side a reasonable \nnumber of amendments--five, to be specific. Now Republicans say they \nwant to have their amendments and have a cloture vote to pass the bill \ntoo.\n  Sounds as though Republicans want to, for lack of a better way to \ndescribe this, have their cake and eat it too. The question is, are \nRepublicans filibustering unemployment insurance benefits or are they \nnot?\n  If we have an amendment process, then what we should get in exchange \nis an up-or-down vote on the bill, and that is what my consent \nagreement will call for. Republicans who don't like extending \nunemployment insurance benefits can still vote no on the bill, but we \nshould at least be able to have a vote on the bill. But we can't set up \na system where the minority of the Senate, which opposes unemployment \ninsurance benefits, gets both an amendment process where they can offer \nthese poison-pill amendments and then the minority of the Senate, \nagain, that opposes the bill, can still kill the bill. This doesn't \nmake a lot of sense.\n  I know everybody has worked hard to try to work through this \nprocess--to kind of thread the needle. I told a number of Republican \nSenators I met with a little while ago, as my Democratic Senators know, \nthat we think there should be a new day in the Senate. We think we \nshould start by whatever comes up next--whether it is flood insurance, \nunemployment compensation, whatever is next--by having a reasonable \nnumber of relevant amendments, and see if we, as Senators, can work our \nway through a bill doing that. If we can do that a few times, maybe we \nwill get better and start having some nonrelevant amendments, but at \nleast let us start someplace so Senators here can have the experience \nof offering amendments--both us and the Republicans--and try to get \nsome legislation passed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture motions with \nrespect to the Reed of Rhode Island amendment No. 2631 and S. 1845 be \nvitiated; that the motion to commit and amendment No. 2631 be \nwithdrawn; that a substitute amendment, which is at the desk, be made \npending; that there be up to five amendments related to the bill from \neach side in order to the substitute amendment; further, that each of \nthese amendments be subject to a side-by-side amendment if the opposing \nside chooses to offer one; amendments under this agreement must be \noffered no later than 4 p.m. Wednesday, January 15; that no other \namendments or motions to commit be in order; that no points of order be \nin order to the substitute or the underlying bill; that each amendment \nhave up to 1 hour of debate equally divided; that upon the use or \nyielding back of time on each of the amendments offered, the Senate \nproceed to vote in relation to the amendments to the substitute in the \norder offered with any side-by-side amendment vote occurring prior to \nthe amendment to which it was offered; that all of the amendments to \nthe substitute be subject to a 60-affirmative-vote threshold; that upon \ndisposition of the amendments, the bill be read a third time, as \namended, if amended, and the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the \nbill; that if the bill is passed, the Senate immediately proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 192, H.R. 2009; that all after the \nenacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 1845, as passed by the \nSenate, be inserted in lieu thereof; that the bill, as amended, be read \na third time and passed; that an amendment to the title be considered \nand agreed to; and the motions to reconsider be considered made and \nlaid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The minority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we have \nnow been on this bill a week--a week. No amendments have been allowed. \nIt is pretty clear the majority leader is not interested in having an \nopen amendment process. And, of course, the consent request that has \njust been offered requires that all of the Republican amendments be at \na 60-vote threshold and that final passage be at 51--in other words, \nguaranteed to fix the result in such a way that doesn't give the \nminority a fair chance.\n  I mean, who is to say, a number of our amendments might be appealing \nto Members on the Democratic side. That is probably why the majority \nleader wants it to be at 60, because he is afraid they may pass.\n  So this has obviously been fixed to guarantee that you get no \noutcome. Of course, our Members who voted to get on the bill, who are \nanxious to try to improve the bill and find a way to get us to final \npassage, have also found this agreement to be unacceptable. So I am not \nspeaking just for myself but for the Members on my side who have spent \na lot of time over the last week trying to figure a way to get this \nbill across the floor in a bipartisan fashion which would actually \nachieve the result and try to get us to some reforms as well.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that once the Senate resumes consideration \nof S. 1845, the unemployment extension bill, the first amendment in \norder be a Heller-Collins amendment related to the bill. I further ask \nunanimous consent that following the disposition of that amendment, it \nbe in order for the majority leader, or his designee, to offer an \namendment, and it be in order for the leaders or their designees to \ncontinue to offer amendments in an alternating fashion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have seen in the last little bit a \nsignificant number of statements on the floor and op-ed pieces written \nabout process--process.\n  On this side we have been talking about 1.4 million Americans needing \nhelp getting past the real financial crisis they find.\n  It seems interesting to me the only fix to get no outcome is the \nRepublican strategy to find something to object to no matter what \nDemocrats try. Process--compared to helping in a substantive way people \nwho are in trouble,\n\n[[Page S311]]\n\nprocess never wins. We need to move forward.\n  My friend talks about amendments. Democrats have amendments. We have \n5 too. Ours would have a 60-vote threshold just like theirs. This is \nthe new target that my Republican colleague the Republican leader has \nset. We have a new reality around here of 60 votes. This isn't anything \nI invented. In fact, I wish we would get rid of it and go back to the \nway we used to do it.\n  So I repeat. I think this has been constructive. I especially \nappreciate the junior Senator from Nevada and the senior Senator from \nMaine working to come up with something. I am disappointed we couldn't \nwork something out. It appears, and I have been told, they are going to \nobject to this consent agreement just as I object to modifying my \nconsent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I would like to ask the leader a \nquestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to the Republican leader's \nrequest.\n  Is there objection to the majority leader's request?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend from New York was standing to \nreserve the right to object.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Let me just say, I think on both sides of the aisle \nthere is a real desire to try to work things out so we can have more \ndebate, more discussion. It seems to me, from the years I have been \nhere--not as long as either leader--there has always been sort of a way \nthe place worked, particularly in the old days when it worked better: \nThe majority sets the agenda. That is their right as majority. The \nminority has the right to offer amendments--both--amendments that might \nchange that agenda and amendments that, frankly, might be tough to vote \nfor so the minority can capture the majority again. That has been fair.\n  But it seems to me that what my friend the Republican leader is \nsaying is: We want all the amendments we want, but we are still going \nto filibuster any bill you bring up. Maybe a few have said: If our \namendments pass on the other side, maybe we won't filibuster. But that \nis not much of a fair deal.\n  So I would suggest that what the Democratic leader has suggested is \neminently fair. It gives the minority--no matter who it is--their time-\nhonored right to offer amendments, difficult amendments. That is part \nof the deal. But it gives the majority the right to set the agenda and \nnot have the things they bring forward filibustered ipso facto and not \nbe allowed to come to a vote.\n  It is in fact true, as I understand it, that a couple of those who \nare offering amendments on the other side of the aisle have stated that \nif their amendment doesn't pass, they won't allow us to come to a vote.\n  So I hope we could proceed along the way the majority leader suggests \nand not to simply offer amendments--relevant, not relevant; germane, \nnot germane--and then make it almost certain the bill will be \nfilibustered and that we won't be able to get an up-or-down vote. All \nwe are asking is an up-or-down vote on employment insurance.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, regular order.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe I objected to the majority leader's request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator did so.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up the \nHeller amendment No. 2651.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent to call up the Coburn \namendment No. 2606.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Parliamentary inquiry: Is it correct that no Senator \nis permitted to offer an amendment to the unemployment insurance bill \nwhile the majority leader's motion to commit with instructions with \nfurther amendments is pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Further parliamentary inquiry: If a motion to table \nthe Reid motion to commit with a further amendment is successful, would \nthere still be Reed amendments pending that would prevent anyone from \noffering an amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have an important amendment that I \nwould like the Senate to debate and vote on. The Reid motion to commit \nis currently blocking the consideration of those amendments.\n  In order for the Senate to start considering amendments, including \nthe Coburn amendment No. 2606, I move to table the pending Reid motion \nto commit with instructions and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I do have a right to object to this; do I \nnot?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct, but the question is on \nthe cloture motion. It takes consent for the motion to be tabled.\n  Mr. REID. I am not objecting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on the motion to table.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 45, nays 55, as follows:\n\n                       [Rollcall Vote No. 8 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--45\n\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Barrasso\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coats\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     Cruz\n     Enzi\n     Fischer\n     Flake\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Heller\n     Hoeven\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson (WI)\n     Kirk\n     Lee\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Moran\n     Murkowski\n     Paul\n     Portman\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rubio\n     Scott\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Thune\n     Toomey\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--55\n\n     Baldwin\n     Baucus\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Blumenthal\n     Booker\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Coons\n     Donnelly\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Heinrich\n     Heitkamp\n     Hirono\n     Johnson (SD)\n     Kaine\n     King\n     Klobuchar\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Manchin\n     Markey\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murphy\n     Murray\n     Nelson\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schatz\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Warren\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n  The motion was rejected.\n  Mr. REID.

On this vote, the yeas are 55, the nays are \n45. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider the vote by \nwhich cloture was not invoked on S. 1845.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is entered.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate very much my colleague, the \njunior Senator from Nevada, voting with us--voting with himself. He is \na cosponsor of this legislation. He and Jack Reed have done admirably \ngood work for the Senate and for the country.\n  Everyone should notice on the first matter we tried to invoke cloture \non, I did not enter a motion to reconsider. I did on this one. This is \na 3-month unpaid-for. I would hope we could get that passed sometime. \nIf we cannot, there is still an effort, I am sure, out there someplace \nwhere we could find a way to work together to get these people the \ndesperate help they need. So that is why I did this, leaving the door \nopen for us to work together to try to come up with something.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I rise to express my extreme disappointment that the Senate \nhas been blocked from moving forward on this critical legislation. \nThere are about 1.5 million Americans who have lost their unemployment \ninsurance since December 28. Every week 70,000 more lose that \nprotection, so my disappointment is severe.\n  But their situation is much more desperate. We had within our power \ntoday the ability to move this Senate forward to help our people, to \nhelp people who only qualified for the program because they worked and \nbecause they are still looking for work in one of the most difficult \njob markets we have seen in many decades.\n  It is extremely urgent that we act and today we failed to act. We \nhave to continue to move forward. The majority leader has procedurally \nput us in a position so we can call up this measure again very quickly. \nWe have to continue to work toward a solution. We have to keep the \neconomy moving forward and creating jobs. That was what this was about, \ngiving people some modest support each week. But also, as the CBO \nestimated, this measure, if extended for the full year, would generate \n200,000 additional jobs. That is, on average, about what we have been \ncreating each month. In fact, I will remind my colleagues, last year's \nunemployment insurance benefits were unpaid for and they generated \nadditional jobs, not only providing benefits to people who needed it \nand were searching for work but increased economic activity in the \ncountry, which put people to work.\n  I hope my colleagues recognize this legislation they filibustered \ntoday was the result of significant concessions to many of my \nRepublican colleagues. I worked closely with my Republican colleagues. \nWe worked to find a way through this thicket so we could help Americans \nwho have earned this help.\n  I think it is important to make clear how much we moved to try to \naccommodate the major objections and considerations of my colleagues on \nthe other side.\n  We first proposed--and I proposed--this as emergency spending, unpaid \nfor. We received from the other side: No, we can't accept that. It has \nto be paid for.\n  We went ahead, and the in the first proposal we voted on today, we \npaid for it. We also responded to another significant concern that we \nnot use tax revenues to pay for it, so we avoided tax revenue.\n  Next, we went ahead and we adopted a provision to pay for it, to \nprovide for many months, 11\\1/2\\ months of benefits, paid for without \nusing revenues.\n  Let me also note that this is the exception to the rule. The White \nHouse, in some of their materials, has noted that ``fourteen of the \nlast 17 times in 20 years that it's been extended,'' UI, ``there's been \nno strings attached,'' no pay-fors--emergency spending. But yet we \nlistened to the thoughtful comments of our colleagues, we worked \ntogether closely with them, and we came up with a way to pay for this \nextension for 11\\1/2\\ months and not to use tax revenues, even though \nmany on our side--in fact I would be among them--who would say there \nare egregious loopholes that should be closed regardless of what the \nrevenue is used for but could be used to fund these benefits.\n  Then we have had this procedural back-and-forth. But today Leader \nReid offered a series of amendments to the\n\n[[Page S313]]\n\nother side, and they objected to that offer.\n  Let me reiterate. We have tried, not only in very good faith but very \ndiligently over the last several days particularly, to try to bring \nsomething to this floor that could get the 60 votes necessary to help \nthese struggling Americans.\n  We have incorporated, in fact, in our pay-for, one of the provisions \nSenator Portman suggested with respect to disability payments--which \nwas controversial in some respects--but it was, again, another attempt \nto try to look at what my colleagues, on the Republican side as well as \nthe Democratic side, were talking about in terms of how we would \nresponsibly pay for this measure.\n  We have been debating this extension since December. It is time to \nact, and regrettably we did not act today. We have made concessions to \ntry to move forward. This was not a take-it-or-leave-it. It has been \nunpaid for 14 times before--and it would have been 15 times now. We \nhave to do this. And still we are telling people who are in very \nextreme economic situations, who are depending on this modest $300 a \nweek to help them pay their rent, pay their mortgage, put fuel in their \ncar, have a cell phone so they can look for work, get to a job \ninterview--telling them, no, you are still out in the cold, literally, \nand it is very cold in parts of the country.\n  We can't give up. We are not going to give up. I am very encouraged. \nAfter talking to some of my colleagues on the Republican side, they \nstill want to work through this with us. We will accept that \nopportunity to work together.\n  Let us remember though what is a disappointing moment today for many \nof us is a dispiriting moment for millions of Americans who do not have \nthe modest support unemployment insurance would provide. We have to \nwork for them, we have to work for our economy, and we can do both. In \nthe weeks ahead and the days ahead we will continue to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. As we just heard, the Senate continues to discuss and \nconsider an extension of unemployment benefits. Many Americans \ncertainly do continue to struggle to find work in today's economy. \nWhile assistance to those without work serves an important purpose in \nhelping Americans in transition, I am fearful we are failing--in fact, \nI know we are failing--to address the underlying and important root \ncause of that unemployment; that is, how do we as Americans grow our \neconomy and create jobs for the citizens of our country?\n  A growing economy creates new opportunities for Americans to find \nmeaningful work. With meaningful work comes the opportunity for \nAmericans to improve their economic security and advance up the \neconomic ladder.\n  In 2012 Senator Wyden and I started the Economic Mobility Caucus that \nmet today for the fifth time, exploring ways we could work together to \ncreate the opportunity for every American to work their way up, have a \nbetter life, a greater future, more success, and better financial \nstability.\n  Unfortunately--again, at the moment, in my view--a lack of leadership \nand partisan politics have prevented action on measures that could \nprovide an immediate boost to the economy at little or no cost to the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  Data from the Kauffman Foundation in Kansas City makes clear that \nmost new jobs come from the young companies created by entrepreneurs. \nIn fact, since 1980, nearly all of the net new jobs that have been \ncreated by companies are less than 5 years old. These new businesses \ncreate an average of 3 million jobs each year.\n  As of December, approximately 20.6 million Americans were unemployed, \nwanted to work but have stopped searching for a job or are working part \ntime because they can't find full-time unemployment. When we talk about \nthe unemployment rate, it masks the true story of people who have given \nup looking for a job as well as those who have a part-time job and need \nand desire a full-time job.\n  The labor force participation rate has reached its lowest level in 35 \nyears. At a time when only 62 percent of working-age Americans are \nemployed, it is clear we need an economic boost powered by \nentrepreneurship. To jump-start the economy and create jobs for \nAmericans, we have put together and I authored bipartisan legislation \ncalled Startup Act 3.0.\n  The Senate majority leader is often talking about the need for \nallowing votes on legislation that has bipartisan support, and this is \na perfect example of such a bill that ought to be considered by the \nSenate.\n  Working with Senator Warner--my primary cosponsor of this bill--and \nSenators Coons, Kaine, Klobuchar, as well as Republican Senators Blunt \nand Rubio, we introduced commonsense legislation that addresses four \nkey factors that influence an entrepreneur's chance for success: taxes, \nregulations, innovation, and access to talent.\n  It has become all too common in the Senate that we are denied the \nopportunity to have a vote on things that many of us find common \nagreement on, and Startup Act 3.0 is one of those. In fact, I offered, \nalong with Senator Warner, Startup Act 3.0 as an amendment to the \nunemployment insurance extension bill. Startup Act 3.0 makes \ncommonsense changes to the Tax Code to encourage investment in startups \nand reward patient capital. To address the burdensome government \nregulations, the legislation requires Federal agencies to determine \nwhether the cost of new regulations outweigh the benefits--and \nencourages Federal agencies to give special consideration to the impact \nproposed regulations would have upon those startup businesses.\n  As any entrepreneur knows, a good idea is essential to starting a \nsuccessful business. To get more ideas out of the laboratory and into \nthe market, this legislation improves the process for commercializing \nfederally funded research so taxpayer-funded innovations can be turned \ninto companies and spur economic growth and job creation.\n  Finally, Startup Act 3.0 provides new opportunities for highly \neducated and entrepreneurial immigrants to stay in the United States. \nThey are here legally now but are often told they need to go home to \npursue their careers, when we know their talent and their new ideas \ncould fuel economic growth and create American jobs.\n  While there is meaningful disagreement--we have plenty of \ndisagreement about the immigration issue--there are aspects of \nimmigration in which there is broad agreement. One of the areas of \nagreement is highly skilled immigration. Highly skilled immigrants not \nonly provide the talent for growing companies needed to fuel further \ngrowth and job creation, but those individuals tend to be very \nentrepreneurial.\n  Immigrants are now more than twice as likely as native-born Americans \nto start a business. In 2011 immigrants were responsible for more than \none in every four U.S. business founded.\n  In addition, immigrants are responsible for significant contributions \nto innovation. According to a recent study by the Partnership for a New \nAmerican Economy, 76 percent of patents at the top 10 patent-producing \nU.S. universities had at least one foreign-born inventor.\n  One of the best things we can do for the American economy is to \nwelcome highly skilled and entrepreneurial immigrants. No matter what \nCongress does, these individuals will continue to innovate and create \njobs. The question is where will they innovate and where will the jobs \nbe created. If Congress makes the right choice, those jobs and that \ninnovation will occur in the United States of America and build the \nU.S. economy and employ U.S. citizens.\n  Unfortunately, there are too many people in the Senate and in the \nCongress in Washington, DC, who say we can't do anything unless we do \neverything. That has prevented the passage of targeted immigration \nlegislation that would boost the economic growth and create American \njobs. That same attitude prevents us from doing many things on the \nSenate floor, and it is well past time we found ways to do the things \nwe can agree upon and not wait for the opportunity to do everything. \nLet's do the things we can while we wait and work on the chance to do \nbigger and broader things.\n\n  The STEM visas we talk about seem so important to our economy. \nAmerican businesses are projected to need\n\n[[Page S314]]\n\nan estimated 800,000 workers with advanced STEM degrees by 2018 but \nwill only find 550,000 American graduates with an advanced STEM \neducation.\n  We must do more as a nation. We absolutely must do more to prepare \nAmericans for careers in STEM fields so that our country no longer has \nto rely upon talented foreign labor. But in the short term, as we work \nto equip Americans with skills for the 21st-century economy, we need to \ncreate a pathway for highly educated foreign-born students who are here \nin the United States legally, going to school, to stay in America where \ntheir ideas and talents can fuel great American economic growth.\n  Startup 3.0 creates visas for foreign students who graduate from an \nAmerican university with a master's or Ph.D. in science, technology, \nengineering, or mathematics. These skilled workers would be granted \nconditional status contingent upon them filling a needed gap in the \nU.S. workforce.\n  It may seem counterintuitive that by allowing highly skilled workers \nto work in the United States, more Americans will find work, but that \nis exactly what will happen. A study by the Partnership for a New \nAmerican Economy and the American Enterprise Institute found that every \nimmigrant with a graduate degree in the United States from a U.S. \nuniversity working in a STEM field creates 2.62 subsequent American \njobs.\n  If American companies are unable to find and hire the qualified, \ntalented workers they need, those businesses will open locations \noverseas. I have seen examples of that too many times. When this \nhappens, not only are those specific jobs gone--they are lost--but also \nthe many supporting jobs and economic activities associated with them \nare no longer here.\n  Even more frustrating to me is that when these highly skilled workers \nwho are now employed in some other country and who are entrepreneurs \ntoo have an idea and they found and start a business that may grow and \ncreate more jobs because they couldn't find employment here due to \nlacking the necessary visa and have moved to another country, they use \ntheir entrepreneurial skills and talent, and they create the jobs--the \ncompany--elsewhere. So the jobs we need in this country are then \noutside the United States.\n  This legislation also allows for an entrepreneur's visa. Immigrants \nto the United States have a long history of creating businesses in \nAmerica. Today, 1 in every 10 Americans employed at a privately owned \nU.S. company works at an immigrant-owned firm. Of the current Fortune \n500 companies, more than 40 percent were founded by a first- or second-\ngeneration American.\n  So my question to my colleagues is, Why would we want to leave an \nimmigration system in place that discourages entrepreneurs from coming \nto our country, investing their own money, and creating jobs here and \nstrengthening our economy? I think we should do exactly the opposite \nand welcome those people who want to create jobs for Americans in \nAmerica.\n  Startup 3.0 creates an entrepreneur's visa for foreign-born \nentrepreneurs currently in the United States legally. Those individuals \nwith a good idea, with capital, and a willingness to hire American \nworkers would be able to stay in the United States and grow their \nbusinesses here. Each immigrant entrepreneur would be required to \ncreate jobs for Americans. If the business is not successful and jobs \nare not created, the immigrant would have to go back to his or her home \ncountry.\n  Using conservative estimates, the Kauffman Foundation predicts that \nthe entrepreneur's visa would generate 500,000 to 1.6 million jobs over \nthe next 10 years. These are real jobs with real economic impact that \ncould boost GDP, it is estimated, by more than 1.5 percent. These are \njobs for Americans desperately seeking to work here to support their \nfamilies and follow their dreams.\n  As the Senate considers extending unemployment insurance in the short \nterm, we must not lose sight of the long-term goal--that ought to be \nthe short-term, intermediate, and long-term goal--of creating an \nenvironment for jobs in America. There is no better way to create jobs \nthan to support entrepreneurs and to foster the development of new \nbusinesses, which are responsible for all those net new jobs in the \neconomy.\n  Numerous studies demonstrate that a smarter more strategic \nimmigration policy that supports entrepreneurs and skilled immigrants \ncan grow the economy and help put Americans back to work. Jobless \nAmericans and U.S. businesses searching for the talent they need to \nexpand and create jobs can no longer afford to let the all-or-nothing \napproach to immigration legislation hold economic growth and \nopportunity hostage. It has prevented progress on important challenges \nfacing our country for far too long. A far better approach would be to \npass the things we can agree upon now and keep working to find \nagreement on the issues that divide us. First on this list should be \nthe measures outlined in Startup Act 3.0.\n  Other countries are realizing the value of highly educated and \nentrepreneurial individuals in starting businesses, and they are \nchanging their laws to welcome then. The United States cannot afford to \nturn a blind eye to global competition. If we fail to act, we risk \nlosing the next generation of great entrepreneurs, and the jobs they \nwill create will be in foreign countries, not in the United States, and \nwe risk continuing another month in which 20.6 million Americans remain \nwithout meaningful work.\n  Work is an ennobling feature of life. Jobs matter, and this Congress \nand this President have failed miserably, in my view, to carry out one \nof our primary responsibilities--to create an environment in which \nAmericans can find work and can pursue that American dream of putting \nfood on their family's table, saving for their kids' education, making \nsure they have a secure retirement in the future, and knowing every day \nwhen they get up and go to work they are doing something good for \nthemselves and for their families and their country.\n  Mr. President, we desperately need to work together to create an \nenvironment in which American jobs are created. No one I know really \nwants to be the recipient of an unemployment check. It may be \nnecessary, but it is not their goal. The goal is to find an ennobling, \nmeaningful job that supports them and their family.\n  I thank the Chair for his indulgence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I think it is wonderful to hear the Republican Senator \nMr. Moran talk about job creation. It is really music to my ears, \nespecially when he talks about addressing the importance of \nimmigration, which clearly needs to be addressed and is clearly a job-\ncreation issue. That is why I have been hoping Speaker Boehner would \ntake up the Senate's immigration bill, which is comprehensive; and, as \nPresident Obama said, if you can't do that, bring up a series of bills \nand let's get moving.\n  Believe me, I have seen every report there is, and Senator Moran is \nright--immigration reform is necessary for us. It is an economic issue. \nIt would be an economic boon to our country in terms of jobs and GDP.\n  I also think it very important that we not turn our backs on an \nAmerican value we have had in this country since the 1950s in which \nRepublicans and Democrats in the Congress and Republicans and Democrats \nin the White House have agreed that when there is a great recession and \npeople are out of work, they need to have unemployment compensation, \nwhich is an insurance program to keep them from falling apart. This is \nan American value.\n  We talk about bipartisanship, but sometimes we just can't seem to get \nthere. I have looked back, and since the 1950s, two-thirds of the time \nwe passed an extension of unemployment compensation--many times to help \npeople the Chair has worked so hard to represent, the mine workers and \nothers who were hit with hard times, we did so in a bipartisan way--and \ntwo-thirds of the time with no pay-for. Since 1958, two-thirds of the \ntime we extended it with no pay-for.\n  Under George W. Bush we extended unemployment compensation--the \nextended unemployment compensation paid for by the Federal Government--\nthree times with no pay-for because it was an emergency. And we did it \neven though in those days deficits were raging.\n  Here we have cut the deficit in half, and we don't like that. We want \nto cut it more. I want to see it balanced. But\n\n[[Page S315]]\n\nwe surely should do what we just tried to do, which is to extend \nunemployment compensation for a long period of time with a pay-for--\nthat is what we tried to do--or for a short period of time without a \npay-for and help people keep their lives together.\n  We have had this American value since the 1950s. Yet, for the first \ntime I can tell, we had one party--with the exception of one person--\nvote lockstep against extending unemployment compensation to hard-\nworking Americans who are looking for work every week, every day. And I \nhave their stories, which I am going to put in the Record. They have \nturned their backs on 1.5 million Americans--in my State, 250,000 \npeople.\n  Now, here is the thing--and I don't like to come and make these \nspeeches, but the facts speak for themselves. Leader Reid, the majority \nleader, just offered a very important deal in broad daylight to the \nRepublicans. And I am going to make a parliamentary inquiry, if I \nmight, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Here it is. Is it true that Majority Leader Reid offered \nthe Republicans five related amendments to the unemployment \ncompensation bill, those amendments to be of their own choosing? Is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Is it further true that he offered Democrats five related \namendments of their own choosing?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Is it further correct that he also said each side could \noffer an additional five amendments as side-by-sides, if they wanted \nto, of their own choosing? Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Is it also true that he offered time agreements of 1 hour \nper amendment and then to be followed by passage of the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. OK. The reason I wanted to put this in the record in a \nsimple way is because sometimes when we have the back-and-forth and the \n``I object'' and ``reserving the right to object,'' people lose track \nof exactly what happened.\n  We offered the Republicans everything they said they wanted. They \nwanted amendments. They were offered amendments of their own choosing. \nUp to 20 amendments could have been voted on under the agreement. They \nsaid they wanted pay-fors. We gave them a pay-for that actually came \nout of Paul Ryan's budget, a structural change that would have paid for \n10\\1/2\\ months of unemployment benefits. The Republicans just can't say \nyes. They demanded amendments. We gave them amendments. They demanded \npay-fors. We gave them pay-fors.\n  I believe something else is going on, and I have to say what I think \nis going on. They do not want to extend unemployment compensation to \nthe long-term unemployed. That is a dramatic change that is occurring \nin the culture of this country, in the compassion of this country, in \nthe consensus in this country, in the values of this country. We are \ntalking about 1.5 million Americans--250,000 Californians. I am frankly \nstunned.\n  I know Senator Mikulski is here, and I so much want to hear from her, \nso I will skip some of the other history about how it has been over the \nyears and how we have done this where we have come together, \nRepublicans and Democrats. We have extended unemployment compensation \nbenefits more times under Republican Presidents than under Democratic \nPresidents, and Democrats didn't stand there and say: Gee, there is a \nRepublican in the White House. Maybe this will help him look good or \nmaybe this will add two-tenths of 1 percent to the GDP. Maybe we better \nsay no.\n  No. We said yes because we are a party that believes people need to \nkeep hearth and home together.\n  The long-term unemployment rate is twice as high as it was at any \nother time when these extended benefits were allowed to expire. There \nare almost three unemployed people for every job opening nationwide.\n  I am going to close with a few little stories from my constituents \nbecause one has to hear the voices of people. In this Senate, we should \nbe representing the middle class and the working poor of this country. \nWe should be fighting for them because, guess what, everyone else \nbenefits. The billionaires and millionaires are doing fine. They do \nbetter when we have a strong middle class.\n  The Presiding Officer is a fighter for economic justice, and I know \nthis statistic is something the Senator has probably used many times. \nBut the fact is that 450 families are worth more than 150 million \nAmericans. I can guarantee you, those 450 families are just fine and \ntheir children and their grandchildren and their children's children's \nchildren. And good for them. Fine. But what about the people who are \nnow cut off at the knees because they are not getting $300 a week to \nlive? Here is one of them. One woman wrote to me:\n\n       I am 58 years old and am receiving unemployment benefits \n     for the first time in my life. I am currently receiving my \n     first federal extension.\n\n  Which, by the way, she has now been cut off from.\n\n       I was laid off because the non-profit I was working for \n     lost a major portion of its state funding.\n       Getting unemployment benefits is not preventing me from \n     looking for work. In fact, people getting extended \n     unemployment benefits are required to prove that they're \n     looking for work. I spend hours every week filling out \n     applications and posting my resume without results.\n\n  And then she says to me:\n\n       Tell me, how am I, and thousands like me supposed to pay \n     rent and eat? I agree that Washington should ``focus on job \n     creation'' but that should be in addition to, not instead of, \n     extending benefits. I beg you, please extend unemployment \n     benefits.\n\n  Then there is Kaitlyn Smith of Twentynine Palms. She lost her benefit \nwhen the Federal extension expired. A Marine Corps veteran and the \nmother of two, Smith says: Work is hard to come by. They can't move \nbecause her husband, a vet of the Afghanistan-Iraq wars, must remain \nnear the combat center until he is discharged in July.\n  Listen to this:\n\n       I have to keep the house at 55 degrees even though I have \n     two little girls, ages 2\\1/2\\ and 1\\1/2\\.\n\n  That is what she told the L.A. Times in December.\n  How do my Republican friends--except for the one who voted with us at \nthe end of the day--look themselves in the mirror and think about this \ncourageous woman whose family put their life on the line for the \ncountry and who is freezing in their home, because they are playing \nparliamentary games on process?\n  Last, Cindy Snow of Beaumont:\n\n       Why are they using us as pawns? They're playing games with \n     people's lives.\n\n  Referring to politicians in Washington. That appeared in Bloomberg \nNews.\n\n       Laura Walker, a 63-year-old paralegal, has been looking for \n     work since January, when she was laid off from a California \n     law firm. She counted on $450 a week in federal unemployment \n     benefits for help that have now run out.\n       ``Not all of us have savings and a lot of us have to take \n     care of family because of what happened in the economy,'' \n     said Walker, of Santa Clarita, who said she has applied for a \n     least three jobs a week and shares an apartment with her \n     unemployed son, his wife and two children. ``It's going to \n     put my family and me out on the streets.''\n\n  That is from the Bloomberg News of December 30, 2013\n\n       Cindy Snow, of Beaumont, CA, lost her job as a social \n     worker in April when the San Bernardino school system \n     terminated the child-care program where she worked. Her \n     husband, employed in the construction industry, has been \n     without a job since 2009. They have been relying on \n     assistance from the California Housing Finance Agency to \n     cover a $1,424-a-month payment on their home.\n       When she loses her unemployment benefits, she said, the \n     family will no longer qualify for the housing assistance. \n     ``Why are they using us as pawns? They're playing games with \n     people's lives,'' Snow said, referring to politicians in \n     Washington.\n\n  This is also from Bloomberg News of December 30, 2013\n\n       Ethelyn Holmes, a software engineer who lives in Mission \n     Hills, is one of 18,720 San Diego County residents about to \n     lose the weekly payments. Holmes said her $450 weekly \n     unemployment payment goes to food, dental insurance and other \n     living necessities.\n       Holmes, in her 40s, said she's tried zealously to find \n     work. She's joined the Project Management Institute of San \n     Diego, volunteered, attended meetings, cold called and \n     written letters. Now, she said she'd like to find a \n     retraining program to help her become more marketable. ``. . \n     . I have not been sitting here watching soap operas,'' she \n     said. ``I would go to work tomorrow, or today. I really am \n     tired of this.''\n\n\n[[Page S316]]\n\n\n  That is from the San Diego Union-Tribune dated December 28, 2013.\n\n       Steven Swanson of Madera Ranchos, CA, worked for 33 years \n     in wholesale, mostly in beverage sales, before losing his job \n     in 2011. Since then, he estimates that he's submitted resumes \n     for more than 500 positions and in the last six months filled \n     out more than 200 job applications--all to no avail.\n       ``I want a job, I want to work,'' said Swanson whose \n     daughter and son-in-law live with him and pay rent to help \n     him keep up the mortgage on the house he owns. ``As a \n     taxpayer, I paid into the system for a lot of years. For them \n     to just shut it off and say, `These people need to get weaned \n     off and get a job'--well, yeah, I need to get a job. But for \n     them to suggest that I just go get welfare or go get food \n     stamps--that's why I'm frustrated with the Republican Party. \n     They just don't get it.''\n\n  That is from the Fresno Bee of January 2, 2014.\n\n  In addition to helping people get by while they look for jobs, \nextending unemployment insurance will help the economy.\n  A new study by the Council of Economic Advisers and the U.S. \nDepartment of Labor estimates that extending unemployment insurance \nwill prevent the loss of 240,000 jobs in 2014, including 46,441 in \nCalifornia.\n  CBO has said that another year-long extension would add two-tenths of \na percent to our GDP.\n  CBO has found that when unemployment is high, extending unemployment \ninsurance is one of the most cost-effective ways to grow the economy \nand create jobs.\n  This will help us reduce our deficit in the long term. Already, our \nannual deficit has been cut in half. For 2009, when President Obama \ntook office, it was $1.4 trillion. For 2013 it was $680 billion, and \nfor 2014 the forecast is only $560 billion.\n  We are making progress, and extending unemployment benefits will help \nus grow our GDP and reduce our deficit even more.\n  So I say to my colleagues, the answer is obvious. Stop blocking this \nbill. It will save jobs, grow the economy, and provide help to our \nfamilies while they get on their feet.\n  There are a lot of games played around here, and sometimes it is time \nto call the bluff of the people who are playing cruel games. Leader \nReid called the bluff of my friends on the other side. He said: You \nwant amendments? You got them. You want to pay for this extension? We \nhave done it. What did they do? They walked away. And who is suffering? \nPeople like the people I just told you about, ordinary folks who want \nnothing more than to get a decent job, who are caught in a situation \nwhere we are recovering from the worst recession since the Great \nDepression. And this is what we give them, a bunch of gobbledygook \nabout: I wanted more of my amendments so I can be proud and offer \namendments.\n  There is a time and a place for filibusters, even though they do far \ntoo many. There is a time and a place to argue about process. This is \nnot the time. This is not the place. This is wrong. I applaud Leader \nReid for his leadership. I applaud Jack Reed for his leadership.\n  Before Senator Mikulski takes the microphone, I wish to thank her \npublicly. What a hard job she had to sit down and negotiate an \nappropriations bill, an omnibus bill which covers everything we do. It \nwas so hard. But she did it in the right spirit of bipartisanship. So \ndid her colleague, whom she dealt with and had to deal with, \nCongressman Rogers. As a result, we are going to do something good here \nand give stability to the American people.\n  Why can't that same spirit of cooperation take over when we have \noffered the Republicans everything they wanted in order to get them to \nvote for unemployment compensation? I am distressed about it, and we \nwill keep fighting on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise today to speak on the \nConsolidated Appropriations Act of 2014. But before I make those \ncomments, I wish to associate myself with the remarks of the Senator \nfrom California Mrs. Boxer and also the Senator from Rhode Island Mr. \nJack Reed and also all of those who voted to move forward where we \ncontinue to provide an economic safety net for those people who have \nlost their job and are actively looking for work, and to continue this \neconomic and social contract which has been part of the way Americans \nrespond to help other Americans at a time when they are down but they \nshouldn't feel as though they are out. I hope we could put party rancor \naside and look at commonsense ways to move this bill forward.\n  In terms of the so-called pay-fors, I have been here a long time. I \nhave never seen this pay-for before on unemployment compensation, \nparticularly for a 90-day bill. We are talking about 90 days, and we \nare already in the middle of January. I hope the two leaders can come \ntogether and we can resolve this.\n  On another topic, I wish to report to the Senate some very good news. \nI rise today as the chair of the Appropriations Committee, and I wish \nto announce that the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 has \ncompleted all its work in the committee process. We have completed our \nconference and it has been filed in the House and should be considered \nin the House and Senate this week. What does that mean?\n  First of all, our Appropriations Committee has met the test of the \nConstitution. Article 1, section 9 of the Constitution directs that \nthere be an Appropriations Committee, although it is not referred to by \nname, and that every year we review the annual spending of the Federal \nGovernment and vote upon it.\n  We also followed the law. By following the law, the law is the \nbipartisan Budget Act forged by Chairpersons Ryan and Murray. We meet \nthe requirements of the Budget Control Act.\n  The Budget Control Act looks at total spending for the Federal \nGovernment--mandatory spending and then discretionary spending. We who \nare appropriators handle all of the accounts for discretionary \nspending. Guess what. The Budget Committee puts a cap on us, and that \nis great. It is a way that we actually have a cap on spending that \neverybody knows and everybody voted for.\n  So we have a cap by law on discretionary spending of $1.012 trillion \nfor fiscal year 2014. The work of our 12 committees stayed within that \ncap, and yet we spent the money to meet certain areas. We met \ncompelling needs. We certainly preserved national security. We looked \nout for our human capital, particularly our children in terms of \neducation, and also invested in physical capital--improving \ninfrastructure--and also the long-range needs of our country by putting \npublic investments into important research and development by $1 \nbillion more in NIH.\n  We also met the mandate of the American people who told us: Work \ntogether. Be bipartisan. Work across the aisle and work across the \ndome. And we did it. They also said: When the bill comes up, don't do \nit with brinkmanship and don't do it with showmanship. Get the job done \nin a commonsense way which promotes growth in our country but yet at \nthe same time looks at reducing debt.\n  They said: Don't do showdown politics. And we won't. We will pass it \nbecause we have met our deadline.\n  They said: Don't put government on autopilot with something called \nthose continuing funding resolutions. We don't do that either. Every \none of our 12 subcommittees is in this comprehensive bill.\n  We dealt with difficult and divisive policy issues, but we did it \nwith diligence and determination. And, I must add, we tried to promote \nan atmosphere of civility as we did it. It was tense and it was \nintense. But at the end of the day, we did work pinpointing how to do \nthe job rather than finger-pointing at each other. As I said, \nnegotiations were conducted that way.\n  Our House Appropriations Committee chairman--Mr. Hal Rogers, the \ngentleman from Kentucky--and I forged this agreement, along with \nranking members, my vice chairman Senator Shelby of Alabama and in the \nHouse Congresswoman Lowey of New York. We didn't do it alone. There was \nbipartisan agreement of all the subcommittee chairs and over 50 Members \nof the House and the Senate.\n  We met a very stringent deadline. When we left here on December 20, \nwe had to produce a bill by January 15. That is tomorrow. That is when \nthe\n\n[[Page S317]]\n\ncontinuing resolution expires. We are asking for a 72-hour extension, \nnot to finish the job, but so we can do our deliberations on the floor \nin both the House and the Senate.\n  We worked day and night. I jokingly said during the deliberations: I \nwish I were as thin as I am stretched, because we really worked at it. \nOver the holidays our staffs and our subcommittee chairmen worked. The \nonly time they took off was Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. So we \nthank each and every one of them for their dedication.\n  As I said, this bill required very difficult choices. It meant give \nand take. It meant more giving on both sides, because there were no big \ntakes.\n  We worked under a very tight budget, $1 trillion. It sounds like a \nlot of money, and it is. But of the $1 trillion, $600 billion was in \nthe Department of Defense. The other $300 billion was in discretionary \nspending for all of the domestic agencies. It comes out to like 620 and \n380, but those are the rough numbers.\n  So we did meet our national security needs, but we also were very \nmindful. I was particularly mindful of the social contract with the \nAmerican people. I wanted to have a bill to help create jobs in this \ncountry, not make-work but real work, in rebuilding our physical \ninfrastructure on roads and bridges and clean water. I also wanted to \nlook ahead to the long-range needs of our country, in research and \ndiscoveries, and not only win the Nobel prizes but win the markets. We \nexpanded our commercial service office to help us promote exports \noverseas, accelerating manufacturing institutes where government could \nwork with this new emerging dynamic, small-scale manufacturing. I have \nlost over 12 percent of manufacturing in my State, so manufacturing is \nimportant.\n  We wanted to make sure that families felt they had a government that \nis on their side--first of all, helping with school safety--and we have \na bipartisan program in here to promote school safety--but at the same \ntime to promote quality childcare and early childhood education. We \nthen made those kinds of investments, all with an eye to getting value \nfor taxpayers.\n  Our colleagues were very clear, and so were the American people: We \nhave to have a more frugal eye. I instructed my colleagues on the \nSenate side: Let's look at those programs which are dated, duplicative, \nor dysfunctional. They get a D: dated, duplicative, and dysfunctional. \nWe were able to eliminate many of them, and we will be back at it next \nyear doing a scrub. If you notice, there is no atmosphere of crisis.\n\n  The other thing that I am proud of in this bill is that we avoided \ncontentious policy riders. I think we have been able to deal with those \nin a way where they would not be a problem for the other side of the \naisle.\n  However, there was one item wrong or one technical mistake in the \nBudget Committee that I am proud that we were able to fix. This was \nreally at the very top of our agenda, when Mr. Rogers and I met. We \nwere deeply concerned about the cost-of-living issue related to \nmilitary retirees of working age who were disabled or survivors. Their \nCOLAs were mistakenly reduced by 1 percent in the recent budget \nagreement. This bill, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014, \nfixes that problem.\n  It is limited in scope. It is limited to disabled military retirees \nand survivors of departed servicemembers--the neediest of the needy. We \nhope, as time moves on, there is a Presidential and DOD commission on \npension reform at DOD, and we will have a comprehensive approach and do \nit. But I want our colleagues to know we were very mindful of these \nveterans. So we did this fix for military retirees of working age who \nwere disabled or survivors of departed servicemembers, but we also did \nsomething else.\n  If you go to the Web site in the House, which has the most detail \nbecause it is pending there--it will come up in the Senate when it \nmoves here tomorrow--we really put money into veterans health care. We \nput money into fixing the veterans disability backlog. I know the \nSenator from Massachusetts believes that when you are on the front \nlines you should not have to wait at the back of the line if you are a \nwounded warrior to get your disability benefits determined. So we \npushed for those reforms, and we put the taxpayers' dollars behind them \nbecause we knew that is the way they would want us to spend their \nmoney.\n  We also maintained the veterans education budget because many of our \nyoung men and women coming back home who served so well over there need \nto brush up on education here to move them to jobs here.\n  I hope in voting for this bill people realize it is a vote to support \nour most vulnerable patriots, to make sure we keep our promises to our \nveterans, and that we also look at the comprehensive bill that we have \nmoved ahead without rancor, without roar, and we stayed within the \nbudget parameters given to us on a bipartisan agreement.\n  The House will consider this agreement this week. They have sent us \nover a 3-day extension so we could complete our work. I hope we pass \nit. I would like it to pass tonight or certainly tomorrow. We will be \non the floor for ample debate on this bill, and I look forward to \nanswering some questions.\n  But at the end of the day, when all is said and done--in this \ninstitution often more is said rather than done--you will know we did \nget it done. I will have more to say about it when the bill comes to \nthe floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I thank my colleagues from Minnesota \nand North Dakota who are on the floor. I know they want to enter into a \ncolloquy, but they have been gracious to allow me 1 minute on a \nseparate subject, which is flood insurance. I thank them so much.\n  Before I start, I congratulate the Chair of the Appropriations \nCommittee, who not only understands the issues in a major piece of \nlegislation, from science to space to technology to defense to homeland \nsecurity to education, and really keeps so much of that in her mind and \nher heart, but she also can explain this important bill to us in a way \nthat everyone can understand.\n  The Senator from Maryland is truly a champion and a treasure in the \nSenate. Before she leaves the floor I want to acknowledge her \nextraordinary leadership. It is a very tough time to find common \nground, but she has found it with her Republican colleagues. I hope we \ncan get this bill through the floor of the Senate in the next 2 or 3 \ndays.\n  Let me say for one moment how important it is to pass this \nextraordinary appropriations bill, which many of us have been working \non for over a year, literally, in public hearings and meetings, \nnegotiating with our Republican colleagues. Of course, in the last \nmonth these high-level negotiations have been going on. We hope to be \non that bill sometime tomorrow. Leader Reid has expressed that we will \nnot be leaving for the break next week without getting that work done.\n  I am prepared--all of us are here--to handle that business. But there \nis another piece of legislation of which, Madam President, you have \nbeen a cosponsor, and Senator Hoeven, who is on the floor, has been an \nextraordinary leader on, and that is to fix our well-intended but \ndisastrous flood insurance program referred to as Biggert-Waters, which \nwas passed a year ago with very good intentions, but it has had \ndisastrous consequences in Massachusetts, South Dakota, Louisiana, \nTexas, Montana, and in Pennsylvania.\n  This is not a coastal issue. This is an issue that affects millions \nof Americans owning their own homes, their primary homes, and business \nowners--solidly middle-class people who do not live anywhere near a \nbeach and people whose homes have never flooded.\n  They found themselves, because of the unintended consequences of this \nwell-intentioned law, in a terrible circumstance in which they may \nactually lose their home and lose their business. We can fix that. The \ngreat news is we have a bill that is being led by Senator Menendez from \nNew Jersey and Senator Isakson from Georgia. It is truly bipartisan. We \nhave almost 30 cosponsors in the Senate. While it has been difficult to \nfind common ground, we have worked very hard to find it. I am here on \nthe floor to say to our knowledge we have pretty much worked out most \nof the objections on all sides.\n  We think there might be amendments that are wanted to be offered by \nSenator Toomey, Senator Coburn, Senator Crapo, and on our side Senator\n\n[[Page S318]]\n\nHagan and Senator Merkley. We are working through that now.\n  The amendment of Senator Blunt we believe can be incorporated into \nthe bill. The amendment of Senator Tester can be incorporated into the \nbase of the bill with no harm to the underlying balance of the bill.\n  I come to the floor to say to everyone, we are really making \nprogress. We could work on these few amendments in the next hour, and \nthe leaders might be able to ask unanimous consent for us to get on \nthis bill in the morning and actually finish it before we go on \nappropriations. If everyone will cooperate just a little bit more on \nthis, we could have several amendments and limit the time to 30 minutes \nof debate on each amendment. We would end up with about 6 or so \namendments, and we could fit this into tomorrow morning's work.\n  That is my hope. If we do not, then we are going to have to stay \nhere, I think, even after the appropriations bill to get this. I don't \nknow about you, Madam Chair, but I just cannot go home again without \ngetting this fixed. We have been working on this patiently. We have had \nhearings. We have had meetings. We have had press conferences. We have \na coalition of over 200 organizations.\n  We have worked with the House in strong partnership. They will be \nready to act when they get back on our bill. If we can get a strong \nvote of 70 Senators--which we are hoping for, maybe more--that will \nsend a very strong signal to the House of Representatives. This bill \nhas no score--a zero cost to this bill, zero. It doesn't repeal \nBiggert-Waters, it postpones it until we can fix it, and it gives us \nthe impetus to fix it.\n  Let's work hard in the next hour or so. I really thank Senator \nIsakson for working so hard--the Senator from Georgia--for trying to \nclear the objections that are on his side, and Senator Menendez and his \nstaff for working on our side.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana for \nher work on the flood insurance bill. I am pleased to join her in that \neffort. It is very important. I hope we do have an opportunity to \naddress that this week. We will continue to do all we can to help in \nthat endeavor. Again, I thank her for all her work on that very \nimportant legislation.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hoeven and Ms. Klobuchar pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 1925 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Omnibus Spending Package\n\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I stand before this body today to talk \nabout the omnibus spending package the Senate will be considering over \nthe next few days. I have some concerns related to this omnibus \nspending package that relate to a program called PILT. It is an acronym \nwith which most Americans and probably even most Members of Congress \nare not familiar. It stands for payment in lieu of taxes.\n  The program was developed to help those States, including my home \nState of Utah, in which the vast majority of the land is owned by the \nFederal Government. Beside me is a map of the United States. In red we \ncan see all of the land that is owned by the Federal Government. As we \ncan see by looking at the map, most of the land west of the Rocky \nMountains--more than 50 percent, in fact--is owned by the Federal \nGovernment. Very little of the land east of the Rocky Mountains is, by \ncontrast, owned by the Federal Government.\n  Being from a public land State presents some interesting, very \nsignificant, very substantial challenges. Among those challenges is the \nfact that the Federal Government has deemed this land, has legislated \nthis land as being beyond the ability, beyond the authority of States \nand their political subdivisions--including counties and local taxing \njurisdictions--beyond the ability of the States and their subdivisions \nto tax. So we can't collect property tax revenue from any of that land. \nAs a result, a lot of our communities in public land States are \nimpoverished--at least impoverished relative to what they might \notherwise face. They are impoverished relative to what their ability \nwould be to collect revenue through property taxes in public land \nStates.\n  For that reason, this PILT Program was created to try to offset--at \nleast to some degree--the heavy cost, the disproportionate burden that \nis placed on the shoulders of public land States and communities.\n  So each year Congress funds this program, and that program then \npartially offsets the lack of property tax revenue flowing through \nthese public land States and communities.\n  Here is the problem I wish to focus on today: The omnibus spending \npackage we are considering this week contains no funding for PILT--no \nfunding whatsoever. This is potentially devastating to public land \nStates, including Utah, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and many other \nStates, especially those throughout the West. The problem is that \nAmerica's public land States and counties can't wait any longer. This \nprogram must be funded, and it must be funded in this bill.\n  Here is a letter from a commissioner in Piute County, UT. This \ncommissioner states:\n\n       PILT not being funded in 2014 will have a devastating \n     impact on all counties in the West, but it is particularly \n     devastating to a county the size of Piute. With 74 percent of \n     Piute County under Federal control, $225,000 of our $1 \n     million budget--almost one-fourth--comes in the form of PILT \n     payments from the Federal Government. Without this funding, \n     we will be in the midst of one of the biggest disasters to \n     hit Piute County in years.\n       We have been scraping and scraping to try to figure out how \n     to fund a fourth deputy sheriff in our county and thought we \n     had it figured out until this $225,000 evaporated from our \n     county's revenue.\n       At the present time it is virtually impossible to staff all \n     of the police, search and rescue, and emergency services we \n     need. With this cut, it will be impossible.\n\n  The Piute County commissioner continues:\n\n       We will be forced to abandon services, including all \n     services on public lands. It will be sad to have our public \n     lands left without police, search and rescue, and emergency \n     services. I think it is critical to understand that the loss \n     of PILT funding cuts clear to the bone and will be \n     devastating to counties such as Piute.\n\n  Now, some argue--some insist when faced with arguments such as \nthese--that this is all OK and we can just wait to make PILT funding \navailable, that we will make it available through another legislative \nvehicle we will supposedly pass later this year. In fact, some of these \nsame people maintain that we will make it better, we will make it \nautomatic, we will make it mandatory spending when we actually do this \nlater this year.\n  It is true that between 2008 and 2013 PILT was funded through a \nmandatory spending mechanism. That has now expired. But it is important \nto remember that there is nothing mutually exclusive about these ideas; \nno reason why we can't go ahead and fund PILT now with discretionary \nspending and then adopt something later to restore the mandatory nature \nof funding for PILT. We can fund PILT now in this bill, and then we can \nmake it mandatory later. We can and we should. This would give States \nand counties the certainty they need, the certainty they have been \nwaiting for, the certainty that will allow them, finally, to plan their \nbudgets.\n  Remember, for many of these counties, such as Piute County, UT, PILT \nis a substantial portion of their annual revenue stream. It is about \none-fourth of the money that Piute County, UT, has to spend every \nsingle year.\n  Importantly, I offered an amendment to last year's budget that would \nbuild a deficit-neutral reserve fund to make sure PILT continued to be \nfully funded. That amendment passed. Unfortunately, the fact that it \npassed has apparently not been enough to make sure it continued to be \nfunded.\n  Now we have a major funding bill before us. This spending bill \noccupies no fewer than 1,582 pages. It spends in excess of $1.1 \ntrillion. Yet PILT still isn't funded.\n\n[[Page S319]]\n\n  It is important to point out that even if we do the right thing and \neven if we fully fund PILT in this program this year, the PILT Program \nis itself still not adequate. It is still in need of reform. PILT \npayments are quite insufficient.\n  PILT was intended to soften the economic impact associated with the \nFederal Government owning so much of the land in the United States. In \nthe case of Piute County, it is about three-fourths of the land. It is \nabout two-thirds of the land throughout the State of Utah. In some \ncounties in Utah, it is well in excess of 90, sometimes 95 percent of \nthe land in a county. PILT was designed to soften that economic impact. \nBut, regrettably, the Federal Government gives States, through the PILT \nProgram, what amounts to in many instances only pennies on the dollar \nof what the taxing jurisdictions would receive if they were to tax that \nland, if they were to collect taxes--even if they were to collect those \ntaxes at the lowest property tax rate, let's say the Greenbelt rate in \nmany counties. We must correct that imbalance.\n  In the coming days I plan to introduce legislation to begin the \nprocess of doing precisely that. After all, it makes no sense to have a \nprogram that some would argue is deceptively entitled ``Payment In Lieu \nof Taxes'' if, in fact, the payment in lieu of taxes doesn't even \nclosely approximate the value that counties would receive if they were \nactually allowed to tax that land and collect that revenue as taxes.\n  If an American citizen, a U.S. taxpayer, for example, decided to \nadopt his or her own PILT Program and on April 15 of each year just \nsent a check to the IRS saying: These are not my taxes, but this is my \npayment in lieu of taxes; I am just paying what I feel like paying, \nthat would cause problems. The taxpayer in question would probably end \nup in prison. In any event, it wouldn't end well for the taxpayer. Yet \nwe have allowed the Federal Government to get away with this over and \nover, often to the detriment of vulnerable communities, of poor \ncommunities, of communities that rely on the Federal Government's \nunsteady stream of revenue--a stream of revenue that, insufficient as \nit is already, is now being threatened altogether.\n  In a sense the problem we face with the Federal Government owning all \nthis land is not new. It is a problem that has been around for a long \ntime. In many respects it was a problem envisioned by some of the \nFounding Fathers. In fact, we can go all the way back to the \nConstitutional Convention of 1787 and see that it was on the minds of \nsome of the Founding Fathers.\n  On September 5, 1787, at the Constitutional Convention they were \ndiscussing the public land-related authorities in the Constitution, \nincluding the authority that has now been included in what is often \nreferred to as the enclave clause--article I, section 8, clause 17.\n  One of the delegates to the Federal Convention of 1787, Elbridge \nGerry, the delegate from Massachusetts, stood before the Convention and \nmade an astute observation. Mr. Gerry said as follows. He expressed \nconcerns that ``this power''--that is, the power of Congress over \nFederal public lands--``might be made use of to enslave any particular \nState by buying up its territory, and that the strongholds proposed \nwould be a means of awing the State into an undue obedience to the \nGeneral Government.''\n  Then, as now, wise observations often came from the State of \nMassachusetts. Then, as now, we have a grave risk associated with the \nfact that when the Federal Government owns this much land, the Federal \nGovernment has this much power. It was on the minds of the delegates to \nthe Convention of 1787 that one of the things they needed to protect \nagainst was the concentration of too much power in the hands of a few, \nespecially the concentration of too much power within the Federal \nGovernment. Each of them had a mission to protect the sovereignty of \ntheir respective States. And they understood that if Congress had too \nmuch power to simply buy up too much land in any one State--\ndisproportionately in some States--the Federal Government would have \ntoo much influence within that State.\n  I would ask you, when you look at this map I have in the Chamber, \ndoes that look equitable? Does that look like an equitable distribution \nof Federal land ownership? We have to keep in mind that, just as there \nare benefits associated with some of our public lands, there are also \nburdens attached to those benefits. When you look at those burdens, it \nis difficult to say anything other than that they are \ndisproportionately allocated into a certain region of the United \nStates. They are overwhelmingly located within the Rocky Mountains and \nareas west of the Rocky Mountains.\n  So to the extent these benefits benefit everyone in the United \nStates, then the burdens ought to be shared by everyone in the United \nStates as well. Yet they are not. PILT, again, is woefully inadequate \nas it is. But now Congress is trying to withdraw funding for PILT. Even \nthough some may say: Well, we will fund it later this year, we have no \nguarantee of that, and we should be funding it right now.\n  As an interesting side note, in response to Elbridge Gerry's concern \non September 5, 1787, the Founding Fathers put a qualifying clause into \narticle I, section 8, clause 17. They said that Congress's plenary \nlegislative jurisdiction over Federal public land lying within a \nsovereign State's boundaries would exist and could be exercised only if \nthat land--the land in question--was acquired by the consent of the \nhost State's legislature.\n  Some have suggested that this may well mean that when the Federal \nGovernment owns land, when it acquires land within a sovereign State's \nterritorial boundaries, that it owns that land just as any other \nproprietor would own it; that is, subject to the authority of the State \nand its political subdivisions to tax and regulate that land, unless or \nuntil such time as the host State's legislative body parts with that \nbundle of sovereign rights relative to that land. In other words, the \nState retains its taxing power over that land unless or until it \nvoluntarily relinquishes it, gives it up, hands it over to the Federal \nGovernment. Yet, in nearly all instances where you see red on this map, \nthat has not occurred.\n  Many of these States have been content with the fact that they have \nbeen receiving PILT funds, however inadequate those PILT funds may be. \nBut now even those are going away. Even if there is a promise that they \nmight be restored later--later this year--they are still inadequate, \nand we still do not have the promise that is going to occur now. There \nis still a lot of uncertainty in a lot of parts of the country--in \nplaces such as Piute County, UT, and elsewhere within my State and \nelsewhere within the western United States.\n  In order to protect against this kind of concern, the kind of concern \nthat the delegate from Massachusetts described on September 5, 1787, \nCongress adopted a practice, when admitting new States into the Union, \nof incorporating language into the enabling act for each new State, \ndescribing what would happen to public land within the new State's \nboundaries after statehood. They adopted this practice and this \nlanguage that would be used each time a new State was admitted into the \nUnion.\n  That language was included in Utah's statehood enabling legislation--\nlegislation that was adopted about 18 months before Utah finally came \ninto the Union in January of 1896.\n  Section 9 of Utah's enabling legislation says that public land \nlocated within the State, lying within the State of Utah, ``shall be \nsold by the United States subsequent to the admission of said State \ninto the Union. . . . '' Adding to that, section 9 of Utah's enabling \nlegislation said that 5 percent of the proceeds from the sale of that \nland would be given to the State and would be held in a trust fund by \nthat State for the benefit of the State's public education system.\n  So, as I mentioned, Utah was not the first State to have that kind of \nlanguage in its enabling legislation. Many of the States that were \nadmitted into the Union much earlier than Utah had similar language in \ntheir enabling acts. Missouri had such language. North Dakota had such \nlanguage. We could name State after State after State that had such \nlanguage.\n  When you look at Missouri, when you look at North Dakota, and when \nyou look at most of the other States that had language such as that in \ntheir enabling acts, you see very little Federal\n\n[[Page S320]]\n\npublic land. You see because Congress and the Federal Government \nhonored the promises made to those States. Congress followed through \nwith that commitment. Congress did what it was supposed to do. It sold \nthat land subsequent to statehood. Holding on perhaps to a few parcels \nhere and there that it deemed necessary for one reason or another, it \nmade good on that promise. Those States benefited. The Federal Treasury \nbenefited. The American people benefited.\n\n  It is important to remember that what we are talking about here--when \nyou see all this red on the map, representing Federal land ownership--\nis not about national parks. National parks represent a very tiny \npercentage of Federal land ownership. We are not talking about national \nmonuments, which also represents a very tiny percentage of Federal land \nownership. What we are talking about in the context of the PILT program \nare lands that are managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, an \nagency that is considered obscure, almost unheard of throughout most of \nthe United States, but an agency that operates with a particularly \ndominant force in States such as mine, where you see a lot of red on \nthe map.\n  I remember the first time I showed this map to my children, my \ndaughter Eliza, who was about 8 years old at the time, was just barely \nold enough to understand what I was explaining to her. I told her that \nthe red indicated ownership of land by our national government. And 8-\nyear-old Eliza looked at that portion of the map that represented our \nState, and she said: Look, dad, they own Utah. I said: You're right, \nEliza, they own Utah. They certainly own the overwhelming majority of \nit.\n  Some of us have not forgotten this promise made in the statehood \nenabling acts of most of the States admitted into the Union, and yet \nCongress seems to be determined to overlook it. I am determined not to \nlet that happen. Some of my friends back in Utah are likewise \ndetermined not to let that happen.\n  A good friend of mine, Representative Ken Ivory, who serves in the \nUtah State legislature, has done an amazing job educating people \nthroughout Utah and, in fact, across America on this very subject, on \nwhat happened with these statehood enabling acts, and why it is that \nStates in the western United States got left behind when it came to \npromises made long ago by the Federal Government. I commend \nRepresentative Ivory for his work on this issue and pledge to continue \nworking with him on this important project.\n  You see, this is about much more than land. This is about the ability \nof local communities not only to thrive, but to survive. This is about \ncommunities where it is very difficult for people to get jobs. It is \nvery difficult for people, in some instances, even to access their own \nproperty, even to access their own farms because it is impossible to \nget anywhere without crossing Federal public land and in some instances \nFederal land managers will block access to the only roads they can use \nto access their own property. This has to stop.\n  In the meantime, it is vitally important that we focus on the issues \nat hand, that we focus, at a bare minimum, on promises that the Federal \nGovernment has extended in lieu of the other promises. That is not to \nsay we are going to forget about the promises made in the statehood \nenabling acts. We are not. But, for the moment, my attention remains \nfocused on making sure we fund the PILT Program. It has to be funded. \nIn fact, it has to be funded even more than it has been in the past. It \nought to reflect at least a rough equivalent of the amount of money the \ntaxing jurisdiction could collect if it were taxing that land at its \nlowest rate. And, at a bare minimum, even below that, we have to make \nsure the program continues to exist. We have to make sure the program \nis funded at least at its current levels. This is not asking much. But \nit is necessary that we do this.\n  The broken PILT Program is, one could argue, just another example of \ngovernment applying significant and unnecessary weight to the shoulders \nof hard-working Americans, many of whom are struggling just to get by, \nmany of whom are barely able to keep food on the table for their \nfamilies, others of whom are able to provide for the day-to-day needs \nof their families but they are worried about what happens next. They \nfind that whenever they find a little bit of additional income, no \nsooner have they earned it than they find it has been swallowed up--\nswallowed up by increasing taxes, swallowed up by higher prices for \ngoods and for services, and they do not know how to get out of this rut \nin which they find themselves somewhat trapped. These are the kinds of \npeople who suffer the most as a result of the Federal Government's \nfailed policies relative to its Federal public land.\n  We have to remember that lifting these weights is not only within the \ngovernment's power, it is the affirmative obligation of government to \nlift those weights. In an 1861 address to Congress, President Abraham \nLincoln said the ``leading object'' of American government was ``to \nelevate the condition of men--to lift artificial weights from all \nshoulders, to clear the paths of laudable pursuit for all, to afford \nall an unfettered start and a fair chance, in the race of life.''\n  Current PILT policy imposes government waste that makes it more \ndifficult for communities to provide important services such as \nschools, police, and fire departments. It hampers the ability of States \nto budget, plan, and provide for infrastructure improvements, make \nneeded reforms to their tax systems, and attract new businesses and new \njobs.\n  This policy--and the Federal land management policies that accompany \nthe PILT policy more generously--is broken, and it is imposing a heavy \nburden on our communities, particularly in rural areas where the \nFederal Government owns much, most or in some cases nearly all of the \nland and where needs are at their very greatest.\n  The program is already broken. The program is already causing \nmillions and millions of Americans to suffer. The program is already \nseverely impeding economic opportunity for Americans, deepening the \nexisting crisis of opportunity that we have in this country, which \nmanifests itself on three different levels: immobility among the poor, \ninsecurity among the middle class, and cronyist privilege at the top.\n  If you live in one of these States, it might be great if you are one \nof those people who owns one of the few parcels of land that is not \nowned by the Federal Government. It is not so great if you live in one \nof the areas where the Federal Government owns basically everything, \nwhere you can do very little anywhere around you without permission \nfrom the Federal Government, where your local government is barely able \nto survive because it lacks a property tax base, and the Federal \nGovernment fails to adequately fund PILT and threatens--in this \ncircumstance--to withdraw funding from PILT altogether.\n  I respectfully implore all of my colleagues to consider the \ninequities inherent in this map, the inequities inherent in the PILT \nProgram, and, for present purposes, to remember we need to fund PILT.\n  It has to be reformed, absolutely, and we have to examine our Federal \nland ownership and management policies more broadly. Today we need to \nfocus on making sure PILT is funded.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iran\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I come to the floor this evening to discuss an issue \nof national security, and that is how to prevent a nuclear armed Iran.\n  I was thinking about our troubled history with Iran and whether more \nsanctions at this time makes sense for our national security interests, \nand I asked myself these questions:\n  Can, in fact, a country like Iran change?\n  Is it possible for an isolated regime to rejoin the community of \nnations and change its behavior after several decades?\n  Must a country and its people be held captive because of the behavior \nof previous leaders in earlier times?\n\n[[Page S321]]\n\n  So I thought back in history. I was a young girl during World War II. \nI remember when Imperial Japan killed millions in Southeast Asia, and \nparticularly in China, during its brutal wars of expansion. Today, \nJapan is a peaceful democracy and one of this Nation's strongest allies \nin Asia.\n  I remember when Hitler and the German Third Reich committed \nunspeakable atrocities across Europe, including the murder of 6 million \nJewish citizens. Germany is now a close ally, a leader in the European \nUnion, an institution created to ensure a war never again occurs in \nEurope.\n  I remember General Franco's Spain, which was so diplomatically and \neconomically isolated that it was actually barred from the United \nNations until 1955. Spain is now a close partner of the United States \nand a fully democratic member of the European Union.\n  The former Yugoslavia, Vietnam, and South Africa have all experienced \ntremendous change in recent decades. Independent states have emerged \nfrom the painful dissolution of Yugoslavia. Vietnam has opened itself \nto the international community but still has much progress to make. \nSouth Africa has shed apartheid and has emerged as an increasingly \nstable nation on a much divided continent.\n  So I believe countries can change. This capacity to change also \napplies to the pursuit of nuclear weapons. At one time, Sweden, South \nKorea, and Argentina each pursued nuclear weapons.\n  Following World War II, Sweden pursued nuclear weapons to deter \nforeign attack. It mastered nuclear technology and built and tested \ncomponents for a nuclear weapon. It may have even obtained enough \nnuclear material to build a bomb. But in 1970, it signed the Nuclear \nNonproliferation Treaty, and it ended its nuclear weapon program.\n  In the early 1970s, South Korea actively sought a nuclear device. The \nUnited States heavily pressured South Korea not to go nuclear, and in \nApril 1975, South Korea signed the nonproliferation treaty and halted \nits nuclear weapons activity.\n  Throughout the 1980s, when it was ruled by a military junta with an \negregious human rights record, Argentina had a covert nuclear weapons \nprogram. It built uranium production, enrichment, and reprocessing \nfacilities, and it attempted to develop nuclear-capable ballistic \nmissiles before abandoning its nuclear weapons program and ratifying \nthe NPT in 1995.\n  So the question comes, is Iran willing to change its past behavior \nand abandon its pursuit of a nuclear weapon? It may well be, and it is \nthe job of diplomacy to push for that change.\n  I believe there are positive signs that Iran is interested in such a \nchange, and I would like to explain my reasons.\n  The election of Hassan Rouhani was a surprise to many long-time \nobservers of Iran because he campaigned in support of repairing Iran's \nrelationship with the West.\n  Since his inauguration he has tried to do exactly that. For the first \ntime since the Iranian revolution, the leaders of our countries have \nbeen in direct communication with each other. Where once direct contact \neven between senior officials was rare, now Secretary of State John \nKerry and Under Secretary of State Wendy Sherman are in near constant \ncontact with their Iranian counterparts. Those conversations produced \nthe historic Geneva agreement which goes into effect in 6 days, on \nJanuary 20.\n  Candidate Rouhani also promised to increase nuclear transparency, and \nhe has delivered on that as well. Even before the Geneva interim \nagreement was reached, Iran slowed uranium enrichment and construction \nfor the Arak heavy water reactor--maybe for technical reasons, maybe \nnot, but it slowed. Iran has also reengaged with the IAEA to resolve \nquestions surrounding its nuclear activities.\n  So what has been achieved in Geneva? The interim 6-month agreement \nreached between the P5+1 countries, the United States, China, Russia, \nthe UK, France, Germany, freezes Iran's nuclear program in place while \na comprehensive agreement is negotiated in the next 6 months. This \nagreement caps Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium at 5 percent. It \nstops the production of 20 percent enriched uranium. It requires the \nneutralization of Iran's stockpile of 20 percent uranium. It prevents \nIran from installing additional centrifuges or operating its most \nadvanced centrifuges. It prohibits it from stockpiling excess \ncentrifuges. It halts all significant work at the Arak heavy water \nreactor and prevents Iran from constructing a plutonium reprocessing \nfacility.\n  Most importantly, the interim agreement imposes the most intrusive \ninternational inspection regime ever. International inspectors will \nindependently verify whether Iran is complying with the interim \nagreement. For the first time, the International Atomic Energy Agency \ninspectors will have uninterrupted access to Iran's enrichment \nfacilities at Natanz and Fordow, centrifuge production plants, \ncentrifuge assembly facilities, and Iran's uranium mines and mills. \nFinally, Iran is required to declare all planned new nuclear \nfacilities.\n  In exchange, the P5+1 negotiators offered sanctions relief limited to \n$7 billion, an aspect of the interim agreement that has been criticized \nand I wish to talk about it for a moment.\n  Here are the facts on that sanctions relief which, in my view, does \nnot materially alter the biting sanctions which have devastated Iran's \neconomy. The vast majority of sanctions relief comes in the form of \nIranian repatriation of $4.2 billion of its own money. Iran will \ncontinue to lose $4 billion to $5 billion a month in lost oil revenue \nfrom existing sanctions. Iran will not have access to about $100 \nbillion of its own reserves trapped by sanctions abroad.\n  For perspective, the total estimated sanctions relief is valued at \napproximately only 1 percent of the Iranian economy, hardly a \nsignificant amount.\n  I wish to take a moment to detail what is not in the interim \nagreement.\n  First, it does not grant Iran a right to enrich. The United States \ndoes not recognize such a right for the five nonnuclear weapons states \nthat currently have enrichment programs, and we will make no exception \nfor Iran. But Iran does have a right to peaceful nuclear energy if it \nfully abides by the terms of its safeguards agreement under the NPT.\n  Secondly, the agreement does not in any way unravel our core oil and \nfinancial sanctions. Others have argued the suspension of any sanctions \nagainst Iran will unravel the entire sanctions regime, and that is \nfalse. The Obama administration has taken action to ensure that does \nnot happen.\n  Two days after the interim agreement was reached, the United States \nsettled with a Swiss Oil Services Company over sanctions violations. \nThe settlement was more than $250 million. It was the largest against a \nforeign firm outside of the banking industry.\n  On December 12, the administration announced the expansion of Iranian \nentities subject to sanctions. These entities either helped Tehran \nevade sanctions or provided support to Iran's nuclear program.\n  On January 7 of this year, the administration halted the transfer of \ntwo Boeing airplane engines from Turkey to Iran. Through these actions, \nthe Obama administration has made it abundantly clear that the United \nStates will continue to enforce our existing sanctions against Iran.\n  Third, the agreement does not codify the violation of U.N. security \nresolutions. Critics have attacked the interim agreement for its \nfailure to completely halt all of Iran's nuclear enrichment by noting \nthat six U.N. Security Council Resolutions have called on Tehran to do \nso and it has not done so.\n  The purpose of the U.N. Resolutions was not to suspend nuclear \nenrichment indefinitely. Instead, these resolutions were designed to \nfreeze Iran's nuclear activities until the IAEA could determine whether \nIran's activities were for exclusively peaceful purposes.\n  This is an important point. The interim agreement achieves what the \nsix U.N. Security Council Resolutions could not. It freezes Iran's \nnuclear progress while a comprehensive, verifiable agreement is being \nnegotiated over the next 6 months.\n  The interim agreement was only possible because a strong \ninternational sanctions regime has worked to convince rank-and-file \nIranians, candidly, that enough is enough.\n  According to the State Department, as a result of the sanctions, \nIran's crude oil exports have plummeted from approximately 2.5 million \nbarrels per day in 2011 to around 1 million barrels per day in recent \nmonths. This decline\n\n[[Page S322]]\n\nalone costs Iran $3 billion to $5 billion per month in lost revenue.\n  In total, 23 nations who import Iranian oil have eliminated or \nsignificantly reduced purchases from Iran. In fact, Iran currently has \nonly six customers for its oil: China, India, Turkey, South Korea, \nJapan, and Taiwan.\n  In the last year, Iran's gross domestic product shrunk by 5.8 \npercent. Its GDP shrunk in 1 year by 5.8 percent, while inflation is \nestimated to be 50 percent or more.\n  Prices for food and consumer goods are doubling and tripling on an \nannual basis, and estimates put unemployment as high as 35 percent \nwhile underemployment is pervasive.\n  This is why Iran says enough is enough. The sanctions are biting and \nthey are biting deeply, and there is no need to put additional \nsanctions on the table at this time.\n  This body may soon consider the Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act; that \nis, a bill to do exactly the opposite, to impose additional sanctions \nagainst Iran, do it now, and hold it in abeyance.\n  Before casting a vote, Senators should ask themselves what would \nhappen if the bill passes and a promised veto by the President is not \nsustained. I would like to give my view.\n  I sincerely believe the P5+1 negotiations with Iran would end and, \nwith it, the best opportunity in more than 30 years to make a major \nchange in Iranian behavior--a change that could not only open all kinds \nof economic opportunities for the Iranian people, but help change the \ncourse of a nation. Its destiny in fact could be changed.\n\n  Passing additional sanctions now would only play into the hands of \nthose in Iran who are most eager to see diplomacy fail. Iranian \nconservatives, hardliners, will attack President Rouhani and Foreign \nMinister Zarif for seeking a nuclear compromise.\n  They will argue that Iran exchanged a freeze of its nuclear program \nfor additional and harsh punitive sanctions. Think about that. They \nwill say that Iran did not achieve anything with this agreement. All we \ngot were more sanctions.\n  Second, if the United States cannot honor an interim agreement \nnegotiated in Geneva by Russia, China, France, Germany, the UK and \nourselves--we are not alone in this--it will never lift sanctions after \na final agreement is reached.\n  Above all, they will argue that the United States is not interested \nin nuclear diplomacy--we are interested in regime change.\n  The bottom line: If this body passes S. 1881, diplomatic negotiations \nwill collapse, and there will be no final agreement.\n  Some might want that result, but I do not.\n  Iran's nuclear program would once again be unrestrained, and the only \nremaining option to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon would \nbe military action. I do not want that unless it is absolutely \nnecessary.\n  To date, the prospect of just considering this bill has prompted \nIranian legislators to consider retaliation. There is talk that the \nlegislative branch, called the Majles, may move to increase nuclear \nenrichment far beyond the 5-percent limit in the interim agreement and \nmuch closer to, if not achieving, weapons-grade uranium.\n  So the authors of additional sanctions in this body and Iranian \nhardliners in the other body would actually combine to blow up the \ndiplomatic effort of 6 major powers.\n  The bill's sponsors have argued that sanctions would strengthen the \nUnited State's hand in negotiations. They argue that sanctions brought \nIran to the negotiating table in the first place. They contend that \nadditional sanctions would force Iran to abandon its nuclear program.\n  I could not disagree more.\n  Let me give the views of a few other people who are knowledgeable in \nthe arena: Dr. Paul Pillar, a former U.S. intelligence official and \ncurrent professor at Georgetown University recently argued:\n\n       It is the prospect of having U.S.-led sanctions removed \n     that will convince Iran to accept severe restrictions on its \n     nuclear program. Threatening Iran with additional sanctions \n     now--after it has agreed to the interim agreement and an \n     interim agreement is about to go into effect--will not \n     convince Tehran to complete a final agreement.\n\n  I couldn't agree more.\n  If this bill would help our negotiators, as its authors contend, they \nwould say so.\n  I believe this bill is an egregious imposition on the Executive's \nauthority to conduct foreign affairs. In fact, our Secretary of State \nhas formally asked this Congress to give our negotiators and our \nexperts the time and space to do their jobs, including no new \nsanctions.\n  What does this body say, sitting here? We are not going to do that? \nThis is a Secretary of State who is of this body, Chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee, who has been absolutely prodigious in his \nefforts to get this interim agreement, has gotten it, and we are going \nto run the risk that it is going to break apart during the next 6 \nmonths when a final agreement might well be negotiated?\n  If the Senate imposes its will, if we override the President's veto, \nand it blows up this very fragile process, some would say: Too bad, \nwhat a tragedy.\n  We know what the Iranian reaction will be. The Iranian Foreign \nMinister Zarif, who I happen to have known for a substantial period of \ntime, has clearly stated what the result will be in five words, and it \nis this: ``The entire deal is dead.''\n  That is his direct quote. Why wouldn't we take him at his word? So \nfar he has been good to his word.\n  The ambassador of our staunchest ally, the UK, warned this body not \nto pass more sanctions. Sir Peter Westmacott recently wrote:\n\n       Further sanctions now would only hurt negotiations and risk \n     eroding international support for the sanctions that have \n     brought us this far. The time for additional measures will \n     come if Iran reneges on the deal or negotiations fail. Now is \n     not that time.\n\n  I deeply believe that a vote for this legislation will cause \nnegotiations to collapse. The United States, not Iran, then becomes the \nparty that risks fracturing the international coalition that has \nenabled our sanctions to succeed in the first place.\n  It says to the UK, China, Russia, France, and Germany that our \ncountry cannot be trusted to stand behind our diplomatic commitments. \nThat is a very big statement.\n  Our allies will question whether their compliance with sanctions and \nthe economic sacrifices they have made are for naught.\n  Should these negotiations fall apart, the choices are few and the \nmost likely result, in my view, is the eventual and inevitable use of \nmilitary force.\n  So I ask this body, Is that the choice we want to make? In 6 days the \ntentative agreement will go into place. We want to pass this? We don't \neven want to wait and see what happens?\n  We don't even want to wait and see what the IAEA finds when they are \nin there 24-7, 365 days a year?\n  I think what we ought to do is concentrate on Iranian compliance with \nthe interim agreement.\n  On January 20, 2014, this agreement comes into effect, 6 days from \nnow, and over the next 6 months the international community will be \nable to verify whether or not Iran is keeping its commitments to freeze \nits nuclear progress.\n  If Iran fails to abide by the terms of the interim agreement, or if a \nfinal agreement cannot be negotiated, Congress can immediately consider \nadditional sanctions.\n  I deeply believe that additional sanctions should only be considered \nonce our diplomatic track has been given the opportunity to forge a \nfinal, comprehensive, and binding agreement.\n  This is what is most distressing. If we had not reached an agreement, \nwith the cooperation and leadership of the big powers of this world, \nthat would be one thing. The fact is we have reached agreement and that \naction is just about to take place, and we are going to jaundice it, we \nare going to hurt it, and we are likely to collapse it by passing \nadditional sanctions now which a President of the United States will \nveto with the aim of overriding that veto.\n\n  How does that make any kind of common sense? It defies logic, it \nthreatens instant reverse, and it ends what has been unprecedented \ndiplomacy. Do we want to take that on our shoulders? Candidly, in my \nview, it is a march toward war.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I know the \nchallenges Iran poses to U.S. interests around the world.\n\n[[Page S323]]\n\n  I see the majority leader is on the floor.\n  Would the majority leader like me to cease for a moment?\n  Mr. REID. Go ahead and finish.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. As I said, as Chairman of the Intelligence Committee, \nI know the challenges Iran poses to the U.S. interests around the \nworld. Its patronage of the terrorist group Hezbollah, its support for \nSyria's Bashar Assad through the Revolutionary Guard Corps are two of \nthe most troubling.\n  I would hope that as a followthrough of diplomacy we might be able to \nquell some of these activities.\n  Let me acknowledge Israel's real, well-founded concerns that a \nnuclear-armed Iran would threaten its very existence. I don't disagree \nwith that. I agree with it, but they are not there yet.\n  While I recognize and share Israel's concern, we cannot let Israel \ndetermine when and where the United States goes to war. By stating that \nthe United States should provide military support to Israel in a formal \nresolution should it attack Iran, I fear that is how this bill is going \nto be interpreted.\n  Let me conclude. The interim agreement with Iran is strong, it is \ntough, and it is realistic. It represents the first significant \nopportunity to change a three-decade course in Iran and an opening to \nimprove one of our most poisonous bilateral relationships. It could \nopen the door to a new future which not only considers Israel's \nnational security, but protects our own.\n  To preserve diplomacy, I strongly oppose the Nuclear Weapon Free Iran \nAct.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Donnelly).

Mr. President, I rise today, as an alumna of \nGeorgetown University, to recognize the university's 225th anniversary. \nOn January 23, 1789, the first deed was granted to then Bishop John \nCarroll for land on which Georgetown was built. Those of us whose lives \nhave been shaped, at least in part, by this great institution are proud \nthat it was founded in the same year that the United States was formed. \nIndeed, the two events were intertwined, and Georgetown's mission \nstatement today continues to reflect that bond by emphasizing that the \nuniversity ``educates women and men to be reflective lifelong learners, \nto be responsible and active participants in civil life and to live \ngenerously in service to others.''\n  Over the course of more than two centuries, Georgetown, its students, \nand alumni have contributed to our country's rich history. The \nAstronomical Observatory on campus was used to calculate the longitude \nand latitude of the District of Columbia in 1846. This building stands \ntoday and is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. \nBuildings on the Georgetown campus were used as hospitals for wounded \ntroops during the Civil War, which nearly closed the university because \nso many students left to fight, for both the Union and Confederate \nStates. All told, more than 1,000 Georgetown students and alumni \nserved. In 1876, the students selected the colors blue--Union--and \ngray--Confederate--as the university's official colors to celebrate the \nend of the war. These colors remain a source of school pride today.\n  Father Patrick Healy, born a slave, became the first African American \nto head a major U.S. university, serving as Georgetown's president from \n1873 to 1882. With the outbreak of World War I, Georgetown formed a \n500-member Cadet Corps in the spring of 1917. In 1918, the U.S. War \nDepartment replaced it with the Student Army Training Corps, which \nbecame the Reserve Officers Training Corps as we know it today \nfollowing the end of the war. More than 2,000 Georgetown men served. \nDuring World War II, Georgetown was selected by the War Department to \nhouse the Army Specialized Training Program. Over 75-percent of \nstudents enrolled during the 1943-1944 academic year were military \nservicemen.\n  Since Georgetown awarded its first two bachelor's degrees in 1817, \nthe university has educated numerous leaders in business, government, \nand the nonprofit sector. A President, Cabinet Secretaries, \nAmbassadors, Governors, and Members of the U.S. Senate and House of \nRepresentatives have studied on ``the Hilltop'' and left to make \nimportant contributions to our country and beyond. Likewise, Georgetown \nalumni have gone on to lead school systems, universities, and \nbusinesses, as well as international and charitable organizations that \nstrive to address challenges facing the United States and the world.\n  A school with an enrollment of 40 students in its first year has now \nswelled to over 12,000 undergraduate and graduate students, more than \n5,000 faculty and staff, and countless alumni. In addition to \nundergraduate degrees, Georgetown University now includes the McDonough \nSchool of Business, Walsh School of Foreign Service, Graduate School of \nArts and Sciences, Law Center, School of Medicine, School of Continuing \nStudies, School of Nursing and Health Studies, and McCourt School of \nPublic Policy.\n  I was privileged to have the opportunity to earn a Georgetown degree, \nand my experience there has played a significant role in the career of \npublic service I have been blessed to live. It is a place that gave me \nopportunities to be exposed to public service here in the Nation's \nCapital as a student and impressed on me a set of values reflecting \nJesuit tradition that continue to shape my life and work.\n  Georgetown's history has in many ways tracked the Nation's history. \nIt is a pleasure to recognize the tremendous impact it has had over the \nlast 225 years and to look forward to future centuries of contributions \nnot only to this country but to the world.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 225th \nanniversary of the founding of Georgetown University. As a proud member \nof the Georgetown community, it is an honor to help commemorate the \nschool's 225 years of excellence. This milestone marks a time of \ncelebration for all of Georgetown's students, faculty, board of \ngovernors, and alumni.\n  As the oldest Catholic and Jesuit institution of higher education in \nthe United States, Georgetown has a long and distinguished history. On \nJanuary 23, 1789, Bishop John Carroll, the first Catholic bishop in the \nUnited States, secured the deed to around 60 acres of land overlooking \nthe Potomac River. This hilltop grew to become the campus of Georgetown \nUniversity. Three years later, in 1791, the first students arrived on \ncampus. At the age of 13, William Gaston was the first student at the \nuniversity. He went on to serve North Carolina as a Member of the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives and authored a bill granting a Federal charter \nto ``the College of Georgetown in the District of Columbia'' in 1815. \nPresident James Madison signed that legislation into law on March 1, \n1815.\n  While buildings on Georgetown's campus were temporarily used as a \nhospital after the Second Battle of Bull Run, it wasn't until 1851 that \nGeorgetown University Medical School, which I attended in the 1970s, \nwas established. It was the first Catholic medical school in our \nNation. The medical school first\n\n[[Page S324]]\n\nopened its doors in a vacant warehouse and an adjacent building at 12th \nand F Streets, NW, before later moving to the university's main campus \nin 1930.\n  I received both a bachelor of science degree in biology and a doctor \nof medicine degree from this great university. The quality education \nand valuable training I received there has had a lasting impact on my \nlife and helped shape my career. I am grateful for my time at this \nexceptional institution and the incredible influence Georgetown has had \non so many people across the United States and around the world.\n  Over the years, there have been numerous Members of Congress who were \nstudents at Georgetown University. Today, the U.S. Senate is fortunate \nto have five other Members who hold degrees from Georgetown University. \nSenator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska received her bachelor's degree from \nGeorgetown. Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Senator Mark Kirk of \nIllinois, and Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii all received their law \ndegrees from Georgetown Law. The Senate majority whip, Senator Dick \nDurbin of Illinois, holds both his undergraduate and law degrees from \nGeorgetown.\n  As shown by the geographic range of States represented by these \nSenators, students come from all over the Nation to attend this \nwonderful institution of higher education. Georgetown's student body \ntoday includes students from all 50 States as well as from 141 \ncountries around the globe. Georgetown is indeed a national as well as \na global university.\n  The university's mission statement makes the point that ``the \nuniversity was founded on the principle that serious and sustained \ndiscourse among people of different faiths, cultures, and beliefs \npromotes intellectual, ethical and spiritual understanding.'' It is \nclear that this founding principle continues to energize Georgetown \nUniversity 225 years later.\n  I look forward to all of the great contributions Georgetown will \ncontinue to provide in the years ahead through its many areas of \nacademic and research excellence: medicine, law, international affairs, \nbusiness, public service, and the diverse fields within the arts and \nsciences.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating this significant \nmilestone and wishing Georgetown University continued success in \nachieving its mission and goals in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/14/senate-section/article/S324-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:27 p.m., a message from the House, delivered by Mrs. Cole, one \nof its reading clerks, announced that the House has passed the \nfollowing bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 230.

A bill to amend the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \nConsumer Protection Act to provide for an application process for \ninterested parties to apply for a county to be designated as a rural \narea, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have spoken often on the floor about \nthe challenges and opportunities for the future that the people of \neastern Kentucky and rural parts of the Commonwealth face. Many of \nthese challenges stem from this administration's regulatory overreach, \nwhether it is a war on coal, ObamaCare or Dodd-Frank. Too many people \nare out of work, which has placed a drastic burden on the coal mining \nindustry, and harshly cut the number of jobs available in the coal \nmining industry and related industries.\n  In spite of the challenges the people of eastern Kentucky face, I \nhave great confidence we can overcome that and succeed. I was pleased \nto be able to assist the Kentucky Highlands Investment Corporation in \nreceiving a Promise Zone designation, which was awarded just last week. \nThat is why I wrote the administration in support of this designation \nlast year. This economic initiative is just one way to help jump-start \nthe region's journey out of economic distress.\n  But we need more than that. My friend and colleague in the other \nChamber, Representative Hal Rogers, is leading an effort to identify \nways to lift Appalachia out of the cycle of poverty and unemployment \nthrough the SOAR Initiative, and I applaud his efforts.\n  To offer yet another possibility for eastern Kentucky, my friend and \ncolleague Senator Rand Paul and I introduced the Economic Freedom Zones \nAct, to further enable eastern Kentucky to lift the burdens of some of \nthe poorest families in the country. Our legislation would roll back \ngovernment regulations and tax barriers to spur job creation and reform \nfailed educational systems to aid disadvantaged children.\n  So continuing my efforts to find ways to assist these rural counties \nand give these communities a voice, I am pleased to introduce today, \nalong with Senator Paul, the Helping Expand Lending Practices in Rural \nCommunities Act or simply the HELP Rural\n\n[[Page S327]]\n\nCommunities Act. My friend and colleague in the House, Representative \nAndy Barr, introduced this legislation in that body, and I applaud his \nefforts to see it passed.\n  The HELP Rural Communities Act would give rural counties in Kentucky \na voice when the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, has \nincorrectly labeled them as ``nonrural''--just another example of this \nadministration's one-size-fits-all, we-know-best approach to governing. \nSeveral counties in Kentucky, such as Bath County, have been labeled as \n``nonrural'' and are therefore barred from certain rural lending \npractices helpful to farmers and small businesses.\n  If you have ever been to these counties, as I have, you would most \ncertainly disagree with the CFPB's ruling. But current law provides \nliterally no opportunity to challenge the CFPB's decision. My bill \nwould allow counties which have been improperly designated as \n``nonrural'' to petition the CFPB with additional local information to \nreconsider their status in order to ensure that rural communities, such \nas those in eastern Kentucky, have the access to credit they need to \ngrow their economy.\n  This is an important step in the effort to renew hope for the future \nin rural Kentucky, especially eastern Kentucky. Given the bipartisan \ninterest shown in recent weeks to get government out of the way and let \nthe people of the region work, Congress and the President can come \ntogether to pass this legislation on behalf of eastern Kentuckians and \nrural communities. I look forward to working with my colleagues, \nSenator Paul and Representative Barr, to see that we get this passed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1916\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Helping Expand Lending \n     Practices in Rural Communities Act of 2014'' or the ``HELP \n     Rural Communities Act of 2014''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DESIGNATION OF COUNTY AS A RURAL AREA.\n\n       Section 1022 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \n     Consumer Protection Act (12 U.S.C. 5512) is amended by adding \n     at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(e) Designation of County as a Rural Area.--\n       ``(1) Application.--Not later than 90 days after the date \n     of the enactment of this subsection, the Bureau shall \n     establish an application process under which a person who \n     lives or does business in a State may, with respect to a \n     county in such State that has not been designated by the \n     Bureau as a rural area for purposes of a Federal consumer \n     financial law, apply for such county to be so designated.\n       ``(2) Evaluation criteria.--When evaluating an application \n     submitted under paragraph (1), the Bureau shall take into \n     consideration the following factors:\n       ``(A) Criteria used by the Director of the Bureau of the \n     Census for classifying geographical areas as rural or urban.\n       ``(B) Criteria used by the Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget to designate counties as metropolitan \n     or micropolitan or neither.\n       ``(C) Criteria used by the Secretary of Agriculture to \n     determine property eligibility for rural development \n     programs.\n       ``(D) The Department of Agriculture rural-urban commuting \n     area codes.\n       ``(E) A written opinion provided by the State's banking \n     regulator.\n       ``(F) Population density.\n       ``(3) Public comment period.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Not later than 60 days after receiving \n     an application submitted under paragraph (1), the Bureau \n     shall--\n       ``(i) publish such application in the Federal Register; and\n       ``(ii) make such application available for public comment \n     for not fewer than 90 days.\n       ``(B)  Limitation on additional applications.--Nothing in \n     this subsection shall be construed to require the Bureau, \n     during the public comment period with respect to an \n     application submitted under paragraph (1), to accept an \n     additional application with respect to the county that is the \n     subject of the initial application.\n       ``(4) Information required to be published.--The Bureau \n     shall enter each application submitted under paragraph (1) in \n     a sortable, downloadable database that is publicly accessible \n     through the Web site of the Bureau.\n       ``(5) Decision on designation.--Not later than 90 days \n     after the end of the public comment period under paragraph \n     (3)(A) for an application, the Bureau shall--\n       ``(A) grant or deny such application; and\n       ``(B) publish such grant or denial in the Federal Register, \n     along with an explanation of what factors the Bureau relied \n     on in making such determination.\n       ``(6) Subsequent applications.--A decision by the Bureau \n     under paragraph (5) to deny an application for a county to be \n     designated as a rural area shall not preclude the Bureau from \n     accepting a subsequent application submitted under paragraph \n     (1) for such county to be so designated, so long as such \n     subsequent application is made after the end of the 90-day \n     period beginning on the date that the Bureau denies the \n     application under paragraph (5).''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOEVEN (for himself, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Blunt, Mr. \n        Manchin, Mr. Kirk, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Johanns, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. \n        Hatch, Mr. King, Mr. Bennet, Ms. Hirono, Mr. Begich, Mr. Wyden, \n        Mr. Coons, Mr. Portman, Mr. Franken, and Mr. Thune):\n  S. 1925. A bill to limit the retrieval of data from vehicle event \ndata recorders; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for \njoining me this afternoon. Today we are introducing the Driver Privacy \nAct. I am very pleased to sponsor that legislation with the good \nSenator from Minnesota. We have a great group that has joined us as we \nintroduce this bill today. This is all about protecting people's \nprivacy in regard to their automobile.\n  Every automobile that will be made going forward, over 90 percent, \nand something like 96 percent of the automobiles made now have a black \nbox. This is actually silver, but we call it a black box because it is \nan event data recorder. It records information about your automobile. \nNinety-six percent, I think, of automobiles made now have them, but the \nU.S. Department Of Transportation is requiring this year that every \nvehicle have an event data recorder in it.\n  The Senator from Minnesota and I believe that should be the owner's \ninformation and that information should not be released without the \nowner's consent. We already have a good group who have joined us in the \nendeavor, including an equal number of Republicans and Democrats: \nSenator Johanns from Nebraska, Senator Angus King from Maine, Senator \nKirk from Illinois, Senator Joe Manchin from West Virginia, Senator \nSaxby Chambliss from Georgia, Senator Michael Bennet from Colorado, \nSenator Roy Blunt from Missouri, Senator Mazie Hirono from Hawaii, \nSenator Johnny Isakson from Georgia, Senator Mark Begich from Alaska, \nSenator Orrin Hatch from Utah, and Senator Ron Wyden from Oregon.\n  It is absolutely an equal number of Republicans and Democrats from \nacross the United States have joined together, recognizing people are \nconcerned about their privacy and we need to make sure their privacy is \nprotected.\n  I would like to make a few further introductory comments with the \nhelp of these charts and then turn to my colleague from Minnesota for \nher comments as well. We have seen with the NSA, with the IRS, with the \nAffordable Care Act, and with a whole range of issues that people \nbelieve what is going on, not only in government but with technology, \nis that their privacy is at risk these days and it is very much a \nconcern. Many people do not realize that this event data recorder is in \ntheir car. It records all kinds of information, and in fact the Federal \nGovernment is requiring that this device be in their car. Neither is \nthere a limitation on the amount of data that the device can record nor \nis there a law that protects individuals' privacy to make sure the \nowner of the car decides who gets that information, other than under \nvery specific circumstances which I will take a minute to go through.\n  What kind of data gets recorded by your event data recorder, this \nblack box that is included in your car? There are more than 45 \ndifferent data points that are in fact recorded right now. Again, the \nmanufacturer can change this--add to it. There are no limitations or \nrestrictions or guidelines or requirements on what manufacturers can \nhave the event data recorder do. Right now it records things like \nspeed, braking, engine, seatbelt usage, driver information, passenger \ninformation, steering, airbags, and crash details. As\n\n[[Page S328]]\n\nI say, at this point the manufacturer determines what goes into that \nblack box in terms of what its capabilities are.\n  Just to give a sense, if you delve further, for example, engine--just \npick one here: ``Number of times engine was started since being \nmanufactured prior to a crash.'' Obviously the idea here with the event \ndata recorder is that it provides information just like an event data \nrecorder on an airplane. In the event of a crash, it provides \ninformation about the accident. It is recording this information in a \nloop on a continuous basis, and it retains it for a short period of \ntime and constantly updates it.\n\n  For example, for your engine, it can record the number of times the \nengine was started since being manufactured prior to a crash. It can \nrecord the number of times the engine was started since being \nmanufactured prior to the EDR data download that is taken in case the \nbox is removed and the information is taken and there isn't a crash. It \ncan record how fast the engine was running. That is just 1 of the 45 \ndata points, but it shows the kind of information that is recorded and \ncan be extracted from the black box.\n  So what does our legislation do? It is very simple and very \nstraightforward. The Driver Privacy Act provides that the data from \nyour EDR in your car cannot be extracted or taken by another party \nother than under very specific circumstances, and that means it cannot \nbe done without your consent unless it is authorized by a court of law \nor the information is retrieved pursuant to NHTSA, which is the \nNational Highway Transportation Safety Administration, recall or the \ninformation is needed in the event of a medical emergency, essentially \nunless there is some kind of recall on the car--and then they can't \ndisclose any data about you as an individual. It is macrodata. But \nother than that, without your consent, that information can only be \ntaken from you by a court of law or in the event of a medical \nemergency, and that is done, obviously, for the very reason you have \nthe black box in the car--safety, right?\n  Law enforcement might be getting it pursuant to a court order. They \ncan't just take it; they have to have a court order. If you are in a \ncar accident and they need that information because of a medical \nemergency, then there is a special condition to take it.\n  In developing these, we were very careful to work both with the \norganizations that advocate privacy as well as the automobile dealers, \nthe insurance industry, and law enforcement. We consulted with \nstakeholders, such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center, \nHeritage, AAA, the Auto Alliance, the International Association of \nChiefs of Police. Again, we wanted to make sure the law enforcement \nissues were covered as well as the ACLU. We have a broad and diverse \ngroup that has been consulted and that we have worked with in putting \ntogether this information.\n  Fourteen States have their own laws on this issue. I have highlighted \nthe 14 different States that have passed laws that, in fact, assure you \nthat this information is your information and cannot be taken from you \nwithout your consent other than through a court order or in the case of \na medical emergency. But when you leave your State and you are driving \nin another State, you are no longer protected. So even though 14 States \nhave stepped up and said: Yes, this is something we need to do--in \nfact, it was something we did when I was Governor in my State. Not only \nare the other States not protected, but you are not protected either \nwhen you drive outside your State, which all of us do on many \noccasions. So that is why we need a Federal law.\n  The reality is this technology is evolving and developing. This \ntechnology is going to continue to develop with all kinds of other \naspects--obviously now we have GPS--and all the different things that \nare being done with automobiles. In many cases these are things people \nwant, but they need to know their privacy is protected, and that is \nwhat we are doing here. We are doing it in a way that we made sure we \ncontinue to assure law enforcement, first responders, and manufacturers \nthat the safety issues are being dealt with, and at the same time \nassure American citizens and consumers that their privacy rights are \nbeing respected and protected as required under the Fourth Amendment of \nour Constitution.\n  With that, I will turn to my esteemed colleague from Minnesota and \nagain thank her and her staff for the work they have done on this bill. \nWith her background in law enforcement, she truly understands the \nissues and has been invaluable in putting this legislation together. \nAgain, I thank her and ask her for her comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I am introducing this bill today with \nSenator Hoeven, who has been a true leader on this issue. When he was \nGovernor, he worked to pass a similar law in North Dakota.\n  As Senator Hoeven just described, the Driver Privacy Act will \nstrengthen safety and protect consumer privacy. I think the bipartisan \nsupport Senator Hoeven has gathered for this bill--seven Republicans, \nseven Democrats, and people all over the country from Hawaii to Georgia \nto Oregon to Alaska, not to mention the two of us from the middle of \nthe country--demonstrates the strong support and the concerns people \nhave about emerging technology. We want this technology, but I figure \nour laws have to be as sophisticated as the technology we have out \nthere. Right now our laws are lagging and this information is not \nprotected. There is no roadmap on how it should be protected, and that \nis why we are introducing this bill.\n  I have long supported improving safety on the roadways. Too many \npeople die on our highways, and we need to do something about it. In \n2010, there were more than 30,000 fatal crashes and more than 1.5 \nmillion crashes that resulted in injuries. This is unacceptable. Rural \nroad safety is a critical issue for my State, as well as for Senator \nHoeven's State. Only 23 percent of the country's population lives in \nrural areas, and yet 57 percent of all traffic fatalities occur in \nrural America.\n  As a Member of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation \nCommittee, I have worked to advance efforts to improve safety for all \ndrivers, especially on rural roads, and we have made some progress. The \ntransportation bill, MAP-21, ensured strong funding for safety \nimprovements at rail-highway grade crossings, and the allocation of \nFederal funding was improved to put resources into roadways that need \nattention the most.\n  My amendment in MAP-21, with Senator Sessions, required the Federal \nHighway Administration to work with State and local transportation \nofficials to collect the best practices from around the country that \nare also cost-effective ways to increase safety on high-risk rural \nroads. The report was just released, and I am now looking for \nopportunities for how we can best address some of the challenges \naddressed in the study, but it is clear we have more work to do.\n  Vehicle technologies that assist drivers and prevent crashes have \ngrown tremendously in recent years. From new sensors that identify \nunsafe conditions, to driverless cars, these emerging technologies \ncould dramatically increase safety for drivers and passengers.\n  Event data recorders, which are the subject of our discussion today, \nhold similar promise in improving safety on our roadways. An EDR, as \nSenator Hoeven described, is a device that records data on a loop it \nreceives from vehicle sensors and safety systems. The data is \nconstantly being replaced and it only records 5 seconds of technical \nsafety information when a crash occurs, although I am sure that could \nchange when the technology changes.\n  EDRs can be the only resource available to determine the cause of a \ncrash by providing information about what a driver was doing in the \nseconds leading up to a crash, such as how fast the vehicle was going, \nwhether the brake was activated in the seconds before the crash, if \nairbags were deployed, and whether the driver and passengers were \nwearing seatbelts.\n  As a former prosecutor, I know how useful this data can be. It can be \nvery useful for investigators to put the pieces back together to more \neasily determine the cause of a crash for safety reasons and also \ndetermine who caused the crash.\n  The proven benefits to driving safety that EDRs provide are not new. \nIn the summer of 2012, the Senate included in\n\n[[Page S329]]\n\nits version of the Transportation bill, MAP-21, a requirement that the \nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration, NHTSA, initiate a \nrulemaking to require passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks to \ninclude EDRs.\n  At the same time, there were many legitimate questions regarding what \nimpact expanding EDRs to all passenger vehicles would have on consumer \nprivacy. Who owns the data? Who can access the data? It became clear \nthat an effective EDR provision would need to strengthen driver and \nvehicle safety while protecting consumer privacy, and the EDR provision \nwas removed from the final transportation bill.\n  Over the past 2 years, NHTSA has continued to work with law \nenforcement safety groups and the automobile manufacturers to ensure \nthe safety benefits of EDRs, which could reach the most consumers. The \nauto manufacturers had already begun expanding the inclusion of EDR \ntechnology in more new vehicles each year. EDRs became so commonplace \nthat 96 percent of 2013 cars and trucks had the EDR built in, and NHTSA \nand the industry it regulates, the automakers, were able to agree that \nall new cars and trucks should have an EDR in place in September 2014. \nI am not sure everyone who goes out and buys a car is aware of this, \nbut by 2014 every single car and truck will have this capability.\n  However, NHTSA does not have the authority to address the consumer \nprivacy concerns related to EDRs that have remained outstanding for 2 \nentire years. We have seen an enormous increase in new cars and trucks \ncontaining the EDRs, and that is where Senator Hoeven comes in.\n  Congress does have the authority to clarify ownership of EDR data, \nand that is why we are introducing the Driver Privacy Act, along with \n12 other Senators. Our bill makes crystal clear that the owner of the \nvehicle is the rightful owner of the data collected by that vehicle's \nEDR, and it may not be retrieved unless a court authorizes retrieval of \nthe data, the vehicle owner or lessee consents to the data retrieval, \nthe information is retrieved to determine the need for emergency \nmedical response following a crash, or the information is retrieved for \ntraffic safety research, in which case personally identifiable \ninformation is not disclosed. So that is where you have it.\n  We have worked hard with safety groups and law enforcement to make \nsure this would work for them. You would need a court authorization or \nyou would need a consent or you would need a determination that it is \nneeded to determine the cause of a crash or it is needed for research, \nand in that case, no identifiable data.\n  This was really important for me, as a former prosecutor, that we \nmade this work for law enforcement and our safety groups, but, most \nimportantly, our goal was to make it work for the individual consumers, \nthe citizens of the United States of America. We realize while all of \nthis was done for good intentions, no one had taken the broom behind \nand made sure the American people were protected.\n  Having just left a judiciary hearing this afternoon about NSA and \ndata collection and privacy and civil liberties, it was very timely \nthat I came over here. While this may not quite have the huge \nramifications of that hearing, I do think to myself that maybe if \npeople thought ahead a little bit, we wouldn't have been sitting in \nthat hearing. That is what we are trying to do with this bill. We are \ntrying to think ahead so we can keep up with the technology so it \ndoesn't beat us out and it doesn't beat our constitutional rights out.\n  I have seen firsthand the devastating effects automobile crashes can \nhave on families as they are forced to say goodbye to a loved one much \ntoo early. Oftentimes families just want answers. They want to know \nwhat happened and why. EDRs can help provide those answers. Our bill \naccounts for those needs of law enforcement and these families. You \ndon't have to take my word for it. The International Association of \nChiefs of Police has concluded that the Data Privacy Act will not cause \nany additional burden to law enforcement agencies in accessing the data \nthey need.\n  Advancements in technology oftentimes force us to take a look at \nrelated laws to ensure they remain in sync. Senator Hoeven and I are \nintroducing the Driver Privacy Act to do just that. Our bill strikes \nthat balance between strengthening consumer privacy protections while \nrecognizing that EDR data will be required to aid law enforcement, \nadvance vehicle safety objectives, or to determine the need for \nemergency medical response following a crash.\n  I thank Senator Hoeven for his leadership. He is a true bipartisan \nleader. We have worked together on many bills. When we work together, I \nalways say the Red River may technically divide our States, but it \nactually brings us together, whether it is about flood protection \nmeasures or important bills such as this. I appreciate the opportunity \nto work with him on this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I thank Senator Klobuchar for joining me \non this legislation and working to develop a great group of 14 original \ncosponsors.\n  Senator Klobuchar brings such a great background as a prosecutor in \nthe law enforcement industry and truly understands law enforcement \nissues, safety issues, and the informational benefits there are with \nnot only event data recorders, but also understands the need to protect \nindividual privacy.\n  As I think we both said very clearly here on the Senate floor, this \nis a technology that is new and evolving. It is not just that this is a \nnew and evolving technology where new capabilities are being added all \nthe time, we don't know what additional capabilities will be added.\n  But now the Federal Government is requiring that this device be in \nevery single automobile made. So when the Federal Government--the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation, NHTSA, the safety branch--steps up and \nsays: OK, we are going to require this device to be in every single \ncar, we need to make sure we are also providing the privacy that goes \nwith it that assures our citizens that their Fourth Amendment rights \nwill be protected.\n  Again, I think the Senator from Minnesota makes a really great point \nthat when we look at some of these areas in terms of whether it is NSA, \nIRS, or other areas, people feel there wasn't enough work done on the \nfront end to protect their personal privacy, so we are in a catchup \nsituation. Let's not do that when every single citizen across this \ncountry owns or their family owns or has access to some type of \nautomobile. That is what we are trying to do.\n  Again, as the technology develops we need to understand what the \nramifications are and how to protect privacy. I think, on behalf of \nboth of us, we are appreciative that we have 14 Senators engaged \nalready, and we look to add, and we are open to ideas on making sure \nthis is the right kind of legislation that addresses safety but \nultimately protects the privacy of our citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/14/senate-section/article/S329-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2649.
