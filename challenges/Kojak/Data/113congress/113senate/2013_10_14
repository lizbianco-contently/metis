Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for such \ntime as I may consume.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we now find ourselves, amazingly, in day \n14 of a government shutdown--a shutdown that was brought to us by the \nRepublicans in the House. They are sitting on a bill we sent them to \nopen the government and they refuse to take it up.\n  My colleague, the Senator from Connecticut, served over there and I \nserved over there, and we always had an opportunity to use the rules in \nsome way\n\n[[Page S7456]]\n\nto get a vote on a bill that was passed by the Senate. But the House, \nnot wanting to have such a vote, has made it pretty much impossible for \nour colleagues over there, Democrats and moderate Republicans, to \nactually vote to keep this government open.\n  I listened very carefully to Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader \nMcConnell, and I have hopes, as I expressed them yesterday, that we \nwill be able to reach an agreement both on the shutdown and on the debt \nceiling. But the fact we are struggling, the fact that people all over \nthe world are looking at us as if we are some kind of dysfunctional \ncountry, the fact that we have about 1 million Federal employees not \ngetting their checks, not knowing where the next meal is going to come \nfrom, the fact we have more than 2 million workers who work for \nprivate-sector contractors who don't know when or how they are going to \nget paid, is something we should all take note of, and we should listen \nto those who say this is ridiculous. This is self-inflicted.\n  You know, it reminds me of getting up and walking out of your house \non a beautiful day. You are walking down the street, and, yes, you have \na few problems on your mind--life isn't perfect--but you are pretty \noptimistic; things are pretty good. Suddenly, you pick up a stone from \nthe ground and bash yourself in the head. Honest to God, that is what \nthey have done, these Republicans. They have bashed in the heads of the \nAmerican public on a beautiful day as we are coming out of a recession, \nwhen we know we have our problems, but we also know we can solve them. \nIt doesn't make sense.\n  Then, as if that isn't enough, they have another stone in their hand \ncalled default. So maybe as you are beginning to see the light of day, \nyou hit yourself again and say to the world: America could actually \ndefault on its debts, and the full faith and credit of the United \nStates is in question.\n  Robert C. Byrd, one of the great Senators and historians, always \ntells us to read the Constitution. In my desk I have a couple of \ncopies, and every once in a while I will look at it. I am not quoting \nverbatim, but it says the debts of the United States shall not be \nquestioned. Nobody has the right to play with that. Yet we are doing it \nagain because the Republicans are angry. Why are they angry? I believe \nit is because they lost the Presidential election. I believe it is \nbecause they didn't take back the Senate. This is a direct quote from \nJohn Boehner. He said the American people don't want to shut down the \ngovernment, but they also don't want ObamaCare, the Affordable Care \nAct. That was his opinion. That is not the truth. The American people \ndon't want to see us shut down the government and threaten default \nbecause of a bill that passed almost 4 years ago, a bill that was \nupheld by the Supreme Court and a law that was heavily debated in the \nPresidential election. The person who said this--Mitt Romney: On day \none, I will repeal ObamaCare--lost the election.\n  I have been around here a while. I have served with five Presidents, \nthree of whom were Republicans. Lord knows I didn't agree with \neverything the Republican Presidents wanted, and I didn't even agree \nwith everything the Democratic Presidents wanted. I fought hard and I \ngot annoyed and I worked in elections. I never saw Republicans or \nDemocrats, until today, to be willing to default. Newt Gingrich did \nlead us to a government shutdown in the 1990s, but we haven't had one \nsince then because it was so painful and awful. I know the grownups are \nnow trying to resolve this. I know our leaders are going to the White \nHouse, and hopefully, they will come to an agreement. But the fact that \nit would take us this long, 3 days before a default and the 14th day of \na shutdown, is unbelievable.\n  A teacher knows the rules when they get a job. They know school \nstarts at 9 a.m., and they dismiss the kids at 3:00. If a teacher says, \nI don't like the start time and I am coming 2 hours later, they can't \nhave this job because they know they have to show up. The equivalent of \nthat is keeping the doors of government open to the people we \nrepresent, not slamming them shut in their face. That is what we have \nto do when we show up here; that is to keep the government going. Do we \nhave disagreements across and even within parties? Of course we do. But \nwe have a procedure to deal with that. It is called legislating. That \nis what we do when we have disagreements. It is something called \ndebate--debate the issues, battle them out, have a vote, and pass a \nbill. The other Chamber does the same. Then the House and the Senate go \nto a conference committee and argue out the differences. You send that \nbill to the President--whoever he or she may be--and the President \neither signs the bill or vetoes it. And if they sign it, it is a law. \nIf they veto it, we have an override. I have been involved in those. \nBut once the bill becomes a law, it is the law, and you carry it out. \nYou don't decide what laws you want to enforce and what laws you don't. \nThat is not the right way. Our founders said: We are a government of \nlaws, not men. Carry out the law. If you don't like the law, try to \nchange it.\n  Now, the Republicans didn't like the Affordable Care Act--which, by \nthe way, is signing up thousands of people a day as we stand here. In \nmy home State, it has signed up by now tens of thousands, and we have \nhad about 750,000 at least unique visitors to our site. In Kentucky, \nthey are signing up 1,000 a day. Unbelievable, never expected. This is \nthe law that caused the government shutdown. The Republicans stamp \ntheir feet. They didn't like it. They didn't care that there was an \nelection about it--none of that. They didn't like it, so they are going \nto shut down the government.\n  Now we don't even hear them talking about it. Now they are talking \nabout wanting to cut Medicaid and Social Security and Medicare. That is \nthe new thing they want to do. Paul Ryan: Let's just forget this one. I \nguess we can't do anything about it. But let's now cut Social Security, \nMedicare, and Medicaid. We have a process to get to conference with the \nHouse. On the Budget Committee we have a strong chairman, Patty Murray. \nShe has asked now 21 times to take our budget to conference. Ted Cruz \nand his friends have objected, and then they have the nerve to say we \nwon't negotiate. We want to negotiate in a conference committee. That \nis why there is a conference committee. They have stopped it.\n  The House has decided now. It is too late. We can't do anything about \nthe Affordable Care Act. Then why don't they open up the government? \nThey shut it down. They now admit they can't do anything about it. It \nhas a steady stream of funding, it is beginning to work, and people are \ngoing to think: Why do you want to take away the rights I have now, \nhaving a preexisting condition, to get health care? Why do you want to \nstop my child who can now stay on my health care until he is 26 and \ntake away benefits like free trips to the doctor to get immunizations \nand birth control and health care? They tried to stop women's health \ncare. They gave that up. They tried to stop us from getting cancer \nscreenings, and we said forget it. So they are all over the place.\n  I have lived long enough to know when I see people who are joyless, \nunhappy, and angry. That doesn't make for an optimistic country. They \nhave the privilege of being here, even if they are only controlling one \nbranch of the three, the House. It is the White House; the Senate, \nDemocrats; the House, Republicans. They have a privilege, and they have \na lot of leverage, but the way they are behaving is unacceptable. As I \nsaid, it is a self-inflicted wound.\n  I never questioned the fact that Republicans, Democrats, and \nIndependents love this country. I never question it. But I have to say, \nwhen you start acting like you are committing domestic abuse you have a \nproblem. I love you, dear, but I am shutting down your entire \ngovernment. I love you, dear, but I am going to default, and you are \ngoing to be weak. Something is dreadfully wrong.\n  I see my colleague from Maryland here. I know Maryland is suffering \nmightily from this shutdown. He and I both have a lot of Federal \nemployees, but the size of our States are different. As a percentage of \nthe workforce, Maryland and Virginia are really suffering. In \nCalifornia we have tens of thousands of workers furloughed, not getting \ntheir pay, and a lot of contractors.\n  I say to my friend from Maryland, I was trying to figure out how many \ncontractor employees are also impacted.\n\n[[Page S7457]]\n\nEven taking away military contractors, because some of them are getting \npaid and some of them aren't. If you take that all out of the equation, \nthere are still more than 2 million workers in the private sector who \nare working for Federal contractors.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article from \nthe Baltimore Sun.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, Oct. 14, 2013]\n\n        The Shutdown's Forgotten Victims: Government Contractors\n\n                         (By Clarissa Olivarez)\n\n       In a city where government contracts make up a multi-\n     billion dollar industry, it is surprising that with the \n     exception of a couple of articles that received moderate \n     attention, the mainstream media has largely ignored the \n     impact of the shutdown on federal contractors.\n       There has never been much sympathy for contractors. On \n     average, we make more money than federal workers because we \n     normally do not have the advantage of affordable health care \n     and/or other benefits offered by the federal government to \n     its direct employees. As a contractor, my colleagues and I \n     work 40 hours a week, and our company bills the government \n     for the services we each provide. On Oct. 1, however, the \n     federal government furloughed many of its employees, which \n     meant that funding for contracts under certain agencies was \n     halted. Once contractors are ordered to stop work by their \n     contracting officer, they must comply and wait patiently at \n     home while Congress and the White House try to find a \n     solution.\n       While defense contractors are mostly still in business, \n     since their services are considered ``essential,'' there are \n     thousands of others who were sent home without pay for an \n     indefinite period of time. As a technical writer and \n     communications specialist for a small company that supports a \n     non-defense agency, my fate was sealed long before early \n     media reports warned of many more impending furloughs.\n       When you are sent home from work for over a week, you begin \n     to notice certain things around you that could cause you to \n     lose heart. In my own neighborhood, I have noticed several \n     cars parked in their driveways--cars that never leave in the \n     mornings for work and never leave in the evening for a night \n     on the town. The Metro parking garages are empty. People's \n     morale is diminishing as cabin fever sets in on all sides. \n     And as rumors of the shutdown continuing until the 17th \n     spread like wildfire in a windstorm, my colleagues and I seem \n     to have exhausted every resource.\n       Many of my co-workers have emailed several government \n     websites only to find an automated reply shoot back at them \n     stating that the government was shut down and there was \n     nobody who could address their concerns. We have written \n     letters to congressmen and spoken with local news anchors, \n     but nothing is being done to help us in our time of need. As \n     contractors, we inhabit a different world, and unlike \n     furloughed federal employees, we will not be reimbursed for \n     the time off we have been forced to take.\n       Unfortunately, like everyone else, there are many of us who \n     owe student loans and are expected to pay rent. We have to \n     pay for utilities, credit card bills, dog food and any other \n     necessities like food and clothing. To make matters worse, my \n     husband and I had set aside money in our savings account for \n     a vacation later this month. That money is now going toward \n     bills and other unforeseen expenses.\n       What does all this mean? An article in the Washington Post \n     recently reported that the shutdown could amount to a loss of \n     $200 million a day for local businesses throughout the city. \n     Contractors provide as much of their income to local \n     businesses as their federal counterparts. If it is not enough \n     that we are suffering as a group, our non-existent income \n     will now begin to hurt certain sectors of the economy.\n       Small businesses within the city have been doing their part \n     to ease the financial burdens of furloughed employees by \n     advertising ``Shutdown Specials'' that would at least \n     partially allow for the small-business sector of the economy \n     to avoid an otherwise severe financial blow. But, with a \n     heavy concentration of federal and non-federal patrons, the \n     shutdown could cripple numerous mom-and-pop establishments as \n     workers save their hard-earned money and guard their savings \n     due to the uncertainty of a future paycheck.\n       Contractors, especially those contractors who work for \n     small businesses, have been hit hard by this shutdown, and it \n     is important that we do not go unheard. Representatives in \n     Congress need to realize that they have only solved half of \n     the problem by passing a bill to reimburse federal employees \n     for time spent at home. While the government will probably \n     not take ownership of the effects it has produced on \n     contractors, it is critical that they remember that we are an \n     essential part of the federal workforce and many of us are \n     weighed down by similar worries.\n\n  I am glad my friend is on the floor, because this was written today:\n\n       In a city where government contracts make up a multi-\n     billion dollar industry, it is surprising that with the \n     exception of a couple of articles that receive moderate \n     attention, the mainstream media has largely ignored the \n     impact of the shutdown on federal contractors.\n\n  I really wanted to bring this to the attention of my colleague. Would \nmy friend like me to yield to him?\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, let me say to my friend that she is \nabsolutely right. We have heard from a lot of contractors who employ \nindividuals, from large contractors such as Lockheed to smaller \ncompanies that employ 30, 40, 50 people. The range is around 20 to 25 \npercent of their workforce has been laid off. There is no assurance \nwhatsoever they will ever get paid. There are some contractors who \ndon't know whether they are going to survive; it is that serious. So \nthe private sector direct employment loss as a result of the shutdown \nis growing every day, and it is having an incredible impact throughout \nthe country in every State.\n  The Senator mentioned Maryland, which I have the honor of \nrepresenting along with Senator Mikulski. Ten percent of our workforce \nworks directly for the Federal Government. The overwhelming majority of \nthem have been put on furlough. We have estimated the number to be in \nexcess of 125,000 in our State of Maryland. Add the private contractors \nwho are laying off workers as a result of the shutdown.\n  Last week I stopped by a restaurant right off the Baltimore Beltway \nto get a sandwich. I know the owner. I asked him how things were going. \nHe said: Terrible. He said: About half of my customers are not here \nbecause they are Federal employees that would normally come in during \nthe workday and are not coming in.\n  The margins are very small for these businesses to be able to remain \nopen. So the direct impact on Federal workers and the direct impact on \nthose who have contract work with the Federal Government and the impact \non our economy--it is in every State of the country, but it is \nparticularly in the State I represent--has been devastating.\n  One more number. The Metro system depends upon the Federal workforce \nhere. They need a fare-box revenue in order to keep the system \noperating in a moderate way. Their ridership is down 23 percent. Their \nrevenues are down 23 percent. What is the Metro going to do?\n  The impact of this shutdown has had an incredibly damaging impact on \nour economy and on families. We have a lot of two-parent households \nworking for the Federal Government both on furlough. So many Federal \nworkers live paycheck to paycheck, and they are now recognizing there \nmight not be any paycheck. How are they supposed to pay their bills?\n  I spoke to one of my constituents in Maryland who works for a Federal \nagency. He and his wife have both been furloughed. They just recently \nbought a home and have a mortgage payment to make. The mortgage company \nisn't going to say: Sorry the government is shut down; don't pay your \nmortgage. He has to pay his mortgage. How is he going to be able to do \nthat?\n  We have hurt people. This shutdown, which should never have happened, \nhas had a huge impact on our economy. The tragedy is for the taxpayers. \nIt is a waste of money, with over $2 billion wasted as a result of this \nshutdown.\n  So I thank my colleague for allowing me to interject to underscore \nthe point she has made. She has been on the floor just about every day, \nand I admire her very much for what she has been saying because she is \nabsolutely right. The damage is clear. We never should have shut down \ngovernment. We should pay our bills. It is difficult to understand the \nRepublicans' original position that they want to negotiate the end of \nObamaCare on a bill that just keeps the lights on in government.\n  Now we are talking about paying our bills. They are talking again \nabout dealing with some policy issues. If we are going to get into that \ndiscussion--which we should not unless we turn the lights on--let's \nopen government and then turn the lights on and then sit down and \nnegotiate. That is what we have to do. We have some major issues we \nneed to deal with, including how we are going to grow the economy, \ncreate jobs, have a modern transportation infrastructure. As chair of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee, my colleague fought so hard \nfor a multiyear reauthorization of our surface transportation systems, \nfor modern roads, well-maintained--a modern transportation system.\n\n[[Page S7458]]\n\n  To Chairman Boxer, we have three major transit initiatives in \nMaryland that need to move forward. We have to have funding for that. \nThat is how our economy will grow.\n  Yes, I look forward to sitting down with my Republican colleagues to \nnegotiate a budget for next year but first open government and pay the \nbills.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I so appreciate my friend, through the Chair, \ninterjecting his thoughts. I have listened to him and to Senator \nMikulski throughout this ordeal. The Senator is right. I have been on \nthe floor quite a lot. The reason is clear. We need to make a record so \nthat this never, ever happens again.\n  There is a reason we had not had a shutdown since the last one when \nNewt Gingrich and Republicans brought it to us in the 1990s--because it \nwas horrible. They got hurt by it.\n  We begged them not to go down this road. They went down the road. \nWhy? Because they didn't like the fact that there is an Affordable Care \nAct. They didn't like it, so they stamped their foot and said: We are \nshutting down the government because we don't like it. We begged them. \nWe said: That is not going to help your cause. This Affordable Care \nAct--85 percent of the funds do not come from appropriated funds; they \ncome from a separate stream of funding, and the bill and the law are \ngoing forward. They would not listen. Now they have changed their tune \nand decided it is about cutting Social Security and Medicare and \nMedicaid. That is their new thing.\n  My friend is right. It would be so easy to end this. Open the \nGovernment, pay our bills, get to the budget negotiations, where we \nwill have Senator Murray, Senator Sessions, Paul Ryan, and his \ncounterpart begin regular order.\n  I want to continue about this contractor employee. What he said is so \nmoving--actually, I think it is a she.\n  She says:\n\n       As a technical writer and communications specialist for a \n     small company . . . my fate was sealed long before early \n     media reports warned of many more impending furloughs. When \n     you are sent home from work for over a week, you begin to \n     notice certain things around you that could cause you to lose \n     heart. In my own neighborhood--\n\n  I say to Senator Cardin, she is talking about your city of Baltimore.\n  This contractor writes:\n\n     in my own neighborhood, I have noticed several cars parked in \n     their driveways--cars that never leave in the morning for \n     work and never leave in the evening for a night on the town. \n     The Metro parking garages are empty.\n\n  The Senator alluded to that.\n\n       People's morale is diminishing as cabin fever sets in on \n     all sides. And as rumors of the shutdown continuing until the \n     17th spread like wildfire in a windstorm, my colleagues and I \n     seem to have exhausted every resource.\n\n  She says:\n\n       Unfortunately, like everyone else, there are many of us who \n     owe student loans and are expected to pay rent. We have to \n     pay for utilities, credit card bills, dog food and other \n     necessities like food and clothing. To make matters worse, my \n     husband and I--\n\n  And this is interesting--\n\n     had set aside money . . . for a vacation. . . . That money is \n     now going toward bills. . . . What does all this mean? An \n     article in The Washington Post recently reported that the \n     shutdown could amount to a loss of $200 million a day for \n     local businesses throughout the city.\n\n  Mr. President, $200 million a day for local businesses throughout \nyour city of Baltimore.\n  She says:\n\n       Contractors, especially those contractors who work for \n     small businesses, have been hit hard by this shutdown.\n\n  She explains how they may never be made whole.\n  Day 14 of a shutdown----\n  Mr. CARDIN. Could I ask my colleague to yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I thank the Chair, and I thank Senator Boxer. She points \nout the hardship of people not getting a paycheck. Senator Boxer points \nit out very clearly. Some of these people are the same people who were \njust furloughed as a result of sequestration, so they already had \nsmaller paychecks because of sequestration.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that sequestration was put in 2 years ago \nas a placeholder. I don't know of a single Senator who wanted to see \nsequestration take effect. It was a placeholder to get to a budget \nnegotiation. What did we do? We passed the budget. We passed the budget \nalmost 7 months ago. We said: Let's negotiate. We knew it was not going \nto be our budget. We know we have to negotiate with the House to get a \nbudget to get rid of sequestration.\n  I mention that because once again we have a very simple request \ntoday: Open the government and pay our bills. Sit down and negotiate. \nIt is pretty simple. We have not brought forward our policy objectives \nin this, which is to have a budget that makes sense for this country, \nthat allows growth of employment, invests not only in roads and bridges \nbut energy and research and education so we can build a competitive \neconomy for the 21st century. We want a budget that is balanced on how \nwe reduce spending--not just on what we call our discretionary spending \naccounts but also as we look at our entitlement spending. We want to \nsee our health care system more efficient. We want to work to make it a \nmore efficient system. We started that with passage of the Affordable \nCare Act. Now we want to implement that. That will bring about some \nadditional savings.\n  We believe we should pay our bills. We should have the necessary \nrevenue. Our revenue code is full of inequities that hemorrhage \nrevenue. My colleague from California is well aware of the fact that in \nour Tax Code--I serve on the Senate Finance Committee. I think my \ncolleagues understand that we are now spending more money in our Tax \nCode than we do in appropriations bills. We spend more money in the Tax \nCode. That is tax breaks some people get--not everyone. We certainly \ncan review those tax expenditures and close those that are inefficient, \nwhich will not only provide more equity in our Tax Code but will \nprovide more revenue to pay our bills and reduce our deficit.\n\n  It is that type of negotiation we want to get into, but we cannot do \nthat when the Republicans have put a gun to the head of the U.S. \neconomy. That is what they have done by shutting government and by \nthreatening not to pay the bills. We say very simply, put down the gun. \nLet's negotiate these issues.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely.\n  Mr. CARDIN. The Senator is absolutely right about the private \ncontractor issue. When you look at 800,000 Federal workers who have \nbeen furloughed, that does not include the private contractors, which \nare clearly going to be an additional hundreds of thousands who are not \nworking today, yes, it is a huge drain on our economy, and there is no \nreason for this.\n  For all those reasons, we say very clearly on day 14, day 14 of this \nshutdown, let's open the government, let's pay our bills, and, yes, \nlet's develop a sensible way to negotiate our budget. Let's not try to \nthreaten the American people and then try to pass an extreme agenda as \na result of that.\n  Through the Chair, I thank Senator Boxer.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Through the Chair, I thank my friend. This contractor \nissue is a sleeper issue in a way, as this woman writes in the \nBaltimore Sun, because if you look at the numbers, you may see more \ncontractor employees affected than Federal employees because even if \nyou take--there are millions of them. Even if you take away, if you \nlook at the statistics, the millions who work for the military and \nassume they are getting paid, there are still more than 2 million who \nare contractors to other arms of the government, such as homeland \nsecurity or border patrol--you name it. It is a sleeper issue.\n  This woman who is so articulate, Clarissa Olivarez--I hope she knows \nwe are taking her words to heart and putting her words in the Record. \nShe is explaining what it feels like to be scared. For what? For \nnothing. Because they did not like the Affordable Care Act--which they \nare not going to change. They tried to repeal it 43 times.\n  Open the government. They are so afraid they will lose the vote, they \nare not even allowing a vote over there.\n  They are coming back--my friends in the House--shortly. By the way, \nimagine, Speaker Boehner said go home over the weekend while all this \nis pending. They were not even in session. Outrageous.\n  I am going to conclude in about 5 minutes by talking about some of \nthe other impacts of the shutdown.\n\n[[Page S7459]]\n\n  Mr. President, 93 percent of the employees at the EPA have been \nfurloughed. What do they do? They make sure the air we breathe is safe, \nthe water we drink is safe, and the rivers we swim in are safe. They \nmake sure Superfund sites are being cleaned up, those toxic brews in \nthere, including things such as benzene and arsenic and every other bad \nthing you can imagine. In my State there is not one single EPA \ninspector on the ground. I have established that. That is the same in \nmany others. Mr. President, 505 Superfund sites were being cleaned up. \nCleanup is suspended. Many children live near those sites. There are \nmany schools near those sites. There are many homes near those sites. \nThey are toxic waste dumps. No cleanup.\n  Now we find out that 92 percent of workers at the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission have been furloughed. What is their job? It was created ``to \nensure the safe use of radioactive materials.''\n  I say to every Senator who has a nuclear powerplant in their State, \nmake a little prayer. If something bad happens, we will have to somehow \nnab all those workers and get them back on the job in time. Earth to my \nRepublican friends: Have you ever heard the word ``Fukushima''? Do you \nknow what I am talking about? Wake up. What are you doing to the \nAmerican people? You don't like a bill, so you shut down the \ngovernment. You take all of the watchdogs off the job so people could \nstart dumping waste into the waterways, into the air?\n  We even have a circumstance in California where pesticides are being \nimported from other countries. The EPA has to inspect those at the site \nand make sure they are safe. There are no inspectors. I just told you \nthat. So they are sitting in a warehouse, and our farmers are starting \nto say: Where are these pesticides? We need them.\n  This shutdown is mindless. The Army Corps of Engineers manages 12 \nmillion acres of public lands, recreation areas that host 370 million \nvisits annually. These recreation areas support local businesses such \nas resorts, marinas, outfitters, grocery stores, gas stations, hotels--\nshut down. Last week the Corps closed Lake Mendocino, which is located \nnorth of San Francisco. Lake Mendocino hosts half a million visitors \nannually and visitors spend $12 million at businesses within 30 miles \nof the lake, supporting 106 jobs and $2.8 million in income. Those \nsmall businesses cannot go on like this. They cannot go on like this.\n  Mr. President, 561 national wildlife refuges are closed because of \nthe shutdown. I say to my friend, Senator Cardin and I--we are very \nclose friends because we work together daily on these issues. He is the \nchairman of the committee that oversees water quality, these wildlife \nrefuges. In many parts of the country, hunting season is in full swing. \nI say to my friend from Oregon--I just found out, but he probably knows \nthis--that on the California-Oregon border, hunters and tourists \nusually head to Klamath Basin National Wildlife Refuge for the opening \nof hunting season. But they have been denied access, which means local \nbusinesses are losing much needed revenues. The impact of this is felt \nwith a direct hit to Federal employees, contractor employees, and local \nbusinesses. Everyone is suffering. That is why we had a letter that I \nput in the Record yesterday, or the day before, signed by the Chamber \nof Commerce, the AFL-CIO, and the nonprofit sector. It is so rare, I \nsay to my friends, that we see those three groups coming together.\n\n  They are demanding that we open the government. They are demanding a \nclean debt ceiling so we can pay our bills. They are demanding it, and \nthey represent the broadest base sector of America.\n  Who is benefiting from this other than people who have a very dark \nside? That is all I can say. You would have to have a really dark side.\n  I will give a couple of examples of what is happening. The NTSB, the \nNational Transportation Safety Board--we had a horrible crash in July \nwith Asiana Airlines, flight 214. We don't know exactly why it \nhappened, and the NTSB has been forced to postpone their hearings. \nThese investigations help us to find out how to avoid disasters in the \nfuture.\n  Three weeks ago in Santa Monica, at a little airport, there was a \ncrash that killed four people. Investigation materials were shoved into \na vault, and we don't know why it happened. If we knew why it happened, \nwe could save lives.\n  I remember when I first came to Congress a very long time ago, and I \nserved in the House, there was a terrible crash. They found out it was \na very small bolt or a screw that was responsible for the problems, and \nthey grounded every aircraft that had that faulty part and fixed it. \nThat is why these investigations are critical. These investigations are \ncritical so we are able to not only tell the loved ones what happened \nbut to make improvements. It is all shut down.\n  Another example has to do with the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission. Last week in San Diego a 2-year-old Annette Estrada was \nkilled when she was crushed by a falling TV. Normally the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission investigates this heartbreaking incident, \nfind out the problem, and demand it be fixed. Who knows who the next \nchild will be. That is why we have a government--a government of, by, \nand for the people--to make life better for the American people.\n  The government is shut down. Open it. Let the people in. It is easy \nto do. Speaker Boehner has a bill. Let them vote over there. Open the \ngovernment now. People are in danger. There are no winners in a \nshutdown. It is devastating for workers. It is devastating for small \nbusinesses. It is devastating for contractors. It is devastating to our \neconomy, which is just coming out of the worst recession since the \nGreat Depression. What are they thinking over there?\n  Then they send these little mini-bills. Oh, open this little agency, \nand open that little agency. I call that government by press release. \nThe heat is on them, so they pass a little mini-bill. Since when does \none political party decide which of our communities survive, which ones \nthrive, which ones die, which people live, which people die, which \nchild is healthy, and which child is not healthy?\n  There is a community in California where kids are suffering \nnosebleeds, and they are sick. It turns out that they are very close to \nan industrial site. I called the EPA. They were going to rush over \nthere and figure it out and stop the pain. They can't go. I don't see a \nbill over there to open the EPA. They will never send us that.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Through the Chair, I just have to say to my colleague \nthat she is absolutely right. She is the chairman of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee Agency. She has given great examples that \nshow how critically important the Environmental Protection Agency is in \nprotecting public health and protecting our environment. The Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission is important to protect the public safety.\n  The Senator from California is absolutely right. I want to give \nanother dynamic, and that is jobs. The fact that the EPA is not in full \nforce is hurting economic growth. I will give one example: Harbor Point \nin downtown Baltimore, which is an RCRA site, which means it was an \nenvironmental cleanup site that has a court order on its development \nrequiring the EPA to sign off to make sure the environmental issues are \nbeing protected in its development.\n  Everything is fairly well understood here, and it has gone through a \nlong process. We are now at the point where we are ready to develop \nthis prime spot. It is the most iconic spot in downtown Baltimore. It \nis going to help our city grow. Our city needs economic growth. It is \non hold. Why? Because the EPA does not have its people in the office to \nbe able to review this application in a timely way. That is just one \nexample. The Environmental Protection Agency is critically important \nfor public health. It is critically important for our environment and \nalso for economic growth.\n  I will give another example: The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade \nBureau is not at full complement either. We have microbreweries in \nMaryland that are doing very well. Every time they add a new product, \nthey have to get approval from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade \nBureau. That is on hold. Their economic growth is on hold.\n  I could give many more examples. Senator Boxer mentioned our refuges.\n\n[[Page S7460]]\n\nThe Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge is located on the Eastern Shore \nof Maryland. It is one of the most beautiful spots in the world. This \nis hunting season. The Eastern Shore of Maryland depends upon the \nhunting season for its economy.\n  I can't tell you how many hotel operators, restaurants, and \nshopowners depend upon the fall season being in full force with the \nhunting season, and now we put a real damper--not just the weather we \nhad over the past weekend--but the fact that the government was closed \nhas put a damper on the economy. Actually, it was good weather for \nhunting. They lost that. They are not going to be able to recover that. \nIt is lost.\n  As my friend pointed out, our request is pretty simple. Our request \nis to open the government, pay our bills, and let's sit down and \nnegotiate. The point I hope everyone understands: The funding level we \nsent over to the House of Representatives is the Republican funding \nlevel. We didn't negotiate that number. That is the current fiscal year \n2013 number. We didn't negotiate between that number and our budget \nnumber that this body passed. We gave up on that and said: Look, it is \nmore important to keep the government open. We have already negotiated.\n  Bear with me for one more minute. Senator Boxer has given the \nBaltimore Sun a lot of credit today, and I would like to quote from \ntheir editorial because I think it is important to point out.\n\n       Passing a ``clean'' continuing resolution keeping \n     government fully operating at funding levels the GOP has \n     already endorsed is no compromise. It's the status quo. \n     Raising the debt ceiling isn't a concession either--it allows \n     the nation to pay the bills Congress has already incurred and \n     prevents the possibility of a government default, which would \n     hurt the economy, raise borrowing costs and increase the \n     federal deficit.\n       So when Speaker Boehner lashes out at President Obama for \n     failing to negotiate, one has to ask, what is this thing he \n     describes as negotiation? House Republicans are not merely \n     leveraging their political position--as some dryly claim--\n     they are threatening to do grievous harm to the global \n     economy and the American public.\n       The gun isn't raised to President Obama's head or to the \n     Senate. The Democrats have no particular stake in passing a \n     continuing resolution or in raising the debt ceiling other \n     than keeping public order and doing what any reasonable \n     person expects Congress to do. No, the gun is raised at the \n     nation as a whole. That's why descriptions like ``ransom'' \n     and ``hostage'' are not mere hyperbole, they are as close as \n     the English language gets to accurately describing the GOP \n     strategy.\n\n  I hope we are close to reaching an agreement to open the government. \nIt should never have been closed. A lot of damage and harm has already \nbeen done.\n  We are on a motion to proceed to the debt ceiling. If we were not to \npay our bills, that would cause irreparable harm not just to our \neconomy, but to the world economy. That is something we should not be \nplaying around with waiting until the last public minute.\n  I urge my colleagues to put the interest of this country first. This \nis a serious matter that affects our economy, America's future, and the \nglobal economy. If we turn the global economy into further economic \ndisorder, it is going to have a major impact on the United States, and \nit will be our fault.\n  I urge my colleagues to immediately cease this strategy of \nthreatening our economy. Let's open the government, pay our bills, and \nsit down and negotiate, as we should, a budget agreement which will not \nbe what the Democrats want or the Republicans want, but it will be a \ncompromise, as it should be, between the parties. We owe that to the \nAmerican people.\n  Through the Chair, I thank Senator Boxer again for underscoring these \npoints and pointing out the wide impact this has on all parts of our \ncountry. We have to end it. I hope we can end it tonight.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for allowing this \ninterlude. I do want to say to my friend, I think it has been very \nhelpful that he and I have been in this conversation because we share \nthe view that these two self-inflicted wounds are outrageous, and we \nwant to make sure that the Congressional Record is very clear and shows \nthe pain, the suffering, the concern, and the insecurities that this \ndual wound, the potential of a default and an actual government \nshutdown, are causing. I pray that we are never facing this again.\n  I am very mindful of the words I use here on the floor so I am not \ngoing to say what I think about this exactly the way I would say it if \nI were talking to my family. There is no reason for it. It makes no \nsense to do this to a country they say they love. Why hurt the country \nthey say they love?\n  Why make the country they say they love look like a laughingstock? \nWhy make a President who was going to go to Asia to pitch our economy \nand investments in our Nation--why make him cancel a trip and have \nChina stand there and say: Well, you can see America just doesn't have \nit together. If they loved their country, they wouldn't do that.\n  Some of the comments over there are unbelievable. One of the \nRepublican House Members said: I have never seen us so happy. She is \nhappy? She is happy that millions of people don't know where their next \ncheck is coming from? She is happy? She is happy that plane crashes \ncan't be investigated? She is happy that Superfund sites can't be \ncleaned? She is happy that veterans are scared? She is happy that 65-\nyear-olds and 62-year-olds who are new to Social Security can't get \ntheir checks on time? She is happy? She needs to look into her heart. \nThat whole party has to look into its heart. Every once in a while you \ncan see into someone's soul, and you know it when it has happened to \nyou.\n  I got into a conversation with one colleague, who shall remain \nnameless. I was so excited. I came home from California, and I saw tens \nof thousands of my people who were signing up for health insurance that \nnever had it before. I could tell so many beautiful stories. There were \npeople with preexisting conditions, people who had lifetime caps, \npeople who were scared, and little kids whose parents finally were able \nto save their lives.\n  There was one incredible woman who wrote an op-ed piece in the \nWashington Post about this. And you know what my colleague, who shall \nremain nameless, said? I told him I went to a signup place, and it was \nexciting. There were so many people who were signing up. We were at a \nHispanic community, and everybody had a smile on their face. He said: I \nwas happy to read in one of your papers that two people had their \npremiums doubled. I stopped and said: You were happy? That made you \nhappy? Look into your soul.\n  Why are people happy over there? How do they say they love their \ncountry, but they don't care if their country defaults on its \nobligations?\n  I want to show my colleagues what President Ronald Reagan said about \ndefaulting--not paying our bills--President Ronald Reagan, the beloved \nPresident of the Republicans, and many Democrats. He came from my \nState. He is one of the most popular Presidents in the history of our \ncountry. We have airports named after him. We have buildings named \nafter him. Why don't we see what President Reagan said about default? \nAnd just know, when he was President, Republicans and Democrats raised \nthe debt ceiling no less than 18 times, I say to my colleagues. \nEighteen times we raised the debt ceiling because, yes, we had debt \nfrom prior bills and Ronald Reagan said, Send me a debt ceiling \nincrease. Here is what he says:\n\n       The full consequences of a default--or even the serious \n     prospect of a default--by the United States are impossible to \n     predict and awesome to contemplate. Denigration of the full \n     faith and credit of the United States would have substantial \n     effects on the domestic financial markets and the value of \n     the dollar.\n\n  Ronald Reagan, 1983. That is when our economy was much smaller than \nit is today.\n  So how does the party of Ronald Reagan now get us to this place where \nin 3 days we are about to default? I didn't hear one word out of them \nwhen they decided to put two wars on the credit card and a huge tax \nbreak for billionaires on the credit card and a big medical \nprescription drug benefit on the credit card--not one word out of them. \nOh, vote, vote, vote, vote, vote.\n  What happened? We had a surplus under Bill Clinton. We had a huge \nincrease in the deficits under George W. Bush. And, by the way, \nPresident Obama got handed an enormous deficit which he has cut in \nhalf.\n  So all of this talk about how the Republicans are the party of fiscal \nresponsibility bears scrutiny. There\n\n[[Page S7461]]\n\nwasn't one Republican who voted for the budget, I say to my colleagues, \nthat Bill Clinton wanted us to vote for. We did it all with Democratic \nvotes. Then we got not only a balanced budget, but a surplus, and tens \nof millions of new jobs. George Bush came in, put two wars on the \ncredit card, prescription drug benefit on the credit card, tax breaks \nto billionaires on the credit card, and the debt was off and running. \nBut not one Republican said: Don't pass a debt ceiling. Not one \nRepublican said: Don't default. What changed? Could it be they don't \nlike this President? Do my colleagues think that has something to do \nwith it? I will let people decide that.\n  We now know what Ronald Reagan said. He said, in other words, we need \nto pay our bills. We need to avoid default. There isn't one respected \neconomist who doesn't agree with what Ronald Reagan said in 1983. The \ncost to taxpayers of default is enormous--billions upon billions of \ndollars--even the thought of it. We are still paying off what it cost \nus the last time.\n  Experts warn us against default. Warren Buffett: ``It ought to be \nbanned as a weapon.'' It, meaning a default, ought to be banned as a \nweapon. ``It should be like nuclear bombs, basically too horrible to \nuse.''\n  Warren Buffett knows a thing or two about this economy.\n  Mark Zandi, who advised John McCain in his Presidential run: \n``Breaching the limit would be an economic disaster.''\n  What would happen to average folks? Mortgage rates could go sky high. \nSmall business, big business couldn't expand. We would go into a \nrecession. And they are happy over there about the prospect. They need \nto look into their souls.\n  The president of the World Bank, Jim Kim: ``Please consider politics \nbeyond the Beltway, politics beyond your districts . . . This is not a \ntheoretical impact. It's very real.''\n  Again, Mark Zandi: ``The dark scenario is so dark I can't imagine \nit.'' That is what he said.\n  So we pray now, as our leadership goes to the White House--and they \nare probably there right now meeting with the President--that they come \nout of that meeting with a plan--a plan to pay our bills, a plan to \nreopen government, and a plan to negotiate on anything Republicans and \nDemocrats want to negotiate on. I pray so that this works out. But \nuntil it does, I am going to be here every day making the record for \nfuture Senators and for the history books that shutting down the \ngovernment and threatening default, those kinds of weapons should be \nbanned.\n  It is our job to pay the bills. It is our job to keep the government \nopen, just as it is a pilot's job to fly the plane. He has to show up \nand fly it. We have to show up, pay the bills, keep the government \nopen, and then negotiate our differences.\n  Thank you so much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, once again I wish to thank Senator Boxer \nfor her comments and for her strength in coming to the floor and \npointing out the danger and harm caused by the government shutdown and \nthe risk of defaulting on our debt.\n  Let me make it clear: Open government. Keep it open at the level the \nRepublicans had in their budget as we continue to negotiate. We want to \nnegotiate a budget for fiscal year 2014. We want that budget to be \nfair. We have been trying to do that for 7 months. We are not going to \nnegotiate a budget in the next 48 hours. It is going to take more time \nthan that.\n  We need to extend the ability to pay our bills. That should be done \nfor a long time--for a longer period of time--because of the \npredictability here. We don't want to go from crisis to crisis. There \nshould be no concessions for either one of those two issues; that is, \nopening government or paying our bills.\n  Let's work back and forth, Democrats and Republicans, on a budget in \nwhich there will be give and take. That is what we are encouraging our \ncolleagues to do.\n  I join Senator Boxer in hoping there is a productive meeting at the \nWhite House today. I hope we find a game plan that will allow us to \nopen government and pay our bills in a way in which we can sit down and \nnegotiate the fiscal year 2014 budget, respecting each other's views \nand doing what our political system always envisioned; that is, true \ncompromise, particularly when we have a House of Representatives \ncontrolled by Republicans and a Senate controlled by Democrats.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise to continue the series of comments \nmy colleagues have been making about the situation we find ourselves in \nat this moment, with our government shut down and with the possibility \nof a default on the payments of our Federal Government. This situation \nis virtually unprecedented, to be in a situation of near default.\n  I want to step back from the immediate arguments over what the answer \nlooks like to understand that we have wandered far outside the normal, \norderly lines of legislative debate. Legislative debate is like a \nbaseball game. Folks come together, and some want plan A, some want to \noppose plan A, and one team wins and one team loses. In this case, we \ncan go back to the health care debate. Some folks wanted a health care \nplan that would put millions of folks without insurance into insurance \nand have a number of systematic reforms that would help Americans and \nto end abuses in the insurance industry. They wanted to create \ncompetition between companies so that customers; that is, citizens, \ncould compare policies and thereby get a better deal, and encourage \ncompanies to drop their prices.\n  This debate now goes back quite a while, to 2009, 2010. The side that \nwanted the improved health care won. The other side normally says, \nWell, we will be back next year. We will be back with some changes in \nteam members, as in baseball, and we will debate this again.\n  Instead of calling to have another legislative debate down the line, \nthose who lost asked for the umpire to declare that the losing team had \nwon. This is acceptable; that is, turning to our Supreme Court and \nasking them if we had violated any of the constitutional provisions \nthat guide our Nation. In this case the answer came back, and the \nanswer was, no, the health care plan was constitutional and it would go \nforward.\n  So now the losing team, instead of saying we are going to debate this \nwith the public, we are going to try to get our point of view across \nand get people elected who support it, said, We are going to hold the \ncrowd hostage and threaten to burn down the stadium. If a person is \nattending a baseball game, we know that is outside the normal rules of \ncompetition. We create these rules in a democracy so we can have an \norderly process by which to consider the viewpoints of our constituents \nand make decisions, but threatening to hold the American people hostage \nis outside of the rules. Threatening to have our national government \ndefault and burn down our economy is outside the rules. Yet that is \nwhere we stand today.\n  Great harm, even as I speak, is coming to our communities across the \nNation. This harm may not touch some of the Members of this body who \nmay have the financial foundation to not be particularly concerned \nabout what happens to others. But I would encourage them to go live a \nfew days in a working-class community and find out how this impacts \nfamilies across our Nation. Not only are those families who work for \nthe government not getting their salaries as well as being furloughed, \nbut they are not then spending their funds in the local community, \nwhich creates an impact on all kinds of other groups. It isn't just in \nthat direct employment. We have a situation with, say, those who are \naffected by food stamps. If the first day of the month comes and food \nstamps are not available, they don't go to the stores and buy \ngroceries, so the stores are affected. The list goes on and on in all \nkinds of ways.\n  In fact, I can turn to my home State of Oregon to demonstrate some \nthings known to me that maybe folks haven't considered. I have here a \nletter from the Port of Astoria. The Port of Astoria, in order for them \nto receive oceangoing ships, has to have its slips dredged to a certain \ndepth; otherwise,\n\n[[Page S7462]]\n\nthose ships can't dock. This letter basically is about how the \ngovernment shutdown is affecting their ability to dredge and how the \ninability to dredge may have a profound economic consequence on the \ncommunity.\n  The port writes, ``Every year the Port of Astoria is required to \ndredge to maintain operations.''\n  They have done that in various ways for the last 23 years. The letter \ngoes on through all kinds of details of the process through which \ndredging occurs. On the third page, it gets down to this: ``Our biggest \nissue at this stage is the government shutdown has prevented our \nconsultation with the National Marine Fisheries Service. . . . \n'' Without that consultation, they cannot satisfy the ESA requirements \nof section 7 of the Clean Water Act.\n\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       This is the only element that is holding us up. . . .\n\n  You may think: Well, if they do not dredge on time, what is the big \ndeal? To Astoria it is a very big deal. I continue with the letter:\n\n       If we are not able to dredge soon, this Port and this \n     community could suffer immense economic damages to the tune \n     of 5-6 million dollars of direct economic funds per vessel \n     that fails to dock at the Port of Astoria or 10-12 million \n     dollars of direct economic impact per month.\n\n  That is based on the fact that there are a couple major vessels per \nmonth.\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       Furthermore, if one vessel strikes the bottom [of the \n     river] the industry and our investors, clients and tenants \n     will be in an uproar and our entire business will be \n     blacklisted on the international trade market.\n\n  That would be terrible, to have a ship hit the bottom and have the \nPort of Astoria completely shut down as a result of the fact that they \ncannot consult--as they point out, that part of this is their ability \nto consult with the National Marine Fisheries Service.\n  That is just one sizable impact for a community. There are thousands \nof these occurring across the country.\n  Let me take another example. We have a company in Oregon that \nproduces a particular device that it exports, and it needs an export \nlicense to do so; otherwise, it cannot send its items abroad to its \ncustomer. Right now it has a big stockpile of a shipment it needs to \nsend out.\n  Well, they cannot get the export license because the government is \nshut down. This is creating a big cashflow issue because they cannot \nreceive the funds until they ship the item, which means huge potential \ndamage to the company--in other words, something that may not have been \nthoroughly thought through.\n  What about the rural areas in our States? Some will be surprised to \nfind out that you have a lot more government workers per capita in \nrural areas than in urban areas. Many parts of my State are forested, \nand the forests are owned either by the Bureau of Land Management or \nthe U.S. Forest Service--it is owned by the national government, in \nother words. If the folks are not there because the government is shut \ndown, it has a direct impact. In fact, right now, the U.S. Forest \nService is issuing directions on how folks who are in the middle of \nlogging have to shut down, skid the logs they have cut, quit felling \nany more, and basically clean up and clear out--in the middle of an \noperation. That does not just mean losses for the company that is \nlogging, it also means a loss of saw logs for the sawmill, which means \nlayoffs or a shutdown at the sawmill.\n  Well, you can start to see how the consequences roll through the \neconomy.\n  How about the superfund site in the Portland Harbor? There is an \nintense effort going on to get a plan to be able to clean up that \nsuperfund site. Negotiations are underway between the industries that \npopulate that stretch and the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  Well, it is very important to move forward to meet deadlines. How are \nyou going to move forward if the folks are not at the EPA?\n  If we go back to a timber company, it is not just the immediate \nimpact, it is the impact a year out, because the folks who are planning \nthe sales for a year out cannot plan those sales if they are shut down \nor if they are furloughed. They cannot plan those sales. And they have \nto have teams of biologists and folks evaluate every aspect of every \nsale to prepare it, put it up for auction. If you cannot put it up for \nauction, somebody does not buy it, there is no cutting, and then the \nlogging companies and the mills are hurt.\n  This is not acceptable. What we have is a series of fiscal \nirresponsibilities by the group within the Senate and the House that \nhas been blocking the budget and appropriations process. Fiscally \nirresponsible--let me lay that out. It is fiscally irresponsible to \nblock the Budget Committee for the last 6 months from having a \nconference committee. Yet a small group has come to this floor and \nrepeatedly objected to the conference committee meeting. Without that \nbudget, you cannot have common numbers for the Senate and the House. \nThat blocks the spending bills--known here as appropriations bills--so \nthe spending bills cannot be put together. Or if they are put together, \nthey are based on a different number than the House has, which means \nthose become deadlocked.\n  That leads to a continuing resolution, which means continuing what we \nare already doing rather than having a new spending bill. That is a \nwaste of money because it means we are going to keep doing things that \nwe know are not working instead of doing the things we know are working \nbetter. That is why you have an annual appropriations or spending \nprocess so you can cast aside the things that are not working and do \nthe things that are working. So it is wasteful to block the budget and \nappropriations process.\n  Then we have this government shutdown. What does this mean? This \nmeans less income because of less economic activity, and it means more \nexpenses because of more safety net responsibilities, which means more \ndeficit and more debt. So this group that is blocking the budget and \nappropriations process is responsible for increasing the deficit and \nincreasing our debt.\n  Then let's fast forward to the threat of not paying our bills. I \nthink everyone in America knows, as a family, if you do not pay your \nbills, your credit score goes down and you have to pay a higher \ninterest rate when you borrow. It is the same with the Federal \nGovernment.\n  There are some in this body who have said: Well, let's make sure we \npay our Treasury bonds, make good on our debt obligations, and let's \njust not pay other obligations. Anyone who has had a credit score knows \nthat no matter what obligation you fail in, it becomes part of your \ncredit score. It raises the interest. You can go for your home loan and \nsay: I have always made my house payment, and they are like: Yes, but \nyou did not pay your utility bill, you did not pay your car payment. \nThat means you are a higher risk. You say: But I have always paid my \nhouse bill, always paid my mortgage. It does not matter. It shows that \nyou are stressed and you do not have a consistent exercise of \nresponsibility in paying your bills.\n  So there is no easy out, despite that my colleagues have come to this \nfloor, this Chamber, and said: It is not a big deal. They are, simply \nput, wrong. If they had come to the Committee on Banking, they could \nhave heard expert after expert after expert say, essentially: You are \nwrong. All your bills matter. All your bills affect your credit rating. \nWhen your credit rating goes down, your interest rates go up.\n\n  It is very expensive for the government, and it is wasted money, \nmoney that is buying us nothing--nothing. It is just paying more for \nthe borrowing you have to do.\n  It is not just government that pays. It is the families who pay. They \nhave to pay higher interest on their mortgage, a higher payment on \ntheir home loan, if you will, their home equity loan, a higher payment \non their car loan, a higher payment on their business loan. Everyone \nwastes money because of this group of incredibly irresponsible, \nfiscally irresponsible Members of the House and Senate who have brought \nus to this point.\n  I can see my colleague has come to the floor, and I am sure he has \nstories from his State, and he has his insights on why this is an \nunacceptable, irresponsible place we find ourselves. All we really \nneed--all we need is a short-term continuing resolution at this point \nto reopen government while we negotiate, and we should have a long-term \nresolution of the default issue because that is something that should \nnever be threatened.\n\n[[Page S7463]]\n\n  It is Ronald Reagan who said: Do not mess with the good faith and \ncredit of the United States of America. It is time everyone on both \nsides of the aisle listens to what President Reagan said, because he \nwas right on on this, that that is just a shoot-yourself-in-the foot, \nself-inflicted wound that does no one in America any good at all.\n  Let's return to the normal process of understanding there are bounds \non the legislative debate. If you lose with your perspective in a \nlegislative battle, you can come back again next time around. You can \ncome back the next year, you can come back 2 years later, you can come \nback 3 months later if the votes shift. You can propose amendments. But \nyou do not--you do not--hold the crowd hostage. You do not threaten to \nburn down the stadium. You do not hold the American people hostage. And \nyou do not threaten to burn down our economy and our international \nstanding by proposing that we not pay our bills.\n  Thank you very much.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oregon for \nspeaking so forcefully and ably about the real-life stories in his \nState--stories of people affected very directly by the shutdown and the \nprospect of the greatest Nation in the history of the world failing to \npay its bills on time. As powerfully as he spoke, so did our colleagues \nfrom California and Maryland, emphasizing again the evidence of how \ndeep and broad the cumulative effect is of the shutdown.\n  I had occasion to speak to people across Connecticut, as I know my \ncolleague, the Acting President pro tempore, has done over the past 10 \ndays. He and I have talked about how Connecticut is affected and about \nthe individuals there who have borne the burden of this shutdown. As in \nOregon and California and Maryland, there are real-life stories of \npeople who have been affected not just temporarily but lastingly and \nenduringly.\n  I had occasion over the last 48 or 24 hours to talk with many of them \nout of the glare of the public eye--privately, candidly--and I want to \ntell some of their stories today, beginning with a meeting I had this \nmorning in East Hartford at VFW Post 2083, at the invitation of my good \nfriend CDR John Hollis of the Veterans of Foreign Wars and a group he \nhelped to invite--veterans of conflicts ranging from Korea, to Iraq, to \nVietnam, to Afghanistan--all ages, all races, religions--more than 20 \nof those veterans telling me their stories and imparting to me their \nmessage: Get the job done. Reach a bipartisan compromise and make sure \nthe government opens and end the shutdown and pays its bills on time, \nas befits the United States of America, for which they fought, the \nNation they served and sacrificed to keep free.\n  I was drawn by young men such as Micah Welintukonis, Jordan Massa, \nMichael Scavetta, David Alexander, veterans of the most recent conflict \nin Afghanistan; and John Hollis, Ed Dettore, Lester Yarmiel, Richard \nKennedy, Mel Huston, Lucius Miles, who have fought in previous wars.\n  As a matter of fact, Micah Welintukonis has recently returned from \nWalter Reed, where he had to undergo the latest round of surgery to his \narm, which was severely wounded in Afghanistan in combat there. That \nwound led him to receive the Purple Heart. He was there with his wife \nCamilla and his three children to talk to me about his fear that he \nwill be denied benefits and compensation that he is due, he deserves, \nand needs--the disability claim that he may apply for.\n  Of course, Jordan Massa is also a Purple Heart recipient as a result \nof a wound that he likewise received in combat. He waited for 2 years \nto receive approval of his disability claim, only to learn on October 1 \nthat he will very likely have to wait longer because of the VA \nfurloughing so many of its employees.\n  Others who came to this meeting: Mike Scavetta from Wethersfield--a \nveteran who served in an Air Force military police unit deployed to \nAfghanistan, who needs the GI bill, which he credits as reconnecting \nhim to a civil society after his return. He has applied for a higher \ndisability rating with the Department of Veterans Affairs based on his \ncontinued experience of post-traumatic stress.\n  Jake Demaskiewicz in Rocky Hill, who has served not only in the Army \nin Operation Enduring Freedom, but on his return now in a nonprofit \norganization, is assisting other veterans. Thirty percent of his \npaycheck comes from the VA's vocational rehabilitation program, and he \nreceives disability payments.\n  These payments, compensation claims will run out at the end of \nOctober, and the delays are present even now, discouraging and failing \nthese brave combat veterans who have endured so much for our Nation--\nthe Nation that now has shut down these services because of a small \nfringe of extremist ideologues in one House of this Congress, one \nbranch of this government, who have succeeded in paralyzing the \nprocess.\n  There are many other impacts on veterans in the denial of programs \nthat are so important, many of which I have mentioned on the floor, \nsuch as the Education Call Center, personal interviews at regional \noffices, education and vocational counseling, outreach programs, \nincluding at military facilities and VetSuccess on Campus.\n  These programs and benefits and claims cannot be sustained by a \npiecemeal allocation of money. The claims need to be verified by going \nto other agencies such as the IRS. The labor training programs need to \nbe provided by the Department of Labor. Opening one agency is no \nsubstitute for a comprehensive approach to serve these veterans and the \npeople of the United States, whether it is Head Start children who \ndepend on that program, or seniors who depend on nutritional services.\n  Over these past 2 weeks, I have spoken to home buyers whose loans \ncannot be processed by government agencies or by banks, business owners \nwhose borrowing cannot be approved, potential victims of health threats \nwho cannot be protected by the FDA or the CDC. There are researchers at \nthe NIH and at places such as Yale who cannot continue their vital work \nto learn of new treatments, of advances in medicine that can help save \npeople's lives and prevent suffering, and medical school applicants and \nPh.D. candidates whose financial aid is in jeopardy and who cannot \neven, many of them, travel with government support to interview for \ntheir next possible assignment and study.\n  These ramifications are not limited to veterans. They affect our \neconomy at its core. I warned about the effect on job growth and \neconomic recovery and now it is visible, literally visible in the \nbusinesses and offices and places of employ throughout Connecticut.\n  Just yesterday in the Connecticut Post there was this story. The \npicture is of Robin Imbrogno. This picture of Robin Imbrogno from the \nConnecticut Post in yesterday's newspaper is of her at a meeting with \nher staff, preparing for their work. Their office in Seymour, CT, \nprovides human resource services for businesses from California to \nMaine, across the country, to more than 150 business clients.\n  It begins:\n\n       Robin Imbrogno pulled her staff together after work on \n     Thursday for an update. How, she asked, has the federal \n     government's partial shutdown impacted business at her \n     company, the Human Resources Consulting Group. ``Even more \n     ways than I'd thought,'' she said moments later.\n\n  I am going to quote the article.\n\n       At the company's office in downtown Seymour, the staff of \n     about 30 was having trouble carrying out a host of tasks for \n     their more than 150 clients located from California to Maine: \n     For one, they can't access [the central source of information \n     in the government.] For another, they can't finish background \n     checks or file equal employment opportunity reports. Most \n     vexingly, perhaps, they got more phone calls than ever on \n     Monday complaining that paychecks hadn't arrived in people's \n     mailboxes across America--even though the U.S. Postal Service \n     is supposed to be fully staffed.\n\n  Their report is about new businesses that cannot open, retail \nbusinesses that cannot go into business because they cannot ``procure \nthe necessary business license.''\n  As Robin said, ``It wasn't a fun phone call.''\n  There is evidence of this effect on employment in businesses across \nthis country, across the State of Connecticut. This relatively modest-\nsize business in Seymore, CT, the Human Resources Consulting Group, \nfounded and headed by Robin Imbrogno, is just one of many across the \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S7464]]\n\n  Her reports about the effects on jobs--we are talking jobs--is a \nwake-up call for this body. It is a wake-up call for not only the \nCongress but for everyone in positions of leadership, because this \neffect will be enduring.\n  In the same article from the Connecticut Post, it talks about the SBA \nnot providing loans to small businesses: $150,000 worth of loans every \nday in one Congressional district in Connecticut alone. Eight companies \nslated to get SBA-backed loans from a private nonprofit organization \nwill not receive them because of this shutdown.\n  There are other individuals. I cannot share all of their stories, but \njust a few. Mary Brady in Durham is trying to buy a home. She cannot do \nit because she is unable to verify Social Security numbers and income \nwith the Internal Revenue Service; Jesse Pannell, who contacted my \noffice because the buyer of his home in Union, CT, cannot process a \nloan from the USDA because the USDA employees are furloughed and there \nis no one to process his buyer's application.\n  In the city of New Haven, which I visited over the weekend, urban \nrenewal is halted because of the shutdown. This city relies on the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development to proceed with foreclosure \nactions on developers. Those developers are subject to foreclosure \nactions when they fail to maintain their property, when that property \nbecomes a blight on the neighborhood. But, of course, HUD employees are \nfurloughed and they are not at their desks to help the city of New \nHaven.\n  This ripple effect spans the State and the country. It goes from \nloans to a physical therapy company, a car wash, a catering company, a \ndental firm, small businesses that populate Main Street. As much as we \nfocus on the markets, on Wall Street, we are talking about Main Street \nin jeopardy because of this shutdown. These are real-life tragedies. \nThere are real consequences to real people, real harm and hardship in \nreal lives. This body has to listen to them, as I did, and as I have \ndone over the past couple of weeks.\n  Behind all of this real harm to real people is the prospect of an \neven more horrendous possible harm resulting from this Nation failing \nto pay its bills on time. The havoc and chaos that would result, the \ncalamity and catastrophe across the globe, the lasting impact on our \nNation, on our credibility as a world power, simply is unthinkable and \nunimaginable.\n  How would we face our children if we were to allow this Nation to go \ninto default? How would this generation explain itself to the next and \nthe one after? Every generation enters into a compact in America that \nwe will leave this Nation better than we found it, just as the World \nWar II generation fought to preserve freedom and democracy and gave of \nitself in combat and then came back to build the interstates and \ndesegregate our schools and put a man on the Moon. In peace as well as \nwar, our veterans are coming back eager and ready to contribute to this \ncountry.\n  The men I just mentioned and met with in East Hartford at VFW Post \n283, veterans across Connecticut, veterans across the country, expect \nmore from this government and are eager to leave this Nation greater \nthan it was left to them, and there are millions of other Americans who \nalso are contributing and giving back in their own ways and who are \ncommitted to following that model of courage and dedication that has \ncharacterized previous generations. How do we face the next generation \nif we allow this great Nation to fail to fulfill its most basic \nobligation that every family meets--paying its bills on time.\n  It is often said America always does the right thing, after it tries \neverything else. I know I am paraphrasing, not quoting directly. \nWinston Churchill said democracy is the worst of all possible \ngovernments, except for all the others.\n  We do not have the luxury today of trying everything else before \nAmerica does the right thing. We do not have the luxury of failing \ndemocracy and failing to pay our bills on time. We must meet this \nchallenge and follow the example of those veterans and millions of \nother courageous Americans who have said to all of us, as they did to \nme this morning: Get the job done. Make sure the Government of the \nUnited States serves the people and pays its bills on time.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will be speaking later this afternoon \nwith regard to the judges, but I have heard a number of people, \nincluding the distinguished senior Senator from Connecticut and others \non the floor, speaking about the effect of the shutdown. I appreciate \nmy colleagues who come and give real-world statements of how what is \nhappening here impacts their constituents.\n  I was just in Vermont and had the opportunity to talk with people, \nmany of whom I have known for years, about how they are being effected \nby the shutdown. These are hard-working people who work for our \ngovernment. They have skills our government needs. They are being \nfurloughed through no fault of their own.\n  They said: I know I am getting paid less in the government, but I \nhave a skill and the country has done so much for me and my family, it \nis a way to give back, but I am not going to tell my children to do \nthat. They are well educated. I am not going to tell them to do that, \nto get treated this way.\n  What is going to happen is we are going to have a lot of these \nfurloughed people who will say the heck with it. They will leave \ngovernment service. These are experts in our intelligence services, the \nDepartment of Defense, medical research, and other areas. What will \nhappen when we try to replace them? We will be scrambling around, \nhiring contractors, paying a lot more for people without the skills and \nexperience.\n  The private sector is being impacted. I have used the example of a \nperson who has a microbrewery in Vermont. He put a lot of money and \neffort into a seasonal brew and was prepared to go with it during what \nwe call the leaf-peeping season, the fall foliage season, in Vermont, \nbut he needs an approval stamp from the Department of Agriculture, but \nthe people who would give him the approval he needs have been \nfurloughed.\n  There are a number of people who may need a passport for an \nemergency, a family member is abroad and ill and somebody has to get on \na plane. A lot passports get issued in St. Albans, Vermont, but the \nemployees at the passport office are not allowed to go to work and get \ntheir job done.\n  Those who have questions of the IRS that they need for their \nbusinesses, normally they could call them, but the IRS is closed.\n  In another area--and someone in the press asked me about this a few \nmoments ago--what about the court system. Our Federal court system is \nfacing some very serious problems. If there is a criminal case, because \nof our speedy trial rules, that goes to the head of the line. We also \nhave, since Gideon v. Wainwright, the fact that criminal defendants are \nentitled to counsel. But the counsel might not be there. Defenders' \noffices might have to furlough staff.\n  Courts can't keep asking the same lawyers to just volunteer their \ntime; maybe they will get paid and maybe they will not, and if they do, \nit is going to be far less than they make otherwise.\n  What happens is that those criminal cases start backing up. Then if \nthere is a legitimate civil case one wishes to bring, good luck in the \nFederal courts. They could wait year after year after year to have \ntheir case heard. By the time their case makes it in front of a judge, \nwhatever remedy they might have is going to be inadequate because of \nthe delay. Justice delayed is justice denied.\n  This is happening in our Federal courts as the money runs out because \nwe have not passed a Continuing Resolution to fund our co-equal branch \nof government. Combined with the funding cuts to the courts due to \nsequestration and the 93 current Federal district and circuit \njudgeships that are vacant 39 of which have been deemed judicial \nemergency vacancies because the caseloads are so high and it is not \ndifficult\n\n[[Page S7465]]\n\nto see that our courts need us act. Fortunately, we will have one judge \nfrom Illinois and one judge from Alabama confirmed this afternoon--but \nwe have a shortage of judges because of vacancies and because we are \nhaving to wait months and months before we are able to vote on \nuncontroversial nominees, who in the past would have been confirmed \nwithin days.\n  I could give 1,000 examples, but the ripple effect on real Americans \nis awful. We see a salmonella outbreak in the West. We know our \nDepartment of Agriculture inspectors are out there checking--oh, wait a \nminute, they are not. They are furloughed or many of them are. What do \nwe do there?\n  As to areas where there are ports, normally busy ports, is shipping \ncoming in and out or is it being slowed because there are suddenly less \npeople?\n  I know when I talk to the FBI, they tell me about investigations they \ncan't go forward with or can't complete because of furloughs.\n  We had this horrific bus accident in the South a couple of weeks ago. \nI cannot imagine the grief those families must feel for those who were \nlost. What I found shocking was that after the accident our National \nTransportation Safety Board couldn't send a team down to find out what \nhappened and whether there is anything that can be learned to prevent \nsimilar crashes because their investigators are furloughed.\n  I know the distinguished Presiding Officer has stood and worked hard \non this floor, in our caucuses, and with others to get the government \nback open and to get us to do the right thing. I am preaching to the \nconverted.\n  I see our deputy leader, the distinguished senior leader from \nIllinois, who has spoken not only on this floor but in the national \nmedia for the need to reopen.\n  I yield the floor to the distinguished Senator from Illinois. I thank \nthe Senator for what he is doing, as I stopped in to thank our majority \nleader for standing strongly on this to reopen the government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me first thank the senior Senator from Vermont and \nthe President pro tempore of the Senate.\n  I wish to say to the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, it \nhas been my great honor for 15 or 16 years to work with the Senator \nfrom Vermont. He is an extraordinary person and an extraordinary leader \non one of the most important committees in Congress.\n  I see Senator Barrasso on the floor. I have about a 10-minute \nstatement if the Senator's schedule allows. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                       Nomination of Andrea Wood\n\n  In a short time, a little more than 1 hour, the Senate will come to \nconsider two judicial nominees. I will speak to one of these nominees \nfrom the State of Illinois. The other I am sure will be addressed by \nother Members of the Senate.\n  I rise to speak in support of the nomination of Andrea Wood to serve \non the U.S. District Court in the Northern District Illinois.\n  Ms. Wood has the qualifications, integrity, and judgment to be an \noutstanding Federal district court judge. I was proud to recommend Ms. \nWood's name to the President of the United States to be considered for \nthis position. I was prouder still when the President concurred in that \nrecommendation. She has my support and the support of my Colleague \nSenator Mark Kirk to fill the Chicago-based judgeship which was left \nvacant by the untimely death of Judge Bill Hibbler.\n  I wish to say a word about Judge Bill Hibbler. Judge Hibbler was one \nof my earlier appointments, a State judge who became an important asset \nto the Federal bench in Chicago. His untimely death left an \nextraordinary vacancy. I was at his memorial service, and the tributes \nthat were paid to him for his life of public service were truly \nfitting. Ms. Wood now has difficult shoes to fill, and it may be \nimpossible, but I think in her own special way she will make an \nextraordinary contribution to the court as well.\n  This vacancy has been designated as a judicial emergency by the \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts, and I am pleased the Senate \nis moving to confirm Ms. Wood today.\n  Ms. Wood currently serves as a senior trial counsel at the Securities \nand Exchange Commission's Division of Enforcement in Chicago. In this \ncapacity she represents the SEC in complex litigation matters. She is a \nnative of St. Louis, and she received her B.A. from the University of \nChicago, where she was selected as one of the student convocation \nspeakers. She received her law degree from Yale, where she served on \nThe Yale Law Journal.\n  After graduating from law school, Ms. Wood clerked for Judge Diane \nWood of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. She then joined the \nChicago law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, where she worked on securities, \nbankruptcies, tax, and other litigation matters.\n  She joined the SEC in 2004 as a senior attorney in the Division of \nEnforcement, where she investigated and litigated securities law \nviolations, including fraud, insider trading, and other misconduct. In \n2007, she became a senior trial counsel, serving as the lead SEC \nattorney on litigation matters and coordinating with the U.S. \nAttorney's Office and other regulators on parallel enforcement actions.\n  Ms. Wood knows the world of litigation at the highest levels. She has \nreceived numerous awards for her work at the SEC, including the \nDirector's Award from the Director of the Division of Enforcement, as \nwell as eight Special Act Awards for her work on individual matters. In \naddition to her busy government service, Ms. Wood has found time to \nserve the Chicago community through a variety of charitable causes.\n  She appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee for a hearing on \nJune 19 and was reported out of the committee on July 18 by a unanimous \nvoice vote. She is an outstanding nominee for the Federal bench, and I \nurge my colleagues to support her nomination when it comes to the floor \nof the Senate later this afternoon.\n  I see on the floor the Senator from North Dakota, who has asked \npermission to speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I wish to thank my esteemed colleague from Illinois and \ntake this opportunity to offer some remarks on the debt ceiling and the \ncontinuing operations of the government.\n  I come to the floor to make an appeal for action, action on opening \nthe government and action on addressing the debt ceiling. Of course, \nthat requires bipartisan effort. This is something our colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle have to work together to accomplish. We have \nbeen negotiating, not only our leadership, Senator Reid and Senator \nMcConnell, but the Members of this body, Republican and Democratic, \nboth sides of the aisle. We have been negotiating and talking about \nmany different ideas, but now we need to come together and find a way \nto both address the debt ceiling and to reopen the government.\n  The kinds of ideas we have discussed include a short-term extension \nof the debt ceiling. Certainly Members on my side of the aisle feel we \nhave to also address the underlying problems that are leading to our \ngrowing debt and deficit.\n  We need savings and reforms as part of addressing that debt ceiling. \nAlso, we have talked about ideas for a continuing resolution to reopen \nthe government, one that follows established law. By that I mean the \nBudget Control Act, which establishes budgetary caps that need to be \nkept in place and honored as part of this agreement.\n  The continuing resolution we have talked about would also include \nflexibility for agencies to prioritize spending subject to \ncongressional oversight, but we have to have budget discipline. We are \nspending more than we are taking in. Whether it is a family, whether it \nis a business, whether it is the Federal Government, that doesn't work. \nWe must exercise budget discipline.\n  Also, we have talked about ideas that might include addressing the \nmedical device tax, possibly repealing the medical device tax or at \nleast deferring it for 2 years and paying for it with pension smoothing \nunder provisions similar to those in MAP-21. We have looked at and \ntalked about requiring income verification under the Affordable Care \nAct to avoid fraud, ideas Republicans have put forward. I think there \nhas been broad support for it on the Democratic side of the aisle.\n\n[[Page S7466]]\n\n  An agreement composed of these kinds of ideas would open government \nand address the debt ceiling on a short-term basis, but the reality is \nwe need to find savings and reforms to address the underlying problems \nthat are driving our deficit and our debt. As part of a debt ceiling \nagreement, we need to have savings and reforms that underlie our \nproblem. Our problem is that we are spending more than we take in. We \ncan't raise the debt ceiling for another year and add $1 trillion in \ndebt to the debt that we already have of $17 trillion. It is kind of \nlike going to the bank. When you go to the bank and you talk to the \nbanker, you say: Hey, I want a loan. I want to increase the loan I \nhave, and I want to raise my credit limit.\n\n  The banker may be willing to give you the loan, but he is going to \nsay to you: What are you going to do to address the underlying problem, \nthe problem you have that you are spending more than you are taking in? \nWhat are you going to do to address that?\n  If you said to the banker: I am not going to do anything to address \nit, you might have a hard time getting the loan, right? That is true \nwhether you are a family, that is true whether you are a business, and \nthat should be true for the Federal Government. So let's put the \nnecessary savings and reforms in place.\n  In his budget, the President identified more than $600 billion in \nchanges and savings and reforms that he could support to mandatory \nspending programs, and we have talked to him about those time and \nagain. Now is the time to implement those savings and reforms to those \nmandatory spending programs.\n  Let me cite an example of one I have been hard at work on for the \nlast 2 years; that is, the farm bill. The farm bill is a mandatory \nspending program. I am a member of the agriculture committee, and we \nhave worked hard on changes, on improvements, on actually strengthening \nthe farm bill by strengthening crop insurance under the farm bill, \nwhich is what our farmers and ranchers want. As we worked through that, \nat the same time we identified on the order of $25 billion to $30 \nbillion in savings that we can generate by reforming the farm program.\n  I am a member of the conference committee on the Senate side. The \nHouse has now appointed their conferees. We are ready to go and resolve \nthe differences between the House and Senate versions of the farm bill, \nand we can have a stronger farm program and save billions of dollars.\n  Those are the kinds of mandatory spending program reforms we need to \nput in place as part of the debt ceiling agreement. And we need to find \na common commitment, a bipartisan commitment, and a commitment on the \npart of the administration as well as the Congress to do that.\n  When we talk about addressing the debt ceiling, that is what it \nreally means. It doesn't just mean raising the debt ceiling. It doesn't \njust mean borrowing more money. It means fixing the problem. So we need \nto act. We need to address the debt ceiling. We need to get the \ngovernment open, but we need to have a common commitment, a bipartisan \ncommitment to solving the underlying problems and to getting the \nreforms and the savings that will ensure we aren't spending more than \nwe are taking in.\n  Of course, a big part of that is economic growth as well. We \nunderstand that. And at the point where we truly come together in a \nbipartisan way--and I would argue this is that point and this is that \ntime--I think the markets will react, and I think business across this \ncountry will react. Businesses large and small will react because the \ncertainty of knowing we truly are dealing with our debt and our deficit \nwill give them the confidence to invest and hire more people, not only \nbringing people back to work, reducing unemployment, but getting \neconomic growth--economic growth not by raising taxes but, with \neconomic growth, broadening and growing the base and generating revenue \nto help with our deficit and our debt.\n  By putting these commonsense reforms, these solutions, these savings \nin place as part of this debt ceiling agreement--a commitment to doing \nthat on both sides of the aisle--we will help unleash the power of the \nstrongest economy in the world, and that economic growth will be a huge \npart of solving our deficit and our debt as well. It is vitally \nimportant that we do it. It is vitally important that we do it for the \nstrength of our country, to get people back to work, but most of all \nfor our children and for future generations. I don't believe there is \nanybody here in Congress--in the Senate, in the House--or anywhere else \nwho wants to leave our children with a $17 trillion debt. So let's \nsolve this. We can do it, and now is the time.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, here we are, it is October 14, and the \ngovernment has been shut down for 2 full weeks. We are about 3 days \naway from a debt ceiling deadline. I keep hearing rumors that a deal is \nclose. I certainly hope that is true, that we do make some \nbreakthroughs and we get through this impasse, but I have some \nobservations on that, and I thought I might take a moment to set the \nrecord straight based on what I have been hearing over the weekend on \nsome of the talk shows and some things that came out over the weekend.\n  In the last day or so there was talk about Democrats putting ``a new \nissue'' on the table, that Democrats are now putting sequestration on \nthe table in these talks. Well, I don't know how anyone could think \nthis is a new issue.\n  In March the Senate approved a budget that replaced sequestration \nwith a mix of entitlement reform and revenue increases.\n  In April the President put forward a budget that replaced \nsequestration with again a mix of spending cuts and revenue increases.\n  Throughout the spring and summer the Appropriations Committee, on \nwhich I serve, debated and passed bills that conformed to the budget \nresolution replacing sequestration. Republicans in the House and Senate \nhave taken part in this debate. Republicans on the Senate \nAppropriations Committee responded with a letter objecting to our \npolicy of replacing the sequestration cuts.\n  The House passed its own budget, the Ryan budget, which also takes \ntheir position on sequestration. They even made it worse by preventing \ncuts in the military and taking all the rest out of nondefense \ndiscretionary spending. I know that sounds like a big word, but it is \nspending that comes out of things such as education and social services \nand health, NIH, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and \nall those other things.\n  Now, again, we heard a lot of talk by Republicans on the Senate side \nthat we Democrats were violating the Budget Control Act by coming in at \na higher level than what sequestration called for. At the same time, \nthe Republicans on the House side violated the Budget Control Act by \nnot taking 50-50. In other words, the Budget Control Act said that if \nsequestration goes into effect, then the cuts have to be made 50 \npercent from defense and 50 percent from nondefense. The Ryan budget--\nwhat they did in the House--left defense whole and took everything out \nof--as I said, everything else, mainly out of health, education, labor, \nand that pot of money.\n  So I guess you might ask whether both sides violated the Budget \nControl Act. No. Both sides had their approach on how to deal with the \nBudget Control Act. The Budget Control Act is not the Ten Commandments \nwritten in stone for all eternity. It is a law. And when we have laws \naround here, periodically, guess what. We change them or modify them, \nof course.\n  So the Budget Control Act was passed, the supercommittee was set up, \nit didn't hit its goals, so sequestration went into effect. Now that we \nhave seen the disastrous consequences of sequestration for this year, \nthose on my side of the aisle said: Well, look, it is time to get rid \nof sequestration, and let's make our decisions as legislators on how we \nwant to spend the taxpayers' money and how we might want to raise \nrevenues.\n  The Republicans on the House side--I don't say they violated \nanything,\n\n[[Page S7467]]\n\nthey just did their own thing. They said: To heck with the Budget \nControl Act. We don't want to take any money out of defense. We will \nleave that whole and take it out of everything else.\n  That would have been the proper time for the House and Senate Budget \nCommittees to get together in a conference so they could work out their \ndifferences. But 19 times we have come to the floor to ask to go to \nconference on the budget, and 19 times the Republicans have refused to \nlet us go to conference to even talk about it. So sequestration is the \nbiggest difference between these two budgets.\n  I might add, with regard to the budget Mr. Ryan came up with in the \nHouse, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, a \nRepublican, called it ``unworkable,'' for whatever that is worth.\n  Nonetheless, sequestration is the biggest difference between our two \nbudgets. Again, that is why we asked to go to conference time and time \nagain. So sequestration is not some kind of new issue. It is the issue \nof the year. It will be the issue of next year. Do we blindly cut \neverything? Sequestration is a blind cut of everything, even programs \neveryone here might agree are worthwhile and should be funded. But that \nis what we are elected to do. We are elected to make those kind of \nchoices and work them out in a conference committee.\n  If you think sequestration is some kind of a new issue, I guess it is \nonly a new issue if your memory is only 2 weeks long. If you know what \nhas been going on for this year, sequestration is the major difference.\n  Two weeks ago Senate Democrats compromised in an attempt to keep the \ngovernment open. How did we do that? We agreed to keep the government \nopen for 6 weeks--at that time, until November 15--at the current \nlevels, which included the sequestration cuts. It was not in our \nbudget, but we agreed, to give us time before Christmas to go to \nconference and work out the differences. We passed it at the same level \nwhich was included in the continuing resolution passed by the House of \nRepresentatives. We agreed to compromise our level down to the House \nlevel for 6 weeks to keep the government open. We passed it and sent it \nover to the House. It has been sitting there ever since. Speaker \nBoehner will not permit it to come to the floor for a vote. Why? \nPerhaps he knows if he brings it up for a vote, it will pass and the \nPresident will sign it.\n  Instead, they began this by saying we had to change ObamaCare. We had \nto make changes in the Affordable Care Act--which has nothing to do \nwith this budget, by the way. That didn't work. So now they have \nshifted to a whole bunch of other demands. And we have never really \ngone to conference. What the Republicans are now saying is we should \ngive up a whole year. Forget about the budget resolution we passed \nhere, and agree to what they passed in the House for the next year \nwithout even going to conference.\n  So first the Republicans in the House won't agree to negotiate on the \nbudget unless we agree to their top priority--no revenue increases. \nThen Republicans insist upon shutting down the government to stop \nObamaCare. Now this weekend Republicans have been saying they won't \nagree to reopen government or lift the debt ceiling until Democrats \nagree to the total spending level in the Ryan budget. This is truly \nunprecedented.\n  We heard over and over Republicans wanted the Democrats to produce a \nbudget. We did. Now they are doing everything in their power to avoid \ndiscussing our budget. But what is truly incredible is that Republicans \nwant the world to believe Democrats agreeing to a compromise for 6 \nweeks was an agreement to give up our entire budget for the whole next \nyear. I don't know why the press is playing into this. They seem to be \nsaying it is tit for tat. It is one side; it is the other.\n  No, it is not. We agreed to 6 weeks. Now the House says that we must \nagree to it for 1 year. That was never part of our budget we sent to \nthe House. So that is not a compromise.\n  I will happily vote for a bill that extends the current level for 6 \nweeks or so. We have already voted for that. The House wanted 10 weeks. \nBut I think a debate over whether to keep or change sequestration for \nthe year--which is the entire debate between the Senate and the House \nbudget resolution--is too important to be used as a bargaining chip for \nbasic government operations.\n  I didn't watch the Sunday shows. I rarely ever do. I have better \nthings to do on Sunday. But I couldn't help but read the paper this \nmorning, and there was a statement in the paper made by the senior \nSenator from Arizona. I guess he was on a talk show, and they were \nquoting him.\n  Senator McCain said: I guess we could go lower in the polls. Right \nnow we are down to blood relatives and paid staffers.\n  That is kind of cute. And I am quoting the newspapers, so I don't \nknow if he said it this way or not. He said: But we have got to turn \nthis around and the Democrats had better help us.\n  What does that mean? They are the ones that shut the government down. \nAs I said, there is a bill before the House right now. If the Speaker \nwould put it on the floor, it would open the government. We passed that \nhere. We helped them. We agreed to their level for 6 weeks. How much \nmore help do they need?\n  The more I read about this in the print and watch the news programs, \nthe more it becomes clear to me there is an attitude being pushed by \nthe Republicans that if they agree to reopen the government and if they \nagree to extend the debt limit, they are doing us Democrats a favor. \nRead between the lines. It is like they are doing us a big favor to do \nthis. Therefore, we have to give them all these concessions because \nthey are doing us a favor.\n  I tell my Republican friends, they are not doing us Democrats a favor \nwhatsoever. If they agree to reopen the government and extend the debt \nlimit, they are doing the Nation a favor, not the Democrats. So get \nthat out of your head that somehow, because you are willing to do that, \nwe have to give concessions on something else. We can talk about \nconcessions, and we can talk about sequestration and other budgets when \nwe go to conference--if they will let us go to conference. Nineteen \ntimes they have opposed us going to conference. But talking about \nconcessions now as a means of reopening government or extending the \ndebt limit--that shouldn't even be a part of the equation. Somehow the \npress continues to report this as a legitimate demand on the part of \nRepublicans; that if we want to open the government, then they get to \ndemand certain concessions. Why is that legitimate? The legitimate \nthing is to reopen the government. It is very simple.\n\n  Other people have come to the floor to talk about the impact of \nsequestration, and I thought I would just take a moment again--I did \nthe other day, I will do it again today, and I will continue to do \nthis--to alert people as to what another year of sequestration would \nmean for programs which come under the jurisdiction of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, \nEducation, and Related Agencies, which I have been privileged to chair \nor be the ranking member of since 1989. Here is what would happen next \nyear if we continued sequestration: Some 177,000 fewer children will \nget Head Start services. Maybe that is not your kid or my grandkids. \nEverybody here has plenty of money. But it affects a lot of low-income \nfamilies in this country.\n  And 1.3 million fewer students would get title I education \nassistance--no kids of anybody in this body or the House, none of our \ngrandkids. We have plenty of money. But low-income families all across \nthis country, in urban areas as well as rural, get title I assistance.\n  And 760,000 fewer households will receive heating or cooling \nassistance under what we call LIHEAP, Low Income Heating and Energy \nAssistance Program. Again, it won't affect anybody in this body, it \nwon't affect anybody in the House, and probably none of our families. \nBut it will affect 760,000 households with an elderly person without \nmuch money, maybe just living off a Social Security check and nothing \nelse.\n  Special education programs under the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act. We fund a portion which goes out to the States. By \nsequestration, the less money we put out will mean 9,000 special \neducation staff will be cut from classrooms. Maybe the\n\n[[Page S7468]]\n\nStates will come up with the money. Maybe local taxpayers will come up \nwith the money. I am just saying, under sequestration we will not be \npaying for 9,000 special education teachers and staff.\n  Sequestration next year means $291 million less for child care \nsubsidies for working families. These are families that go to work \nevery day, and many are single parents. These are low-paying jobs, and \nthe only way they can go to work is to have some kind of child care \nsubsidy, and $291 million will be taken out of that. Again, it won't \naffect anybody here.\n  Two billion dollars less for the National Institutes of Health. That \nis 1,300 fewer research grants next year. Which one of those grants \nwill lead to breakthrough discoveries in medicine and cures?\n  We have a fraud and abuse program in Medicare. It recovers $7.90 for \nevery $1 we appropriate. A lot of that comes because of overcharges \nfrom drug companies. We have seen cases in Wisconsin and a number of \nother States with huge settlements because the drug companies were \novercharging. For every $1 that we put in, we recover $7.90. Because of \nthe cut, because of sequestration, we will lose about $2.7 billion next \nyear in funds that we would assume we would get back. Aside from that, \ndrug companies know we won't have enough cops on the beat, and that \nwill be an excuse for them to just start overcharging again.\n  So those are just a few of the things that will happen if we continue \nsequestration. There are probably some on the other side who just don't \ncare. For example, one Member of the House Republican caucus asked \nRepresentative Bachmann about the government shut down, and she said: \nWe are very excited. It is exactly what we wanted, and we got it.\n  Then there is Representative Culberson who reportedly said: It is \nwonderful. We are 100 percent united.\n  What are they excited about? They are excited about the government \nshutdown. They are probably excited about sequestration. They are \nexcited about hundreds of thousands of low-income kids not getting Head \nStart. They are excited about low-income families not getting heating \nand cooling assistance. They are excited that special education \nteachers will be cut. They are excited about this. This is their vision \nof America.\n\n  The tea party had some big gathering here in Washington the last few \ndays. I happened to be reading about it. There was one woman there \ntalking to reporters. She said we need to go back to the late 1800s in \nthis country when we grew our own vegetables.\n  I thought to myself, fine. If you want to, you can do that. There is \nnothing restricting her from going out and living without electricity \nor running water, health care. She can go find a cabin someplace in the \nwoods, I suppose, have a little plot of land, grow her vegetables, do \nher own canning. You can do that, if you like.\n  But why does she insist that we all want to do that? I don't think a \nlot of people want to go back to the late 1800s in this country. Think \nof what life was like then: child labor, people working 60, 70 hours a \nweek, no minimum wage, no Social Security, no Medicare, no education \nfor a lot of low-income kids. If you had money, you were fine. Disease \nwas rampant--polio, measles, smallpox. That was the late 1800s. That is \nwhat the tea party wants. They want to go back to that. They keep up \nthis hue and cry about that; things have just gotten out of hand.\n  Things have not gotten out of hand. We are a big country. We are a \nbig nation--powerful, big. We have a lot of economic assets, but we \nhave a lot of human assets too. We have to take care not just of the \neconomic assets but our human assets as well. There are no economic \nassets without human assets. We need to invest in our people and not \nlisten to those who want to turn the clock back to the 1800s. That is \nwhat sequestration would start to do. It would start to turn the clock \nback--oh, maybe not to the 1800s--I don't want to exaggerate--but \ncertainly before the Great Society and certainly, probably, even before \nthe New Deal. They do want to get rid of Social Security. They do want \nto get rid of Medicare.\n  I guess Grover Norquist, who is sort of their patron saint, said: We \nwant to reduce the size of government so small we can drown it in the \nbathtub. That is what they want. That is their vision of America. That \nis their vision of our future.\n  I am hoping we do reach some agreements and we can get out of this. \nBut the Republicans have dug themselves in this hole, not us. Now they \nsay they want us to help them. We already have. We passed a bill and \nsent it to the House to open the government. We now have before us, as \nwe did on Saturday, a bill to extend the debt limit without strings \nattached until December 2014. Every single Republican voted against \neven going to that bill to even discuss it on Saturday. I opened the \nnewspapers on Sunday to read about it, and there is very little talk \nabout that. Is there something I missed? Did we not have a vote here on \nSaturday on a motion to proceed to raising the debt limit for 1 year--\njust to go to the bill so we can discuss it? People could offer \namendments. Every single Republican voted against even going to that \nbill, even discussing it.\n  We have thrown plenty of lifelines out there. If what the senior \nSenator from Arizona meant by ``help'' is that we have to give up on \neverything in terms of our budget, sequestration, all that other stuff, \nthat is nonsense. I made a counterproposal. I said if they are going to \nkeep putting all that stuff on there as conditions, we ought to start \nputting conditions on it too.\n  If they want some help, how about raising the minimum wage right now? \nThat would be something we could do. Wouldn't that be neat? If they \nwant to reopen the government and extend the debt ceiling, let's raise \nthe minimum wage right now for people in this country. I would put that \non the table right now. I would put on the table that we need to put \nmore money into special education to help our local taxpayers and more \nmoney, certainly, into early childhood education. Maybe those are the \nthings we ought to put on the table, saying: If you want help, agree to \nthese things. I will not go there. But if they continue to push this \nidea, if the Republicans continue to push this idea that somehow we \nhave to capitulate on everything else, then I think we just throw these \nthings on the table and say: OK, you want us to agree to that? You \nagree to this. We will have a little tit-for-tat on that and see how \nfar it goes.\n  That is why this whole talk about giving up on sequestration and \nbudget matters is a nonstarter. Open the government--very simple. \nExtend the debt limit--very simple. Then go to conference and talk \nabout this. That is the way out of this. That is the real, adult, \ndemocratic--with a small ``d''--way out of this mess. I call upon the \nRepublicans not to do us a favor. Do the country a favor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, in just 3 days, barring some action by \nCongress, the Treasury Department of the United States will run out of \noptions for preventing default on this Nation's debts for the first \ntime in our history, setting off a chain of economic events that will \nbe felt around the world and by every family and business and State and \ncommunity in our country.\n  We have heard a great deal on this floor the last few days about how \nwe arrived at this point and who is to blame. There is a lot of concern \nand consternation about exactly who owns this and how we got here. I am \nnot going to spend time today on that. I am going to skip the politics \nand the drama for now and just talk about the facts and the policy. I \njust want to talk to Delawareans about what would happen if we actually \ngo over this impending cliff, if we do default, and which of the \noptions for addressing this are viable.\n  First, let's be clear about what we are talking about.\n  What is the debt ceiling? Defaulting on our debt by failing to raise \nthe debt ceiling is not the same as cutting up America's credit cards. \nIt is not the same as denying the President the right to sign more \nchecks into the future. Raising the debt ceiling does not give Congress \nor the President a blank check to spend more money. It allows the \nUnited States to borrow more money, yes, but only to pay bills for \ngoods and services already incurred, to meet pledges already made.\n  We have had some kind of a national debt ceiling since 1917, when \nCongress\n\n[[Page S7469]]\n\nallowed the Treasury Department to issue long-term Liberty bonds to pay \nfor our engagement in the First World War. Over the course of the next \ntwo decades, caps were placed on other kinds of debt as well, and \nfinally, in 1939, Congress decided to place a ceiling on the total \namount of debt the country could have.\n  The last time Congress raised the debt ceiling, it was up to $16.99 \ntrillion. Technically, we reached that limit a few months ago--actually \non May 19 of this year. The Treasury Department has since been using \nwhat it calls ``extraordinary measures'' to keep paying our bills, but, \nas Secretary Lew has communicated to this Congress over and over in \nletter and in testimony, in just a few days the Treasury Department \nwill no longer have enough money to keep up. These extraordinary \nmeasures will have run out, and in a week or two later we will have \ncome up to zero.\n  What are the bills we need to raise the ceiling in order to pay? It \nis the salaries of all Federal employees, including our military; it is \nSocial Security and Medicare payments; it is unemployment benefits, tax \nrefunds, and interest on our sovereign debt. Raising the debt limit \nallows the Treasury to borrow the money it needs to pay these bills. \nThat is it.\n  If on any particular day more bills come due than we have cash in our \naccounts to cover, then the United States of America will default on \nsome or all of its obligations. That day is coming and coming quickly. \nFrankly, we cannot let it happen.\n  For decades investors have bought U.S. debt because it was seen as a \nsure thing, a safe investment. When people buy a Treasury bill, a T-\nbill, they do so because they know they are going to earn interest on \none of the safest investments in the world. American debt is considered \nunimpeachable. That is what makes the dollar the reserve currency for \nmuch of the world, which is something that benefits every American \ncompany and community and family in ways that are hard to see but \ncumulatively powerful--the absolute certainty that we will repay our \nnational debt.\n  Who are these investors? Who are the folks who buy these T-bills? \nSome are everyday Americans. A large number of retirees invest in our \ngovernment bonds because they are such a safe bet. Pension funds and \nmutual funds invest in government bonds for the same reason. Some \ninvestors are the governments of other nations that look at the United \nStates as such a good investment that they tie their financial \nstability to ours. So when it starts to look as if Congress will not \nlive up to that standard, will not take the steps necessary to pay all \nof our bills on time and might actually default on some of our debts \nand transform us into a deadbeat nation, it makes investors really \nnervous.\n  Just the talk of defaulting on our debts sends a shockwave through \nour economy and through the markets. For proof we need only look back \nto August of 2001, when Congress last brought the Nation to the brink \nof default. Although we didn't cross the line, just the talk of it, the \nmere possibility that we might for the first time default had an array \nof consequences.\n  First, it slowed job growth and led to an increase in part-time \nemployment.\n  Second, consumer confidence in our economy fell. The Consumer \nConfidence Index--the index of consumer confidence--is a reliable \nindicator of Americans' willingness to spend money and fuel our \neconomic growth. We want consumers buying products at their local \nstores and keeping people employed, right? The index was already on the \npessimistic side of the line when this last crisis began but has fallen \nsubstantially since the government shutdown. Instability and \nuncertainty reduces consumer confidence and takes money out of our \neconomy.\n  Third, the yield of our Treasury bills had to increase in order to \nprop up demand. As U.S. debt becomes perceived as a riskier investment, \nwe have to incentivize investors by increasing what we will pay them. \nThat means taxpayers will have to pay more over time in order to \ncompensate. The debate in 2011 will cost American taxpayers an \nadditional $19 billion over the next decade. Again, just the debate as \nwe ran up to the possibility of default in 2011 added $19 billion in \ndebt service costs to the bonds that were issued in the days and months \nafter.\n  Fourth, the credit rating agency Standard & Poor's--one of the big \nthree--lowered the credit rating of the United States, causing markets \nto drop more than 5 percent in a single day and 17 percent over the \ncourse of that crisis. It was one of the worst declines in the equities \nmarkets in history, and it was only because we talked about defaulting.\n  Just threatening to default is terrible for our economy in all these \nfour different ways.\n  Financial analysts across the world have said Congress is already \ncausing potentially lasting damage to the strength of the dollar just \nby repeatedly threatening to default. Said one:\n\n       There is a negative confidence shock rippling through the \n     economy, and foreign investors have taken fright at \n     developments in Washington.\n\n  Said another:\n\n       A U.S. government default is not a zero-probability event \n     now. Although it remains very unlikely, a low-probability \n     high-impact event like this is naturally making investors \n     cautious.\n\n  So we simply cannot afford this talk. We cannot let our Nation \ndefault.\n  What happens if we do? What would actually happen if we get to the \nend of this week and have not resolved this crisis? I am encouraged by \nrumors of some resolution. I am encouraged that there are negotiations \nand conversations going on. But I think we need to look in a clear-eyed \nway at what would happen if default should happen to occur.\n  For starters, we don't really know. The situation has never been this \nbad before this, and the United States has never defaulted on its debt.\n  Here is what the managing director of the International Monetary Fund \nsaid this weekend:\n\n       If there is that degree of disruption, that lack of \n     certainty, that lack of trust in the U.S. signature, it would \n     mean massive disruption the world over, and we would be at \n     risk of tipping yet again into global recession.\n\n  We simply cannot afford that.\n  Let me share another quote from history, from President Ronald \nReagan, who back in 1983 had this to say about the potential threat of \ndefault and its impact on our economy:\n\n       The full consequences of a default--or even the serious \n     prospect of a default--by the United States are impossible to \n     predict and awesome to contemplate. Denigration of the full \n     faith and credit of the United States would have substantial \n     effects on the domestic financial markets and the value of \n     the dollar.\n  As it was true back in 1983, so it is true again today. The comments \nfrom the head of the IMF and from a whole array of economists and \nbankers this past week remind us of the simple and enduring truth that \nthe modern era has been one where the dollar has been the reserve \ncurrency for the world, and the strength of the American market has \nbeen critical to the strength of the American nation, our communities, \nand our economy. Frankly, to put that at risk over short-term political \ndifferences is reckless indeed.\n  What we know is we will wake up this coming Friday with about $30 \nbillion in the Federal Government's account, according to Treasury \nSecretary Lew. What we don't know is how long it will last. The moment \nwe can't pay one of our bills, we will default. That is what is known \nas X date. The government will still collect revenue, but it won't be \nenough to keep pace with our daily bills.\n  Over the last year, the government collected $7.5 billion a day and \nspent an average of $9.7 billion a day. That means we come up about \n$2.2 billion short on our bills every day if we are not borrowing \nenough to make up the difference.\n  Analysts at the Bipartisan Policy Center suggest that we will run out \nof cash--hitting the X date--roughly on October 22. To be clear, part \nof why we don't know exactly what date this would occur is because \nmoney flows into the Federal Treasury at uneven rates, and it flows out \nat uneven rates.\n  Let's look at a few of the bills that are about to come due in the \nnext few weeks. On October 23, $12 billion in Social Security benefits \nare due; on October 28, $3 billion in Federal salaries would go unpaid. \nOn October 30, $2 billion in Medicaid payments are due; on October 31, \n$6 billion in interest payments on our sovereign debt are due; on \nNovember 1, $58 billion in Medicare,\n\n[[Page S7470]]\n\nSocial Security, and SSI payments, as well as veterans' benefits and \nmilitary pay.\n  Those are just the major bills. There are thousands, even millions, \nof smaller payments that are due from every agency and entity of the \nFederal Government that go up and down day in and day out and where our \nfailure to pay in a timely fashion, while technically not defaulting on \nour sovereign debt, would put into question our ability and willingness \nas a government to pay our bills when due.\n  With what we have left, we will not be able to pay them all, and we \nwill be in violation of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which \nsays that the debt of the United States of America shall not be \nquestioned.\n  If we have not raised the debt ceiling by this Thursday, we are \nlikely to see disturbing losses in global markets. We have already \nstarted to see them as uncertainty takes over and volatility begins to \nspread. Investors are already pulling money out of our T-bills. If 2011 \nis an indication, stock prices will soon begin to drop in the absence \nof some progress toward a resolution.\n  Deutsche Bank, one of the world's most prominent investment banks, \npredicted the S 500 index will fall by a staggering 45 percent if we \ndefault. We heard loudly and clearly when we met with the credit \nratings agencies after the 2011 incident that they would almost \ncertainly downgrade the credit rating of the United States, which would \nreduce demand for Treasurys, particularly among investment funds that \nare required to hold a large number of AAA-rated securities.\n  With the Nation pressed against its debt ceiling and future interest \npayments uncertain, investors will be hesitant to buy more T-bills. The \ntoxicity of U.S. debt may spread to Treasury notes and bonds, and \ninvestors will almost certainly demand higher yields, which will cost \nour country significantly more over time. This is exactly what happened \nin 2011 when we flirted with default.\n  Right now, the dollar is the world's reserve currency. Instead of \nkeeping their money in cash, other nations buy our debt in order to get \ninterest without risk. America has been a great investment. A default \nwould cause other nations to sell our debt and then sell our dollars, \nweakening our dollars against foreign currencies, and raising the costs \non every single good imported into the United States.\n  If Treasury interest rates go up just 1 percentage point, it would \nadd over $1 trillion in the next decade to our debt service cost. \nAnything we saved because of sequestration would be gone, and there is \nno reason to think that default would cause interest rates to go up by \none single point. It could add $2 trillion or $3 trillion to our debt \nover the next decade. This affects everyone in our community and our \ncountry from large to small, from companies to communities to families. \nWhen Treasury interest rates go up, your interest rates go up. Mortgage \nrates, auto loans, student loans, business loans--they all go up, and \nthey would go up fast. Default would make it harder for all of us to \nuse credit responsibly. As consumers buy less, business profits would \nfall, GDP would fall, and the Nation once again would enter a \nrecession. Defaulting on our debt would be an unimaginable drag on the \neconomic health of our country, our community, and families. We cannot \nlet it happen.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague Senator Mikulski has joined me on \nthe floor. If I might, with her forbearance, I will take a few minutes \nto review a few points here, and then I will yield to her.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am happy to yield and have the Senator \nfrom Delaware continue. He is the newest member of the Appropriations \nCommittee. He has really articulated something everybody needs to \nunderstand. I am happy to wait my turn.\n  Mr. COONS. In conclusion, I will briefly touch on our options. We \nhave all heard on this floor Senators suggest that default is really \nnot that big a deal, that we are not really going to default, that \nthere are other ways around this, and that we need not be scared into \nmaking some hurried deal. At the end of the day, several Senators have \naccused the President of fearmongering and have accused my party of \nsuggesting that default is a major threat to our country and our \neconomy when, in fact, it is not.\n  Let me briefly touch on the options that have been discussed by other \nSenators and, frankly, to my surprise. First, some have suggested we \ncan pay our bills not when they are due but when we have the money--\nsort of on a first-come, first-serve payment approach. Let's say we ran \nout of money, as I suggested, on the 20th of this month and could not \npay our bills on the 21st. By the 23rd we would have enough money so we \nwould pay the bills from the 21st, late, but go delinquent on the bills \nfor the 22nd and 23rd, and so on. This is crazy. Payments would be \ndelinquent and the United States would fall behind on its debt.\n  This option would only make our situation worse. We would keep adding \nover $2 billion in debt every single day while going delinquent on our \nbills to Americans.\n  The second way forward. Some have suggested we prioritize certain \nbills but ignore others. The Treasury Department would continue to make \npayments on our sovereign debt so the Chinese would get paid, but they \nwould avoid or default on lots and lots of other obligations. Which \npayments would we choose in this body not to make? Social Security? \nMedicare? Military salaries? Payments for cancer research? Veterans' \nbenefits? Food inspectors? Air traffic controllers? Who goes first and \nwho would we possibly choose? These are the ludicrous choices that have \nbeen sent to us by the other Chamber as they have attempted to fund the \ngovernment in piecemeal slices in the past week.\n  The Treasury Department makes 100 million individual payments per \nmonth, making this option a logistical nightmare. If we prioritize our \npayments, it is not a question of if we go into recession, it would be \na question of when. We would be taking $2.2 billion out of the economy \na day--4 percent of our GDP out of our Nation's economy on an \nannualized basis. This would push us back into recession, we would \nstill be defaulting on our obligations, and the markets and the credit \nrating agencies would know it.\n  The other thing that has been suggested is to work around the debt \nceiling. There are a whole lot of creative but legally questionable \nideas: The minting of a $1 trillion coin, avoiding the 14th Amendment, \na fire sale of U.S. assets, superpremium Treasurys. Each has pros and \ncons that I won't go into, but they would face legal scrutiny and would \nradically increase uncertainty in the market.\n  There is no better option for us going forward than to reopen the \ngovernment, pay our national debt on time, raise the debt ceiling, and \nhonor our obligations as a country. That is the fourth and only good \noption: pay our bills, to prevent default, to put a floor under our \neconomy, to stop these games, and to stop suggesting that there is any \nway out of this other than doing our jobs, preserving the AAA credit \nrating of this country, and making this country worthy of global \nrespect again.\n  In conclusion, I can't believe that Members in this Chamber, who had \nthe chance to avoid default, on Saturday voted in a way that suggested \nthey chose not to. Not only did it rattle me, it rattled the markets. \nThe idea that a sovereign government would have the ability to pay its \ndebts but actively chose not to is unprecedented.\n  We cannot allow that to happen. We cannot allow this country to \nbecome a bad investment. We will not become a deadbeat nation. We need \nto pay our bills, do the right thing, and avoid default. We need to \nstop playing games and do right by the American people.\n  With that, I yield the floor and look forward to the comments from \nthe senior Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have \npermission to speak for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, there is a misguided myth out there--not \nall myths are misguided, but this myth is--by those who believe that \nthe government shutdown is actually saving us money. I am not going to \ngo into all those details about why that is not true, but I can tell \neverybody one area where government shutdown is absolutely being \nnegatively impacted in\n\n[[Page S7471]]\n\nprotecting the taxpayer dollar and fulfilling the mission of the \nagency--particularly in Social Security, Medicare, veterans' benefits, \nand some others.\n  The Presiding Officer was the attorney general and the U.S. attorney \nof the Ocean State, Rhode Island, so he knows about scammers and \nschemers and that where there is need, there is greed. Where there are \nlarge government programs, they are open to waste and particularly to \nfraud.\n  I have been an adamant opponent of fraud, and often that is dismissed \nwith comments such as: Oh, everybody says you are against fraud. But \nwhat are we doing about it?\n  Let me say this: As the chairperson of the Appropriations Committee, \nI was insistent that at every one of my hearings there be an inspector \ngeneral testifying. I have an inspector general who advises us \nappropriators, who actually put money in the Federal checkbook, about \nhow we can stop fraud in our own government. I am the first chairman of \nthat committee ever to institute that process where we take the \nwatchdogs of our Federal spending very seriously.\n  The watchdogs who protect taxpayers' funds are known as inspectors \ngeneral. They are independently appointed, independently confirmed, and \nindependently do their job. Look at the inspector general for the IRS \nwho brought a national scandal to our attention.\n  But guess what. In this shutdown the ability of inspectors general to \nroot out fraud and abuse has been severely compromised. We are not \ncatching criminals who are trying to get a quick buck off the back of \ntaxpayers.\n  I will give an example: The Social Security administration has \nfurloughed 250 investigators and auditors in the Office of the \nInspector General. This is crippling the inspector general's ability to \ninvestigate allegations of fraud and to detect improper payments in \nSocial Security.\n  Just recently headlines have made the news about fraud in West \nVirginia field offices in Social Security where judges and others who \nwere administering the program--administrative judges--were taking \nkickbacks. Thanks to law enforcement, and the inspector general, we \ngrabbed that.\n  There were actually people in Federal prisons who used the Internet \nand created phony identities to get both taxpayer refunds and also \nSocial Security checks. Thanks to inspectors general being on the job, \nwe were able to nip that in the bud.\n  Each year the Social Security inspector general receives 135,000 \nallegations of fraud and abuse. Last year the inspector general at the \nSocial Security Administration saved the program $500 million--a half \nbillion dollars was saved in fraud at the Social Security \nAdministration. But instead of pinning medals on people, we have \nfurloughed them. They are sitting at home waiting and itching to be \nback on the job because they are so proud of what they do.\n  They believe that Social Security is a sacred trust, and anybody who \ntries to scheme or scam the system, they are going to come after.\n  During the normal operations, the Social Security inspector general \nsaves $9 for every $1 spent in oversight.\n  Let's look at some of the other agencies, such as the Department of \nAgriculture. Every minute of this shutdown taxpayer dollars are being \nlost to fraud. When we look at the Department of Agriculture, we see \nthat last year their inspector general investigated 331 possible \nfrauds. They conducted 76 audits. Guess what it resulted in: 800 \nindictments resulting from people trying to scam various aspects of the \nDepartment of Agriculture, including food stamp fraud. Of the 800 \nindictments, they got 538 convictions. Guess what. They saved our \nFederal Government $1.5 billion. I said $1.5 billion, 800 indictments, \nand 540 convictions.\n  The Office of the Inspector General at the Department of Agriculture \nis on furlough. A minimum number of investigators are on the job. All \nof the Department of Agriculture inspector general audit staff is \nfurloughed. That is not a wise use of the taxpayer dollars.\n  Let's go to the VA. The VA Inspector General's Office has furloughed \n70 percent of its staff. The VA operates the largest integrated \nhospital system in the country, including 152 hospitals and 1,000 \nclinics. It also operates a mortgage program and an educational voucher \nprogram. It operates a disability claims and survivor benefit program. \nTheir inspector general routinely audits this complex system. What do \nthey look for? Possible criminal activity. They look for fraud. They \nmake sure there is no misconduct by senior VA officials, and they are \ndoing their job, but they have been furloughed.\n  We also have the General Services Administration, which is \nessentially the real estate arm of the Federal Government. It plays a \ncrucial role. Guess what. Last year they handled 450 cases. They got \n3,000 hotline complaints about possible fraud. Their staff is on \nfurlough. So they are not looking out for fraud in real estate, \nautomobile leasing, technology, gaming the system, and furniture. Their \ncases range from bribery to embezzlement, to kickback schemes. Most--99 \npercent--of our GSA employees are honest. So are our contractors. But \nguess what. In just 6 months alone, from October 2012 to March of 2013, \nthey were able to crack down and recover over $100 million in schemes \nand scams.\n  Look at what I have outlined already: a couple billion dollars, \nincluding Social Security, Agriculture, GSA. They are on the job.\n  I could go to agency after agency. Guess what. The very agency that \ninvolves us and advises us is the Government Accountability Office. \nThat is Congress's watchdog. That is where we ask for studies on how we \ncan do a better job and where they identify programs that are dated, \nduplicative or dysfunctional--dated, duplicative or dysfunctional. If \nthey are dated, goodbye to them. If they are dysfunctional, reform or \ngoodbye. Dysfunctional--dated, dysfunctional, and duplicative, that is \nour mantra on the Appropriations Committee. We are the guardians of the \npurse, but we need our tool. The Government Accountability Office, \nwhich we rely on, has furloughed 98 percent of its staff.\n  I could elaborate on agency after agency, but what I wish to show is \njust this: The consequences of shutdown are affecting people. If they \nare not on the job, they are not doing the job.\n  The job of our inspectors general offices--they are independent. They \nare supposed to come with incredible fiscal background. They are \ninvestigators. They are auditors. They are people who have to know how \nto find a problem, see if it is criminal or civil, whether we can get \nour money back, so we can make sure it doesn't happen again. Those \npeople want to work. They love their job. It is a calling to them, and \nwe need to call them and say: You are back to work.\n  So let's reopen government. Let's find a way. Let's fund government \nat a level that makes sure it can function the way it should. Let's \nalso pay our debts. I do not want our T-bills to become junk bonds. I \ndo not want our T-bills to be so shaky in terms of our ability to pay \nthem back that they arrive at junk bond status. So let's get rid of \njunk politics and junk talking points. Let's get those clunkers off the \nroad. Let's get America rolling again, pay our bills, honor our T-\nbills. Let's get government working and let America be America again.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/14/senate-section/article/S7471-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7471-S7473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF ANDREA R.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnominations, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nominations of Andrea R. \nWood, of Illinois, to be United States District Judge for the Northern \nDistrict of Illinois, and Madeline Hughes Haikala, of Alabama, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the Northern District of Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 30\n\n[[Page S7472]]\n\nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know it is several minutes past 5. I \ndoubt very much if we will use the 30 minutes. We will probably be able \nto yield back time so the vote can be at 5:30, although I am not making \nthat request at this point.\n  Listening to the distinguished chair of the Appropriations Committee, \nthe senior Senator from Maryland, I had to agree with everything she \nwas saying. This is the fourteenth day of the government shutdown, and \nby refusing to pass a clean continuing resolution to fund the \noperations of the Federal government, Republicans continue to threaten \nthe critical functioning of all three branches of government.\n  With this ongoing shutdown of the entire Federal government, a \nhandful of ideologues in the House of Representatives are holding the \nentire judicial system hostage and this threatens our entire democracy.\n  One critical problem is that we have more than 90 judicial vacancies, \nincluding 39 that have been designated as emergency vacancies due to \nhigh caseloads by the non-partisan Administrative Office of the Courts.\n  While we will vote to confirm two additional judges today, we are \nmoving far too slowly and are not keeping pace with the urgent needs of \nour Federal judiciary. We must do better.\n  Both of the district court nominees we are voting on today have been \nnominated to fill vacancies that were named judicial emergencies by the \nnonpartisan Administrative Office of the Courts. Andrea Wood is \nnominated to a judicial emergency vacancy in the U.S. District Court \nfor the Northern District of Illinois. Since 2004, Ms. Wood has served \nin the Division of Enforcement of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, currently as a senior trial counsel and previously as a \nsenior attorney. Before joining the SEC, she spent 5 years in private \npractice as an associate at Kirkland & Ellis LLP. Following law school, \nMs. Wood served as a law clerk for Judge Diane P. Wood of the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.\n  Ms. Wood earned her B.A., with honors, from the University of \nChicago, and her J.D. from Yale Law School, where she served as \narticles editor of the Yale Law Journal. She has the bipartisan support \nof her home State Senators, Senator Durbin and Senator Kirk. Her \nnomination was approved by the Judiciary Committee by voice vote with \nno opposition to her confirmation expressed more than 2 months ago.\n  Madeline Haikala is nominated to a judicial emergency vacancy in the \nU.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, where she has \nserved as a magistrate judge since 2012. Prior to her appointment, she \nworked at the Birmingham law firm of Lightfoot, Franklin, & White for \n22 years, first as an associate and subsequently as a partner. In \naddition, Judge Haikala has taught for approximately 7 years as an \nadjunct professor at the Cumberland School of Law.\n  The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated \nJudge Haikala well qualified to serve on the U.S. District Court for \nthe Northern District of Alabama, its highest rating. Judge Haikala \nalso has the strong support of both of her Republican home State \nSenators, Senator Shelby and Senator Sessions. Like the other \nnomination we are voting on today, Judge Haikala's nomination was \napproved by the Judiciary Committee by voice vote with no opposition to \nher confirmation expressed more than 2 months ago.\n  While I am pleased that we are finally getting to vote on these \nnominees, there remain far too many judicial vacancies. Because of the \ngovernment shutdown, we have been unable to hold hearings, process, and \napprove nominees in the Judiciary Committee for the last two weeks. It \ndoes our country a serious injustice when we fail to provide our \nFederal courts with the resources it needs. Let us end this shutdown \nnow so we can do what we were elected to do and carry out business on \nbehalf of the American people.\n  Let me tell my colleagues another thing that has happened. This \nafternoon, I got a call from the chief judge of the District of \nVermont, the Federal district court. She wanted me to know they are \ngoing to run out of funds on Thursday. She is very worried about the \ngrowing opiate crisis in Vermont. If the courts run out of money, they \nare not going to be able to monitor and test those awaiting trials in \nserious drug trafficking cases.\n  Judge Reiss made it very clear that we are going to hear this from \ncourts all over the country. We forget there are things our courts have \nto do and should do to keep the Presiding Officer safer and me safer, \nas well as everybody else. But we are saying, sorry, we are having this \nlittle political snit and we are not going to give you the money.\n  I have always been proud of being a member of the Vermont bar. I have \nbeen proud of that membership during the time I was in private practice \nand during the time I was a prosecutor, but throughout it all, we \nalways relied on the courts to do their work. We expected that if after \nGideon v. Wainwright it was necessary to appoint counsel for a criminal \ndefendant, the counsel would be there. We expected that if one had a \ncase they wanted heard, there would be a court that could hear it. That \nis not going to happen. We are going to have criminal cases that are \ngoing to get backed up because we don't have the personnel there, and \nbehind those criminal cases are going to be people--Republicans, \nDemocrats, Independents--who are going to have legitimate civil cases \nthat they need to bring to court to be resolved and they are not going \nto be heard for years and years and years.\n  Some of the handful of ideologues who are holding up our ability to \nfund the government go down and have a disturbing and disgraceful rally \non the Mall, where they ridicule the President of the United States. \nThey distort their own roles in how they closed down the government, \nand then they try to use brave veterans as pawns, do they know what \nthey are doing to the image of the United States?\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Illinois on the floor. One of \nthese judges is from his state. I don't know if he wishes to speak.\n  I would say once more, all Americans who rely on our court and our \njudicial system know our system of justice is facing a great danger not \nbecause of anything the courts have done but because of a small group \nof ideologues in the House of Representatives who are holding this \nbudget hostage.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I ask unanimous consent to yield back all remaining \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Hearing no further debate, the question is, \nWill the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Andrea R. Wood, \nof Illinois, to be United States District Judge for the Northern \nDistrict of Illinois?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is, \nWill the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Madeline Hughes \nHaikala, of Alabama, to be United States District Judge for the \nNorthern District of Alabama?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, if I may echo the remarks of the \nmajority leader, we had a good day yesterday. We had another good day \ntoday. I think it is safe to say we have made substantial progress, and \nwe look forward to making more progress in the near future.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would just close by saying this: We are \ndoing our best to make everybody happy, but everyone knows we are not \ngoing to be able to do that.
