Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3204) was ordered to a third reading and was read the \nthird time.\n\n\n                        Animal Drug Compounding\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I wish to thank Mr. Alexander for \nhis work on this legislation. I am happy to see that all sides have \nbeen able to reach an agreement on clarifying the oversight of large \ncompounding facilities, while also ensuring that patients continue to \nhave access to customized medicines at their local pharmacy. I am \ngrateful to the chairman and ranking member for clarifying that the \nintent of this legislation is to maintain current law with respect to \npatients' and physicians' access to drugs compounded for office use. I \nam also very encouraged that we are finally moving forward on creating \na uniform national standard for the pharmaceutical supply chain, which \nwill allow patients to have more confidence in the safety of the drugs \nthey receive while also ensuring that national distributors and third-\nparty logistics providers do not face the burden of dealing with a \nconfusing and inconsistent patchwork of State-by-State rules.\n  I would like to take a moment to discuss an issue that is not \ndirectly addressed in the bill before us. I have heard from my \nconstituents that there are serious problems, similar to the ones we \nare seeking to address today, with the inappropriate compounding of \nanimal drugs. As with human drugs, mass production of compounded animal \ndrugs with inadequate safety standards has resulted in suffering and \ndeath.\n  While the compounding of animal drugs according to a prescription \nfrom a veterinarian for an individual patient is legal, necessary, and \nappropriate, it is important to draw a line between compounding and \nmanufacturing. I am especially troubled by reports that some entities \ncharacterizing themselves as ``compounding pharmacies'' are producing \nlarge quantities of animal drugs that are essentially copies of FDA-\napproved products. They are then mass-marketed as cheap alternatives to \napproved products, without being subject to any of the safety \nrequirements and quality controls that manufacturers must comply with.\n  As with human drugs, the FDA has had mixed success in taking \nenforcement action against questionable or abusive animal drug \ncompounding practices. While I understand that animal drug compounding \nraises complicated issues that the bill before us does not address, I \nwant to make it clear that the absence of animal drug provisions in \nthis legislation does not constitute an endorsement of the status quo. \nI hope that in the months ahead, Congress can begin to investigate the \nissues surrounding animal drug compounding in more depth, with an eye \ntoward spurring the FDA to make this a higher enforcement priority.\n\n[[Page S8072]]\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I agree that there are issues \nassociated with animal drug compounding that should be examined. This \nbill does not change the current animal drug regulatory structure, and \nit is my hope that FDA would exercise its current enforcement \nauthorities, as well as work with State pharmacy boards, to ensure that \nthe law is being followed with respect to animal drug compounding, \nincluding compounding from bulk chemicals and the copying of approved \ndrugs. In addition, Congress should utilize its oversight authorities \nto ensure that the agency acts accordingly. I plan to work with my \ncolleagues in the Senate and the House to ask the Government \nAccountability Office to look at compounding of animal drugs.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I thank the chairman, and I look forward to working with \nhim.\n\n\n                       Access to Compounded Drugs\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I have been working very hard with \nSenator Harkin, members of the HELP Committee, and members of the House \nEnergy and Commerce Committee on legislation to provide options for \npatients and providers who want compounded drugs made in FDA-regulated \nfacilities. As we debate this bill today, I want to make clear that all \ninvolved on this legislation have no intent of limiting patient or \nprovider access to quality compounded drugs that fill a clinical need.\n  The process in the HELP Committee began as soon as news of the \noutbreak broke in Tennessee, and I cannot thank enough the folks at the \nTennessee Department of Health, including Dr. Kainer, for all their \ngood work that prevented so many further cases and lives being \ndestroyed.\n  We have been working very hard to reach an agreement on how \ncompounding should be regulated--and we have come a long way. \nStakeholders including pharmacists, public health groups, and the FDA, \nhave been sitting around a table to find a consensus solution. We have \nmade good progress, and I want to talk about this legislation.\n  For traditional pharmacy, currently regulated under 503A of the Food, \nDrug, and Cosmetic Act, we strike the provisions found unconstitutional \nby the Supreme Court related to marketing.\n  In addition, and what will help prevent another New England \nCompounding Center, NECC, the Drug Quality and Security Act establishes \na completely separate and distinct section 503B that authorizes FDA to \nregulate an optional category for larger compounding facilities. \nSterile compounding facilities that do not want to comply with the \npatchwork of State laws and requirements can choose instead to have FDA \nregulate their compounding. 503B establishes rigorous quality \nstandards, registration, adverse event reporting, inspections, and \nfees. If there are unintended consequences to this legislation, I stand \nready to work with my colleagues and provide necessary oversight.\n  It has been almost 10 years since the Supreme Court decision that \nleft a great deal of uncertainty in the regulation of pharmacy \ncompounding. We clarify that 503A applies nationwide, and create an FDA \nregulated source for sterile compounded drugs. Nothing in the \nlegislation is intended to limit access to quality compounded drugs for \nproviders and patients or alter the practice of medicine but, rather, \ncreate a whole new alternative for safe sources of sterile compounded \ndrugs that are held to a nationwide quality standard. The legislation \ndoes not change current law on office use compounding or repackaging.\n  Chairman Harkin will discuss the importance of this language, and I \nthank him for working with me so hard on this over the last year.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as Senator Alexander has indicated, we \nhave been working together for a long time to develop legislation that \nwill ensure that patients have access to the compounded drug products \nthey need and that they can have greater confidence that their \ncompounded drugs are safe. We ultimately landed on a package that \npreserves current law for traditional compounders but creates a new \noption for entities that choose to operate outside the bounds of \ntraditional pharmacy practice to allow them to serve as safe sources of \nthe compounded drugs that providers and their patients need.\n  We have worked very hard to craft a proposal that preserves patient \naccess to clinically necessary medications while helping to ensure that \nproviders have access to safe sources of compounded drugs. As Senator \nAlexander noted, section 503A of the current Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act governs traditional compounding. This bill preserves \ncurrent 503A but removes the unconstitutional advertising provisions so \n503A is the uniform policy nationwide.\n  Similarly, we do not change current law regarding repackaging or \nbiologics. The Senate bill established a new regulatory regime for \nrepackaging and biologics, but ultimately, after our bipartisan, \nbicameral discussions, we made no changes to current law on those \nsubjects nor do we change current law on the compounding of animal \ndrugs. The existing restrictions on animal drug compounding have not \nbeen rigorously enforced. We will be asking GAO to take a closer look \nat the laws regulating animal compounding because we weren't able to \naddress it in this package.\n  This bill also creates an entirely new source of quality compounded \ndrugs. It permits entities that want to serve as outsourcers for \nentities that need large volumes of clinically necessary compounded \ndrugs to provide those drugs, as long as they register with FDA and pay \na registration fee, adhere to high quality standards, submit to FDA \ninspection, and tell the agency if adverse events occur.\n  I recognize that many patients need drugs that are not available from \npharmaceutical manufacturers, and I have no interest in cutting off \npatients' access to those drugs. But I do want to ensure that when \npatients do need a compounded drug, it is safe. By ensuring that \ncurrent law--FDCA section 503A--applies nationwide and creating a new \nsafe source of outsourced drugs, this bill should enhance patients' \nability to get the drugs they need without having to worry about their \nsafety.\n\n\n                          Practice of Medicine\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wish to express support moving forward \nwith the Drug Quality and Security Act but want to express my concern \nthat this legislation should not be used by the FDA to interfere with a \ndoctor's ability to practice medicine and choose the best therapy for \nhis or her patients. Patients have allergies, conditions, and diseases \non an individual basis. So often drugs in the form made by \nmanufacturers are not the best option for an individual patient's \nneeds, especially in some specialties such as ophthalmology. A varying \nstrength or dose may need to be made by the pharmacy and many States \nhave laws permitting physician compounding as well.\n  I understand and have received assurances from my colleague Senator \nAlexander that limiting access to necessary treatments by providers and \npatients was not the intent of this legislation and look forward to \nworking with him should any unintended consequences arise.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank my friend Dr. Coburn for his \nremarks, concern, and assistance with this legislation. I agree with \nhim, and want to clarify that nothing in this legislation will \nconstrain a doctor's options to practice medicine. The legislation \ntries to ensure that if a doctor or patient needs access to compounded \ndrugs, that there is an FDA-regulated source for those drugs where the \nquality standards are uniform nationwide. Doctors know their patients \nbest and should have access to accurate information on the safety and \nquality of the drugs they use.\n  If there are unintended consequences to this legislation, I stand \nready to work with my colleagues and provide necessary oversight.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the Drug \nQuality and Security Act and also to thank the members and staff who \nhave worked with us to reach an agreement and pass this bill. The \nlegislation addresses the current ambiguity around the regulation of \ncompounding pharmacies, one of which is tied to more than 60 deaths. It \nalso establishes a workable system to get to unit level tracing of the \nnearly 4 billion prescriptions filled a year in the U.S. within a \ndecade. In addition to bipartisan support in Congress, the bill enjoys \nbroad support from the biomedical industry,\n\n[[Page S8073]]\n\npatient groups, consumer groups, and other stakeholders.\n  Over a year ago, staff began to work on identifying the cause and \npossible solutions to help prevent another meningitis outbreak. A group \nof staff from Republican and Democratic offices on the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee began a series of standing \nmeetings and proceeded to meet every week for several months. They met \nwith stakeholders and discussed policy solutions that each member \nthought would solve the problem. After much discussion of the benefits, \ncosts, and possible unintended consequences, members agreed to a list \nof policy concepts. That bill, S. 959, is a strong bill, and was voted \nout of committee unanimously. While I believe our Senate bill was a \nstronger solution, it would not have gotten through the Chamber on the \nother side of the Capitol.\n  We held bipartisan and bicameral meetings throughout August to try to \nfind a consensus that could pass both Chambers, and that legislation is \nwhat you see before you. Is it perfect? No, but I believe it is a good \nfirst step and a market-driven solution to this terrible tragedy.\n  I would like to thank Senator Harkin for his tireless work on this \nbill, along with Chairman Upton and Ranking Member Waxman of the Energy \nand Commerce Committee. Senator Harkin's staff has also worked \ntirelessly on this bipartisan bill. They worked many late evenings, \nlong weekends, and through countless discussions to get the bill to \nwhere it is today.\n  Specifically, I want to recognize and thank Jenelle Krishnamoorthy, \nElizabeth Jungman, and Nathan Brown. I also want to thank Pam Smith, \nSenator Harkin's staff director, for her leadership in getting this \nbill to the finish line.\n  I also would like to thank Jennifer Boyer with Senator Roberts and \nHannah Katch with Senator Franken for all their help as well.\n  Senators Bennet and Burr were instrumental in the drug tracing title \non which they have been working for almost 2 years. Rohini Kosoglu with \nSenator Bennet and Anna Abram and Margaret Coulter with Senator Burr \nworked very hard to craft this section, and I would like to thank them, \ntoo. I would also like to thank our Senate legislative counsels Stacy \nKern Scherer and Kim Tamber, and from the Congressional Budget Office \nJulia Christensen, Jean Hearne and Ellen Werble.\n  Finally, I would like to thank my staff--Grace Stuntz, and my Health \nPolicy Director, Mary-Sumpter Lapiniski. I also want to thank my staff \ndirector, David Cleary, for his work on this bill. My staff has been \nworking around the clock for many days and weeks, and I sincerely \nappreciate their dedication to getting this bill passed.\n  I know Members are pulled in many different directions and there is \nalways a lot of work to complete. We have a bipartisan bill that we \nbelieve will pass the Senate later today and passed the House on \nSaturday, September 28th, that takes a big step in addressing the \nregulation of compounded drugs and preventing counterfeit, stolen, and \nsubstandard drugs from reaching consumers. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this compromise.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, more than a year ago we witnessed the \nfatal New England Compounding Center meningitis outbreak. The Food and \nDrug Administration failed to pursue enforcement action against NECC, \ndespite clear warning signs. Moreover, the Massachusetts Board of \nPharmacy did not do its job. It failed to provide basic oversight. This \ninaction allowed a criminal compounder to operate with impunity--ending \nthe lives of many Americans.\n  In contrast, the Arkansas Board of Pharmacy is competent and \nthorough. It does a great job. Arkansas regularly inspects all \npharmacies. We are a small State, but we run a tight ship.\n  However, Arkansas has no way of knowing whether other State pharmacy \nboards are doing their job.\n  We need to take steps to protect patients from precarious, poorly \ninspected, out-of-State drugs. However, I want to make clear of \nsomething before we move on this legislation.\n  The practice of pharmacy, including pharmacy compounding, is a State \nissue. Nothing in this law changes that. Compounded drugs for office-\nuse is a State issue. Nothing in this law changes that. Commonplace \ndrug repackaging for drugs--like Avastin--is a State issue. I relied on \ncompounders regularly when I practiced in a surgery center. Office-use \ncompounding and repackaging is acceptable under Arkansas law. Nothing \nin this law changes that.\n  The omission of office-use from section 503(a) of the Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act should not signal to the FDA that it has the authority to \nencroach upon State authority to regulate office-use. This is not the \nintent of the law, and I will closely monitor FDA implementation as \nthis process moves forward.\n  If the State of Minnesota wants to prohibit drug repackaging and \ncompounding--that is its decision. But again, this law is by no means a \ngreen light for the FDA to usurp the rights of States. I want to make \nthat crystal clear.\n  Lastly, contrary to much of what has been said, compounders have \nreally stepped up to assist providers in need. Today, America faces a \nserious drug shortage problem. Sterile injectable generic drugs \nconstitute 80 percent of the drugs in short supply.\n  Not surprisingly, government pricing caps have caused these \nshortages. Thankfully, compound pharmacists in Arkansas and across the \ncountry have been meeting critical market needs that manufacturers have \nbeen unable to satisfy. Compounders have helped address supply chain \ngaps and sudden spikes in demand--particularly in rural and neglected \nareas. They have plugged holes in the system, and they have tended to \noverlooked markets.\n  Without compounders, doctors would not perform surgeries. Without \ncompounders, oncologists would be forced to administer alternative \nchemotherapy drugs. Without compounders, patients would suffer from \nlimited access. These are real issues and real problems, and we must \ntake these realities into consideration. I look forward to working with \nall stakeholders to ensure commonsense compounding, repackaging, and \noffice-use administration of compounded drugs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Senate is poised to pass legislation \naimed at strengthening the safety of compounded pharmaceuticals and the \nsecurity of the drug supply chain. It has been more than 1 year since \nthe public became aware of what quickly became a far reaching fungal \nmeningitis outbreak affecting citizens in 20 States, including my home \nState of Michigan. Following an investigation by the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration, \nalong with local health departments, it became clear the outbreak was \ncaused by contaminated steroid injections produced by the now defunct \nNew England Compounding Center, NECC, a compounding pharmacy in \nFramingham, MA. This tragedy brought a spotlight to bear on the opaque \nregulation of mass compounding pharmacies.\n  According to the CDC, over 750 people from across the United States \nwere affected by tainted pain steroid injections produced by NECC. \nVictims numbering 264, more than one third of the hundreds made \nseverely ill from contaminated injections, reside in Michigan. Sixty-\nfour of the victims lost their life as a result of illness, including \n19 Michiganians. While it is certainly important that we clarify \nFederal regulatory responsibilities to help ensure similar tragedies \nare not repeated in the future, we could have begun debate on a \nsolution far earlier. A legislative response is surely long overdue.\n  Colleagues on both sides of the aisle and the Capitol have worked \nthrough this issue to produce a bill that will both strengthen Federal \nauthority to regulate mass-compounding facilities and will lay the \ngroundwork for a nationwide system to track prescription drugs. While \nnot as far reaching as some may have initially intended, the bill we \nare considering does represent an important and necessary step forward \nand was unanimously passed by the House of Representatives in \nSeptember.\n  It is important to draw a distinction, as this bill does, between so-\ncalled traditional compounding--where a pharmacist tailors a particular \ndrug to meet the unique needs of a patient, such as removing a certain \ndye or altering the dosage level of an adult\n\n[[Page S8074]]\n\nmedication to be suitable for a child--and the mass compounding of \ndrugs for wholesale distribution. Compounding pharmacists have long \nbeen regulated by State boards of pharmacy. However, as was made clear \nin the investigation that followed the meningitis outbreak, NECC, a \nmass compounding pharmacy, was operating in a regulatory gray area \nwhere neither the State nor Federal Government took full responsibility \nfor ensuring their facility and compounding practices were safe and \nsterile.\n  The Drug Quality and Security Act aims to address this regulatory \ngray area by clarifying the responsibilities of the FDA with regard to \nthe oversight of mass compounded pharmaceuticals. Specifically, it \nfurther defines the distinction between traditional compounding and \ncompounding manufacturers that make large volumes of drugs without \nindividual prescriptions.\n  Under this bill, mass compounding pharmacies can choose to register \nas outsourcing facilities that would be subject to new FDA regulatory \noversight similar to that of other pharmaceutical manufactures. And, in \nan effort to provide patients with better information about compounded \ndrugs, this legislation calls for detailed labeling of compounded drugs \nand directs the FDA to make available on their website a list of FDA-\nregulated facilities. Importantly, this legislation also will implement \na new system for tracking drugs from the manufacturer to the pharmacy \nin an effort to ensure accountability at every step along the way. This \nnew system will replace the current State tracing laws with a uniform \nstandard and also will establish nationwide drug serial numbers to \nallow for efficient tracing.\n  While this legislation will not compensate those who have been harmed \nor bring back those who we have lost, I am hopeful it will help to \nensure Americans are not faced with a similarly tragic, avoidable \nsituation in the future. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting \nfinal passage of this important legislation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, hundreds of people in Virginia were \nsickened and 2 died from an outbreak of fungal meningitis last year \nthat was traced to a single compounding pharmacy in Massachusetts. \nHundreds more in several States became sick, and dozens perished. This \npublic health crisis highlighted the critical need for better oversight \nof pharmacies that are producing compounded drugs.\n  The Compounding Quality Act and Drug Supply Chain Security Act, which \nthe Senate will consider for final passage today, includes important \nprovisions that ensures that patients and providers have access to safe \ncompounded drugs.\n  This legislation also includes important provisions that deal with \nhow to better monitor and track the drug distribution supply chain. It \nimproves on patient safety by developing a workable pathway that will \nultimately result in tracing for the entire country. Additionally, it \nstrengthens licensure requirements for wholesale distributions and \nthird-party logistics providers, and establishes nationwide drug serial \nnumbers. Finally, this legislation works to address the growing problem \nof pharmaceutical theft, counterfeiting and diversion. The Compounding \nQuality Act and Drug Supply Chain Security Act is the most significant \npiece of legislation on drug distribution supply chain in 25 years.\n  I am appreciative of Senators Harkin, Alexander, and all members of \nthe Health, Education, Labor and Pension committees for their tireless \nwork on putting together these smart, bipartisan provisions which will \nhelp improve the lives of countless Virginians and Americans.\n  I offer my strong support to the Compounding Quality Act and Drug \nSupply Chain Security Act, and encourage its swift passage.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am proud today to support the Drug \nQuality and Security Act because it marks an important step forward in \nprotecting the safety and integrity of our Nation's drug supply. \nCalifornia has been a leader in addressing this issue and played a key \nrole in creating a solution.\n  Patients deserve peace of mind when it comes to purchasing drugs. \nWhen a parent walks into a pharmacy to pick up a prescription for a \nsick child, she should be confident that the drugs she is picking up \nare safe and have not been tampered with. What is perhaps not known to \nmany people, however, is that in today's drug supply system, there is \nno standard process for oversight to trace drugs through the supply \nchain system and make sure they were in the right hands and properly \nstored the whole time.\n  We hear occasionally about infected or counterfeit drugs. These are \nshocking stories. Last year, New England Compounding Center, or NECC, a \ncompounding manufacturer from Framingham, MA, produced contaminated \nmedicine that sickened over 750 people all across the country. I'm very \nsad to say that 64 people have died, needlessly, because of these \ncontaminated drugs.\n  A report by the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, HELP, \nCommittee from earlier this year found that NECC was known to produce \ndrugs that were mislabeled, did not contain the correct dosage of \nactive ingredients and were made using equipment that was not properly \nsterilized.\n  You might think that a story like this is rare. What we have learned \nis that it is not. The report by the HELP Committee found that in the 8 \nmonths immediately after the outbreak caused by NECC-manufactured \ndrugs, 48 other compounding companies were found to be producing drugs \nthat were either unsafe or were made in unsafe environments.\n  The problems do not stop with the manufacturers. People often do not \nrealize that drugs do not usually travel directly from a manufacturer \nto a pharmacist. In fact, they may make many stops along the way. \nManufacturers, resellers, wholesalers, distributors--these are some of \nthe entities that can receive, resell and ship drugs before they get to \nthe pharmacist or patient. At any time in the delivery process, there \nis opportunity for counterfeit drugs to enter the supply chain or real \ndrugs to be diverted for illegitimate uses.\n  In 2009, for example, 129,000 vials of insulin were stolen. These \nvials later reappeared and were then sold to pharmacies and hospitals. \nWe do not know who was handling these vials after they were stolen, or \nif they were stored under appropriate conditions--a real threat to \npatients.\n  This bill does the following:\n  First, it establishes a comprehensive, electronic, interoperable \nframework for tracing the distribution history of every individual unit \nthat passes through the drug supply chain. The effect of this part of \nthe bill is to establish a ``chain of custody'' or ``pedigree'' for \neach prescription drug dispensed to patients. Should a drug be \ndiverted, this ``chain of custody'' will provide important information \nto Federal regulators when counterfeit drugs are detected in the supply \nchain.\n  Second, it clearly distinguishes the scope of what constitutes the \ntraditional pharmacy practice of drug compounding from those, like \nNECC, who seek to exploit a patchwork of current Federal laws and \nregulations to produce large quantities of unsafe drug products under \nthe guise of compounding.\n  I am proud that California has led the Nation in taking real steps to \naddress the issue of pharmaceutical supply chain safety.\n  In fact, California passed a law to require more oversight of the \ndrug supply chain in 2004. Since then, the State Board of Pharmacy and \nState legislators have worked together with representatives from \nindustry to perfect the law.\n  This action by California has been a key influence in drafting \nlanguage on the Federal level. The Board of Pharmacy has provided many \nhours of technical assistance and has really been a team player. I \ncommend the hard work of Chairman Harkin, Ranking Member Alexander, and \nhis predecessor Senator Enzi, as well as Senators Bennet and Burr and \ntheir staff who have worked tirelessly to bring this legislation to the \nfinish line. Many stakeholders were involved in drafting this \nbipartisan, bicameral solution that addresses the issue of substandard \nmanufacturing practices and drug supply chain safety.\n  This is a remarkable step toward improved safety of medicine that \nAmericans rely on every day.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, we worked to ensure that the Drug Quality \nand\n\n[[Page S8075]]\n\nSecurity Act achieves a balanced approach to strengthen the safety, \nsecurity and accountability of our Nation's pharmaceutical drug supply \nchain. This legislation establishes a uniform electronic unit-level \nsystem over the next decade that will increase security and ensure a \nsafer pharmaceutical drug supply chain from manufacturers to \ndispensers. The charitable distribution of prescription drugs from the \nmanufacturer to patients through patient assistance programs, PAPs, is \na valuable and unique approach to providing American patients access to \ncritical, lifesaving medicines. As this legislation is implemented, the \nvaried and unique approaches of PAPs should be taken into consideration \nto ensure patients who access needed treatments through these effective \nprograms are able to continue accessing the prescription drug \nmedications provided through PAPs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on passage of the bill.\n  The bill (H.R. 3204) was passed.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, today the Senate passed the Drug \nQuality and Security Act. I am proud to have worked together with \nChairman Harkin, Ranking Member Alexander, and all of the Senators on \nthe HELP Committee from both sides of the aisle over several months to \ndevelop this law, which will create commonsense oversight of the \npharmaceutical compounding industry and the pharmaceutical supply \nchain.\n  Some politicians use the word ``regulation'' as if it were a curse. \nCertainly no one wants bad regulations or over regulation, but the \nimpact of failing to regulate when public safety is at risk can be \ndangerous and even deadly.\n  We have an example just how deadly right in front of us--and an \nexample of what happens when Congress fails to regulate. It starts with \ncompounding pharmacies.\n  Compounding pharmacies serve individual patients who need specialized \ndrugs. Without these customized products, some of our most vulnerable \npatients would not be able to get the precisely formulated medications \nthey need. But customers have no way to evaluate the safety or purity \nor cleanliness of the compounded medications they receive. That is what \nregulations are for.\n  For too long, bad actors in this industry have taken advantage of lax \nState enforcement and confusion about Federal regulations. The \nconsequences of too little regulation and too little enforcement were \nbrought into sharp focus last year when a compounding pharmacy in \nMassachusetts, the New England Compounding Center, was identified as \nthe source of a widespread fungal meningitis outbreak that sickened 751 \npeople and killed 64. I wish NECC were an isolated case, but companies \nlike it have engaged in shoddy practices for years practices that have \ncaused sickness and injuries and even death.\n  There have been many attempts to fix the law and require FDA \noversight in this area. In 2007 Senator Kennedy worked with Senator \nRoberts to develop bipartisan legislation that would have addressed \nthis issue. If that effort had succeeded, we might have been able to \nspare many people great suffering. Sixty-four people from just one \nincident would probably be alive today. But the industry lobbyists beat \nback their efforts. The result? People got sick and people died.\n  This issue is of particular importance to Massachusetts, and I am \nproud to have worked with my colleagues on the HELP Committee \nthroughout my first year in the Senate to shape earlier versions of \nthis legislation. Throughout the bipartisan development process and the \npublic hearings and votes in the HELP Committee, I pushed for a bill \nthat would subject compounding pharmacies to strong FDA oversight. \nThose efforts, and negotiations with the House of Representatives, have \nproduced the Drug Quality and Security Act. The bill strengthens \ncurrent law and establishes tough, new regulations that will keep us \nall safer.\n  The compounding provisions of this bill are not the final word in \nwhat is needed. I believe the FDA should have more authority to inspect \nthe records of compounding pharmacies, and we have included in the bill \na GAO study that will assess the impact and effectiveness of this new \nlaw and tell us if more work is needed. But this bill is big step \nforward in making people safer, so I support it strongly.\n  This legislation has another feature that will help make drugs safer. \nIt creates an important new oversight system to ensure we have a secure \nsupply chain for our pharmaceutical products. Today, we can track a \ngallon of milk in the grocery store all the way back to its producer, \nbut we can't verify the origins of a prescription drug on the shelves \nof our pharmacies. Counterfeit or illegally imported drugs can be \nintegrated into the supply chain, and currently there is no detection \nmechanism. This bill ensures that we can trace a particular drug from \nits manufacturer all the way to the pharmacy. It will allow consumers \nto buy prescription medications with greater confidence that the drugs \nare safe, legal, and free of counterfeit or substandard ingredients. It \nwill allow patients to have greater confidence that the pills in the \nbottle from the pharmacy are exactly what their doctors have ordered--\nnothing more and nothing less.\n  I commend my colleagues for stepping up to the challenge and showing \nthat it is possible for Congress to do what is right--pass commonsense \nreforms that protect patients and consumers from harm. This is one of \nthe basic functions of government: making sure that markets work by \nensuring that no one cuts corners that the customer can't see or that \nput someone's family at risk. When all the manufacturers have to follow \nthe same standards of cleanliness, when all of them have to account for \nwhere they got the chemicals they used in their products, the playing \nfield is level and the customer is free to make good, independent \ndecisions. This is how government should work--through actions to \nimprove public health and public safety through smart, fair, and \nreasonable regulations that will improve the lives of all Americans. I \nhope that the Drug Quality and Security Act will do just that. I am \nproud to support it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today, with final passage of the Drug \nQuality and Security Act, we have helped to ensure the safety of \ncompounded drug products and secure the pharmaceutical supply chain. We \nhave clarified the law governing traditional compounding and created a \nnew source of high-quality compounded products for hospitals and other \nproviders who need large volumes of compounded drugs. We have also set \nin motion a revolution in the distribution of pharmaceuticals--within a \ndecade we will know exactly how our drug products travel through the \noften-complicated distribution system so that we can identify \ncounterfeit and adulterated drugs before they get into American \nmedicine cabinets.\n  By passing the Drug Quality and Security Act, we have taken an \nimportant step to improve American families' access to lifesaving drugs \nand medical devices.\n  The bipartisan process that produced this bill has been quite \nremarkable. I have worked closely with my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle and both sides of the Capitol, as well as industry \nstakeholders, patient groups, and consumer groups, to solicit ideas and \nimprovements on the critical provisions in this bill. We have a better \nproduct thanks to everyone's input.\n  I would like to extend a special thank you to my colleague, Ranking \nMember Alexander. I have been working with Senator Alexander on this \nsince he became ranking member, and it has been a wonderful and \ncooperative partnership. I can honestly say that we would not have \ngotten this done without his excellent leadership and wise council. I \nthank the Senator.\n  I also thank all of the HELP Committee members, as well as members \noff the committee and their staff, who were thoroughly engaged with \nthis process from the beginning as part of the bipartisan working \ngroups. Each of you has contributed significantly to this legislation, \nand I am sincerely grateful for your contributions.\n  On that note, I specifically thank the staff of Ranking Member \nAlexander's office. I thank David Cleary, Mary-Sumpter Lapinski, and \nGrace Stuntz. I\n\n[[Page S8076]]\n\nalso thank Hannah Katch from Senator Franken's staff, Rohini Kosoglu \nfrom Senator Bennet's staff, Jennifer Boyer from Senator Roberts staff, \nand Anna Abram and Margaret Coulter from Senator Burr's staff. I know \nthat they have developed close working relationships with my staff \nthroughout this process, and I am sincerely grateful for your dedicated \nefforts.\n  I also thank my own staff on the HELP Committee, who have spent many \na night and weekend with Senator Alexander's staff, other member \noffices, and our colleagues in the House working to come to consensus \non the critical policy issues in this legislation. I thank Pam Smith, \nJenelle Krishnamoorthy, Elizabeth Jungman, Nathan Brown, Emily \nSchlichting, Allison Preiss, Kate Frischmann, Abraham White, Jim \nWhitmire, Chung Shek, Frank Zhang and Evan Griffis.\n  We would be remiss if we did not also thank the Congressional Budget \nOffice for their knowledgeable and capable team that dedicated many \nhours to estimating the budgetary effects of this legislation. Finally, \nwe owe an enormous debt of gratitude to the staff members in the \nLegislative Counsel's Office--specifically Kim Tamber, Stacy Kern-\nSheerer, and Bill Baird. They, too, worked long hours, nights, and \nweekends to assist my staff in drafting this legislation and working \nout technical issues.\n  This bill's final passage is a victory for the millions of Americans \nwho need safe medicines--a victory that would not have been possible \nwithout the dedicated work of our Senate family. I thank you all for \nyour extraordinary public service.\n\n\n                     Welcoming Back Senator Inhofe\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I see our friend here who has returned from \nhis surgery and the death of his son, if he wishes to say something \nbefore I complete my remarks.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the majority leader should go ahead. My \nremarks will be longer.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, through the Chair to the senior Senator from \nOklahoma, we are glad to have him back. We all empathize with something \nonly a parent can understand. I am grateful to him for the example he \nsets for all of us.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. President, we are going to be in a period of morning business \nuntil 5 o'clock today. Following morning business, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the nomination of Robert \nWilkins to be U.S. Circuit judge for the DC Circuit. At 5:30, there \nwill be up to two rollcall votes, including cloture on the Wilkins \nnomination. If cloture is not invoked, there will be a second cloture \nvote on the Defense authorization bill.\n\n\n                              Nominations\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today the Senate will consider yet another \nqualified nominee to be a DC Circuit Court of Appeals judge, considered \nby many to be the second highest court in all the land.\n  It is troubling that Senate Republicans, for the fourth time this \nyear, appear poised to reject an exceedingly capable nominee to this \ncourt for blatantly political reasons. Republicans have blocked three \nhighly qualified female DC Circuit nominees in a row: Caitlin Halligan, \nPatricia Millett, and Nina Pillard. Today they are expected to block \nconfirmation of District Judge Robert Wilkins, an extremely competent \nand experienced nominee and one who has bipartisan support. I say that \nbecause no one has questioned his qualifications or abilities; \nlikewise, no Senator objected to the qualifications of Ms. Halligan, \nMs. Millett or Ms. Pillard. Instead, Republicans have blocked these \nnominees solely to deny President Obama his constitutional right to \nappoint judges.\n  In years passed, my Republican colleagues agreed to block judicial \nnominees only in ``extraordinary circumstances.'' These are their \nwords, not mine.\n  In 2005, the senior Senator from South Carolina Lindsey Graham \ndefined extraordinary circumstances for the benefit of this body. Being \na highly qualified trial lawyer, I think he is qualified to respond and \nset this definition that we all agreed with. Here is what he said:\n\n       Ideological attacks are not an ``extraordinary \n     circumstance.'' To me, it would have to be a character \n     problem, an ethics problem, some allegation about the \n     qualifications of a person, not an ideological bent.\n\n  No Senator--I repeat, no Senator--has questioned the character, \nethics, or qualifications of these three women that have already been \nrejected for the DC Circuit. No one has questioned the character, \nethics or qualifications of Judge Wilkins. So I am frustrated that \nRepublicans would once again filibuster such a highly qualified \nnominee--a nominee so highly qualified, in fact, that he was confirmed \n3 years ago by voice vote to become a district court judge.\n  Judge Wilkins is an Indiana native who graduated cum laude with a \ndegree in chemical engineering, and then he got a law degree from \nHarvard Law School. He has worked as a staff attorney for the DC Public \nDefender Service. He was a partner specializing in white-collar \ndefense, intellectual property, and complex civil litigation at the \nprivate law firm of Venable. That is an outstanding law firm with \nlawyers all over the country.\n  Judge Wilkins also helped shine a national spotlight on national \nprofiling when he brought a landmark lawsuit against the Maryland State \nPolice in 1992 after he and three family members were stopped and \nsearched. Why? Because they were African Americans. It is landmark \nlitigation.\n  This nominee has a bright legal mind and a remarkable dedication to \nthe rule of law. Under normal circumstances, such as the circumstances \nof his 2010 confirmation, he would be quickly confirmed, but now he \nfaces a Republican filibuster. Unfortunately, the type of Republican \nobstruction we face today has become quite commonplace. President \nObama's circuit court nominees, including nominees for the vital DC \nCircuit, have waited seven times longer than those nominated by \nPresident Bush.\n  Republicans claim they are blocking nominees to this crucial court \nbecause the court is underworked and doesn't need to fill its \ncomplement of judges. Republicans also claim that filling these three \nvacancies would amount to court packing. That is absurd on its face. My \nRepublican colleagues were happy to confirm four Bush nominees to this \ncourt. In fact, 15 of the last 19 to the DC Circuit were appointed by \nRepublican presidents. Appointing judges to fill vacant judicial seats \nis not court packing, it is the President's right as well as his duty.\n  I do not ask Republican Senators to support President Obama's \nnominees or even that they vote for them, but it is right and proper \nthat they should give President Obama's nominees the same fair \nconsideration afforded the nominees that came before them.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  Would the Chair announce the business of the day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

So, \nthrough the Chair, I wish to thank Harry Reid very much for the \ncomments he made.\n\n[[Page S8077]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/18/senate-section/article/S8077-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8077-S8079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we have something coming up that we are \ngoing to be talking about this week, and I am a little disturbed \nbecause I don't know exactly when it is going to be coming up, and I \ndon't know how many objections there are going to be. I just know there \nare some people who want to delay, since it is a must-pass bill, the \nNational Defense Authorization Act. We have passed it every year for, I \nthink, 51 years. We have never failed to pass it. This is not going to \nbe the first year that we fail to pass it. But I am hoping our Members \nwill recognize how significant this is.\n  First of all, as the ranking member on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, I thank my colleague, the chairman of the committee, Senator \nLevin, for his leadership and for his cooperation, which we enjoyed \nduring the committee markup of this bill. We got it through the \ncommittee in pretty fast order. People realized there are some things \nthat had to be taken up on the floor--three very controversial issues. \nFine. This is where it should be taken up. It will be taken up. There \nwill be amendments I will strongly oppose and some I will support. But \nI have always considered the National Defense Authorization Act to be \nthe most important piece of legislation Congress considers each year.\n  This bill contains crucial authorizations that support our men and \nwomen in harm's way in Afghanistan and around the world. It supports \ntraining of our servicemembers and maintenance and modernization of \ntheir equipment to ensure they are prepared to overwhelm any adversary \nand return home safely to their loved ones. But--and this is a big \nbut--it does so only as the reduced defense spending will allow.\n  It authorizes research and development efforts that will ensure we \nmaintain technological superiority over our enemies and can \nsuccessfully defeat the threats of tomorrow. But, again, it does so \nonly--this is different; this has never happened before--when we are \nfacing a reduction in our military spending. It is so unacceptably low \nthat it has caused our leaders in all core services, which I will read \nin just a moment, to talk about how this is life-threatening.\n  But, most importantly, one thing we will continue to do is provide \nfor the pay and the benefits of the brave men and women who are in \nharm's way to defend this Nation. In an era increasingly defined by \npartisan gridlock, the NDAA--the National Defense Authorization Act--is \none of the rare occasions where Members of both parties can come \ntogether out of a shared commitment to our military men and women. This \nenduring commitment was exemplified this year again by the overwhelming \nbipartisan majority that supported the passage of the NDAA from the \ncommittee in June. I look forward to continuing this tradition and this \ncooperation until we get this bill passed.\n  Consideration of this year's NDAA comes at a pivotal moment for our \nnational security. The global security environment we face is more \nvolatile and dangerous than any other time in my memory or, I suggest, \nin the history of the country. Yet our ability to protect the country \nagainst these growing threats is at serious risk. After losing $487 \nbillion--that just came out of the defense budget through the first \n4\\1/2\\, 5 years of this administration--we now are looking at \nsequestration. Sequestration is an outcome thought to be so egregious \nand irresponsible that it would never be allowed to happen. None of us \nbelieved it would happen, that we would--after already losing $487 \nbillion from our defense system--have to be facing sequestration.\n  I never can say ``sequestration'' without reminding people why it is \nonly 18 percent of our budget goes to defending America. Yet they have \nbeen forced to endure 50 percent of the cuts. It is wrong. But, \nnonetheless, that is what has been happening over the last--it has been \nin effect for 8 months. Its drastic across-the-board cuts are \nexacerbating the effects of an already declining national security \nbudget.\n  As a result, the military is experiencing a dramatic decline in \nreadiness and capabilities. I have a chart in the Chamber.\n  General Odierno, the Chief of Staff of the Army, recently said that \nhis forces are at the--I am quoting now--``lowest readiness levels I've \nseen within our Army since I've been serving for the last 37 years'' \nand that only two brigades are ready for combat--only two brigades. \nThis is General Odierno.\n  The reason I wanted this chart put up is because it tells us where we \nare today. The part shown in orange, which is the huge cuts coming from \nsequestration, is far greater than the rest of it. That is readiness. \nThat is what we are talking about.\n  We do hear a lot about the cost of personnel and all of that, but \nthat is shown in the lower colored blue. So you are not talking about \nif you are able to do away with those actually coming up with any major \nreductions. The part shown in yellow is force structure. Now we are \ntalking about, as General Odierno said, being down to only two brigades \nthat are ready for combat. That is because of what has already been \nhappening in the last 8 months in the force structure.\n  The modernization is shown in green on the chart. Modernization is \nalways the first to be cut when force cuts come in because they figure \nthat is something you don't feel the pain of today. But I want you to \nconcentrate on the part shown in orange because that is where it really \nwould hurt us.\n  So we had General Odierno saying his forces were at the lowest \nreadiness levels he has seen in his 37 years in the U.S. Army. I was in \nthe Army many years ago, and I can remember back then when it always \nhad priority over everything. Defending America seemed to be the thing.\n  Admiral Greenert, Chief of Naval Operations, said:\n\n       . . . because of fiscal limitations and the situation we're \n     in we don't have another strike group trained and ready to \n     respond on short notice in case of a contingency. We're \n     tapped out.\n\n  That is our Navy.\n  Our top military leaders now warn of being unable to protect American \ninterests around the world. Admiral Winnefeld--he is the Vice Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the next-to-the-highest military person--\nsaid earlier this year: ``There could be, for the first time in my \ncareer, instances where we may be asked to respond to a crisis and we \nwill have to say we cannot.''\n  General Dempsey, the No. 1 military person, the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, has warned that continued national security cuts \nwill--and I am again quoting--``severely limit our ability to implement \nour defense strategy. It will put the nation at greater risk of \ncoercion, and it will break faith with the men and women in uniform.''\n  That is why I am so troubled by this disastrous path we are on. In \nthe face of mounting threats to America, prolonged budgetary \nuncertainties and the mindless sequestration cuts are crippling the \npeople who are vital to our security, our men and women in the \nmilitary.\n  To be clear, our military was facing readiness shortfalls even before \nsequestration took effect. Sequestration has only been in effect for 8 \nmonths. We never dreamed it would, after all the cuts we have gotten \nout of it from, quite frankly, this administration.\n  So the equipment, the problems we have--rather than rebuilding the \nability of our military to defend the country, we are digging ourselves \ndeeper into a hole. The longer we allow military readiness and \ncapabilities to decline, the more money and time it will take to \nrebuild.\n  We are falling victim to the misguided belief that as the wars of \ntoday wind down, we can afford to gut investments in our Nation's \ndefense. This is an irresponsible and dangerous course. I remember back \nduring the middle of the 1990s. They talked about a peace dividend at \nthat time. I can remember them saying: Well, the Cold War is over. We \nno longer need that strong of a military. Now, in this day and age, it \nis so much more serious than it has been in the past.\n  Our top military leaders agree. In testimony before the Armed \nServices Committee last week, General Amos--he is the Commandant of the \nMarine Corps--testified that if he is asked to respond to a contingency \nin the current budget environment--I am quoting--``we will have fewer \nforces arriving less-trained, arriving later to the fight. This would \ndelay the buildup\n\n[[Page S8078]]\n\nof combat power, allow the enemy more time to build its defenses, and \nwould likely prolong combat operations altogether. This a formula for \nmore American casualties.''\n  That is the Commandant of the Marine Corps.\n  Such an outcome would be immoral and a dereliction of duty. If we \nexpect the men and women of our military to go into harm's way to \nprotect America, we have an obligation to provide them with the \ntraining, technology, and capabilities required to decisively overwhelm \nany adversary at any time and return safely home to their loved ones. \nUnder this sequestration, we cannot do it. That is what we are talking \nabout right here when I say we are talking about our obligation to \nprovide the training, technology, and capabilities. That is shown in \nall that orange on the chart. That means that is what we are not going \nto do.\n  This is why ending sequestration and protecting the readiness of our \nmilitary men and women remains my top priority. However, something must \nbe done now to mitigate the devastating impacts to readiness until we \ncan find a long-term solution.\n  Again, I am just talking a little bit about the significance of \nhaving our Defense authorization bill come to the floor, get it \nstarted, start working on amendments. This is what is important. But in \norder to address the shortfalls we have, I have an amendment that would \nphase sequester in a way that would allow our senior military leaders \nto enact reforms without disproportionately degrading our ability to \ntrain and prepare our military men and women to protect this country.\n  Let me say quickly, one of my closest friends in this Chamber is one \nof the Senators from Alabama, Jeff Sessions. Jeff Sessions, as we \nspeak, is on a plane on his way back from California, so he cannot be \nhere. Jeff Sessions has come up with an amendment. He is on the Budget \nCommittee. He is a real budget hawk, and he still is willing to \nincrease the military by 1 percent with a proposed amendment he might \nhave. When Jeff Sessions gets back, I am going to talk to him about \ngoing together on his amendment so we can maybe merge the two \namendments.\n  My amendment seeks to leverage what General Odierno refers to as \n``ramping,'' a rephasing of the sequestration cuts that reduces the \nimpact in fiscal year 2014 and 2015 to a more manageable level and \nshifts the remainder of the required cuts across the remaining years. \nSo we are talking about that you would not feel it as much in these \nfirst 2 years, and yet we would make up for it, and that is why it is \nbudget neutral. The Congressional Budget Office has told me this \namendment will not score. That is very important to a lot of people.\n  Let me be real clear: I remain committed to ending sequestration of \nour military men and women. My amendment does not fix sequestration nor \nwill it impede my continued push for fixing sequestration. We are going \nto continue to do that. It is immoral that we are not doing it. \nHowever, the damage being done to our military is so egregious and \nreckless under the current sequester mechanism that I have no choice \nbut to take this step to avoid an even greater readiness catastrophe \nthat would seriously damage our national security.\n  I talked just a few minutes ago to General Odierno. He is the \nCommander, the top person in the U.S. Army. I made a couple of notes \nhere. I want to make sure I do not misquote him because he said if we \ncan do what we are trying to do with this amendment--in other words, \nbackload some of this stuff--it would actually save money 3 or 4 years \nfrom now because if you start cutting right now across the board, as \nwould be mandated by sequestering, then you are going to be cutting in \nareas where it is going to cost you more to come back and do that. So I \nthink you will find most of the military is very anxious to do that.\n  Again, I am not going to offer this until we have a chance to talk to \nSenator Sessions and hopefully come up with something that will be \nsellable to this body.\n  In addition to my concerns about sequestration, this bill contains \nseveral provisions that I find deeply problematic. In particular, I \nstrongly oppose the sections that would loosen restrictions on the \ntransfer of detainees from Guantanamo Bay into the United States or to \ncountries such as Yemen that remain vulnerable to Al Qaeda and its \nterrorist affiliates.\n  I have to ad-lib here a little bit because I cannot remember how many \nyears I have been trying to save one of the greatest assets this \ncountry has, and that is Guantanamo Bay. I say to my good friend, the \nPresiding Officer, this is one of the few good deals we have because we \nhave had Guantanamo Bay since 1904, and it has cost us--I think the \ntotal is $4,000 a year--and Castro forgets to collect about every other \nyear. So it is one of the few good deals we have out there.\n  It is the only place you can put these combatants where they are in a \nposition where they can be interrogated and we can save American lives, \nand I do not know why this President, President Obama, has this \nobsession to turn these people out of Guantanamo Bay back into the \nUnited States. He first did this his first year--4 years ago. He had a \nplan. He had located, I think it was, 17 places in America where he \ncould send these terrorists.\n  One of them happened to be in my State of Oklahoma at Fort Sill. I \nwill always remember that. I went down to Fort Sill, I say to the \nPresiding Officer, because I found out we have a small prison down \nthere. And the major, a female who runs that prison, said to me: I \ncan't understand what is wrong with you people in Washington. You have \nthat perfectly good facility down there that will save American lives, \nand people are treated better than they have ever been treated before. \nOne of the major problems we have down there is obesity because they \nare eating so much. So it is not a matter of not being treated fairly.\n  Well, for some reason this President has had a--and one of the \nproblems with turning these people back in to America into our system \nis that a terrorist is not a criminal. A terrorist teaches others. They \nare in the business of teaching other people to be terrorists. You put \nthem in our prison system and they are going to be working on the \npeople who are there. That is why I have such strong feelings about the \nclosing of Guantanamo--or the President trying to do that. We have \nstopped him from doing that for 4\\1/2\\ years now. We will continue. \nHowever, they are trying to make it easier for them to take people out \nof Guantanamo Bay and send them to my State of Oklahoma and throughout \nAmerica. Hopefully we can defeat that part of this bill.\n  While I am pleased the bill fully funds the budget request for \nmissile defense and includes a provision that would establish a radar \nsite on the east coast, I remain concerned that we are vulnerable to a \ngrowing ballistic missile threat from the Middle East.\n  Let me comment here. I was upset. The first budget that President \nObama had, I knew--and again, when you say ``liberal'' and \n``conservative'' that is not name calling. ``Liberal'' simply means you \nwant government to have more involvement in our lives, and he is a \nliberal person. And most liberals do not think we need a military, to \nstart with.\n  I always remember his first budget. I went over to Afghanistan so I \ncould be there when he announced his budget, knowing if I was doing it \nfrom there with tanks going back and forth, I would get some attention \non it. Sure enough, it worked.\n  In that first budget, the President, in his budget, did away with our \nonly fifth-generation fighter, the F-22; did away with our lift \ncapacity, the C-17; did away with our future combat system, which had \nbeen the first advance in ground capability in probably 50 years.\n  But I think the worst of everything was, he did away with the site \nthat we were building in Poland and the Czech Republic to be a ground-\nbased interceptor that would take care of something coming from that \ndirection into the United States.\n  You see, we have 33 ground-based interceptors. They are all located \non the west coast. Our intelligence has told us since 2007 that Iran is \ngoing to have the capability of a weapon and a delivery system--by \nweapon, I am talking about a nuclear weapon--and a delivery system by \n2015. We are talking about in less than a year and a half from now. He \nis going to have that capability. So we were building that for\n\n[[Page S8079]]\n\nthe purpose of being able to catch something coming from that \ndirection. Well, he took that out, and we stopped that.\n  There are other problems with that too because I remember when we \nwere trying to sell Poland and the Czech Republic on the idea. They \nsaid: Are you sure now? If we agree and we make Russia angry at us by \nagreeing to have a ground-based interceptor in Poland and the radar in \nthe Czech Republic, are you sure that some President is not going to \ncome along and pull the rug out from under us?\n  I said: I am absolutely positive.\n  That is exactly what happened.\n  I only mention that because the radar site on the east coast \ncertainly would not be effective by the time they are going to have \nthat capability. Nonetheless, we are addressing it.\n  I am pleased that under Chairman Levin's leadership the committee was \nable to reach a compromise during the markup to address the scourge of \nsexual assault in the military. The Senate bill includes 16 provisions \nthat are specifically targeted to improving the tools the Department, \nthe services, and the commanders have at their disposal for fighting \nsexual assault. It includes an additional 12 provisions to make \nimportant improvements to the military justice system and the Uniform \nCode of Military Justice. This is a comprehensive, targeted legislative \ninitiative that would address that. That is going to be controversial. \nI understand that.\n  I think a lot of us served in the military. It happens that I was in \nthe military court many years before most of you guys were born. At \nthat time the one thing I learned--and this was way back then--was that \nthe commander's influence in discipline is necessary. We are all going \nto keep that in mind as we look at some of these amendments.\n  I look forward to bringing this to the floor as soon as we can, \ngetting these controversial issues out of the way. I am hoping I will \nget favorable consideration on my amendment that is going to make it \nmuch less devastating to the military.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/18/senate-section/article/S8079-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8079-S8080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     DRUG QUALITY AND SECURITY ACT\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, this afternoon the Senate passed and \nsent to the President legislation that Tennesseans and Americans will \nwelcome because it deals with the terrifying fungal meningitis outbreak \nthat occurred more than a year ago that killed 16 Tennesseans and made \nmany others sick.\n  The problem at that time was sterile compounded drugs that turned out \nnot to be sterile. So when they were injected into patients for back \npain or neck pain, those tainted drugs caused fungal meningitis and \ncaused a number of Tennesseans to die and many others to become sick. \nHad it not been for the heroic efforts of the Tennessee State \nDepartment of Public Health, many others across the country may have \nbeen injected with that tainted medicine and become sick.\n  This is a very important piece of legislation which Senators and \nHouse Members have been working on for a year. I am glad it passed. I \nam sure the President will sign it. In our State, we know how personal \nthis was. There is the story of Diana Reed from Brentwood, TN, who was \nthe caregiver for her husband, who has Lou Gehrig's disease. She had \nneck pain--maybe because of helping him in and out of a wheelchair--\nwent to the doctor, and got an injection for her neck pain. The next \nthing she knew, she had fungal meningitis and she died. Still, her \nhusband with Lou Gehrig's disease lives on.\n  That story has been told in many States. We have been told by the \nCommissioner of the Food and Drug Administration that if we do not act, \nit will happen again. If we do not act, Commissioner Hamburg said, the \nquestion is not if but when there will be another tragedy. We have \nacted. No one should believe we can guarantee such a tragedy will never \nhappen again, but for two reasons, it is much less likely we will have \nanother tragedy like fungal meningitis as the result of contaminated \ndrugs.\n  No. 1, we have cleared up the question of accountability. After this \nhappened, and it was discovered that the tainted drugs came from the \nMassachusetts compounding pharmacy, there was a lot of finger pointing \nback and forth between the FDA and the State board about who should \nhave been regulating this pharmacy, because there were other trouble \nsigns. This never should have happened and would not have happened if \nthey had been either properly regulated either by the State or the \nFederal agency, the FDA.\n  That often happens when there is not accountability, when it is not \nclear who is on the flagpole, as I like to say--when it is not clear \nwho is in charge. We have used the example of Admiral Hyman Rickover, \nwho was a Navy officer. In the 1950s, when he was assigned the job of \nthe nuclear Navy, he told his captains two things: No. 1, you are in \ncharge of the ship; and, No. 2, you are in charge of the reactor. If \nanything goes wrong with the nuclear reactor, your career is over.\n  As a result of that level of clear accountability, since the 1950s \nthere has never been a death as a result of a reactor accident on one \nof our nuclear ships. This legislation creates that kind of \naccountability for compounded drugs.\n  It preserves the traditional role of States to regulate drugstores. \nCompounding is something almost every drugstore does. We have 60,000 of \nthose, and that is an important job to the States. Most States do an \nexcellent job.\n  It preserves the role of the Food and Drug Administration for \nmanufacturers, those who manufacture large amounts of drugs which are \nprepared without an individual prescription. But it creates a new sort \nof facility which we call outsourcing facility. This facility is \nregulated by the FDA.\n  Two things have happened. One is either the FDA or the State is in \ncharge of a compounding pharmacy. It will be one or the other. The \nsecond is there is a new outsourcing facility. A doctor or a hospital \nin Virginia or Tennessee may choose to buy all of its sterile drugs, \nfor example, from a compounding pharmacy that is regulated by the FDA. \nIt doesn't have to, but it may choose to do that.\n  We believe many will choose to do that, particularly with the sterile \ndrugs that are sent across State lines without a prescription. This \nlegislation affects the health and safety of millions of Americans.\n  There was a second part this legislation that was passed this \nafternoon that is equally as important and in some ways more far-\nreaching. We call it track and trace. That is the shorthand name for \nit. Four billion prescriptions are written every year.\n  What this legislation does is attach a serial number to each drug \nthat is manufactured and follows it all the way from the drug \nmanufacturer to the individual pharmacy. Why is that important. It is \nimportant so that one will know, if given a prescribed drug, that it \nworks, is not counterfeit, and that it is safe. It will take several \nyears to implement this, but the drugs that make the 4 billion \nprescriptions will now be able to be tracked and traced from the \nmanufacturer to the pharmacy.\n  Many of our disputes are well advertised around the Senate. In fact, \none could argue that is what we are for--the resolution of disputes. If \nthere weren't a dispute, we probably wouldn't be here. We would work \neverything out at the city council, the Governor's office or somewhere \nelse.\n  The big issues of the day stand here. Some of those are hard to \nresolve. ObamaCare is hard to resolve, fixing the debt is hard to \nresolve. We have very different points of view.\n  On this issue, which was difficult to do, we worked for more than 1 \nyear on the compounding pharmacy bill and more than 2 years on the \ntrack-and-trace bill. It was very difficult to do. We were able to do \nit.\n  I commend Senator Harkin, who is chairman of our committee, Senator \nFranken, Senator Roberts, Senator Burr, Senator Bennet, and many other \nMembers of the committee. We were able to involve many people in it and\n\n[[Page S8080]]\n\ncome out with the unanimous recommendation of our committee, and it was \nunanimous today.\n  Just because it was unanimous, I don't want anyone to think it was \neasy. It was hard work. Because it was unanimous, I don't want anyone \nto think it is not important.\n  It is important in Tennessee to those 16 families who had a family \nmember die. It is important to the dozens of families with a member of \ntheir family who is sick because of those injections. It is important \nto those families who may still become sick in our State and other \nStates.\n  No. 1, it is important to know after this who is on the flagpole. It \nis either the FDA or the State agencies, and there will be no more \nfinger pointing.\n  No. 2, any doctor or hospital that chooses to buy its sterile \ncompounded drugs that are shipped interstate in large amounts without \nprescription from an FDA-related facility may do that.\n  This is a day of results in the Senate, which I am pleased to see.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. While the Senator is on the floor, I wish to thank my \ncolleague from Tennessee for this legislation and the hard work he has \ndone on it. Also, there was significant pain and difficulties \nexperienced by his constituents in Tennessee. This is something that I \nthink will benefit all Americans and a rare bipartisan occasion in the \nSenate, which we should all celebrate. I thank my colleague from \nTennessee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/18/senate-section/article/S8080-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8080-S8081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. First, I obviously wish to join all of my colleagues in \nwelcoming back our dear friend, the Senator from Oklahoma, Jim Inhofe. \nWe know he has gone through a very terrible family tragedy, and our \nthoughts and prayers continue to be with him and the members of his \nfamily. We are very happy to see him return, working and leading on \nthis very important aspect of our work, the National Defense \nAuthorization Act.\n  Today I will have filed an amendment on behalf of Senator Sessions \nand myself--Senator Sessions, as we all know, is the ranking member of \nthe Budget Committee--to try to address the issue of this terrible \neffect on our defense establishment as a result of sequestration. \nRather than go into the background of why it happened, the fact is that \nnow in 2012, 2013, and into 2014, we see a continued decline in funding \nfor national defense and then a rise, as it is currently planned. This \nis current law.\n  Obviously, it is not a rational approach because our defense business \nand people in the Pentagon do not plan on a day-to-day or week-to-week \nor month-to-month basis.\n  What this amendment does is it preserves sequestration--which I am \nopposed to--but the fact remains that in order to try to ease the \nburden of sequestration on our military, this would smooth out this dip \nthat has taken place over an 8-year period until the expiration of \ncurrent law in 2021, and next year and the years after for 2014, 2015, \n2016, and 2017 it would give increases in spending and then reductions \nin those outyears and still achieve the same reductions in spending as \ndictated by sequestration.\n  The reason I say this is because we are looking at a dramatic impact \non our military if we allow spending to go down to that level for 2014 \nbefore we start climbing back up.\n  What is happening to our military today? It has a large impact, it is \ndisgraceful, and it is harmful. In this very unsettled world we live \nin, we are seeing unprecedented reductions and impact on our national \nsecurity that we have not seen since the end of the Vietnam war.\n  Two weeks ago the Armed Services Committee held a hearing to \nunderstand how the sequester had impacted the Department of Defense. We \nlearned, according to the Chief of Staff of the Army, GEN Ray Odierno, \nthat continued sequestration along this line will cause the Army to \nend, restructure or delay over 100 acquisition programs. The Army, \nalready drawing down by 80,000 Active-Duty troops, will be forced to \nreduce and eliminate an additional 60,000. The Guard and Reserve would \nalso be forced to remove tens of thousands of men and women from their \nranks. It amounts to an almost 20-percent cut in troop strength over \nthe next 5 years and will result in an Army that has tens of thousands \nfewer soldiers than it had in 2011. Unit training has been curtailed \nsuch that by the end of 2014, if we go down this scale, General Odierno \nforecasts that only 15 percent of Army brigade combat teams will be \nfully ready in the event of a contingency.\n  The Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Greenert, testified that \nsequestration means the Navy will operate more sparsely across the \nglobe and be less able to reassure our allies that U.S. interests \naround the world are properly served. The Navy is the most visible sign \nof America's strategic deterrent, and we are putting that deterrent at \nrisk.\n  The Commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. James Amos, said that \nbecause of sequestration, he was ``mortgaging'' long-term modernization \nto pay for keeping his marines trained and ready today, but he also \nsaid the plan is not sustainable. As equipment and facilities age, he \nwon't be able to pay for their upkeep while simultaneously paying for \ntraining. What will give, unfortunately, is readiness.\n  As all the service chiefs testified, ``readiness'' means lives. The \nlower their readiness, the greater the risk to the lives of soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines in the event of a deployment.\n  The Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Gen. Mark Welsh, told us that \nthe Air Force had to ground 13 combat squadrons--had to ground 13 \ncombat squadrons--because they lacked funding due to sequestration. \nOther squadrons' flying hours were cut in half. He warned that \ncontinued cuts to flying hours, which are a certainty under this \npresent plan, will guarantee that many more squadrons will forego \nmission readiness in the coming years. General Welsh's least damaging \nplan to pay for sequestration is to cut some 25,000 airmen and 500 \naircraft, almost 10 percent of the aircraft inventory.\n  Obviously, what is not reflected in these numbers is the impact on \nmorale and retention. The Air Force is deeply concerned about the \nnumber of pilots it is losing to private industry. My colleagues may \nnot know that there is a large exodus of airline pilots that will be \nleaving the airlines due to retirement in the next few years.\n  There is a recent story where a number of Air Force pilots were \noffered a bonus of $225,000 to remain in the U.S. Air Force and most of \nthem turned it down. Why are they turning it down? It is because they \nare not flying, and they are not sure whether they are going to be \nflying.\n  We are cutting their flying hours to the bone. We are grounding \nentire squadrons. We are harming the morale and readiness of our \nmilitary today in all of the services.\n  I provide those examples, but as one Air Force leader said recently: \n``If you're not flying your aircraft because it's grounded, you might \nas well go fly something else.''\n  I provide these examples because it is important for us to understand \nthat our actions in Congress are presently and materially degrading our \nmilitary's ability to defend the Nation and protect our interests \nabroad. This is not an abstraction, especially at a time when \ninternational threats and instability are growing and not lessening.\n  I acknowledge there is a fatigue after more than a decade of war. \nCutting the defense budget seems an easy way to ameliorate the Nation's \ndire budget problems, but such thinking is wrong.\n  I remember the troop cuts and the budget reductions after Vietnam. I \nremember that it took us 15 years to restore the military to the \nproficiency, capability, and professionalism that we have today.\n  Defense represents less than 20 percent of total government spending. \nWe could zero out the entire defense budget and would still, with the \ngrowth of entitlement spending and the prevalence of tax loopholes, not \nbe able to reduce the Federal deficit.\n  I have worked with colleagues for 2 years trying to address this \nissue. I have toured the country with Kelly Ayotte and Lindsey Graham \nand met with community and business leaders. I joined with our \ndistinguished chairman Carl Levin and hosted a series of meetings with \nSenators to find common ground. None was to be found.\n\n[[Page S8081]]\n\n  So here we are, with an obvious impact for next year of sequestration \nwhich would dramatically impact our ability to defend this Nation. In \ndesperation, I am asking my colleagues to at least agree to smoothing \nout this path--which would end up with the same reductions in the \nspending but at least not hit this bottom level which would cause us to \nhave planes that will not fly, ships that can't sail, and men and women \nin the military unable to train and operate. Once we reduce and impact \noperations and maintenance, readiness suffers, and readiness \nincapability only shows up over time.\n  I spent last Sunday with my friend Senator Alexander. The Senator \nfrom Tennessee and I were at Fort Campbell, KY, where we spent some \ntime with the men and women who are serving in the military. We were \nbriefed by the military leadership and the command master sergeants of \nthe various units based at Fort Campbell, KY. We found that already the \nability to train, the ability to retain, the ability to act with the \nkind of proficiency which is necessary in today's world is already \nbeing seriously degraded.\n  So I ask my colleagues, in working with Senator Sessions via the \nSessions amendment, to consider this amendment to the National Defense \nAuthorization Act so we can at least soften the blow, to some degree, \nof sequestration.\n  Senator Lamar Alexander and I were taken by the patriotism, the hard \nwork, and the quality of the men and women serving our Nation in the \nUnited States Army at Fort Campbell, KY. Senator Alexander and I were \nboth deeply alarmed at the fact that these people are literally having \nto budget and operate on a month-to-month basis. They are not able to \nsustain the level of readiness and capability that this Nation needs at \nthis very difficult time.\n  So I urge my colleagues to consider this amendment that Senator \nSessions will be sponsoring. I look forward to debating and hopefully \npassing this legislation to give our men and women the relief they need \nto serve this country with the patriotism and the efficiency we need in \nthese difficult times.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am here to talk about legislation I have \nintroduced that I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting, but \nfirst I would like to make a couple of comments about the terrific \nstorms that roared through the Midwest, including my State, yesterday \nafternoon and evening. Mother Nature was in full fury and caused \nsignificant damage to my State. Fortunately, no deaths were reported, \nbut there were injuries, destroyed buildings, turned-over cars, and \ndowned trees and power lines. There was quite a bit of damage across \nour State affecting a significant number of towns--Muncie, Kokomo, \nMarion, Lebanon, Washington, Lafayette, and others. It was a line of \nstorms that packed a lot of power and did a lot of damage.\n  We were fortunate in Indiana not to suffer loss of life. Our \nneighbors to the west in Illinois took the brunt of this storm. Our \nthoughts and prayers go out to those families and those loved ones who \nwere lost in that storm.\n  There has been a good response by FEMA. People are on the ground \nalready. Assessments are being made and Hoosiers are rolling up their \nsleeves and cleaning it up, as we fully expect them to do. The response \nhas been terrific. I certainly have to acknowledge that this caused \nsome severe damage but the response addressing it has been terrific.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/18/senate-section/article/S8081-2", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8081-S8082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL CEMETERIES ACT\n\n  Mr. COATS. The bill I would like to talk about is S. 1471, the Alicia \nDawn Koehl Respect for National Cemeteries Act, which hopefully will \ncome before the Senate this week. I wish this legislation were not \nnecessary. It should not be. Tragic events happened on May 30, 2012. \nObviously, we wish that had never happened and wish there never had to \nbe a bill named after Alicia Dawn Koehl. I regret that the Department \nof Veterans Affairs made a mistake that resulted in even more pain and \nheartbreak for this family who is already suffering from heartbreak \nfrom the loss of Alicia Dawn Koehl.\n  These are the circumstances. On May 30, 2012, Michael LaShawn \nAnderson went on a shooting spree at an Indianapolis apartment complex, \ninjuring three people and taking the life of Alicia Dawn Koehl, a \ndevoted wife and loving mother of two children. As police were arriving \nat the scene, Anderson then killed himself.\n  Shortly after the Koehl family faced the unimaginable--putting their \nmother and wife to rest--they discovered that the local Department of \nVeterans Affairs had made a very disturbing mistake. The VA erroneously \ngranted the shooter a burial with military honors at Fort Custer \nNational Cemetery in Augusta, MI, on June 6, 2012. Although Anderson \nwas a U.S. veteran, his unthinkable act made him ineligible by law to \nbe buried in a national cemetery. We passed a law prohibiting a veteran \nwho has committed a federal or state capital crime, even though they \nhave given service, from benefiting from the honors of a military \ncemetery burial.\n  After learning that Anderson was given this distinct honor of being \nburied alongside our country's heroes in a national cemetery, the Koehl \nfamily requested that the VA disinter his remains. They contacted our \nstaff, me, and for over a year, together, we worked and we have been \nworking with the VA and the Koehl family to remove Anderson's remains \nfrom the Custer National Cemetery in Michigan.\n  However, earlier this year the VA informed me personally that it \ncould not exhume the remains of Anderson because the Department does \nnot believe it has the legal authority to do so without the Congress \npassing legislation and signature by the President. In other words, the \nVA was not permitted under current law to bury Anderson at the national \ncemetery, but the Department's legal interpretation of the law says it \ndoes not have the legal authority to fix that mistake and exhume the \nremains of this ineligible veteran. Legislation had to be offered to \nright this wrong. The bill that is being presented here would grant \nboth the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense \nthe authority to disinter ineligible veterans buried at national \ncemeteries who have committed a Federal or State capital crime. It \nwould give the VA the authority it needs to exhume the remains of \nMichael Anderson.\n  Last month I testified in support of this bill before the Senate \nVeterans' Affairs Committee hearing, and I was pleased to be joined by \nAlicia's father-in-law Frank and mother-in-law Carol, who traveled from \nFort Wayne, IN, in support of this particular bill. I thank chairman \nBernie Sanders and ranking member Richard Burr and members of the \ncommittee for immediately grasping the nature of this and being willing \nto do everything possible to help us move this legislation. It could \nnot have been done without their support, and their efforts have been \nadvanced and expedited by their commitment to support this and to have \nSenate action on the legislation as soon as possible.\n  I am here today to urge my colleagues to support and pass this Alicia \nDawn Koehl Respect for National Cemeteries Act. The victims and family \nmembers of this tragic shooting have suffered enough and should not be \nforced to wait much longer to have their requests met. As a veteran \nmyself, I have the deepest respect for those who have worn the uniform \nto serve and defend our country. But no veteran who commits a capital \ncrime should be given the honor of a military burial and being laid to \nrest next to our Nation's military heroes. That is the law today, and \nwe need to make sure that law is followed.

Res. 165\n\n       Whereas, in August 1991, the Ukrainian Parliament declared \n     independence from the Soviet Union and approved decrees to \n     mint its own currency and take command of all Soviet military \n     units on its soil;\n       Whereas, in December 1991, 90 percent of Ukrainians voted \n     in a referendum to support independence from the Soviet \n     Union;\n       Whereas Ukraine has experienced increased economic and \n     political cooperation with Europe and the United States since \n     its independence from the Soviet Union;\n       Whereas, in 1996, Ukraine adopted its first democratic \n     constitution that included basic freedoms of speech, \n     assembly, religion, and press;\n       Whereas in 2004, Ukrainians organized a series of historic \n     protests, strikes, and sit-ins known as the ``Orange \n     Revolution'' to protest electoral fraud in the 2004 \n     presidential election;\n       Whereas Yulia Tymoshenko was a leader of the Orange \n     Revolution and was first elected as Prime Minister in 2005;\n       Whereas, in the 2010 presidential election, incumbent \n     President Viktor Yushchenko won only 5.5 percent in the first \n     round of voting, which left former Prime Minister Viktor \n     Yanukovich and then Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko to face \n     one another in a run-off election;\n       Whereas Mr. Yanukovich defeated Ms. Tymoshenko by a margin \n     of 49 percent to 44 percent;\n       Whereas, on October 11, 2011, Ms. Tymoshenko was found \n     guilty and sentenced to seven years in prison on charges that \n     she abused her position as Prime Minister in connection with \n     a Russian natural gas contract;\n       Whereas, on January 26, 2012, the Parliamentary Assembly \n     Council of Europe (PACE) passed a resolution (1862) that \n     declared that the articles under which Ms. Tymoshenko was \n     convicted were ``overly broad in application and effectively \n     allow for ex post facto criminalization of normal political \n     decision making'';\n       Whereas, on May 30, 2012, the European Parliament passed a \n     resolution (C153/21) deploring the sentencing of Ms. \n     Tymoshenko;\n       Whereas, on September 22, 2012, the United States Senate \n     passed a resolution (S. Res 466, 112th Congress) that \n     condemned the selective and politically motivated prosecution \n     and imprisonment of Yulia Tymoshenko, called for her release \n     based on the politicized charges, and called on the \n     Department of State to institute a visa ban against those \n     responsible for the imprisonment of Ms. Tymoshenko and the \n     other political leaders associated with the 2004 Orange \n     Revolution;\n       Whereas, on April 7, 2013, President of Ukraine Viktor \n     Yanukovich pardoned former interior minister Yuri Lutsenko \n     and several other opposition figures allied with Ms. \n     Tymoshenko;\n       Whereas, on April 30, 2013, the European Court of Human \n     Rights, which settles cases of rights abuses after plaintiffs \n     have exhausted appeals in their home country courts, ruled \n     that Ms. Tymoshenko's pre-trial detention had been arbitrary; \n     that the lawfulness of her pre-trial detention had not been \n     properly reviewed; that her right to liberty had been \n     restricted; and, that she had no possibility to seek \n     compensation for her unlawful deprivation of liberty;\n       Whereas, on April 30, 2013, Department of State Spokesman \n     Patrick Ventrell reiterated the United States call that Ms. \n     Tymoshenko ``be released and that the practice of selective \n     prosecution end immediately'' in light of the European Court \n     of Human Rights decision;\n       Whereas Ukraine hopes to sign an association agreement with \n     the European Union during the Eastern Partnership Summit in \n     November 2013; and\n       Whereas, after the European Court of Human Rights ruling, \n     European Parliament Committee on Foreign Affairs chairman \n     Elmar Brok stated that ``Ukraine is still miles away from \n     fulfilling European standards'' and must ``end its selective \n     justice'' before signing the association agreement: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved That the Senate--\n       (1) calls on the Government of Ukraine to release former \n     Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko from imprisonment based on \n     politicized and selective charges and in light of the April \n     2013 European Court of Human Rights verdict;\n       (2) calls on the European Union members to include the \n     release of Ms. Tymoshenko from imprisonment based on \n     politicized and selective charges as a criterion for signing \n     an association agreement with Ukraine at the upcoming Eastern \n     Partnership Summit in Lithuania;\n       (3) expresses its belief and hope that Ukraine's future \n     rests with stronger ties to Europe, the United States, and \n     others in the community of democracies; and\n       (4) expresses its concern and disappointment that the \n     continued selective and politically motivated imprisonment of \n     former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko unnecessarily detracts \n     from Ukraine's otherwise strong relationship with Europe, the \n     United States, and the community of democracies.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak to an issue relative to \nthe nation of Ukraine. It is the continued imprisonment of former \nUkrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko. Sadly, for over 2 years now, \nshe has been languishing in prison on politicized charges that she \nabused her position in connection with a natural gas contract with \nRussia.\n  This is a photo showing the former Prime Minister's trial in Ukraine. \nThis occurred, as I said, more than 2 years ago.\n  I am not going to judge the wisdom of that contract--one of an \nendless series of policy decisions any chief executive makes in most \nnations. But this is an imprisonment that has been recognized by the \ninternational community and countless human rights organizations and by \nthe European Court of Human Rights as selectively prosecuted and \npolitically motivated. This is an imprisonment that has a whiff of the \nneighboring nation of Belarus, where those who run for President \nagainst strongman dictator Alexander Lukashenko not only always lose \nthe election but virtually always get thrown in jail--talk about a \ndisincentive to run for office--but not from Ukraine, which has looked \nto solidify its place among the community of democracies, do we expect \nthis kind of conduct.\n  When I visited Ukraine last May, I had the opportunity to meet with \nPresident Yanukovich, the Prime Minister, and the Foreign Minister. I \nwas grateful they gave me their time. During those discussions, I \nalways raised the issue of Ms. Tymoshenko's imprisonment, hoping it \nwould be solved. They gave me kind of indirect assurances that it would \nin a very brief time.\n  Last year, Senator Inhofe of Oklahoma, as well as Senators Boxer, \nCasey, Menendez, and I, introduced a Senate resolution calling for her \nrelease. It passed unanimously last September--over 1 year ago. Yet \nhere we are today, more than 1 year later and a few weeks before an \nimportant opportunity for Ukraine to strengthen its ties to the West by \npotentially signing an agreement with the European Union, and Ms. \nTymoshenko is still in jail.\n  This is not only embarrassing, it is disgraceful. This is a costly \ndistraction from all the other important issues in the Ukraine, a \nnation which has such great potential. It plays into Russian President \nPutin's hands, who would like nothing more than to see the European \nUnion Association Agreement scuttled because of the failure of the \nUkrainian Government to release Ms. Tymoshenko. Why would Ukraine's \nleaders want to succumb to Russian bullying and jeopardize political \nties to the West over a simple grudge regarding the previous Prime \nMinister?\n  I am dismayed by the seeming inability to find a reasonable \ncompromise that would allow Ms. Tymoshenko to seek medical treatment \nabroad, a move that would allow us to instead focus on strengthening \nthe important ties between the United States, the European Union, and \nUkraine.\n  Ukraine is our friend and ally. It helped us in Libya and in \nAfghanistan.\n\n[[Page S8083]]\n\nIts leadership rightly sees Ukraine's future with the West. But when \nyou join the community of democracies, you simply do not throw your \nformer political opponents in jail over policy disagreements. You \ninstead offer better ideas and beat them in an election.\n  That is why this summer, regrettably, I introduced a followup \nresolution again calling for the release of Ms. Tymoshenko. I am happy \nto note that Senators Barrasso, Boozman, Boxer, Cardin, Inhofe, \nMenendez, Murphy, Portman, Rubio, Sessions, and Shaheen have joined me \non that resolution. Let me add that is not a group of Senators we see \nagree on too many issues. We all agree on this. For months, we have \nbeen waiting, assured that a resolution to Ms. Tymoshenko's case would \ncome to fruition. We saw Ukraine take promising steps toward political \nreform. We saw some of Ms. Tymoshenko's allies pardoned.\n  Over the course of the last few weeks in particular, we were \noptimistic that the negotiations led by former President of the \nEuropean Parliament Pat Cox and former Polish President Aleksander \nKwasniewski were seemingly making headway toward a solution in which \nMs. Tymoshenko would leave to go to Germany for medical treatment. We \nwere hopeful such a solution would come in time for Ukraine to sign an \nassociation agreement with the EU during the Eastern Partnership Summit \nin Vilnius at the end of this month--a step strongly supported by the \nUnited States.\n  We held off in calling this resolution with the hope that real \nprogress would take place. But last Wednesday, after 2 years of delay \nand obfuscation on this issue, the Ukrainian Parliament postponed a \nvote on the bill that would have secured this resolution--a move that \nonly adds to the long list of missed opportunities in Ukraine. That is \nwhy today, with some disappointment, my colleagues and I have decided \nto move forward and pass this resolution in the Senate.\n  There is still time to find a solution before the Eastern partnership \nsummit takes place at the end of the month, so I am hopeful our friends \nin the Ukraine will be able to find an honorable way forward to put the \nbest interests of the country first and end Ms. Tymoshenko's detention.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the committee-reported substitute \namendment to the resolution be agreed to; the resolution, as amended, \nbe agreed to; the committee-reported amendment to the preamble be \nagreed to; the preamble, as amended, be agreed to; and the motions to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  The resolution, (S. Res. 165), as amended, was agreed to.\n  The amendment to the preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, as amended, with its preamble, as amended, was agreed \nto.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/18/senate-section/article/S8083-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8083-S8084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TORNADOES IN ILLINOIS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, search and rescue operations are underway \nin several Illinois v communities today after deadly tornadoes tore \nthrough my home State yesterday.\n  Eight people died as a result of the storms--six in Illinois--and \ndozens are seriously injured.\n  My heart goes out to the people who have lost so much and today are \nbeginning to sort through the rubble.\n  Take a look at what the people in Washington, IL, near Peoria, woke \nup to this morning.\n  This photo shows what is left of the neighborhood on Devonshire Road.\n  It is difficult to know which property is which because the homes \nhave been reduced to splinters.\n  The tornado cut a path from one end of Washington to the other, \nknocking down power lines, rupturing gas lines, and ripping off roofs.\n  This is another picture of the devastation in Washington, IL. It \nlooks as though this whole neighborhood has been destroyed.\n  Mayor Gary Manier says between 2,000 and 3,000 homes were damaged by \ntornadoes in his city, alone. He credits the advance warning system for \nsaving many lives. Mayor Manier estimates people in Washington had \nabout 4-to-5 minutes to take cover.\n  Washington is a city of about 15,000 people. It is about 150 miles \nsoutheast of Chicago.\n  At least 400 homes were destroyed there--wiped off their foundations.\n  Standalone homes, multifamily homes, and apartment buildings were \ndamaged. Rescue teams are searching the debris to make sure all the \nvictims of the storm are accounted for.\n  Several stories have been reported of debris from Washington ending \nup near Streator, IL, which is more than 50 miles away. People in \nStreator found part of a plastic recycling bin with the Washington city \nemblem on it and a UPS package addressed to one of Washington's hardest \nhit neighborhoods. A person in Lockport, IL; which is two hours away, \nfound a savings bond with a Washington, IL, address.\n  Many other Illinois communities were struck by the twisters. This \nphoto shows some of the aftermath in Brookport, IL, which is in Massac \nCounty, in the southern part of the State.\n  Several people in Brookport said some homes moved as much as 20-feet \noff their foundations. Seventy homes were destroyed and many more are \ndamaged.\n  Three of the six people who died in Illinois lived in Massac County.\n  The Village of Gifford, IL, a small community of 500 people, suffered \nsevere damage. About 160 homes were destroyed there. People there say \nit looks as though half of the town has been wiped away.\n  In Washington County, two siblings, Joseph Hoy, who was 80 years old, \nand Frances Hoy, who was 78, died in the storms. They lived in the \nVillage of New Minden.\n  Coal City, Nashville, East Peoria, Pekin--many Illinois communities \nwere struck by the tornadoes.\n  In the face of all this devastation, people all over the State are \nbeginning the painful task of assessing the damage.\n  In fact, we are starting to hear stories of bravery during the \ntornadoes.\n  In Washington, a 6-year-old boy is being credited for saving the \nlives of his mother and older brother.\n  Six-year-old Brevin Hunter was playing a video game when he heard the \nwail of the siren yesterday. He urged his mom to go down to the \nbasement.\n  His mother, Lisa Hunter, had heard the siren, too, but said the skies \nlooked deceptively calm, so she thought it was a drill.\n  Brevin wouldn't let up. He told his mother that he learned in school \nthat when you hear the siren, you have to go somewhere safe.\n  Brevin, his mother, and Brevin's older brother, Brody, grabbed a \nfuton and went to the basement just minutes before the tornado slammed \ninto their duplex in Washington Estates.\n  Lisa Hunter credits her little boy for saving their lives.\n  Lorelei Cox, a teacher in the City of Washington, credits a former \nstudent for saving her life and her husband's.\n  Cox's house was directly in the path of the storm. She and her \nhusband, Dave, took shelter when they heard the sirens, but they were \nburied by debris when the twister hit. They survived but could not get \nout.\n  Cox says she and her husband were dug out from under the rubble by \none of her former students.\n  Governor Pat Quinn has declared seven Illinois counties State \ndisaster areas.\n  Champaign, Grundy, LaSalle, Massac, Tazewell, Washington, and \nWoodford Counties are receiving the trucks, communications equipment, \nand heavy equipment needed to remove debris. More than 60 National \nGuardsmen are helping with recovery.\n  Earlier today I spoke with Jonathon Monken, the head of the Illinois \nEmergency Management Agency. He assured me that FEMA representatives \nare in the State, assessing the damage, and working with State and \nlocal officials to help people.\n  The State has dispatched technical rescue teams to a number of \nlocations across the State, and is providing emergency generators, \nlight towers, and communications systems.\n  The extent of the damage is breathtaking. I commend the mayors and \nfirst responders who are on the front lines, bringing order to the \nchaos, and Governor Quinn and his team, who are getting immediate help \nto the communities hardest hit.\n  And I am confident that the State will need Federal assistance to \nhelp\n\n[[Page S8084]]\n\nwith the cleanup and recovery. I stand ready to help ensure there is \nFederal assistance to augment the arduous but critical recovery work \nthat the municipalities and the State already have begun.\n  Tornadoes aren't new to Illinois. They are pretty common in our part \nof the world, but this is an unusual situation we face. In the last 27 \nyears, there have been approximately 194 tornadoes in our State \nrecorded in the month of November; 101 of them were recorded \nyesterday--again, 194 in 27 years, and 101 yesterday. Is the weather \nchanging in America? I think the people in Illinois would say it is \nchanging for the worse when it comes to the incidences of tornadoes out \nof season in our State of Illinois.\n  There are two things I can predict about this disaster, without fail. \nOne year from now, we will go back to these scenes and we will see the \nmost amazing work having been done by so many families and so many \nneighbors to pitch in and rebuild. They never quit and never give up. \nThey will be back. They will be back with their homes and playgrounds \nand churches and schools and shops. They will be back.\n  The second thing I can predict without fail--and it is not unique to \nIllinois, but I am so proud of it--is that neighborly quality where \npeople pitch in to help one another in ways large and small, from \nshowing up last night in Washington, IL, at one of the shelters with 35 \nhot pizzas; somebody just brought them in and said give them to whoever \nwants them. It is the little gestures such as that, and many others, \nlarge and small, which I am so proud to report that are just part of \nwho we are. Again, not unique to Illinois, not unique to the Midwest, \nmaybe not even unique to America, but time and again in times of crisis \nit comes out and shows itself over and over again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/18/senate-section/article/S8084-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WILKINS NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the President's \nnominations to fill vacancies on the Court of Appeals for the DC \nCircuit.\n  The DC Circuit, which is considered to be the second most important \ncourt in America, has 8 active judges of the 11 judgeships authorized \nby law. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have argued that \nthe Senate should not confirm any of President Obama's nominees for \nthese vacancies. But when there are vacancies in the Federal judiciary, \nit is the duty of the President to fill them, and it is the duty of the \nSenate to advise and consent in an honest and professional way to the \nfilling of these vacancies. The Senate does not have the right to \nunilaterally determine that certain judicial seats and posts should \nnever be filled by certain Presidents. That is exactly what is \nhappening today in the U.S. Senate.\n  Today we are considering the nomination of Judge Robert Wilkins to \nserve on the DC Circuit. He currently serves as a Federal judge for the \nU.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. He was confirmed by \nthe Senate in 2010 by a voice vote--no controversy. Seventy of my \ncolleagues, including 28 Republicans, were here for that confirmation.\n  There is no question that Judge Wilkins has the experience, \nqualifications, and integrity to be an outstanding circuit court judge. \nHe is a native of Indiana and a graduate of Harvard Law. He worked for \n11 years as a public defender in Washington, DC, and then joined the \nVenable law firm, where he served as a partner for nearly a decade.\n  As a judge, he has presided over hundreds of civil and criminal \ncases. He has a reputation, an unblemished reputation, for fairness and \nintegrity. The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, which \nstrongly supports his nomination, said he has a ``wealth of experience \nand impartiality'' and a ``steadfast commitment to enforcing the rule \nof law.''\n  He has been rated ``unanimously well-qualified'' to serve on the DC \nCircuit by the nonpartisan American Bar Association.\n  No Senator--not one--questioned his qualifications during his hearing \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee. As a sitting Federal judge, he \nhas already demonstrated sound judgment and integrity.\n  He deserves an up-or-down vote on his nomination. And he deserves to \nbe confirmed. But my Republican colleagues have made it clear that, \nonce again, they are going to filibuster President Obama's nominee to \nthe DC Circuit. It has nothing to do with Judge Wilkins, they say. They \njust do not want any Democratic President to fill this vacancy on this \nimportant court, period. This is becoming a pattern, an embarrassing \npattern, in the U.S. Senate, and this court is exhibit A in the abuse \nof the filibuster.\n  President George W. Bush made six nominations for the DC Circuit \nduring his Presidency. Four were confirmed by the Senate. President \nObama has made five nominations for the DC Circuit. If the Republicans \nfilibuster Judge Wilkins today, as they have threatened, then four out \nof the five of this President's nominees will have been filibustered.\n  Let's go through these nominees, just to recollect.\n  Caitlin Halligan, Patricia Millett, and Nina Pillard--some of the \nfinest attorneys in the country, some of the most outstanding women who \nhave ever been nominated for a Federal judgeship--were all filibustered \nand stopped by the Republicans.\n  My Republican colleagues say this is an argument about caseload \nbecause there is not enough work to justify these judges. This argument \ndoes not make sense. My Republican colleagues were eager to confirm \nnominees for the 9th, 10th, and 11th seats on the DC Circuit when it \nwas a Republican President. You did not hear them talk about caseload \nthen. This is a manufactured excuse for them to filibuster President \nObama's nominees.\n  When it comes to DC Circuit nominees by our current Democratic \nPresident, it looks as though we will see four times as many \nfilibusters as confirmations. This is unacceptable. It is disgraceful. \nThese judicial vacancies are authorized by law, and the President has \nnominated extraordinarily well-qualified women and men to fill them. \nThese nominees do not deserve a filibuster. They deserve a chance to be \njudged on their merits.\n  I urge my Republican colleagues to stop these filibusters now and to \nallow an up-or-down vote on Judge Wilkins and these other outstanding \nnominees.\n  We reached a bit of an agreement here a number of years ago that we \nwould not stop these nominees unless there were ``extraordinary \ncircumstances.'' That was the term that was used. It turns out one of \nthose extraordinary circumstances is when a Democratic President named \nBarack Obama makes a nomination. Too many Republicans think that is \nextraordinary and that they can stop well-qualified, good people from \nserving our Nation and serving on this important court.\n  We will have a chance this afternoon. I hope Judge Wilkins will be \ngiven that chance to serve on this important court.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the retirement \ncrisis in this country--a crisis that has received far too little \nattention and far too little response from Washington.\n  I have spent most of my career studying the economic pressures on \nmiddle-class families--families who worked hard, who played by the \nrules, but who still found themselves just hanging on by their \nfingernails. Starting in the 1970s, even as workers became more \nproductive, their wages flattened, while core expenses such as housing \nand health care and sending their kids to college kept going up.\n  Working families did not ask for a bailout. Instead, they rolled up \ntheir sleeves. They sent both parents into the workforce. But that \nmeant higher childcare costs, a second car, and higher taxes. So they \ntightened their belts more, cutting spending wherever they could.\n  Adjusted for inflation, families today spend less than they did a \ngeneration\n\n[[Page S8085]]\n\nago on food, clothing, furniture, appliances, and other flexible \npurchases. When that still was not enough to cover rising costs, they \ntook on debt--credit card debt, college debt, debt just to pay for the \nnecessities.\n  As families became increasingly desperate, unscrupulous financial \ninstitutions were all too happy to chain them to financial products \nthat got them into even more trouble--products where fine print and \nlegalese covered the true costs of credit. These trends are not new. \nThere have been warning signs for years about what is happening to our \nmiddle class.\n  One major consequence of these increasing pressures on working \npeople--a consequence that receives far too little attention--is that \nthe dream of a secure retirement is slowly slipping away.\n  A generation ago, middle-class families were able to put away enough \nmoney during their working years to make it through their later years \nwith dignity. On average, they saved about 11 percent of their take-\nhome pay while working. Many paid off their homes, got rid of all their \ndebts, and retired with strong pensions from their employers. And when \npensions, savings, and investments fell short, they could rely on \nSocial Security to make up the difference.\n  That was the story a generation ago. Since that time the retirement \nlandscape has shifted dramatically against our families. Among working \nfamilies on the verge of retirement, about a third have no retirement \nsavings of any kind and another third have total savings that are less \nthan a year's annual income. Many seniors have seen their housing \nwealth shrink as well. According to AARP, in 2012, one out of every \nseven older homers was paying down a mortgage that was higher than the \nvalue of their house.\n  And just as they need to rely more than ever on pensions, employers \nare withdrawing from their traditional role in helping provide a secure \nretirement. Two decades ago, more than a third of all private sector \nworkers--35 percent--had traditional defined benefit pensions--pensions \nthat guaranteed a certain monthly payment that retirees knew they could \ndepend on. Today that number has been cut in half. Only 18 percent of \nprivate sector workers have defined benefit pensions. Employers have \nreplaced guaranteed retirement income with savings plans, such as \n401(k) plans, that leave the retiree at the mercy of a market that \nrises and falls and sometimes at the mercy of dangerous investment \nproducts. These plans often fall short of what retirees need and nearly \nhalf of all American workers do not even have access to those limited \nplans. This leaves more than 44 million workers without any retirement \nassistance from their employers.\n  Add all of this up--the dramatic decline in individual savings and \nthe dramatic decline of guaranteed retirement benefits and employer \nsupport in return for a lifetime of work--and we are left with a \nretirement crisis, a crisis that is as real and as frightening as any \npolicy problem facing the United States today.\n  With less savings and weaker private retirement protection, retirees \ndepend more than ever on the safety and reliability of Social Security. \nSocial Security works. No one runs out of benefits and the payments do \nnot rise or fall with the stock market. Two-thirds of seniors rely on \nit for the majority of their income in retirement, and for 14 million \nseniors--14 million--this is the safety net that keeps them out of \npoverty. God bless Social Security.\n  And yet even Social Security has been under attack. Monthly payments \nare modest, averaging about $1,250, and over time those benefits are \nshrinking in value. This puts a terrible squeeze on seniors.\n  With tens of millions of people more financially stressed as they \napproach retirement, with more and more people left out of the private \nretirement security system, and with the economic security of our \nfamilies unraveling, Social Security is rapidly becoming the only--\nonly--lifeline that millions of seniors have to keep their heads above \nwater. And yet instead of taking on the retirement crisis, instead of \nstrengthening Social Security, some in Washington are fighting to cut \nbenefits.\n  Just this morning the Washington Post ran an editorial mocking the \nidea of a looming retirement crisis. To make sure no one missed the \npoint, they even put the words ``retirement crisis'' in quotation \nmarks.\n  No retirement crisis? Tell that to the millions of Americans who are \nfacing retirement without a pension. Tell that to the millions of \nAmericans who have nothing to fall back on except Social Security. \nThere is a $6.6 trillion gap between what Americans under 65 are \ncurrently saving and what they will need to maintain their standard of \nliving when they hit retirement. Mr. President, $6.6 trillion--and that \nassumes that Social Security benefits are not cut. Make no mistake, \nthere is a crisis.\n  The call to cut Social Security has an uglier side to it too. The \nWashington Post framed the choice as more children in poverty versus \nmore seniors in poverty. The suggestion that we have become a country \nwhere those living in poverty fight each other for a handful of crumbs \ntossed off the tables of the very wealthy is fundamentally wrong. This \nis about our values, and our values tell us that we do not build a \nfuture by deciding first who among the vulnerable will be left to \nstarve.\n  Look at the basic facts. Today Social Security has a $2.7 trillion \nsurplus. If we do nothing, Social Security will be safe for the next 20 \nyears and even after that will continue to pay most benefits. With some \nmodest adjustments, we can keep the system solvent for many more \nyears--and we could even increase benefits.\n  The tools to help us build a future are available to us now. We do \nnot start the debate by deciding who gets kicked to the curb. We are \nAmericans. We start the debate by figuring out how to create better \nefficiencies, how to make small changes that will make the system \nfairer, how to grow the pool of those who contribute, and how to \nrebuild the system that every single one of us can rely on to make sure \nthere is a baseline in retirement that no one falls below.\n  We do not build a future for our children by cutting basic retirement \nbenefits for their grandparents. No. We build a future for our kids by \nstrengthening our economy, by investing in education and infrastructure \nand research, by rebuilding a strong and robust middle class in which \nevery kid gets a chance and the most vulnerable have a strong safety \nnet.\n  The most recent discussion about cutting benefits has focused on \nsomething called the chained CPI. Supporters of the chained CPI say it \nis a more accurate way of measuring the cost-of-living increases for \nseniors. That statement is simply not true. Chained CPI falls far short \nof the actual increases in costs that seniors face. Pure and simple, \nchained CPI is just a fancy way to say cut benefits.\n  The Bureau of Labor Statistics has developed a measure of the real \nimpact of inflation on seniors. It is called the CPI-E. If we adopt it \ntoday, it would generally increase the benefits for our retirees, not \ncut them. Social Security is not the answer for all of our retirement \nproblems. We need to find a way to tackle the financial squeeze that is \ncrushing our families. We need to help families start saving again. We \nneed to make sure more workers have access to better pensions. But in \nthe meantime, so long as those problems continue to exist and as long \nas we are in the midst of a real and growing retirement crisis, a \ncrisis that is shaking the foundations of what was once a vibrant and \nsecure middle class, the absolute last thing we want to do is cut \nSocial Security benefits. The absolute last thing we should do in 2013, \nat the very moment that Social Security has become the principal \nlifeline for millions of our seniors, is allow the program to be \ndismantled inch by inch.\n  Over the past generation, working families have been hacked at, \nchipped, and hammered. If we want a real middle class, a middle class \nthat continues to serve as the backbone of our country, then we must \ntake the retirement crisis seriously. Seniors have worked their entire \nlives and have paid into this system. But right now more people than \never are on the edge of financial disaster once they retire. The \nnumbers continue to get worse. That is why we should be talking about \nexpanding Social Security benefits, not cutting them.\n  Senator Harkin from Iowa, Senator Begich from Alaska, Senator Sanders \nfrom Vermont, and others have been\n\n[[Page S8086]]\n\npushing hard in that direction. Social Security is incredibly \neffective. It is incredibly popular. The calls for strengthening it are \ngrowing louder day by day.\n  The conversation about retirement and Social Security benefits is not \na conversation just about math. At its core this is a conversation \nabout our values. It is a conversation about who we are as a country \nand who we are as a people. I believe we honor our promises. We make \ngood on a system that millions of people paid into faithfully \nthroughout their working years. We support the right of every person to \nretire with dignity.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as I noted last week, despite the \nrepeated promises of President Obama, millions of people are losing \ntheir health insurance, health insurance they very much like and were \nassured that they could keep. It has been reported that so far 3.5 \nmillion Americans have lost their health insurance under ObamaCare. \nThat includes over one-quarter of a million in Kentucky, one-third of a \nmillion people in Florida, and almost a million people in California. \nThis is a serious problem that the President and congressional \nDemocrats need to do something about. Unfortunately, they appear to be \nrelying on half measures and creative accounting, not real solutions.\n  For example, we learned over the weekend that the administration's \ngoal is to have the Web site serve only 80 percent of users, which is \nprobably why our Democratic colleagues want to spend 100 percent of \ntheir time discussing other subjects, which brings us to the vote we \nwill have today.\n\n\n                              Nominations\n\n  For the third time in this work period, the majority will have the \nSenate vote on yet another nominee to the DC Circuit. This is not \nbecause the court needs more judges. It is the least busy court in our \nentire country. In fact, it is far less busy now than it was when \nSenate Democrats pocket-filibustered President Bush's nominee to that \ncourt, Peter Keisler, for 2 whole years. This is according to our \nDemocratic colleagues' own standards.\n  Our colleagues are having the Senate spend time on this because doing \nso furthers their twin political goals: first, to quote a member of the \nDemocratic leadership, to fill up that court because the President's \nagenda, according to an administration ally, runs through the DC \nCircuit; second, to divert as much attention as possible from the \nproblem-plagued ObamaCare rollout at this formative stage of the 2014 \ncampaign, according to published reports. In other words, rather than \nfocusing on keeping their commitment to the American people, they are \nfocusing on what appeals to their base. Rather than change the law that \nis causing so many problems for so many, they want to change the \nsubject.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate will not be voting on legislation to allow \nAmericans to keep their health insurance if they like it, as they were \npromised again and again and again. Rather, we will be voting on \nanother nominee for a court that does not have enough work to do. The \nSenate ought to be spending its time dealing with a real crisis, not a \nmanufactured one. We ought to be dealing with an ill-conceived law that \nis causing millions of Americans to lose their health insurance. \nInstead, we will spend our time today on a political exercise designed \nto distract the American people from the mess that is ObamaCare, rather \nthan trying to fix it.\n  Last week I also suggested that if our Democratic colleagues are \ngoing to ignore the fact that millions of people are losing their \nhealth insurance plans, they should at least be working with us to fill \njudicial emergencies that actually exist, rather than complaining about \nfake ones. I noted there are nominees on the Executive Calendar who \nwould fill actual judicial emergencies, unlike any of the DC Circuit \nnominations. Several of them, in fact, have been pending on the \ncalendar longer than the nomination on which we will be voting today. \nAnother week has gone by without any action by the majority to fill \nthese actual judicial emergencies. Rather than work with us to schedule \nvotes on them in an orderly manner as we have been doing, the majority \nchose to leapfrog over them in order to concoct a crisis on the DC \nCircuit so it can distract Americans from the failings of ObamaCare.\n  Unfortunately, our friends appear to be more concerned with playing \npolitics than with actually solving problems. So like last week, I will \nvote no on this afternoon's political exercise. As I said last week, I \nhope the Senate will focus on what the American people care about \nrather than spend its time trying to distract them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I am going to vote not to bring up the nomination of \nJudge Wilkins. I have some concerns about his record, but I am not \ngoing to focus on those concerns today, because there are a lot bigger \nissues we are dealing with. I have said it before and I will say it \nagain: By the standards the Democrats established in the year 2006, we \nshould not confirm anymore judges to the DC Circuit, especially when \nthose additional judges cost approximately $1 million per year per \njudge.\n  The fact of the matter is, this DC Circuit they want to make three \nmore appointments to--and this will be the third of these appointments \nwe have dealt with--is underworked. The statistics make it abundantly \nclear, but I am not going to go through them all again as I have in the \npast. I will mention a couple brief points regarding the caseload. The \nDC Circuit ranks last, for instance, in both the number of appeals \nfiled and the appeals terminated. These are the cases coming to the \ncourt and going out. Not only does DC rank last, but it is not even \nclose. To give you a frame of reference compared to DC, the Eleventh \nCircuit, which has the highest caseload, has over five times as many \nappeals as are filed here in the DC Circuit. The same is true for \nappeals terminated. Again, it is not even close. The Eleventh Circuit \nhas over five times as many appeals terminated as the DC Circuit.\n  The bottom line is that the DC Circuit does not have enough work as \nit is right now, let alone if we were to add even more judges, in this \ncase the President's desire to add three.\n  That is why the current judges on the court, the current judges, have \nwritten to me and said things such as: ``If any more judges were added \nnow, there wouldn't be enough work to go around.''\n  As I said last week, at least some on the other side concede that the \nDC Circuit's caseload is low, but they claim DC's caseload numbers \ndon't take into account the complexity of the court's docket based upon \nthe number of administrative appeals filed in that circuit.\n  As I have said, this argument doesn't stand against scrutiny. My \ncolleagues argue that the DC Circuit docket is complex because 43 \npercent of its dockets are made up of administrative appeals. Of \ncourse, there is a reason they cite a percentage rather than a number. \nThat is because it is a high percentage of a very small number.\n  When we look at the actual number of these so-called complex cases \nper judge, the Second Circuit has almost twice as many as the DC \nCircuit. In 2012 there were 512 administrative appeals filed in the DC \nCircuit, but in the Second Circuit there were 1,493 filed.\n  Stated differently, in DC there were only 64 administrative appeals \nper active judge. The Second Circuit has nearly twice as many with 115 \nfiles. Again, that is 64 administrative appeals per judge in DC \ncompared with almost twice as many with the Second Circuit at 115.\n\n[[Page S8087]]\n\n  This entire argument about complexity, I hope, comes out to be \nnonsense to most of my colleagues. To hear the other side, it is an \noutrage that we would hold them to the same standards they established \nin 2006 when they blocked Peter Keisler's nomination to the DC Circuit \nbased upon caseload.\n  Since that time, by the standard that the other side established, the \ncourt's caseload has declined even further. It has declined so much, in \nfact, that the number of appeals back then, with 10 acting judges, is \nroughly the same as there are now with 8 active judges. Again, we \ndidn't set this standard, the Democrats did.\n  That standard may be inconvenient for Democrats today, but that is \nnot a reason to abandon the standard they established. Remember, the \nother side established the Keisler standard after the so-called Gang of \n14 agreement. Even if that agreement hadn't expired by its own terms at \nthe end of the 109th Congress, the Democrats established the Keisler \nstandard after that agreement supposedly took effect.\n  As I have said, the other side has run out of legitimate arguments in \nsupport of these nominations. That is why they seem to be grasping at \nstraws.\n  When the other side gasps at straws, they get desperate. When the \nother side gets desperate, they turn to their last line of defense, \naccuse us Republicans of bias.\n  Over the last week or so, my colleagues on the other side have argued \nthat Republicans are opposing nominees based on gender. That argument--\nas I said last week and I still say--is offensive and patently absurd.\n  It is so absurd, in fact, that even the Los Angeles Times called the \nDemocrats' attempt to play the ``gender card'' a ``pretty bogus \nargument,'' noting that in the past Republicans have ``happily \nconfirmed female nominees.''\n  The fact is that the Republicans have supported over 80 women \nnominated to the bench by this President as well as a host of other \nnominees of diverse backgrounds. Those are the facts. It is unfortunate \nbut sadly predictable that facts may not mean much.\n  These allegations of gender bias are unfortunate because they \nrepresent cheap attacks that the other side knows are untrue. It also \nis unfortunate because the entire exercise is designed to create the \nappearance of a crisis where there is no crisis. There is no crisis in \nthe DC Circuit because they don't have enough work to do as it is. \nThere is a crisis occurring now all across the country as a result of \nthe health care reform bill that often goes by the terminology of \nObamaCare.\n  Millions of Americans are losing their health insurance, even though \nthe President promised over and over--we know the quote: ``If you like \nyour health care, you can keep it.''\n  Even though we have a very real and serious crisis facing this \ncountry because of ObamaCare, the other side is desperately trying to \ndivert attention to anything but the ObamaCare disaster.\n  This is how the Roll Call newspaper described this strategy:\n\n       Senate Democrats . . . are readying their next assertive \n     moves on three other issues important to their base:\n       Abortion rights\n       Minimum wage\n       Federal judiciary\n       The goal is to divert as much attention as possible away \n     from the problem-plagued ObamaCare rollout.\n\n  Let me get this straight. A crisis is unfolding all across this \ncountry as millions of Americans are losing their health insurance \nbecause of ObamaCare. Yet the Democrats' strategy, according to Roll \nCall, is to conceal the ObamaCare crisis by using the DC Circuit as a \nsmokescreen.\n  That is breathtaking, even by Washington, DC, standards. The other \nside is so eager to divert attention from the millions of Americans \nlosing their insurance because of ObamaCare that they are willing to \nmanufacture a crisis in the DC Circuit, even though the current judges \nsay: ``If any more judges were added now, there wouldn't be enough work \nto go around.''\n  Not only that, but after running out of legitimate arguments to \njustify the President's attempt to stack the deck on this court, the \nother side has resorted to making allegations of gender bias. I have \nalready explained that these allegations are offensive and absurd. But \nsince the other side's strategy is to conceal the ObamaCare train wreck \nwith a DC Circuit smokescreen and on top of that is willing to go so \nfar as to accuse our side of gender bias, then I am going to take the \nopportunity to share some of the frustrations being experienced by my \nconstituents in Iowa, meaning women in Iowa, as a result of ObamaCare.\n  A woman from Vinton, IA, writes:\n\n       After 28 days of complete frustration, I got to look at 30 \n     plans on the Iowa health care exchange at healthcare.gov. The \n     CHEAPEST one is $1,886 per year with a $6,300 deductible.\n       Last year, I spent $1,484 on health care. TOTAL. OUT OF MY \n     OWN POCKET. I wouldn't even meet the deductible paying almost \n     $350 a month on the one plan offered.\n       At that rate, what I spent TOTAL last year would be spent \n     on premiums in 4 months. . . .\n       With more and more policies being cancelled by the \n     insurance companies; with more and more doctors refusing to \n     serve patients with Obamacare; and with the increasing anger \n     towards elected officials, including President Obama, how do \n     you plan to fix this mess???\n\n  Another woman from Sioux City, IA, writes:\n\n       My company just had a meeting inform us of the changes to \n     our healthcare plan thanks to ``Obamacare''.\n       It is going to cost me $190 more each month next year for \n     my family coverage.\n       I am going to have to work more overtime, reduce my 401K \n     contributions and opt out of my Flex 125 contributions to try \n     to recover the extra money coming out of my paycheck because \n     of the new laws. . . .\n       While I suppose I should count myself lucky I didn't lose \n     my employer health insurance coverage, I sure don't feel \n     happy about the extra money I am going to have to pay for the \n     same coverage I was getting this year. What a joke.\n       I wish there was something that could be done about this. \n     Socialized health care . . .\n\n  Then she used a word that I can't repeat in the Senate.\n  From a mom in Dayton, IA:\n\n       Our family's health insurance agency contacted us last week \n     to set up an appointment to talk to us about the changes in \n     our health coverage due to Obamacare.\n       We went to the meeting and found out that our HSA that we \n     currently have will no longer be available because of \n     Obamacare, plus our monthly rate will go from $350.00/month \n     to $570.00/month.\n       We have no idea how we are going to afford this increase. \n     We feel blindsided. I know that you are committed to helping \n     Iowans, as well as all Americans, so I ask that you keep \n     fighting for affordable healthcare.\n\n  My final message is from a woman in Melbourne, IA, who writes:\n\n       I got a full in your face understanding of just how \n     horrible it was today when I went to renew my insurance.\n       I currently pay $110 every two weeks for insurance for my \n     whole family.\n       Next year I will have to pay over $500 every two weeks to \n     insure my family.\n       The healthcare website Obamacare created is no better. I \n     can't even get the website to work properly. It will not \n     allow me to put my husband on a joint policy with me. . . . I \n     actually have to weigh which is cheaper . . . paying the fine \n     or paying for insurance. Sadly it will probably be paying the \n     fine.\n\n  These are real stories from real women facing a real crisis in only 1 \nState of the 50 States, my State of Iowa. Of course, this isn't \nhappening only in my State. Far from it. This is happening to millions \nof Americans all across the country.\n  Rather than focus on this crisis, a real crisis, the other side has \ndeveloped a strategy specifically designed to divert attention from it. \nThat strategy is to use the DC Circuit as a smokescreen.\n  In summary, the judges themselves say: ``If any more judges were \nadded now, there wouldn't be enough work to go around.''\n  Even though we shouldn't fill these seats based upon the Democratic \nstandard set in 2006 and even though filling these seats would waste $3 \nmillion per year in taxpayers' money that we don't have, the other side \nseems, in an unreasonable way, bent upon manufacturing a crisis for \ncynical, political reasons.\n  I urge my colleagues on the other side to come to their senses. Let \nus start focusing on the real crisis facing this country. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote no on the Wilkins cloture petition.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S8088]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/18/senate-section/article/S8088-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8088]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO CONGRESSMAN DICK NICHOLS\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, last month I was at the World War II \nMemorial greeting a number of Kansans who had arrived on an Honor \nFlight, and I certainly want to pay tribute to each of our service men \nand women and veterans. What a great experience it was on a beautiful \nday at the memorial. One of those veterans is someone I wish to talk \nabout this evening to my colleagues here in the Senate.\n  Getting off the bus that day was my friend and a former Member of the \nU.S. House of Representatives for the Fifth Congressional District of \nKansas, Dick Nichols. There are many things I admire about Kansans. \nFolks from my home State always look out for others. They commit their \nlives to helping and improving the lives of their communities, our \nState, and our Nation in order to make certain there is an even better \nopportunity for the next generation. Congressman Nichols is certainly \none of those individuals. I wish to pay my regards to him today.\n  Dick was born in Kansas, raised in Fort Scott, and served during \nWorld War II as an ensign in the U.S. Navy. After serving our Nation \nwith great integrity and humility, he pursued and achieved a bachelor's \ndegree in science from Kansas State University in 1951. Congressman \nNichols is a supporter of education but particularly a supporter of \neducation that comes from Kansas State University. He is a Wildcat \nthrough and through.\n  Dick worked in a number of roles related to agriculture and banking \nin both the Topeka and Hutchinson communities in our State before he \nmoved to McPherson--his home now. In McPherson, he began his career as \na longtime community banker at the Home State Bank. He became president \nof that bank in 1969, and in 1986 he was elected to serve as president \nof the Kansas Bankers Association.\n  That same year Dick got some national notoriety: He was stabbed on \nthe Staten Island Ferry by a homeless refugee from Cuba while touring \nthe Statue of Liberty. While recuperating in the hospital, he was \nvisited by then-New York Mayor Ed Koch, who apologized on behalf of the \ncity of New York for the event. He was also invited to the Johnny \nCarson show to tell of his experiences in New York City. But even \nduring that particular event, what he said on the talk show and what he \ntold Mayor Koch was that he always looked for the best in every person \nand in every situation.\n  Dick continued as an active banker and served as the president and \nchairman of the board of his bank until he was elected to the U.S. \nCongress in 1990. Due to reapportionment in our State following the \n1990 census, his district, the Fifth District, was eliminated and we \nwent from five congressional districts to four, and Dick returned to \nthe Home State Bank as chairman of its board. But whether he was a \nCongressman representing the Fifth District, a community banker in his \nhometown, or an ensign in the U.S. Navy, Dick always put service to \nothers above self-interest.\n  Prior to his election to office in Congress, he was active in Kansas \npolitics and particularly Republican politics. In my first campaign in \n1996 for the U.S. House of Representatives, it was an honor for me to \nhave him agree to serve as my campaign's honorary chairman.\n  In addition to his political involvement, Dick was also engaged in so \nmany other things, many of them related to the community he cares so \nmuch about, McPherson, KS, including the chamber of commerce and the \nRotary Club. He became the commanding general of the Kansas Cavalry, \nwhich is a group of business men and women from across our State who \nband together to recruit and encourage new businesses to come to our \nState, and he continued to serve other service men and women and \nveterans through his membership and participation in the American \nLegion and VFW.\n  Dick has often been quoted as saying:\n\n       Much of life is in our mental attitude. If you think great \n     things might happen, they do. If you question them ever \n     happening, they won't.\n\n  I agree with that sentiment, and I have seen Dick Nichols live that \nin his life. Because of his attitude and character, many--including \nme--were inspired not only to get to know him but then to try to model \ntheir public service after his.\n  In McPherson, there are few people more loved and respected than Dick \nNichols. It is a privilege for me to be able to call him a friend and \nmentor. When I initially ran for Congress and needed advice about his \ncommunity and his county, he was the first person I reached out to. I \nalways remember, as I was campaigning for the very first time for \noffice in Congress, I had people tell me: If you are a friend of Dick \nNichols', you are a friend of mine. And it is an opportunity we all \nought to take to remember that how we conduct ourselves influence and \naffect so many others.\n  While I know that what happens here in the Senate and what happens in \nWashington, DC, has huge consequences and effect upon Kansans and \nAmericans--and, in fact, people around the globe--I continue to believe \nthat we change the world one person at a time, and it happens in \ncommunities across my State and across the country. Dick Nichols \nrepresents the kind of person who changes lives--in fact, changes the \nlife of every person he meets.\n  So today, having seen Dick Nichols just a few weeks ago at the World \nWar II Memorial, built in his and other World War II veterans' honor, I \nexpress my gratitude to Congressman Nichols for his service to his \ncommunity, to our State of Kansas, and to our Nation. And I use this \nopportunity to remind myself about the true nature of public service, \nabout caring for other people. I wish Dick and his wife Linda and their \nfamilies all the very best.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the nomination of Robert Leon \nWilkins to be United States Circuit Judge.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Robert Leon \nWilkins, of the District of Columbia, to be United States Circuit Judge \nfor the District Of Columbia Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 5:30 \np.m. will be equally divided and controlled in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nnomination of Judge Robert L. Wilkins to be a circuit judge for the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. I \nwas pleased to introduce Judge Wilkins to the Judiciary Committee in \nSeptember, and the committee favorably reported his nomination in \nOctober.\n  Judge Wilkins currently serves as Federal District Judge for the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia, and was unanimously \nconfirmed by the Senate for this position in 2010. I urge the Senate to \ninvoke cloture to allow an up-or-down vote on this extremely qualified \nnominee.\n  Judge Wilkins is a native of Muncie, IN. He obtained his B.S. cum \nlaude in chemical engineering from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, \nand his J.D. from Harvard Law School.\n  Following graduation, Judge Wilkins clerked for the Honorable Earl B. \nGilliam of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of \nCalifornia. He later served as a staff attorney and as head of Special \nLitigation for the Public Defender Service for the District of \nColumbia. He then practiced as a partner with Venable LLP, specializing \nin white collar defense, intellectual property, and complex civil \nlitigation, before taking the bench as a judge.\n\n[[Page S8089]]\n\n  Besides Wilkins' professional accomplishments as an attorney, he also \nplayed a leading role as a plaintiff in a landmark civil rights case in \nMaryland involving racial profiling. During his tenure with the Public \nDefender Service and in private practice, Judge Wilkins served as the \nlead plaintiff in Wilkins, et al. v. State of Maryland, a civil rights \nlawsuit against the Maryland State Police for a traffic stop they \nconducted of Judge Wilkins and his family.\n  In 1992, Judge Wilkins attended his grandfather's funeral in Chicago, \nand then began an all-night road trip home with three family members. \nJudge Wilkins was due back in Washington, DC that coming morning for a \ncourt appearance as a public defender. A Maryland State Police trooper \npulled over their car. The police detained the family and deployed a \ndrug-sniffing dog to check the car, after Judge Wilkins declined to \nconsent to a search of the car, stating there was no reasonable \nsuspicion. The family stood in the rain during the search, which did \nnot undercover any contraband.\n\n       It is hard to describe the frustration and pain you feel \n     when people pressure you to be guilty for no good reason, and \n     you know that you are innocent . . . [W]e fit the profile to \n     a tee. We were traveling on I-68, early in the morning, in a \n     Virginia rental car. And, my cousin and I, the front seat \n     passengers, were young black males. The only problem was that \n     we were not dangerous, armed drug traffickers. It should not \n     be suspicious to travel on the highway early in the morning \n     in a Virginia rental car. And it should not be suspicious to \n     be black.\n\n  After the traffic stop, Judge Wilkins began reviewing Maryland State \nPolice data, and noticed that while a majority of those drivers \nsearched on 1-95 were black, blacks made up only a minority of drivers \ntraveling there.\n  Judge Wilkins filed a civil rights lawsuit, which resulted in two \nlandmark settlements that were the first to require systematic \ncompilation and publication by a police agency of data for all highway \ndrug and weapons searches, including data regarding the race of the \nmotorist involved, the justification for the search and the outcome of \nthe search. The settlements also required the State police to hire an \nindependent consultant, install video cameras in their vehicles, \nconduct internal investigations of all citizen complaints of racial \nprofiling, and provide the Maryland NAACP with quarterly reports \ncontaining detailed information on the number, nature, location, and \ndisposition of racial profiling complaints.\n  These settlements inspired a June 1999 executive order by President \nClinton, Congressional hearings and legislation that has been enacted \nin over half of the 50 States.\n  It was a landmark case. It pointed out the right way in which we \nshould conduct oversight and the right way to end racial profiling. \nJudge Wilkins took the leadership and did something that many of us \nwould have had a hard time doing, putting himself forward in order to \ndo what was right.\n  As my colleagues know, I have introduced S. 1038, the End Racial \nProfiling Act--ERPA--which would codify many of the practices now used \nby the Maryland State Police to root out the use of racial profiling by \nlaw enforcement. The Judiciary Committee held a hearing on ending the \nuse of racial profiling last year, and I am hopeful that with the \nbroader discussion on racial profiling generated by the tragic Trayvon \nMartin case that we can come together and move forward on this \nlegislation.\n  Judge Wilkins played a key role in the passage of the federal statute \nestablishing the National Museum of African American History and \nCulture Plan for Action Presidential Commission, and he served as the \nChairman of the Site and Building Committee of that Presidential \nCommission. The work of the Presidential Commission led to the passage \nof Public Law No. 108-184, which authorized the creation of the \nNational Museum of African American History and Culture. This museum \nwill be the newest addition to the Smithsonian, and it is scheduled to \nopen in 2015 between the National Museum of American History and the \nWashington Monument on the National Mall.\n  Judge Wilkins continues his pro bono work to this day. He currently \nserves as the Court liaison to the Standing Committee on Pro Bono Legal \nServices of the Judicial Conference of the DC Circuit. He is committed \nto public service and equal justice under the law.\n\n  As a U.S. district judge for the District of Columbia since 2011, \nJudge Wilkins has presided over hundreds of civil and criminal cases, \nincluding both jury and bench trials. Judge Wilkins already sits on a \nFederal bench which hears an unusual number of cases of national \nimportance to the Federal Government, including complex election law, \nvoting rights, environmental, securities, and administrative law cases. \nIndeed, Judge Wilkins has been nominated for the appellate court that \nwould directly hear appeals from the court on which he currently sits. \nHe understands the responsibilities of the court that he has been \nnominated to by President Obama.\n  The American Bar Association gave Judge Wilkins a rating of \nunanimously well qualified to serve as a Federal appellate judge, which \nis the highest possible rating from the nonpartisan peer review.\n  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is \nalso referred to as the Nation's second-highest court. The Supreme \nCourt only accepts a handful of cases each year, so the DC Circuit \noften has the last word and proclaims the final law of the land in a \nrange of critical areas of the law. Only 8 of the 11 seats of the court \nauthorized by the Congress are filled, resulting in a higher than 25-\npercent vacancy rate on this critical court.\n  This court handles unusually complex cases in the area of \nadministrative law, including revealing decisions and rulemaking of \nmany Federal agencies in policy areas such as environmental, labor, and \nfinancial regulations. Nationally, only about 15 percent of the appeals \nare administrative in nature. In the DC Circuit, that figure is 43 \npercent. They have a much larger caseload of complex cases. The court \nalso hears a variety of sensitive terrorism cases involving complicated \nissues such as enemy combatants and detention policies.\n  I have a quote from former Chief Judge Henry Edwards who said:\n\n       [R]eview of large, multiparty, difficult administrative \n     appeals is the staple of judicial work in the DC Circuit. \n     This alone distinguishes the work of the DC Circuit from the \n     work of other circuits. It also explains why it is impossible \n     to compare the work of the DC Circuit with other circuits by \n     simply referring to raw data on case filings.\n\n  Chief Justice Roberts noted that ``about two-thirds of the cases \nbefore the DC Circuit involved the Federal Government in some civil \ncapacity, while that figure is less than twenty-five percent \nnationwide.'' He also described the ``D.C. Circuit's unique character, \nas a court with special responsibility to review legal challenges to \nthe conduct of the national government.''\n  We have a person who is imminently qualified for this position in \nJudge Wilkins. We have a need to fill these vacancies. The Senate \nshould carry out its responsibility and conduct an up-or-down vote on \nJudge Wilkins' nomination. We are going to have a chance to do that in \na few moments.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that the Senate unanimously confirmed \nJudge Wilkins in 2010 for his current position, and he has a \ndistinguished lifelong record of public service.\n  I ask the Senate and my colleagues to vote so we can move forward and \nget an up-or-down vote on this imminently qualified judge, and I hope \nmy colleagues will support his confirmation.\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senate today takes yet another unnecessary cloture \nvote on a nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, a \ncourt that needs no more judges. Applying the same standards that \nDemocrats used to oppose Republican nominees to this court shows \nwithout a doubt that it needs no more judges today.\n  In July 2006, Judiciary Committee Democrats--including four still \nserving on the committee today--wrote chairman Arlen Specter explaining \ntwo reasons for opposing more DC Circuit appointments. The caseload of \nthe court had declined, Democrats wrote, and more pressing ``judicial \nemergency'' vacancies had not been filled. Today, as we also debate \nnominees to the DC Circuit, Democrats will not only mention, let alone \napply, the criteria they used in the past. But if we are going to have \nmore than a totally political, completely partisan judicial \nconfirmation process, I believe we should do just that.\n  In 2006, Democrats opposed more DC Circuit appointments because \nwritten\n\n[[Page S8090]]\n\ndecisions per active judge had declined by 17 percent. Since 2006, \nwritten decisions per active judge have declined by an even greater 27 \npercent. In 2006, Democrats opposed more DC Circuit appointments \nbecause total appeals had declined by 10 percent. Since 2006, total \nappeals have declined by an even greater 18 percent. The DC Circuit's \ncaseload not only continues to decline, but is declining faster than \nbefore.\n  In 2006, Democrats opposed more DC Circuit appointments because there \nwere 20 judicial emergency vacancies and there were nominees for only \n60 percent of them. Since 2006, judicial emergency vacancies have \nnearly doubled and the percentage of those vacancies with nominees has \ndeclined to less than 50 percent.\n  These are not my criteria. I did not pull these criteria out of the \nair this morning because they helped the political spin surrounding \nthis cloture vote. After all, it takes only an agenda and a calculator \nto create a politically useful statistic. No, these are the very same \ncriteria that Democrats used to oppose Republican nominees to this very \nsame court. No Democrat has yet admitted that they were wrong to use \nthese criteria in 2006 or explained why we should use different \ncriteria today simply because the other political party controls the \nWhite House.\n  Since these facts are so uncomfortable, Democrats simply ignore them \nand try a new tactic, claiming that the DC Circuit's caseload is at \nleast not the lowest in the country. I really wish the truth mattered \nmore around here, especially when it is so easy to identify. The \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts ranks the 12 circuits of the \nU.S. Court of Appeals on different measures of their caseload and have \nposted on its website the rankings for the past 17 years. Without \nexception, the DC Circuit has ranked last, 12th out of 12 circuits, in \nboth appeals being filed and appeals being terminated.\n  Some, including the Judiciary Committee chairman just last week, \nclaim that the DC Circuit is busier than the Tenth Circuit, which \nincludes my State of Utah. I have no idea how that is relevant to \nwhether the DC Circuit needs more judges today. But even if that made \nsense, the claim is simply not true. The only caseload measure he now \nmentions is ``pending cases,'' which is least relevant because it is a \nsnapshot rather than a measure of the flow of cases through the court. \nBut here's what a brief look at the Administrative Office's database \nquickly shows. This year is the only year in nearly two decades when \nthe Tenth Circuit ever had more pending cases than the DC Circuit.\n  The Tenth and DC Circuits have been the same size for many years, and \nsince 2008 the DC Circuit has had one fewer authorized judgeship. This \nyear, the Tenth Circuit had 87 percent more new appeals, 150 percent \nmore written decisions per active judge, and 220 percent more appeals \nterminated on the merits. Rather than using an irrelevant criterion \nfrom a single year, as Democrats do, I looked at these relevant \ncriteria over the last 20 years. The Tenth Circuit has always had a \nhigher caseload than the DC Circuit and, if anything, the gulf between \nthem has increased over time.\n  Why are my Democratic colleagues trying so hard to ignore or distort \nthe cold, hard facts? What is so crucial about appointing these \nparticular nominees to this particular court at this particular time? \nThe most obvious reason is also the most political. This court has \njurisdiction over actions of the executive branch agencies that \nPresident Obama needs to pursue his political agenda. His go-it-alone \nstrategy increasingly avoids Congress, the only branch directly elected \nby and representing the American people. He appears to think that the \nthree branches are interchangeable, that the political ends justify the \npolitical means.\n  The DC Circuit is evenly balanced today, with four Republican and \nfour Democratic appointees. So President Obama sees this as his chance \nto stack the DC Circuit with judges he believes will approve his \nagenda.\n  If we still believe in an independent judiciary, if we want to \npreserve at least a little integrity and not lose all confidence of the \nAmerican people in the confirmation process, then we should stop this \npartisan gambit. We should do what Democrats in 2006 did. We should use \nmeaningful, objective criteria to conclude that the DC Circuit needs no \nmore judges today and instead focus on confirming qualified nominees to \ncourts that need them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I listened to the words of my good friend \nfrom Maryland. He is absolutely right in what he said. It is a strange \ntime. I have been here almost four decades, and I have experienced some \ndramatic changes in the Senate majorities and leadership styles going \nback and forth between both parties. But nothing at all has compared to \nthe change that has occurred in the last 5 years.\n  Since President Obama was sworn in as President of the United States, \nwhat has occurred here is something I have never seen with any other \nPresident, and I have been here since the time of President Ford. \nSenate Republicans have made it their priority to obstruct at every \nturn the consideration of nominations that he has put forward. The \nRepublican leader has said that his main goal was to have the President \nfail. Confirmation votes that regularly occurred by consent, now \nrequire a lengthy cloture process. Bipartisan and home state support \nfor a nominee no longer ensures a timely confirmation.\n  Make no mistake, through this obstruction, Senate Republicans have \ncrossed the line from use of the Senate rules to abuse of the Senate \nrules. It is the same kind of abuse that shut down our Federal \nGovernment recently and cost the taxpayers billions of dollars. One of \nthe things that concerns me, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, is what it is doing to undermine, and eventually destroy, \nboth the integrity and independence of our Federal judiciary.\n  One of the great glories of our country's three-part government is \nthe independence of the Federal Judiciary. But, over the last 5 years, \nSenate Republicans have dragged it into politics. This severely impacts \nthe ability of our Federal justice system to serve the interests of the \nAmerican people.\n  If you are a litigant and need the protection of our Federal courts, \nyou do not care whether a judge is a Republican or Democrat. You do not \ncare whether they were nominated by a Republican or a Democratic \nPresident. All you expect--whether you are a plaintiff or defendant, \nState or respondent--is to be able to go into that courthouse and be \ntreated fairly. But, if you go to that courthouse now, there is nobody \nthere due to the 93 vacancies caused by the stonewalling on the other \nside of the aisle.\n  The same Republicans who are stonewalling now once insisted that \nfilibustering judicial nominees was unconstitutional. The Constitution \nhas not changed but when a Democrat was elected to the White House, \nthey reversed course and filibustered this President's very first \njudicial nominee. Can you imagine? Within a very short time after the \nPresident was sworn in, the very first person was filibustered. That \nwas the precedent they started.\n  Incidentally, that judicial nominee had the strong support of the \nmost senior Republican then serving in the Senate. The most senior \nRepublican Senator supported that nomination, but his leadership said: \nNo, we have to filibuster and block the nomination because, after all, \nit was President Obama's nomination, not President Bush's nomination.\n  This is the pattern Senate Republicans continued to follow, \nfilibustering 34 of President Obama's judicial nominees. This is nearly \ntwice as many nominees than required cloture during President Bush's \ntwo terms. Almost all of these nominees were, by any standard, \nnoncontroversial, but it took a great deal of effort by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee members and by Majority Leader Reid to get to a \nsimple up or down vote on those confirmations. Most of these nominees \nwere supported by well-known names in the law, both Republicans and \nDemocrats, but we still had to fight and get cloture to get them \nthrough.\n  Most recently, Senate Republicans have decided to filibuster well-\nqualified nominee after well-qualified nominee for the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the DC Circuit. This court has three vacant seats.\n  During the Bush Administration, the Senate confirmed President Bush's \nnominees to the 9th, 10th, and 11th\n\n[[Page S8091]]\n\nseats. Then when there was again a vacancy in the 10th seat, and the \nSenate confirmed President Bush's second nominee for the 10th seat. \nBut, now, when a new President has been elected--and I might say \nreelected by a solid majority--the Senate Republicans say: Oh, no, wait \na minute. We needed those judges when there was a Republican President. \nWe don't need them now that there is a Democrat President. The Senate \nRepublican blockade of DC Circuit nominees is at an unprecedented level \nof obstruction. In my four decades here, I have never seen anything \nlike what the Senate Republicans are doing--by either party. As Maine's \nformer senior Senator Olympia Snowe recently said, ``When you have \nthese back-to-back rejections of nominees, at some point it may be \ntrying to reverse the results of the election.''\n  I fear that the obstruction will continue tonight, when we will try \nto end the filibuster against Judge Robert Wilkins. Judge Wilkins was \nunanimously confirmed to the U.S. District Court for the District of \nColumbia less than three years ago. He has presided over hundreds of \ncases and issued significant decisions in various areas of the law, \nincluding in the fields of administrative and constitutional law. Prior \nto serving on the bench, he was a partner for nearly 10 years in \nprivate practice and served more than 10 years as a public defender in \nthe District of Columbia.\n  This is a man who under past Presidents and in past Senates would \nprobably be confirmed by a voice vote after dozens of Senators of both \nparties stood on the floor to praise him. The difference today is that \nJudge Wilkins was nominated by President Obama, and suddenly Republican \nSenators are trying to block him.\n  During his time at the Public Defender Service, Judge Wilkins served \nas the lead plaintiff in a racial profiling case, which arose out of an \nincident in which he and three family members were stopped and detained \nwhile returning from a funeral in Chicago. This lawsuit led to landmark \nsettlements that required systematic statewide compilation and \npublication of highway traffic stop and search data by race.\n  These settlements inspired an Executive order by President Clinton, \nlegislation in the House and Senate, and legislation in at least 28 \nStates prohibiting racial profiling or requiring data collection. It \nwas a landmark case. The distinguished Presiding Officer and I come \nfrom States where we hope we do not have racial profiling. But, many \nSenators here know there are cases of racial profiling. I am aware of \nthat happening even to members of my own family. I believe this \npractice should be stopped.\n  Despite the progress made in the past several decades, the struggle \nto diversify our Federal bench continues. If confirmed, Judge Wilkins \nwould be only the sixth African American to have ever served on what is \noften considered the second most powerful court in our country, the DC \nCircuit.\n  Judge Wilkins has earned the ABA's highest possible rating of \nunanimously well qualified. Most attorneys nominated to the federal \ncourts by Republicans or Democrats wish they had Judge Wilkins' \nprofessional experience and qualifications. Judge Wilkins also has the \nsupport of the National Bar Association, the nation's largest \nprofessional association of African-American lawyers and judges, as \nwell as several other prominent legal organizations. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record a list of letters in support of \nJudge Wilkins.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Letters in Support of the Nomination of Judge Robert Wilkins\n\n       July 31, 2013--Diverse group of 97 organizations in support \n     of Judge Wilkins, and the other two D.C.

Republicans said the DC Circuit should be operating at \nfull strength when President Bush held office. What is the difference \nbetween President Obama and President Bush's nominees? If it made sense \nto be operating at full strength with a Republican President, shouldn't \nit be operating at full strength under a Democratic President?\n  The Senate should consider Judge Wilkins based on his qualifications, \nand not hide behind some pretextual argument that most Americans can \nsee through. As today's Washington Post editorial states, ``It's \ntransparently self-serving of GOP lawmakers to oppose D.C. Circuit \nnominees only when it's a Democrat's turn to pick them.'' I as \nunanimous consent to have this editorial printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 17, 2013]\n\n          Judicial Nominees Face Unfair Hurdles in the Senate\n\n                        (By the Editorial Board)\n\n       Senate Republicans on Monday are likely to take a vote that \n     is unfair, unwise and bad for the functioning of the \n     government. Again.\n       For the third time in three weeks, the Senate will consider \n     a presidential nominee to the powerful U.S. Court of Appeals \n     for the District of Columbia Circuit. The first two nominees, \n     Patricia Millett and Cornelia Pillard, failed to attract the \n     60 votes necessary to clear GOP filibusters. There's little \n     reason to think that dynamic will change for the third, Judge \n     Robert Wilkins.\n       Senate Republicans are not assessing these nominees on \n     their merits, as each deserves. Rather, Republicans have made \n     them victims of a toxic and unresolvable ``debate'' about the \n     proper size of the D.C. Circuit. Republicans accuse President \n     Obama of attempting to tilt its ideological balance, which, \n     of course, he is. And they argue that the court isn't busy \n     enough to require its vacant seats to be filled. Democrats \n     insist the court still needs more active judges, and they \n     point out that Republicans attempted to fill the court during \n     the George W. Bush years, when the caseload wasn't much \n     different.\n       But the question of whether the D.C. Circuit needs all 11 \n     of its judicial slots doesn't need to be resolved to offer \n     the president's legitimate nominees a fair up-or-down vote, \n     and Republicans are wrong to use that as a pretext to block \n     them. It's transparently self-serving of GOP lawmakers to \n     oppose D.C. Circuit nominees only when it's a Democrat's turn \n     to pick them. If Republicans truly are concerned that the \n     court is too large, they should offer a plan to reduce its \n     size--in future presidencies. That would separate raw \n     partisan motivation from authentic concern about the state of \n     the court system, and it's the only sensible way to make \n     changes to its size amid sharp partisan contention. In the \n     meantime, Republicans should give the president's legitimate, \n     well-qualified nominees a fair hearing, instead of degrading \n     further the already-broken process of staffing the government \n     and the courts.\n       If the ``debate'' about the D.C. Circuit's size should \n     doesn't end that way, Democrats might end it in another. Some \n     of them would like to unblock the road for the president's \n     nominees by forcing rules changes that would limit the \n     filibuster. Following the rejection of the two women and Mr. \n     Wilkins, who is African American, even some fairly even-\n     keeled senators might be inclined to agree. That's a perilous \n     path for the chamber that both sides probably would regret \n     taking.\n       Instead, adults in the GOP should finally get together with \n     Democrats and hammer out an understanding--the way previous \n     judicial nomination crises have been resolved.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The halls are full of people talking about whether we are \ngoing to have a change in the cloture rule. I hope it does not come to \nthat. But, make no mistake: the reason there is momentum toward \nconsidering a change in our rules is this kind of pettifoggery, delay \nfor the sake of delay,\n\n[[Page S8092]]\n\nand treating this President differently from past Presidents.\n  If the Republican caucus continues to abuse the filibuster rules and \nobstruct these fine nominees without justification, then I believe this \nbody must consider anew whether a rules change should be in order. As I \nstated above, that is not a change that I want to see happen but if \nRepublican Senators are going to hold nominations hostage without \nconsideration of their individual merit, drastic measures may be \nwarranted.\n  Earlier this year, nearly every single Senate Democrat pushed the \nMajority Leader for a rules change in the face of Republican \nobstruction. I was one of the few members of the majority who voiced \nconcern about changing the Senate rules. I believe that if Republicans \nfilibuster yet another well-qualified nominee to this court tonight, it \nwill be a tipping point. Senate Republicans have blocked three well-\nqualified women in a row from receiving a confirmation vote and now \nthey are on the brink of filibustering the next nominee, Judge Robert \nWilkins. I fear that after tonight the talk about changing the cloture \nrules for judicial nominations will no longer be just talk. There will \nbe action. We cannot allow this unprecedented, wholesale obstruction to \ncontinue without undermining the Senate's role provided in the \nConstitution and without harming our independent Federal judiciary.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 91 and the nays are \n0. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the first \namendments in order to S. 1197, the Defense authorization bill, be the \nfollowing two amendments. First, an editorial comment. These are two \nvery important amendments that I think we should resolve. The \nGuantanamo amendment--I think most all Democrats accept what is in the \nbill. The White House accepts what is in the bill. The Republicans and \na few others want to change what is in the bill. We should have debate \nand a vote on that. I think that is appropriate. Gillibrand--that is an \namendment that has received a lot of attention, and we should have that \ndebate now. It has received nationwide attention.\n  So let's start over. The reason I mentioned these two, and these two \nonly, tonight--I ask unanimous consent that the first amendments in \norder to S. 1197 be the following: the Republican leader or designee \nrelative to Guantanamo and Gillibrand or designee relative to sexual \nassault; that each amendment be subject to one side-by-side amendment \nrelevant to the amendment it is paired with; that a McCaskill-Ayotte \namendment be considered the side-by-side to the Gillibrand amendment \nand the majority leader or designee have the side-by-side to the \nRepublican Guantanamo amendment; that no second-degree amendments be in \norder to any of these amendments; that each of these amendments and any \nside-by-side be subject to a 60-affirmative vote threshold; that each \nside-by-side amendment be voted on prior to the amendment to which they \nwere offered; further, that no motions to recommit be in order during \nthe consideration of the bill; finally, that upon disposition of these \namendments, I be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me \nfirst say to my good friend the leader that I wholeheartedly agree that \narguably the two most significant amendments and most controversial \namendments that have to be addressed would be on Guantanamo and then, \nof course, the Gillibrand amendment on sexual assault. I think we \nprobably have different views and positions, but I think we agree that \nthese need to be addressed immediately.\n  My wish has been that we could do that and line up some of the other \namendments but at the same time put ourselves in a position where we \ncould have open amendments on our side. There is a great demand in our \nconference to have open amendments. I would like to get to the point \nwhere we could do that and have them somehow regulated so that they be \nrelative to the subject matter of the bill, S. 1197.\n  So that would be my concern, and for that reason I would object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I hope we can work on additional amendments \nbeyond these two after they are disposed of. It is an important bill. \nWe need to finish it before we leave here this week, and it is a big \ntask to do that. It is my understanding that Senator Levin, working \nwith the ranking member, has already had some serious conversations \nabout how to move forward, conferencing, preconferencing, and even \nthough the ranking member has been indisposed because of a medical \ncondition that lasted just a short period of time, he has been in touch \nwith his staff and Senator Levin on almost a daily basis. So I hope we \ncan move beyond these two amendments. I would sure like to get these \ntwo amendments out of the way as soon as possible.\n  As far as an open amendment process, I think that was then and we are \nhere now. I am not sure that is going to happen on this bill. If we \ncould work something out for a finite list of amendments or something \nthat could help us get this done, I would be happy to be as reasonable \nas I can.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, would the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. REID. Of course.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The majority leader has said we have to finish this bill \nthis week. If we can't make progress on amendments that we agree should \nbe called up and are important amendments--one coming basically from \neach side, even though there will probably be votes from each side for \nand against these amendments--if we can't make progress on these \namendments where everyone seems to agree we ought to start moving, I am \nworried about the prospects of finishing this week. Frankly, I am \nworried anyway. I am very much worried. It has to happen. We have to \nfinish this week or else we can't get to conference. We have to get to \nconference and then come back. So I hope that in the morning perhaps \nthe majority leader might renew that unanimous consent request because \nthe objection to it is going to make it less likely we can get our bill \npassed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, to the senior Senator from Michigan, the \nchairman of this most prestigious and important committee, what I think \nwould be a real shame is if we wind up having to file cloture on the \nbill as it is written. I know the committee did great work. They worked \nvery hard, and the vast majority of the time they did it on a \nbipartisan basis to get the bill to where it is now. It would be a \nshame to have to file cloture on the bill itself. I would hope that if \nwe have to do that, we can get cloture on it and get on with the \nconference. But I am very troubled. Today is Monday, and I would be \nhappy to renew my request as soon as I get here in the morning, but I \nwould hope that the people who are working on these two important \npieces of legislation at the very least would come and start talking \nabout them. Everyone knows what the amendments are. They may not be \nable to pass a test on every word in the amendments, but we know the \nconcept of the amendments. Let them come and start talking about these \namendments. To this stage, they have been negotiated and debated in the \npress. Let's debate them here on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Would the leader yield?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I hope the leader is aware that I have just as strong \nfeelings about these amendments. It is a starting place. And the leader \nsaid we need to be talking about it. I came down today and talked about \nboth of these amendments at some length.\n  While I say we may not be in agreement with the amendments, they need \nto be debated. Historically, every year since I have been here, I say \nthrough the Chair, we have had a lot of amendments. We have always been \nable to get it through--50, 51 years-- Mr. REID. It was 52, I think.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Fifty-two, and we are going to do it this time and I hope \nsatisfy some of the concerns in our caucus at the same time.\n  I thank the leader for his comments, and I want him to know we are in \nagreement on getting to these amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before I yield to my friend from Michigan, \nthere are things in this bill that are not resolved in the Defense \nappropriations bill that authorize things to be done in the military \nthat can only be done by authorizing them. So I myself am very \nconcerned about being able to move forward on this bill. We do not live \nin a vacuum. We have to work something out with the appropriate \ncommittees in the House of Representatives and then have both the House \nand the Senate vote. That is what conferences are all about. Time is of \nthe essence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma, my \nranking member, the ranking member on\n\n[[Page S8094]]\n\nArmed Services, because I know how much he wants to get to this bill. I \ndo not understand the objection that I know is not his personally but \ncomes from his side. I do not understand how we are advancing this bill \nand advancing the cause of reaching debate on amendments on this bill \nby objecting to move to the amendments that I think everybody wants to \ndebate. I do not understand how that advances any cause. I know this is \nnot the approach of the Senator from Oklahoma. We have a very \nbipartisan committee.\n  Anyway, I will leave it at that. I hope in the morning we can find a \nway to do what I think everybody says they want to do, which is to \nbegin an amendment process on this bill.\n  I want to end by again thanking him. He has not only had his personal \nhealth issue, but, as the majority leader and all of us know in this \nbody, he has had a very tragic loss, and he is working very hard \nthrough that. We doubly and triplely appreciate his service to this \nbody and his bipartisan work on the Armed Services Committee. It is \ninvaluable. I don't want anything that I say tonight about being \nfrustrated that we cannot start debate on two amendments that everybody \nwants to debate in any way to imply anything other than a very positive \nrelationship that we have.\n  Mr. REID. Reclaiming my time, I ask unanimous consent to yield back \nall postcloture time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The question is on the motion to proceed.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/18/senate-section/article/S8094-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2014\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we proceed to a \nperiod of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak for 10 \nminutes each until 8 o'clock this evening, and as I thought I said, Mr. \nPresident, this will be for debate only.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, what we have just seen on this floor \ntonight is just more and more of the same obstruction. This is now the \nfourth DC Circuit judge the Republicans have filibustered. That means \nthey have not allowed us to have an up-or-down vote.\n  I am not going to go into the qualifications of these people; they \nare stellar. We will have more time to debate that. But it is \nextraordinary. We never heard that the DC court should become a smaller \ncourt when George Bush was President, or any other President. Now, all \nof a sudden they want to shrink the court when, in fact, this is \nprobably--I would say it is the most important circuit in the country, \nand it has a very important caseload.\n  First we see that obstructionism, the filibuster of the court \nnominees, and then we see my dear friend the ranking member of the \nArmed Services Committee I think reluctantly object to moving forward \nwith two amendments that are essential to the bill. There are two \namendments; one has to do with Guantanamo, one has to do with sexual \nassault in the military.\n  My friend from Oklahoma, representing the Republicans, said: We want \nan open amendment process. Just so people know what that means, when \nsomeone says: We want an open amendment process, it means they want to \noffer amendments that have nothing to do with the Defense bill, to this \nparticular bill. Again, we are stymied.\n  I was just home. People are saying: Why don't you guys get along? Why \ndon't you get things done?\n  We are trying. We did not have one Democrat filibuster the judges. We \ndidn't have one Democrat oppose moving forward with two critical \namendments.\n  Mr. President, we see obstructionism here from my Republican friends. \nThey are my friends. They are my friends, but I do not get this. This \nis a military bill. This is a dangerous world. We are bringing our \ntroops back from hot spots around the world. They are still in great \ndanger. We have sexual assault in the military that I am going to talk \nabout that is rampant. We have so many issues we want to address. Yet \nwe hear objection.\n  We can only hope that in the light of day tomorrow, cooler heads will \nprevail and we can begin debating and voting on these critical \namendments. It is puzzling. It took us days and days to do the \ncompounding bill, which is a bill necessary to make sure the \npharmaceutical outlets that compound drugs are safe. It passed the \nHouse. It is uncontroversial--days and days because a Senator wants to \ntalk about the health care of Members of Congress.\n  We better start doing the work of the people because that is why we \nare here.\n\n[[Page S8095]]\n\nWe cannot go down any lower in public opinion. It is embarrassing--9 \npercent of the people think we are doing a good job. At first I thought \nit is our families, but now I am even doubting they think we are doing \na good job. I don't know who the 9 percent is, but thank you, thank \nyou, thank you. It will get better when we start working together.\n  I am very hopeful. I am going to chair the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act conference. We are going to conference on that bill. It \nis 500,000 jobs. A bill passed the House. We have a good bill here in \nthe Senate that passed. We hope to iron out our differences. I know \nSenator Murray and Paul Ryan are trying to bring us agreement on the \nbudget. I pray they get that done.\n  Meanwhile, we have a bill that should bring us together, the Defense \nAuthorization Act. Yet what happens? Stymied. We have supremely \nqualified judges for the circuit court. What happens? They are \nfilibustered. We cannot vote on them and they are left out there \nhanging, with all their qualifications. It is ridiculous.\n  Something has to give.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2181\n\n  There are a couple of issues I have worked hard on in terms of this \nbill. I have a number of amendments, but I want to talk about two with \nwhich I have been very involved. One is my own amendment No. 2181, \nwhich is based on a bill I wrote with Senator Graham, Lindsey Graham. \nThe bill is quite bipartisan. We have an amazing list of cosponsors. I \nam going to read them in alphabetical order: Ayotte, Baucus, \nBlumenthal, Blunt, Cardin, Chambliss, Collins, Coons, Donnelly, \nFischer, Gillibrand, Graham, Hirono, Klobuchar, McCain, McCaskill, \nMurkowski, Shaheen, Tester, and Warner. This is wonderful.\n  The amendment I have written is going to reform what we call the \narticle 32 proceeding. In the military, when there is a sexual assault \nand the decision is made to move forward with a trial, there is first a \npretrial investigation. This is called an article 32 proceeding. It is \nthe equivalent of a civilian pretrial hearing. Even though there is \nsupposed to be a rape shield law in place, it does not work. What is \nhappening is these article 32 proceedings have become their own trials, \nan opportunity for the defense counsel to harass and intimidate sexual \nassault victims. In fact, according to the DOD, 30 percent of sexual \nassault victims who originally agree to help prosecute their offenders \nchange their minds before the trial because they know and they told us \nthey are revictimized by the process. I am going to give a few \nexamples.\n  In April 2012, a 20-year-old female midshipman at the U.S. Naval \nAcademy was raped by three football players at an off-campus party. The \nyoung woman testified during the article 32 proceeding, where she was \nforced to endure roughly 30 hours of relentless questioning by \nattorneys for her attackers. The questioning included graphic questions \nabout her sexual history and even what she was wearing under her \nclothes. Anyone who knows anything about the civilian legal system \nknows this would never, ever be allowed--never.\n  In October 2008, while stationed at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar \nin San Diego, Elizabeth Lyman was raped in her barracks by another \nmarine. She was 11 weeks pregnant at the time. She was forced to \ntestify at two article 32 proceedings before her case was sent to a \ncourt-martial. This is what she said:\n\n       My rapist hired a civilian attorney who asked me outrageous \n     questions. . . . These questions were extremely upsetting to \n     me. I had just been discharged from the hospital when I was \n     told I had to take the stand for a second time and I was told \n     I had no choice if I wanted the charges to go forward. This \n     is what has become of the procedure for article 32.\n\n  I went to Senator Lindsey Graham because he is an expert and indeed \nan attorney. He has served in the position of counsel, and right away \nhe said it was revictimization. It is wrong, it is a runaway train, and \nwe have to fix it. I am so grateful to him for helping us.\n  In July 2012, a 23-year-old marine named Karalen Morthole was raped \nby a master sergeant in a bar on the grounds of the Marine Barracks in \nWashington, DC. Earlier this year she testified in an article 32 \nproceeding against her alleged attacker. According to her, ``The \noverall experience was painful. It was the first time since the night \nof the rape that I saw the man who hurt me. It was a terrifying and \nuncomfortable experience. I felt dehumanized being made out as a liar, \nand blamed for everything that happened to me. . . The intimidation \ntactics, the blaming, all in front of the man who raped me were \ncompletely overwhelming.''\n  She supports this bipartisan amendment to reform article 32. She said \npeople don't come forward because they know they are going to be \nrevictimized, and so they walk away.\n  I am very pleased we have strong bipartisan support for this \namendment. I know we have a very big debate going on and everybody is \ntorn asunder on the other issue of whether to keep the prosecution \ndecisions in the chain of command for serious offenses. But on this \none--limiting the scope of article 32--we have broad support. I am \nproud to say that I even have support of Chairman Levin and Senator \nInhofe. We have a tremendous group of people who have helped us.\n  We will have these proceedings presided over by a military lawyer \nwhen possible. The proceedings are going to be recorded. We will \nprevent victims from being forced to testify in these proceedings. They \ncan have alternative forms of testimony instead. So these are the basic \ncommonsense reforms.\n  I am very happy to say that with the strong support we have from so \nmany of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, as well as the \nsupport of Chairman Levin, I feel very positive. But to get this done \nand stop this revictimization of people who are distraught after having \nbeen attacked and brutally raped and hurt, we need a bill to come up, \nand we don't need objections so we can move forward. We need to move \nforward with this bill, and I truly hope we can.\n  This article 32 reform brings us all together. It brings Claire \nMcCaskill and Kirsten Gillibrand together. It brings Senator Blunt and \nmyself together. It is a very bipartisan reform. There are already \nseveral reforms in this bill we are proud of. Senator Mikulski is \norganizing us tomorrow to talk about those reforms, and this is one \nmore we can add.\n  In closing my remarks tonight, I wish to take on the issue of the \nGillibrand amendment No. 2099. I am so very proud to stand with a very \nbipartisan group of colleagues in support of Kirsten Gillibrand's \namendment. These colleagues perhaps don't agree on much. When I am on \nthe same side as Ted Cruz, that is something; right? When Kirsten \nGillibrand is on the same side as Rand Paul, that is something. It goes \non and on down the line. We also have Senator Grassley's support.\n  By the way, 17 of 20 women Senators support the Gillibrand amendment. \nI hope that is a message--that this is the right way to go, and I am \ngoing to explain it.\n  My involvement in this is deep and long. Twenty years ago we were all \noutraged to learn that nearly 100 women and men had been sexually \nharassed and assaulted by a group of naval aviators during a convention \nof the Tailhook Association. I think a lot of us who were around then \nremember that. I was a new Senator at the time, and I was completely \nshocked at what happened. They had a gauntlet that people walked \nthrough. They were harassed, hurt, and distraught when it was over.\n  In the wake of the Tailhook scandal, senior military leaders promised \nto crack down on the crime of sexual assault with then-Secretary of \nDefense Dick Cheney declaring a zero tolerance policy.\n  I will show how many times different Secretaries of Defense--Democrat \nand Republican--have promised they were going to take care of this. \nWhen the military comes to lobby us against this, I say to them: When \nare you going to embrace true reform? Because for 20 years we have been \nhearing this baloney, and I will read now.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld, who served from January 2001 to December 2006, \nsaid: ``Sexual assault will not be tolerated in the Department of \nDefense.''\n  Secretary William Cohen, who served from January 1997 to January \n2001, said: ``I intend to enforce a strict policy of zero tolerance of \nhazing, of sexual harassment, and of racism.'' He said that on January \n31, 1997.\n  Secretary William Perry, who served from February 1994 until January \n1997,\n\n[[Page S8096]]\n\nsaid: ``For all of these reasons, therefore, we have zero tolerance for \nsexual harassment.''\n  Secretary Cheney, who served from 1989 until 1993, said: ``Well, \nwe've got a major effort underway to try to educate everybody, to let \nthem know that we've got a zero-tolerance policy where sexual \nharassment's involved.''\n  I wish to correct the Record.\n  When Tailhook happened, I was in the House. I got to the Senate right \nafter that because it was 1991, and I was elected in 1992. I continued \nmy work on this when I got to the Senate. I have to be honest and say I \nbelieved the military when they said it would never happen again. I \nsaid: Well, that is it. This thing is out and it will never happen \nagain. I was wrong. By the way, that is the worst thing a politician \never wants to say: I was wrong. Those are three words you never want to \nsay: I was wrong.\n  I believed the Pentagon. I thought they would take care of it. They \nhave never taken care of it. Now we have Chuck Hagel, who, to my \nknowledge, is now lobbying against the Kirsten Gillibrand approach.\n  Secretary Hagel said:\n\n       It's not good enough to say we have a zero tolerance \n     policy. We do, but what does that mean? How does that \n     translate into changing anything? I want to know.\n\n  He wants to know. I will tell him. Support the Kirsten Gillibrand \namendment. Change and reform this. Take these serious offenses outside \nof the chain of command. It is not working.\n  Leon Panetta, who served from July 2011 until February 2013, said: \n``We have absolutely no tolerance for any form of sexual assault.'' He \ndidn't take anything outside the chain of command either.\n  Secretary Robert Gates, who served from 2006 until 2011, said: ``This \nis a matter of grave concern. I have zero tolerance for sexual \nassault.''\n  Really? Every one of these men had zero tolerance for sexual assault. \nYet not one of them ever lived up to the promise. Sexual assault is \nrunning rampant. We have 26,000 cases a year, and do you know what \npercent get reported? Ten percent get reported. Do you know what \npercent of cases don't get reported? Ninety percent. We have a 90-\npercent problem. There are 26,000 cases and only 10 percent get \nreported. Ninety percent don't get reported.\n  So then you say: Why? Why is it? The answer comes back from the \nvictims: Nothing will happen. We will be revictimized. We will get \nblamed. They will blame us. We will get kicked out. We have to go to \nour commander. He is not trained in this. Please change it.\n  If a whole group of people who have been victimized tell you the \nreason why they will not report the crime, you ought to listen. They \nknow better than any Senator. They know better than any Defense \nDepartment blue ribbon panel.\n  Speaking of panels, there is a panel that has a funny name called \nDACOWITS, which stands for Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the \nServices. They have one job; that is to provide recommendations on \npolicies relating to women in the military. Guess what. They endorsed \nthe Gillibrand amendment. There was not one vote against it.\n  How can Senators--and I have friends on both sides of the aisle--\nstand with a straight face and say we can keep the status quo, when all \nthe victims are saying no, and the one committee that has advised the \nmilitary on women for over 60 years says no. I say listen to the \nvictims, listen to the military's advisory committee. Don't listen to \nthe top brass who are running around, going to everybody's offices \ntrying to undermine us. Just for the record, they have not come to my \noffice because they know where I stand.\n  If they came to my office, the first thing I would do is look at them \nand say: What would you do if this happened to your daughter? What \nwould you do? Would you tell her to report it to a commander who may be \nvery friendly with the guy who did this?\n  Let me tell you, there is a moment in time when you see an issue \nclearly, and it happens in funny ways. The woman who has been nominated \nto be Under Secretary of the Navy made a statement about this issue. \nWhen I read this statement, you will understand why the victims are so \nright.\n  I know the Presiding Officer has worked hard on this issue as well. \nDr. Jo Ann Rooney, the nominee to be Under Secretary of the Navy was \nasked the following question: In your view, what would be the impact of \nrequiring a judge advocate outside the chain of command to determine \nwhether allegations of sexual assault should be prosecuted?\n  In other words, she was asked about the Gillibrand amendment. Should \nwe take the prosecution of military sexual assault and other serious \ncrimes outside the chain of command? Listen to her answer. This is the \nadvertisement for the Gillibrand amendment.\n  She said:\n\n       A judge advocate outside the chain of command will be \n     looking at a case through a different lens than a military \n     commander. I believe the impact would be decisions based on \n     evidence . . .\n\n  Can you believe that? She said: ``I believe the impact would be \ndecisions based on evidence . . . ''\n  I ask rhetorically: Isn't that what justice is about, decisions based \non the evidence? She goes on to say, `` . . . rather than the interest \nin preserving good order and discipline.'' I would argue, A, you base \nthese decisions on the evidence; and, B, there is no good order and \ndiscipline when there are 26,000 cases of sexual assault and only 10 \npercent are reported.\n  What kind of order is that? We have thousands of perpetrators running \naround the military, and there are thousands of victims scared to \ndeath. They are brokenhearted, broken down, and their spirit is broken. \nHow do Senators actually stand here and say: We are going to just keep \nit the way it is. We are going to turn our backs on these victims.\n  Listen to this story from a young woman in my State. I stood next to \nher and held her hand when she told this story. Stacey Thompson was \ndrugged and brutally raped by a male sergeant while stationed in \nOkinawa, Japan. She reported the rape to her superiors, but her \nallegations were swept under the rug. While her attacker was allowed to \nleave the Marine Corps without ever facing trial, Stacey became the \ntarget of a drug investigation, and this is why. Her perpetrator \ndrugged her and he dumped her on the street. He left her on the street \nafter being raped and drugged. He gets out of the military scot-free \nand they start an investigation on her drug use, even though she never \nused drugs, except the drugs her perpetrator gave her.\n\n  I stood next to this young woman. She had never told her story \nuntil--and it happened in 1999--until Kirsten Gillibrand put her bill \nforward.\n  I want to make this point: Half of the victims are men. When I talk \nabout 26,000 victims, half of them are men. These are violent crimes.\n  So here is the story of Amando Javier. He was serving in the Marine \nCorps in 1993. He was brutally raped and physically assaulted by a \ngroup of fellow marines. Ashamed and fearing for his life, he kept his \nrape a secret for 15 years. When he finally found the courage to share \nthe story with a friend, he wrote it down, and I will read some of his \nwords:\n\n       My experience left me torn apart physically, mentally, and \n     spiritually. I was dehumanized and treated with ultimate \n     cruelty, by my perpetrators . . . I was embarrassed and \n     ashamed and didn't know what to do. I was young at that time. \n     And being part of an elite organization that values \n     brotherhood, integrity and faithfulness made it hard to come \n     forward and reveal what happened.\n\n  So it is two decades later, and not one person--not one--has been \nheld accountable for this heinous crime. The perpetrators are still out \nthere and they are able to recommit these horrific crimes again.\n  Ariana Klay. Here is the last story. She graduated from the U.S. \nNaval Academy. She joined the Marines. She deployed to Iraq in 2008. \nFollowing her return from Iraq, she was selected to serve at the Marine \nBarracks in Washington, a very prestigious post. It is right down the \nstreet from here. At the Marine Barracks, Ariana was subjected to \nconstant sexual harassment. When she tried to report it, do my \ncolleagues know what her chain of command told her? ``Deal with it.'' \nThat is akin to telling a little child who is being abused somewhere to \ndeal with it.\n  That is the culture my colleagues want to keep--``deal with it''? No. \nIt is a crime. Help the person. Go after the perpetrator. Get a trained \nprosecutor in there to find out if it is true and if it is true, \nprosecute to the hilt.\n\n[[Page S8097]]\n\n  In August 2010, she was gang-raped by a senior Marine officer and his \nfriend who broke into her home. Ariana, despite all the warning signs, \nreported her assault. But a Marine Corps investigation determined she \nhad welcomed the harassment. Do my colleagues know why? This is what \nthey said: She wore makeup and she exercised in shorts and tank tops. \nWhat?\n  The Marine Corps did court-martial one of Ariana's rapists, but they \nnever convicted him of rape. Do my colleagues know what he was \nconvicted of? Adultery and indecent language. Please. How could anyone \nwho listens to the victims say they are not going to vote for the \nGillibrand amendment?\n  I stood with Ariana along with a large group of colleagues, \nRepublicans and Democrats, right here the other day. Her husband is a \nformer Marine Corps officer and he spoke at the press conference. This \nis what he said. It is so important to listen to what he said:\n\n       The first step to addressing sexual assault in the military \n     is to remove its prosecution from the chain of command. It is \n     unfair to expect commanders to be able to maintain good order \n     and discipline as long as their justice system incentivizes \n     and empowers them to deny their units' worst disciplinary \n     failures ever happened.\n\n  In his statement--and it is on YouTube and I hope people will listen \nto it. In his statement, he talks about the fact that he was a \ncommander and he was in the middle of war. He said, as a commander, I \nhave one job to do; that is, to have a fighting machine that is second \nto none. I want you to know, when I am told to deal with sexual \nharassment or a crime of any sort, I am not trained to do it. It is a \ndistraction.\n  I will read the exact quote so my colleagues don't think I am \nexaggerating. He said:\n\n       I used to feel a commander's disinterest in the law, too. \n     During my training and deployments to Iraq, I focused on \n     fighting. My life and those of my Marines depended on it. \n     Legal issues were divisive, distracting, and confusing; they \n     made me resent those who brought them to my attention, and \n     feel bias as strong as my relationships with those involved. \n     Commanders can be forgiven for thinking war is their most \n     important job, and it should be expected that they'll manage \n     the judicial process as a side-show and an annoyance.\n\n  This is someone who served as a commander and is telling us it is not \nright to keep loading these commanders up with all of these \ndifferent responsibilities when their main responsibility is to fight \nand win wars.\n\n  So our amendment, the Kirsten Gillibrand amendment, would take the \ndecision about whether to prosecute serious crimes such as sexual \nassault out of the hands of commanders and give it to professionally \ntrained military prosecutors outside the chain of command. If \nsomething, God forbid, were to happen in the Presiding Officer's office \nor my office--something very bad, some crime, upstairs in a room \nsomewhere in our office--we are not trained to deal with that. We would \nimmediately call law enforcement to deal with it, wouldn't we? We are \nnot going to decide who is right and wrong. One person is saying he did \nit. The other one is saying she did it. People are crying and yelling \nin our office. We are not going to. It is not right. It has to be taken \noutside our office to the trained prosecutors to determine who was at \nfault. The chips will fall where they may. Maybe a Senator has a \nfavorite of the two people involved in the altercation. We are not \nobjective, and we are not trained for that--at least I am not. It would \nbe similar to saying a CEO of a corporation should make a decision \nabout whether one or more of her employees should be prosecuted for \nrape. That is not right. We don't have the decision made within the \norganization. It has to be outside.\n  Under our amendment, complex legal decisions would be made by \nexperienced and impartial legal experts because the decision to \nprosecute serious crimes should be based on evidence. Nothing else \nshould enter into it except evidence. Jo Ann Rooney made the point for \nus. She said, essentially, watch out if you take it outside the chain \nof command, it will be based on evidence, not on discipline. Some \ndiscipline. Some discipline: 26,000 cases and 90 percent go unreported. \nWhat kind of discipline is that? It is not discipline. People are \ngetting away with it. They are getting away with it.\n  The men and women who risk their lives every day deserve a better \nsystem. I can't tell my colleagues how many victims I have met. They \nwere destroyed by the system. They were destroyed by that culture. Men \nand women are begging us to act.\n  Tonight we had a chance to agree we would begin debate and voting on \nthis important amendment. It was objected to by the Republicans. We \nneed to get to the vote. I hope when we do that we will have the votes \nnecessary.\n  I wish to make another point: There is a filibuster going on here. We \nare going to need 60 votes. We have over 50. Let's be clear. We have \nover 50. I am very sorry we have to get to 60, but there are those on \nboth sides who are demanding that we get to 60. It is 20 years after \nTailhook. This is our moment to make the change we should have made \nback then. It is time to stand up to all the people who say status quo, \nstatus quo, status quo. If the status quo was working, I would support \nit. If the status quo was working, the victims would come forward. They \nwouldn't run away and say: I can't deal with this.\n  Think about the thousands of perpetrators who are running around the \nmilitary doing this over and over. Think about when they get out and \nnow they are on the street in civilian life doing it over and over \nagain. If they think they can get away with this behavior--this abuse \nof power, this violence, this hurt--they are going to continue.\n  I hope colleagues will make the decision to stand with us, with our \nterrific bipartisan group we have lined up behind this amendment, this \nGillibrand amendment. I am very proud to have been working on this for \na long time, and I think we are moving in the right direction. We are \nvery close to 60 votes. I urge any colleague who might be within the \nsound of my voice, if they haven't decided, meet with a victim, meet \nwith a victims' group, listen to their pleas. Listen to how smart they \nare. They understand what happened to them and they are begging us to \nstand up to the status quo, to the powerful Pentagon. We are taking on \nthe most powerful organization in the world. But on this, they are \nwrong. They are right on a lot of other things, but on this they are \nwrong.\n  I look forward to proudly casting my vote for the Gillibrand \namendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/18/senate-section/article/S8097-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n      ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO CLAY LARKIN\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \noutstanding work of Clay Larkin, who is retiring after serving for 13 \nyears as Mayor of Post Falls, ID.\n  Mayor Larkin has dedicated immense time and covered considerable \nground serving the people of Post Falls. He has devoted nearly 18 years \nto advancing the community, and Post Falls has thrived under his \nleadership. He served on the city council for 5 years before becoming \nmayor. As a strong and consistent advocate for the city, he helped \nbring considerable commerce to the area. His efforts also helped \nestablish a foundation for further economic development and \ninfrastructure improvements.\n  Additionally, under his leadership, community resources, including a \nlibrary, city hall and police station, have been constructed, and he \nhas worked to protect essential resources. Further, he has invested \ntime and effort into emphasizing opportunities for youth, who are the \nfuture of our communities, State, and Nation. Mayor Larkin's work has \nunderstandably been recognized through numerous awards and honors. He \nis acknowledged for his devotion to making progress, his ability to \nadapt to changes, and his perseverance.\n  Post Falls and Idaho have been blessed to benefit from Clay's sound \nleadership. I thank Clay Larkin for his exceptional service, \ncongratulate him on his retirement, and wish him all the best. I hope \nthat retirement provides him more time with loved ones and the time for \nfishing he so greatly deserves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/18/senate-section/article/S8097-2", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8097-S8098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO REBECCA SPENCER\n\n Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, for the past 25 years, Rev. \nRebecca Spencer has provided parishioners at the United Church of \nChrist's Central\n\n[[Page S8098]]\n\nCongregational Church in Providence, RI, with thoughtful, dedicated, \nand selfless leadership.\n  I have been blessed to experience Reverend Spencer's inspiring \nstewardship firsthand. As a member of the Central Congregational Church \nfor the years that I lived in Providence, I saw her regularly touch the \nlives of her parishioners by providing the spiritual guidance sought by \nso many in today's fast-paced and sometimes lonely world. And as the \nfirst woman in the United Church of Christ's history to become a senior \nminister without first serving as an associate of the congregation, \nReverend Spencer has been a role model for the young women of her \ncongregation who aspire to follow in her footsteps and one day take on \nleadership roles of their own.\n  Outside of church, Reverend Spencer has been a leader in Rhode \nIsland's close-knit community. From her work to prevent domestic \nviolence, to her service to our children through the United Way of \nRhode Island, to the counsel she provides the Bioethics Committee at \nWomen & Infants Hospital, Reverend Spencer has demonstrated a deep \ndevotion to public service. Her contributions have made our State a \nbetter place for all.\n  Last year, I had the privilege of bringing Reverend Spencer to the \nSenate floor to deliver the opening prayer as a guest chaplain. Her \ninvocation reminded each of us, particularly those us of elected to \nrepresent our fellow citizens, of our responsibility as members of the \nnational and international community:\n\n       Gracious and loving God, we thank You for Your presence \n     with us. You offer wisdom and perspective and grace. We ask \n     Your blessings to be upon these elected representatives. May \n     all that we do reflect Your purpose that we live together as \n     Your children in harmony and freedom. May Your blessings and \n     our work bring real hope to those who may be struggling or \n     oppressed.\n       We do ask for Your special blessings to be with those who \n     serve our country in the military--at home, at sea, in the \n     air, and foreign countries. Shield them from danger as they \n     work for peace.\n       This is indeed a gift of a new day You have given to us. \n     May all our endeavors honor You and may we all serve the \n     cause of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness in this \n     beloved land of ours. May we truly do justice and love \n     kindness and walk humbly with You, our God.\n\n  Congratulations to Reverend Spencer on her 25th anniversary at the \nCentral Congregational Church. Rhode Island is proud to call her one of \nour own, and I am proud to call her a friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/18/senate-section/article/S8098-1", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/18/senate-section/article/S8098-2", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/18/senate-section/article/S8098-3", "month": "11", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:02 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2655.
