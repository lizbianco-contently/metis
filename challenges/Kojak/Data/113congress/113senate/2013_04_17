Mr. President, today this august body will honor the memory \nof 20 first grade children. Little babies were gunned down, most of \nthem shot multiple times. But we will also honor the teachers and \nadministrators who were killed that day in Newtown, CT. We are also \ngoing to honor with this legislation tens of thousands of others who \nare killed by guns each year in America. We are going to do that by \nvoting on a number of measures to strengthen the laws to prevent gun \nviolence in this Nation.\n  The families of the innocents killed in Newtown and Aurora, in Carson \nCity and Blacksburg, in Oak Creek and Columbine, deserve these votes.\n  Where do I stand on these Democratic proposals?\n  This afternoon the Senate will vote on a compromise background check \nproposal crafted by Senators Manchin, Toomey, Kirk, and Schumer--all \nexperienced legislators. I very much appreciate their principled stands \non legislation supported by 90 percent of the American people.\n  The American people overwhelmingly support this commonsense proposal \nwhich would close gaping loopholes in the law and keep guns out of the \nhands of bad people--criminals--and people with severe mental illness.\n  What it would not do--what it would not do is create a national \nregistry of guns or gun owners. In fact, that is specifically outlawed \nin the legislation. I refer everyone to page 27 of the Manchin-Toomey \ncompromise legislation. It not only bans a registry, but it creates a \n15-year felony sentence for any government official found storing these \ngun records. So please start talking about that, all the opponents of \nthis bill. Because it is absolutely false, it is untrue, and it is \nunfair. Claims that this legislation would create a gun registry are \nnothing more than shameful scare tactics.\n\n  If any of my colleagues wish to vote against stronger background \nchecks, go ahead and do it and oppose the will of the American people.\n  That is their right. But the American people have a very long memory. \nTo\n\n[[Page S2698]]\n\nvote against something that 90 percent of the American people want, the \nAmerican people are not going to forget about that. The opponents of \nthe will of the American people should not spread misinformation or sow \nseeds of fear about this critical antiviolence legislation. But that is \nwhat they are doing, that is what they have done, and it is absolutely \nfalse and misleading.\n  Assault weapons, we are going to vote on Senator Feinstein's proposal \nto ban assault weapons. She has been stalwart in her advocacy for this \nlegislation.\n  I am a strong supporter of the Second Amendment, Americans' right to \nkeep and bear arms. That is how I earned a B grade with the National \nRifle Association.\n  When I was a 12-year-old little boy, in Searchlight, NV, my parents \nsent away for a Sears catalog and bought me a 12 gauge shotgun--a great \nbig gun. That gun held five in the tube and you put one in the \nchamber--six 12 gauge shotgun shells.\n  I carried a handgun when I was a police officer and, frankly, on \nother occasions. From where I come from, people own guns as a matter of \ncourse--for self-defense and for hunting and for sportsman activities, \ntarget shooting.\n  I still go target shooting basically out in my backyard in \nSearchlight with my grandchildren, but I have always had trouble \nunderstanding why people need assault weapons to hunt or to protect \ntheir homes or to target shoot.\n  When the assault weapons ban came before the Senate for a vote 10 \nyears ago, I called my friends--one in particular who was a real \nadvocate on guns. He said to me: You know, you can't define an assault \nweapon. Why are you doing this? You just can't define an assault \nweapon.\n  He convinced me he was right, so I voted against that. That seemed \nreasonable to me, and I voted against the ban.\n  Just about a month ago, I called this same friend. I asked if his \nopinion had changed: Generally, no, but specifically, yes, it had \nchanged. He still opposes a ban on assault weapons.\n  I said: Tell me why. I found his new reasoning absurd, and even \nthough I care a great deal about my friend, he is headed in the wrong \ndirection. So it caused me to reassess my position.\n  He said: Do police have assault weapons?\n  I said: Yes, some of them.\n  He said: If they have them, I want them.\n  Then he said: Does the military have assault weapons?\n  I said: Yes.\n  He said: If they have them, I want them.\n  I thought for some time about what that statement means. It was not a \nrash decision I made. But what it means is there should be no limits on \nthe kinds of weapons private citizens are allowed to own.\n  I asked myself whether I believe that to be true. The police have \nriot gear and tear gas and battering rams and others things. Should \ncivilians have them? Obviously, no.\n  The military has rocket-propelled grenades, other kinds of rockets, \nmachine guns, tanks, fighter jets. Should civilians have those also? \nPlease. It does not make sense.\n  So I decided the answer is no. In a civil society, where we have to \nbalance individual rights with public safety, there should be limits--\nsignificant limits--on the kind of destructive weapons people are \nallowed to own.\n  I believe--I repeat for the second time today--in the right to own a \ngun to protect your home and your family, to hunt, to go target \npracticing. I will continue to defend that right as long as I am \nserving the people of Nevada.\n  But you do not need an assault weapon to defend yourself or your \nproperty. Assault weapons have one purpose and one purpose only: to \nkill a large number of people very quickly. This goes well beyond the \npurpose of self-defense.\n  The desire to arm ourselves against the young men and women who \nwillingly risk their lives to defend our freedoms--soldiers, sailors, \nmarines; the Navy, the Air Force--is not a reason to oppose an assault \nweapons ban.\n  The wish to arm ourselves against the police who keep our streets \nsafe is not a reason to oppose an assault weapons ban.\n  I believe as Americans we have a right to arm ourselves against \ncriminals, but we do not need the ability to arm ourselves against the \nArmy or the police. The U.S. military is not out to get us. Federal law \nenforcement, local police departments, are not out to get us.\n  These conspiracy theories are dangerous and they should be put to \nrest. In the real world--not this conspiratorial world that some live \nin--in the real world, in addition to mowing down first graders, \nassault weapons are used to shoot down the very people who have sworn \nto protect us.\n  Here is one real-world example in Nevada: After serving 9 months in \nAfghanistan with his National Guard unit, SSG Ian Michael Deutch was \neager to return to his day job as a police officer in Nye County, NV. \nHe could not wait to get back to work. He survived Afghanistan--bombs, \nbullets, acts of terrorism. He survived.\n  His second day back on the job--second day back on the job--he was \nshot and killed by a man with an assault weapon with a 30-round clip.\n  Sergeant Deutch was responding to a domestic dispute in Pahrump, NV, \nwhen he was shot three times in the chest. One of the bullets even \npierced his body armor. An assault weapon pierced the body armor the \npolice officer was wearing.\n  He was airlifted to Las Vegas, rushed into emergency surgery, and he \ndied within a few hours. He was 27 years old, had survived Afghanistan \nbut not America. All 730 soldiers in Michael's squadron returned alive \nfrom their tour of duty in Afghanistan. They were so thankful and \nproud. It was a criminal on the streets of the United States of \nAmerica, our country, armed with a weapon designed to kill who took \nMichael's life--his young life.\n  Here is what his mom said:\n\n       He was finally safe. In our country. And somebody here \n     kills him.\n\n  That is what she said. That is a tragedy, and it is one we could have \nprevented by keeping weapons of war off the streets. We can keep them \noff the streets. We should keep them off the streets.\n  In the 1920s, organized crime was committing murders with machine \nguns. We have seen them in the movies--the Valentine's Day Massacre. So \nCongress dramatically limited the sale and transfer of machine guns a \nlong time ago. As a result, machine guns basically disappeared from the \nstreets. They are in the movies, but private citizens do not have them.\n  We can and should take the same commonsense approach to safeguard \nAmericans from modern weapons of war, assault weapons. That is why I \nwill vote for Dianne Feinstein's assault weapons ban; we must strike a \nbetter balance between the right to defend ourselves and the right of \nevery child in America to grow up safe from gun violence. I will vote \nfor the ban because maintaining law and order is more important than \nsatisfying conspiracy theorists who believe in black helicopters and \nfalse flags. I will vote for the ban because saving the lives of police \nofficers, young and old, and innocent civilians, young and old, is more \nimportant than preventing imagined tyranny.\n  High-capacity magazines--clips is what I call them my reason for \nsupporting a ban on large ammunition magazines is similar. These large \nclips are designed to kill--not to kill a deer or a duck or any other \ngame, large or small, they are designed to kill humans, living, \nbreathing human beings, people from Hawaii, people from Kentucky, \npeople from Nevada--our citizens. They are designed to kill.\n  In fact, it is not even legal to load more than 3 shotgun shells--let \nalone 30--to hunt birds. I talked to the Presiding Officer earlier \nabout my shotgun. I told him that it could hold six shells, but we had \nto plug that gun because that was the law. By law, we had to limit the \namount of ammo in that shotgun, so we had to plug it so it could only \nshoot three--two in the magazine, one in the chamber. That way, when \nyou went bird hunting, you gave birds a sporting chance. You could only \nfire three times. As Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia--the \ncourageous Senator from West Virginia--said, ``I do not know anybody \nthat needs 30 rounds in a weapon to go hunting.'' Take 30 and reload. \nSo why should we not limit the number of bullets in a clip? Don't \npeople deserve as much protection as birds?\n\n[[Page S2699]]\n\n  Limiting magazine size will force shooters bent on taking a life to \nreload more often. When this madman with the strange-colored hair \nwalked into that Aurora, CO, movie theater with a semiautomatic weapon \nand a 100-round drum magazine, the only thing that spared many \nsurvivors was the fact that the shooter's gun jammed. Think of the \ncarnage, in addition to what already was so bad, that would have taken \nplace.\n  In Tucson, AZ--we met here in Washington yesterday with Gabby \nGiffords, a woman who was shot right in the head by a man who should \nhave not had a gun. But he emptied a 33-round clip in less than 30 \nseconds, killing 6 and injuring many more, including Gabby Giffords.\n  In Carson City, NV, a mentally ill man went to an IHOP during \nbreakfast time and killed four people. Three of them were National \nGuard personnel going to work. He shot 80 rounds in 80 seconds using \n30-round clips.\n  Limiting the size of clips will not hurt hunters and sportsmen, but \nit will save lives. So I am going to vote in support of the Blumenthal-\nLautenberg amendment.\n  In the case of Carson City, the example I just gave, let's talk a \nlittle bit about mental health. That incident at the IHOP restaurant \nreveals a tragedy, of course, but also the deficiencies in this \nNation's mental health treatment system. That is another important part \nof our discussion about how to prevent gun violence. We simply have not \ndone a good job of providing funding for and access to mental health \nservices. This should be a bipartisan issue. Going back many years, it \nwas bipartisan--Wellstone-Domenici.\n  While we have done a better job of doing certain things in mental \nhealth, we have done a poor job of removing the stigma that keeps \nAmericans from seeking the treatment they need. We must do better. So \nthe bill reported out of the HELP Committee, led my Chairman Harkin, \nbegins the work of improving access to critical services.\n  I hope to be able to have shortly--after we finish this list of \namendments--the ability to move to Senator Stabenow's measure. She has \nworked with others on another bipartisan piece of legislation to go \neven further in doing something about the mental health problems so \nthat we can alleviate, at least on occasion, these terrible tragedies.\n  As I have said many times, the efforts will not stop every criminal \nbent on violence, but last year's terrible tragedy in Newtown was a \nwake-up call that we are not doing enough to keep our citizens safe. It \nis hard to even comprehend the scope of the tragedy, let alone recover \nfrom it, but part of the healing process is this remarkable \nconversation about how to prevent violence in America. That \nconversation is taking place in America today because of Boston and \nbecause of the thousands of people killed with guns every year. Part of \nthe healing process is examining what can be done to prevent more \ntragedies such as the ones in Newton, CT; Aurora, CO; Oak Creek, WI; \nCarson City, NV; and multiple other places. I believe that if we can \nsave the life of a single American, we owe to it ourselves to try. That \nis going to take courage by some people.\n  President Monson, the president of the Mormon Church, said this about \ncourage:\n\n       Life's journey is not traveled on a freeway devoid of \n     obstacles, pitfalls and snares. Rather, it is a pathway \n     marked by forks and turnings. Decisions are constantly before \n     us. To make them wisely, courage is needed: the courage to \n     say, ``no,'' the courage to say, ``yes.''\n\n  The courage today to say yes. Decisions do determine destiny. Today \nour decision will determine the destiny of our country. Today I choose \nto vote my conscience not only as Harry Reid a Senator but also as a \nhusband, a father, a grandfather, and I hope a friend to lots and lots \nof people. I choose to vote my conscience because if a tragedy strikes \nagain--sorry to say it will--if innocents are gunned down in a \nclassroom, theater, or restaurant, I would have trouble living with \nmyself as a Senator, a husband, a father, a grandfather, and a friend \nknowing I did not do everything in my power to prevent that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/17/senate-section/article/S2699-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the last few days have been trying ones \nfor our Nation. Monday's attack in Boston reminded us that terrorism \ncan still strike anywhere at any time. As yesterday's news of an \nattempt to send ricin to the Capitol reminds us, it is as important as \never to take the steps necessary to protect Americans from those who \nwould do us harm.\n  This morning I would like to recognize the postal and law enforcement \nofficials for their excellent work in detecting and preventing this \nthreat before it even reached the Capitol. They proved that the \nproactive measures we put in place do, in fact, work.\n  We have faith that the men and women charged to protect the American \npeople will find those responsible for the attack in Boston and for the \nletter here at the Capitol. The truth will eventually come out, and \njustice will be delivered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/17/senate-section/article/S2699-3", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GUN AMENDMENTS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Later today the Senate will begin to consider \namendments to legislation that deals with one of our most fundamental \nconstitutional rights as citizens. There are many different \nperspectives on this issue, and passions are high on all sides. That is \nwhy I would urge the majority to allow the full and open amendment \nprocess we were told the Senate would have. Today's votes are a very \ngood start. The American people deserve the opportunity to be heard on \nthis matter. We should respect that. So let's approach this debate in \nthe spirit of transparency that the American people expect.\n  In my view, we should focus on keeping firearms out of the hands of \nthe criminals and those with mental issues that could cause them to be \na threat to our society. The government should not punish or harass \nlaw-abiding citizens in the exercise of their Second Amendment rights. \nIt is that focus on protecting communities and preserving our \nconstituents' constitutional rights that will be my guide as we begin \nto vote on amendments on this bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I happened to be on the floor and hear \nthe remarks from the majority leader. I would like to thank him for his \nsupport of this legislation. It is extraordinarily important to me, to \nthe people of my State, and, I believe, to a majority of Americans. I \nhope to make that clear during my remarks.\n  I would like to also thank the 23 cosponsors of this legislation. \nThey are in alphabetical order: Richard Blumenthal, Senators Boxer, \nCardin, Carper, Cowan, Durbin, Franken, Gillibrand, Harkin, Hirono, \nKlobuchar, Lautenberg, Levin, Menendez, Mikulski, Murphy, Murray, Reed, \nRockefeller, Schatz, Schumer, Warren, and Whitehouse. I am very \ngrateful for the willingness of the Presiding Officer and the others to \nstep up, show courage, and do what is right for America.\n  There are all kinds of things we confront as Members of this great \nSenate. There are issues of national security, the economy, health \ncare, immigration--all tough issues.\n  People often ask me why I care so much about assault weapons and why \nI stayed with this issue for more than 20 years.\n  The answer is this: In my view, the proliferation of this specific \ntype of weapon goes to the heart of what kind of society in which we \nwant to live. It goes to what kind of culture we are going to raise our \nchildren in, which brings us to the horrific massacre at Newtown, CT, 4 \nmonths ago.\n  Sandy Hook--and much has been said about it, but I can't forget--\nSandy Hook was a safe school in a safe town. Candidly, it was \ninconceivable that such a tragedy could happen there, but it did. I \ncan't exaggerate how this senseless murder of 20 beautiful young \nchildren and 6 incredibly brave adults affected me and millions around \nthis country. I think it is fair to say that this event really shocked \nthe conscience of America.\n  The pictures of these little victims still bring tears to the eyes of \nmillions. I am very impressed with this one page of the New York Daily \nNews. I carry it when I speak to people, trying to get their votes. \nSome say no, and I look at this picture of these smiling faces, and in \nthe middle, ``Shame on U.S.'' This was the cover of the New York Daily \nNews. I think it carries the message of what we are trying to do here, \nand I hope to demonstrate that during the time that I speak.\n  I think the despair that we all felt, for some of us, has changed to \ndetermination. I believe that this amendment over time will finally \nbegin to address not only the wanton, brutal violence, but the weapon \nthat is often used to carry out this wanton, brutal violence.\n  To have a chance at understanding these mass shootings, we need to \nunderstand how they are perpetrated and by whom.\n  It is impossible to know with any certainty what motivated Adam \nLanza, the Newtown shooter. We know he exhibited clear signs of mental \ndisturbance. We know he had an extreme aversion to normal social life, \nand he didn't like physical contact. He was in and out of school and \nspent time in special education classrooms and was home-schooled by his \nmother. He lived in a room with blacked-out curtains and played violent \nvideo games for hours on end.\n  We know his mother purchased assault weapons for him and kept an \narsenal at home. We know that they went target shooting together at \nranges and that both were certified in gun safety. Their home was a \nveritable weapons depot, with many firearms, more than 1,600 rounds of \nammunition, samurai swords, and even a gun safe in this young man's \nroom.\n  It has been reported that Adam compiled a spreadsheet documenting \nhundreds of victims of mass murders--something he may have used as a \nmeasuring stick for his own sadistic plot.\n  We know one more thing: None of this information would have been \ncaught on a background check. I say this although I support background \nchecks. But this shows what is out there, which needs to be stopped.\n  On that December morning, Adam Lanza started his rampage by killing \nhis mother. He then drove to Sandy Hook and shot his way into the \nschool. He was heavily armed. This is what he carried: a Bushmaster \nXM15 assault rifle, a Glock handgun, a SIG Sauer handgun, ten 30-round \nmagazines, and a Saiga 12-gauge assault shotgun. In less than 5 \nminutes, he fired at least 154 rounds from the Bushmaster in 2 \nclassrooms. He stopped only when first responders arrived. He then took \nhis own life. He died with 139 more rounds available to fire.\n  I am sure background checks would stop many would-be murderers, but \nthey would not have prevented Newtown. The weapons were legally \npurchased by his mother. While he was disturbed, he had no criminal \nrecord or record of mental illness and would not have been subject to a \nbackground check because his mother gave him these weapons.\n  Let me be clear: Universal background checks are very important. I \nstrongly support them, but they would not have prevented the tragedy in \nNewtown.\n  I have watched these mass shootings escalate over the past 40 years--\nfour decades of my public life. Twenty-nine have taken place in just \nthe past decade, seven in the past year. Military-style assault weapons \nare often the weapon used in many of these shootings.\n  Just 3 days before Newtown, an AR-15 assault rifle was used to kill \ntwo people and seriously wound a third at a mall in Clackamas, OR.\n  Five months before Newtown, a gunman opened fire in a theater at a \nlate-night performance of a brand new movie. He killed 12 and injured \n58. The only reason he didn't continue was that this drum that he had \nin his weapon--a 100-round drum--jammed at approximately 50.\n  Although the Aurora shooter was being treated by mental health \nprofessionals, he owned a small arsenal of weapons, including a Smith & \nWesson M assault rifle, a Remington 12-gauge shotgun, two Glock .40 \ncaliber handguns, and a 100-round ammunition drum.\n  A number of weapons were used in the 1999 massacre at Columbine High \nSchool in Littleton, CO, where 13 were killed. The weapons were a TEC-\nDC9 assault pistol, a Hi-Point 9mm Carbine, a Savage pump-action \nshotgun, and a Savage 311-D 12-gauge shotgun.\n  High-capacity ammunition magazines also play a role in these mass \nshootings. In 2011, a gunman in Tucson used a semiautomatic Glock \nhandgun equipped with a 33-round magazine to kill 6 and wound 12, \nincluding Congresswoman Gabby Giffords. In 2007, a Virginia Tech gunman \nused 2 handguns and at least 19 magazines to kill 32 and wound 17. Some \nof these magazines were 15-round versions. All told, he had nearly 400 \nrounds to fire.\n  Has this ended with Newtown? Was Newtown such a stirring event on the \nconscience of America that no one would try it again? What is the \nanswer? The answer is no.\n  On March 18, just 3 months after Sandy Hook, a former student at the \nUniversity of Central Florida planned to set off a fire alarm in his \napartment and kill students as they fled. A roommate saw him with these \nweapons and called the police. The police came quickly and were able to \nprevent another massacre. Here is what he had: a .22 caliber assault \nrifle, known as German Sport Guns GSG-5; a .45 caliber handgun; two \n110-round magazines; 4 homemade explosive devices; and a stockpile of \napproximately 1,000 rounds.\n\n[[Page S2701]]\n\n  On March 31, an AR-15 assault rifle was used to assassinate a \ndistrict attorney and his wife in Texas. The district attorney's wife \ninnocently opened the door of their home. A gunman shot and killed her \nwith a single bullet. As her husband turned to try to get to his \nweapon, he was killed in a burst of at least 20 rounds. This is the \noffensive nature of these weapons.\n  A shooting many years ago--because I came to know some of the victims \nwho survived--encouraged me to submit the first bill in 1994. This was \nan attack by a man named Gian Luigi Ferri in a very high office \nbuilding in San Francisco, CA, called 101 California Street. He came in \nand killed eight. He had two TEC-9s and magazines holding 50 rounds of \nammunition.\n  He killed a young mother, Jody Sposato, 30, who had recently given \nbirth to her first child. Her neighbor said, ``She just had that \nlittle, lovely baby 10 months ago.'' I came to know Jody's husband, \nSteve, who was a wonderful, tall man who used to come to see me with \nhis baby in his arms. I am delighted to see that he remarried and made \na new life for himself.\n\n  Ferri also killed Donald ``Mike'' Merrill, who had recently adopted \ntwo children, a son and a daughter, ages 4 and 2, with his wife \nMarilyn.\n  One of the wounded, a beautiful young woman, Michelle Scully, was \nsaved because her husband John died while jumping on her body, \nshielding her from the gunfire.\n  This is how these events unfold. The tragedies they leave behind are \nactually never completely recoverable.\n  Over the years, as I have watched, I have come to see that these \nweapons are attractive to two groups of people. There are collectors, \nthere is target practice, some hunt, and some think they offer a strong \ndefense. This is one group. But death tolls show there is another group \nwho covet these firearms more for their deadly firepower--most notably, \ngrievance killers, gang members, and juveniles.\n  Let me mention the grievance killers. Their goal is to kill \nindiscriminately. These are weapons that are easy to fire quickly. They \ncan fire many times without overheating, and they can carry ammunition-\nfeeding devices that exceed 100 rounds. These are the weapons of choice \nof this group of people. The question is, Can this group of people, who \nwill kill with these weapons, buy these weapons easily? The answer \ntoday is yes.\n  These weapons are attractive to gang members because pistol grips and \nfolding stocks make them easy to conceal and maneuver. These weapons \npack enough firepower to confront other gangs as well as the police.\n  I would like to tell you one other story from my home town that \ntouched me deeply. In 2004, undercover police officers Isaac Espinoza \nand Barry Parker confronted a man at the corner of Newcomb Avenue and \nNewhall Street in San Francisco. As the officers approached, the \nshooter pulled out an AK-47 from beneath his coat and fired 14 rounds, \nkilling Officer Espinoza and injuring Officer Parker, both of whom were \narmed.\n  Officer Espinoza was a real star in the San Francisco Police \nDepartment. Everyone liked him, and he had real credibility on the \nstreets and in the community. He was very special. He had been a police \nofficer for 8 years. During that time, he received four major service \nawards. Police Chief Greg Suhr, the current chief, said he wouldn't \nhave been surprised if Officer Espinoza rose to be the chief himself \none day. But he is gone. He left behind his wife of 7 years, Renata, \nand their daughter Isabella, who was 3 at the time of his murder.\n  Finally, assault weapons are attractive to juveniles because they are \nlightweight, have little recoil, and are easy to fire.\n  The takeaway is that nowhere seems safe from these acts of mass \nviolence, made all the more deadly because of the military features of \nthese particular weapons.\n  These mass killings aren't confined to dangerous areas. They happened \nin a mall in Clackamas. They happened in a movie theater in Aurora. \nThey happened in a temple in Oak Creek. They happened in an office in \nSan Francisco. Worst of all, they happen now in schools. Schools used \nto be safe places, but now we confront the legacy of Columbine, \nVirginia Tech, and Newtown.\n  President Obama relayed the story of a murdered child's mother. She \nsaid she hates when people say her son was ``in the wrong place at the \nwrong time.'' When are schools ever the wrong place? Schools should \nalways be the right place for children and they should always be the \nright time. And that is why we must take action.\n  I am relieved we are finally debating the issue of gun violence, in \nparticular the amendment I offer today to introduce the Assault Weapons \nBan in the underlying bill. It has been 9 years since the first Federal \nAssault Weapons Ban expired in 2004, and far too many deaths. The \nAssault Weapons Ban I offer today as an amendment has one purpose: to \nbegin to dry up the future supply of assault weapons and high-capacity \nammunition magazines over time, which will save lives. It does not \naffect any legally owned weapon possessed now.\n  I fully support the bill to expand background checks, increase \npenalties on straw purchasers, and strengthen school security. But \nthese provisions are only part of a solution. The weapons I talk about \ncan fire hundreds of rounds a minute with velocities and energy far \nexceeding the standard handguns. They do not belong on the streets \nwhere they can be bought without questions asked.\n  This amendment bans the future manufacture, possession, sales, and \nimportation of 157 semiautomatic assault weapons by make and model. Let \nme list some of the most infamous models. We have here a display. They \ninclude the AK-47, the AR-15, the Bushmaster XM15, the Smith & Wesson \nM, the Hi-Point Carbine, the UZI Mini Carbine, and the Intratec \nTEC-9. They include the MAC-10, the Saiga-12, the Street Sweeper, and \nall 157 of them are explicitly, by make and model, delineated in the \nbill.\n  The bill also prospectively bans the manufacture, sale, and \nimportation of all other assault weapons that can accept a detachable \nmagazine and have at least one military characteristic, such as a \npistol grip or barrel shroud.\n  Finally, the amendment bans the manufacture and importation--as well \nas the future sale or transfer--of large-capacity ammunition feeding \ndevices capable of accepting more than 10 rounds. Here are some of \nthese large magazines--and this is the drum that was used at Aurora. In \nmany cases, such as the tragic shooting of Congresswoman Giffords, it \nis only when a shooter stops to switch magazines that police or others \nhave the chance to take the shooter down, and he or she may well fumble \nin so doing.\n  Now what does the amendment not do? To clear up some misinformation, \nit is also important to know what the bill does not do. It does not \ntake away any legally owned weapon. All weapons legally possessed on \nthe date of enactment are exempted. The amendment does not require \nregistration. If an assault weapon is legally owned before enactment \nand later transferred or sold, the recipient or purchaser must pass a \nbackground check as required in the underlying bill.\n  Finally, the amendment does not affect hunting or sporting firearms. \nLet me point that out. It protects legitimate hunters by excluding \n2,258 specifically named firearms used for hunting and sporting \npurposes. It took 96 pages of legal bill language to list these hunting \nand sporting firearms by make and model so everyone can see clearly \ntheir hunting or sporting gun is excluded from the bill. It took my \nstaff a long time and a lot of vetting to compile this list, but they \nhave done it.\n  Some have argued that the legislation would violate the Second \nAmendment. Candidly, that is wrong. The original Federal Assault \nWeapons Ban I sponsored in 1994 was repeatedly challenged in Federal \nCourt on a variety of grounds, including the Second Amendment, the \nCommerce Clause, the Due Process Clause, and the Equal Protection \nClause. The Fourth, the Sixth, the Ninth, and the District of Columbia \nCircuit Courts all upheld the 1994 law, with three of them rejecting \nchallenges based on the Second Amendment.\n  Since these rulings, the Supreme Court, in 2008, recognized an \nindividual right under the Second Amendment in a 5-to-4 decision in the \nDistrict of Columbia v. Heller. But Heller itself clearly rejects the \nclaim that Second Amendment rights are absolute. In Heller, \nconservative Justice Antonin\n\n[[Page S2702]]\n\nScalia stated: ``The right secured by the Second Amendment is not \nunlimited.''\n  And the Court said the Second Amendment does not protect ``a right to \nkeep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for \nwhatever purposes.'' Case made.\n  Also, just like other constitutional rights, the Second Amendment's \nright to keep and bear arms is subject to reasonable restrictions. An \nassault weapons ban is such a reasonable restriction, and no assault \nweapon ban has ever been overturned by a court of law.\n  Don't take my word for it. Look at the Supreme Court decisions. \nJustice Scalia's opinion in Heller specifically stated, ``Weapons most \nuseful in military service--M-16 rifles and the like'' are weapons that \n``may be banned.'' And there are weapons that are the like of the M-16 \nweapon on the street today that are covered by this bill.\n  Third, an assault weapons ban leaves available ample means for \nindividuals to defend themselves and their families using firearms. \nThis amendment imposes restrictions on one class of weapons--military-\nstyle weapons--that are highly dangerous and can kill large numbers of \npeople quickly, with increasing velocity. It leaves open ample \nopportunities to possess and use numerous types of firearms for \ndefense. I have no question this bill is constitutional.\n  A second false attack is that assault weapons covered by this ban \ncontain only ``cosmetic features'' and are no more dangerous than any \nother firearm. Nonsense. Law enforcement officers and gun experts are \nthe best ones to go to, and we have. And they have pointed out these \nfeatures were designed to be added to military weapons to make them \nmore deadly and they have the same effect on civilian versions.\n  Some examples: The pistol grip was first added to a rifle by the \nGerman army in World War II, when it was incorporated in the STG 44, \nwhich is called a ``Storm Gun.'' This feature allows a shooter to \n``spray-fire'' a large number of rounds over a broad killing zone \nwithout having to aim at each individual target.\n  Folding stocks were added to the M1 Carbine by the U.S. Army in World \nWar II so the weapon could be more easily transported by soldiers \ntraveling in cramped aircraft and military vehicles. Similarly, UZI \nmanufacturers started adding folding stocks to their weapons in the \nearly 1950s at the request of Dutch and German military who found the \ntraditional wooden stock to be too long for use while traveling in \narmored vehicles.\n\n  Every law enforcement officer who testified on the Assault Weapons \nBan in our Judiciary hearing was emphatic that military characteristics \nadd to a weapon's lethality. From Baltimore County Police Chief Jim \nJohnson: Assault weapons are ``meant for the battlefield.'' Milwaukee \nChief of Police Edward Flynn: ``Military characteristics are not simply \ncosmetic in nature. These weapons are designed for combat.'' And John \nWalsh, the U.S. Attorney for Colorado, couldn't be more clear: These \nweapons, he said, are ``crafted to be as effective as possible at \nkilling human beings.''\n  Now where are we today? Seven States and the District of Columbia \nbanned assault weapons prior to the Newtown massacre. These are my own \nState, California, Connecticut, D.C., Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, \nNew York, and New Jersey.\n  Since Newtown, legislators in 20 States have introduced bills to \neither ban assault weapons or strengthen existing bans. Twenty States \nare now contemplating action.\n  Connecticut and New York passed laws to tighten their existing bans \nto prohibit assault weapons with one military characteristic, which is \nwhat we do in this bill.\n  Maryland expanded an existing ban on assault pistols to cover rifles \nand assault shotguns.\n  In Massachusetts and New Jersey, bills have been introduced to \nstrengthen those States' assault weapons bans.\n  Efforts are also underway to prohibit these deadly weapons in States \nwith no current assault weapon ban. In Florida, Illinois, Indiana, \nMinnesota, Missouri, Mississippi, North Dakota, New Mexico, Oregon, \nPennsylvania, Vermont, and Virginia, bills have been introduced to \nimpose an assault weapons ban for the first time.\n  All of these States have strong hunting or sporting traditions, but \nthe sponsors of these bills recognize that no one needs an assault \nweapon to hunt or target shoot.\n  In other States, bills have been introduced to regulate assault \nweapons. An Arizona bill would require the sale of any assault weapon \nbe done through a licensed gun dealer.\n  Bills in Kentucky and Texas would require one to obtain a license to \npurchase an assault weapon. The Kentucky bill would also require the \nregistration of assault weapons and handguns. That is Kentucky.\n  Some bills have been introduced that would go even further than the \namendment I have introduced today. California is seeking to strengthen \nits ban, going from a one-characteristic test to a zero-characteristic \ntest. This bill would prohibit any semiautomatic rifle capable of \naccepting a detachable magazine.\n  A bill in South Carolina would require the government to seize any \nassault weapons used in certain crimes.\n  Even though more States are banning assault weapons, the need for a \nFederal ban has never been greater. If only California or New York bans \nassault weapons, nothing stops an individual from buying an assault \nweapon in a neighboring State, then crossing the border to commit \nviolence. At a Judiciary Committee hearing, Senator Durbin mentioned \nthat guns are coming into the city of Chicago which are being traced to \nthe State of Mississippi.\n  I believe if this legislation does not pass, we will see bills passed \nin a number of States. That will result in a confusing patchwork of \nlaws with different standards in different States. If this bill goes \ndown, States will, I believe, pass additional legislation. It is only a \nquestion of time.\n  Some suggest there may not be enough support in the Senate to pass \nthe Assault Weapons Ban. But the support is there among the American \npeople. In poll after poll, that support is there. In no poll--even \nwith all the discussion, even with the mobilization of gun owners and \nthe NRA, a majority in every single national poll done shows that the \nmajority want controls over assault weapons. I know of no poll done \nthis year that shows less than a majority to reinstate a Federal ban on \nassault weapons. We have more than 170 organizations covering a wide \nrange of groups that have endorsed the bill. Here are a few:\n  Major Cities Chiefs; International Association of Chiefs of Police; \nAmerican Medical Association; American Academy of Nursing; American \nAcademy of Pediatrics; National Education Association; American \nFederation of Teachers; the Children's Defense Fund; the Sierra Club; \nthe United States Conference of Catholic Bishops; the United States \nConference of Mayors; the National League of Cities; more than 800 \nmayors from across the country; Tom Ridge, former Governor and Homeland \nSecurity Secretary; John Warner, former Republican Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Few bills ever have such broad support, and I ask unanimous consent \nto have printed in the Record a list of endorsements.\n  I have also received letters and calls from Americans across the \ncountry, from all walks of life, including gun owners, who demand that \nwe stop these weapons of war from claiming more innocent victims. I \neven had a member of the NRA call me and say, ``I am a hunter and I \nhave an AR-15 but I don't need it, and I am turning it in.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record excerpts from \nthese letters.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Endorsements for the Assault Weapons Ban of 2013\n\n       Law Enforcement: International Association of Campus Law \n     Enforcement Administrators, International Association of \n     Chiefs of Police, Major Cities Chiefs Association, National \n     Association of Women Law Enforcement Executives, National Law \n     Enforcement Partnership to Prevent Gun Violence, National \n     Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, Police \n     Executive Research Forum, Police Foundation, Women in Federal \n     Law Enforcement, Chaska, Minn.

There is no practical distinction between the rate of \n     fire produced by this weapon and that produced by a fully \n     automatic machine gun. While one weapon is clearly illegal, \n     the other is legal because the outdated words used to \n     describe it suggest a distinction that no longer exists. This \n     dangerous inconsistency has essentially undermined existing \n     law, putting the practical equivalent of banned weapons back \n     on our streets.\n       The result has been devastating for our community and too \n     many like it across the country. Legally, logically, and \n     morally, your obligation is clear: we need you to take action \n     now. Please support S. 150. . . .\n\n\n                          Gina M.--Newtown, CT\n\n       . . . Six children at Sandy Hook School were able to \n     squeeze past the gunman in a doorway because he had to stop \n     to reload. How many more would have been spared had his \n     magazines been smaller? Think of those children, who had to \n     watch their teacher and classmates brutally murdered in front \n     of their eyes, now think of your own children. Think of your \n     grandchildren. Think about the parents and spouses who have \n     to live with the horror of knowing their children spent their \n     last few minutes in terror and in pain as the bullets \n     shredded their flesh. Think about the survivors of that \n     massacre, also victims, who will have to deal with their own \n     mental health issues for decades to come. . . .\n\n\n                        Richard A.--Newtown, CT\n\n       . . . Our pediatric practice lost several patients. I held \n     two of these babies in my arms in the delivery room when they \n     were born. And I was at the firehouse that night with the \n     older brother of one of our children.\n       This event has altered so many lives. One mother told me, \n     having lost her daughter, that her sons saved her life.\n       These guns, these bullets blew open these children's heads, \n     their bodies, their limbs. In what kind of society do we \n     live, whereby these weapons are needed to defend and protect?\n       Do we need to splatter bodies and blood in order to defend? \n     Do we need to shatter bones and decapitate our tyrannical \n     governments? How can anyone justify these self proclaimed \n     weapons of mass destruction . . .?\n\n\n                        Michelle D.--Newtown, CT\n\n       . . . No one should have to live in fear. No one should \n     have to live looking over their shoulder while shopping in a \n     mall, grocery store, taking in a movie, attending school or \n     simply going about their lives. No one should have to put \n     their kids on their school bus and fear that they may not \n     come home. NO ONE. . . .\n\n\n                       Christina D.--Newtown, CT\n\n       . . . We have no more time to waste. We must change for \n     those lost at Sandy Hook, for the town of Newtown, for our \n     country, for our children. We must protect our nation's \n     people. . . .\n\n\n                      Po M.--Newtown, Connecticut\n\n       I am a mother of four children (who graduated from Sandy \n     Hook Elementary School) and the shooter lived in my \n     neighborhood. We lost our neighbors, educators, and principal \n     on that dreadful morning on December 14, 2012. Our \n     neighborhood is one of the safest places in this country. \n     Sandy Hook Elementary School was one of the most nurturing \n     environment for my four children therefore we were in a state \n     of shock when we heard the horrific news on December 14th.\n       I believe stronger gun regulations would have saved lives \n     on that tragic day. I also believe if millions of people in \n     this nation demanded change after Columbine, Virginia Tech, \n     Tucson and Aurora then maybe just maybe this type of massacre \n     in our neighborhood elementary school could have been \n     avoided. It is unacceptable for us to not take action. Too \n     many Americans are dying every year. You acted swiftly and \n     boldly to institute measures to improve public safety after \n     September 11th and you must do the same after December 14th. \n     We have the right to feel safe in our schools, malls, movie \n     theaters, places of worship, work place, salons and on our \n     city streets.\n       I made a promise on December 14th that I will no longer \n     stay silent and do more to save lives by writing, e-mailing \n     and calling the lawmakers. I traveled down to Washington DC \n     with 40 Newtown teachers, clergy, parents, students, other \n     members of Newtown Action Alliance and families of victims on \n     February 26th and 27th to meet with congressional leaders and \n     to attend Senator Feinstein's Assault Weapons Ban hearing. We \n     shared our stories of tragic loss, our pain and we asked many \n     of you to honor the 26 lives by helping us to turn our \n     tragedy into meaningful action and change. Please have the \n     political courage to save American lives by banning military-\n     style assault weapons, prohibiting gun trafficking, requiring \n     universal background check on all gun purchases and limiting \n     high capacity magazines. You have the ability to save lives \n     and I am asking for your leadership.\n\n\n                         Aimee P.--Newtown, CT\n\n       . . . Over the past two months, I have brought meals to \n     neighbors who have lost children, and wept with friends who \n     have had to tell their six-year-olds that five of their young \n     friends had died. I have seen surviving\n\n[[Page S2704]]\n\n     Sandy Hook students cling desperately to their parents, to \n     their dolls, to their dogs. I have watched parents of \n     surviving Sandy Hook students withdraw from their support \n     systems. I have seen my own son, who just turned three, \n     develop a sudden fear of monsters. The effects of this \n     shooting, even in a community as supportive and loving as \n     Newtown, will be with all of us forever.\n       In the time it took Adam Lanza to reload, children were \n     able to escape. While it is unrealistic to think that we can \n     stop every incidence of gun violence in this country, we have \n     a moral obligation to do what we can to reduce the \n     unacceptably high rate of gun-related deaths every year. A \n     weapon that can put eleven bullets in a six-year-old in a \n     matter of seconds has no place on our streets or in our \n     communities. . . .\n\n\n                               Merlyn L.\n\n       . . . I have been a member of the NRA since 1979 and I am \n     willing to state they have gone way too far. They are \n     promoting anarchy and overthrowing the government. Why are we \n     allowing people to shoot each other at the movies and in \n     schools? This is sick, we don't need these weapons. We got \n     rid of the Wild Wild West a long time ago. . . .\n\n\n                               Douglas M.\n\n       . . . End this madness with people believing they have some \n     right to own any kind of gun they wish and that it can shoot \n     as many bullets as possible without reloading. Guns today \n     have turned into a kind of game in which many people who have \n     never served in the military pretend to be at war. . . .\n\n\n                                Mary L.\n\n       . . . I am a life-long Republican, but fully support the \n     ban on assault weapons. I also support the universal \n     background checks as proposed by President Obama. . . .\n\n\n                                 Jim S.\n\n       . . . As PAST NRA members, I fully support President \n     Obama's gun control plan. The NRA has no business in our \n     government. . . .\n       . . . I spent 22 years in the U.S. Army defending our \n     country--two of those years in Viet Nam.\n\n\n                               Robert A.\n\n       Please stand strong with President Obama regarding \n     meaningful gun control legislation--specifically regarding \n     assault rifles. I carried them in the army and in Viet Nam. \n     They are made for two purposes and two purposes only--to kill \n     as many people as you can in the shortest time possible and \n     kill a person with as much damage to the person as \n     possible!!! There is no need for civilians to have these \n     weapons of mass destruction.\n\n\n                                Paul N.\n\n       I am a multiple gun owning hunter and target shooting \n     enthusiast. I also support MUCH tougher gun control laws, far \n     beyond just assault weapon bans. We need to have strict \n     registration and control of all weaponry as well and closing \n     the ease of purchase loopholes. . . .\n\n\n                       Gordon S.--Cottonwood, CA\n\n       As a gun owner, I have given up membership in the NRA, \n     whose solutions to gun violence seem outrageously stupid  . . \n     . I'm not a big Obama fan, but his stance, in light of mass \n     gun violence on our ``babies'' seems reasonable. The NRA'S \n     statement of position, it seems to me, leads us into a spiral \n     of hate and destruction that may be violently braced from the \n     ``other'' side; our lives do not have to become ones of \n     revenge and fear. . . .\n\n\n                     Barbara C.--Arroyo Grande, CA\n\n       My mother was killed by a gun blast when I was 13 years \n     old. I am now 76 and the pain and memory remains. . . . I \n     accept individual that hunt and feel a need to protect \n     themselves in isolated areas, however our gun culture has \n     caused many like me to suffer beyond words and the loss of \n     young and too many lives. . . .\n\n\n                         Uma L.--Virginia Tech\n\n        . . . Had there been a ban on high capacity magazines, I \n     am confident the death toll, the injured toll would not be as \n     high as it was. Had my father's murderer used an assault \n     weapon that day, I know for certain that many who are alive \n     now--many who have become my friends--would not be with me \n     today. . . .\n        . . . The day my father went to teach--went to die, \n     really--he was sick. He was running a fever, and even though \n     it was April, he felt cold. My mother didn't want him to go \n     in, but he went anyway. That was the type of man he was--he \n     believed in his duty, and he always did it. He was right \n     where he was supposed to be--the right place at the right \n     time. And yet, he never came home. He never came home because \n     he was dead, and that was how I saw him next. Though I tried \n     to warm his hands, they were like ice. And when I said \n     goodbye, his lips were cold and there was no laughter. For \n     the first time ever, my father is somewhere I cannot follow . \n     . . .\n        . . . Somehow, the impact of gun violence and what it \n     means to lose someone is something that we don't talk about \n     in this country. It's as if the subject is taboo, a dirty \n     secret to be shoved under the carpet. . . .\n        . . . Here's what we do talk about: our right to the \n     second amendment. We talk about the right to bear arms and \n     the right to protect ourselves. We talk about the right to \n     carry our weapons in the street, our right to have them on \n     our person at all times. We talk about the right to arm our \n     children, our parents, our country. We talk about our right \n     to bear the arms we like and our right to shoot the bullets \n     we like.\n       Since my father's passing, I've heard many things. Some of \n     these comments include: ``I know you're grieving, but it [the \n     loss of a parent] is part of the natural order.''\n       Or:\n       ``If your father'd had an assault weapon that day, he'd \n     still be alive.''\n       Or:\n       ``It was a tragedy. A battlefield was created that day. If \n     only someone'd had a gun.''\n       . . . I find each of these statements to be appalling . . .\n       . . . Death by gun is something that should never become \n     normal. The idea of a battlefield becoming part of the common \n     course of everyday life horrifies me . . .\n       . . . Your everyday life should not be a battlefield. It \n     should be a place where you are safe, where you can go about \n     your business without fear. No one should have to worry about \n     facing down the barrel of a gun. Not when they are at home, \n     far away from a theatre of war.\n       Assault weapons and high capacity magazines are both things \n     that belong to theatres of war. . . . In Seung-Hui Cho's \n     case, he fired more than 158 bullets in less than ten minutes \n     at Virginia Tech. His gun never jammed, and there was no \n     window of opportunity for someone to tackle him. Had he had \n     lower capacity magazines, a window of opportunity might have \n     opened, and the casualties would have been less. . . .\n       . . . While some claimed that high capacity magazines would \n     be necessary in the hypothetical situation of five or six \n     attackers, the fact remains that it is a hypothetical. The \n     issues we are discussing now are not hypothetical--they are \n     painfully real. The murder of my father is not a \n     hypothetical. It is real, and it happened because a sick boy \n     got his hands on a gun and high capacity magazines and used \n     it to murder. If he had not had access to guns, much less \n     high capacity magazines, I would not be writing this letter \n     today. . . .\n\n\n                        Patricia M.--Tucson, AZ\n\n       . . . The shooter was stopped, not by another man with a \n     gun, but by two ordinary citizens there that day to talk with \n     our Representative, Gabrielle Giffords. If the shooter was \n     forced to reload because the magazine only held ten or 15 \n     bullets Roger and Bill might have been able to tackle him \n     sooner--and fewer human beings might have been murdered or \n     wounded, fewer families wrenching with the pain and sorrow of \n     a loved one being murdered on a sidewalk.\n       That high capacity magazine coupled with a semi-automatic \n     weapon gave horrific killing capability to the shooter. . . .\n\n\n                               Melissa L.\n\n       . . . In my 30 years as an RN working in Trauma centers, I \n     have witnessed the destruction of guns--the useless senseless \n     destruction of life. I am appalled that the NRA and other gun \n     advocates do not believe in gun control and background \n     checks. I support your efforts and the efforts of President \n     Obama. . . .\n\n\n                          Cliff P.--Hemet, CA\n\n       . . . I understand that there are many fine people that are \n     NRA members, but, at some point, they are going to see that \n     their beliefs are being ignored by the money that is poured \n     into the NRA by the gun makers.\n       As to my personal stance on this issue, I actually did a \n     little hunting when young. I have friends that like to keep a \n     gun in their home. I'm just a guy that cannot find any reason \n     for assault weapons being in the hands of anyone outside of \n     law enforcement.\n\n\n                        Gary W.--Lake Forest, CA\n\n       . . .

When your everyday citizen has access to such \n     firearms it presents an enormous threat to police, fire and \n     everyone else in the community. None of my fellow police \n     officers, probation officers, etc. ever supported the \n     possession of assault rifles or military weapons in the hands \n     of the general public. We all knew it was a bad idea we had \n     to deal with the danger it created daily.\n       It is time for the madness to stop and for meaningful \n     legislation to be passed . . .

I grew up in Shasta County and was raised on a family \n     cattle ranch. Guns were part of our everyday life and I have \n     used them to hunt . . . I understand the concerns of rural \n     gun owners and I do believe that their rights should be \n     protected. But protecting those rights must not come at the \n     cost of all of our safety. For too long, people have been \n     able to buy dangerous (nearly-automatic) weapons in secret \n     and amass dangerous arsenals of weapons that have no \n     legitimate purpose. . . .\n       . . . The same people who claim that they will go bankrupt \n     if taxes are raised one nickel, don't bat an eye at spending \n     thousands of dollars on a new gun. . . .\n       . . . People in some parts of the state are now talking \n     openly about how their second amendment rights are there to \n     enable them to defend against government tyranny. This \n     seditious talk is very frightening. I can't imagine what \n     these people think would result from armed conflict with \n     their own government . . . These people seem to think they \n     are going to be heroes in some post-apocalyptic fantasy; they \n     have lost their foothold on reality and they are very \n     dangerous.\n       . . . Please let these delusional whackos know that they \n     are not living in the state of Jefferson, they are living in \n     America, and we are a country of laws. . . .\n\n\n                        Susan E.--San Diego, CA\n\n       . . . I am a retired educator, who has experienced school \n     violence first hand. I was the only administrator on campus \n     when Andrew Williams killed two students and wounded 13 \n     others at Santana High School . . . This senseless violence \n     has to come to an end. The rights to life and safety have \n     been forgotten in the rhetoric over 2nd amendment rights.\n\n\n                      Mindy F.--San Francisco, CA\n\n       . . . I was doing my job, I was protecting my kids and I \n     was being a positive citizen in my community. I was \n     exercising my right to the freedom of my religion and Buford \n     O'Neal Furrow (a convicted felon out on parole who was deemed \n     mentally unstable by authorities) tried to take all that away \n     from me. And because of the easy accessibility of assault \n     weapons and large capacity ammunition clips guns in this \n     country he was able to do that without a second thought.\n       To me the idea of living in a free country is the ability \n     to live my life to the fullest. To be allowed to celebrate my \n     faith alongside others of many faiths and not be persecuted \n     for it . . . To be allowed to walk through life without the \n     fear of being gunned down on the job. . . .\n       . . . I hope that this letter reminds those voting on these \n     bills that there are real people and faces that are dealing \n     with these tragedies. We are not just stories and not just \n     victims. We are survivors what want to make sure what we \n     lived through can never happen to anyone else. . . .\n\n  To conclude, not every issue we vote on in the Senate is a life-or-\ndeath matter. I deeply believe this is. Since the original Federal \nAssault Weapons Ban expired in 2004, there have been more than 460 \nincidents involving assault weapons, and here they are listed, 460 of \nthem.\n  The most important duty a government has is to protect its citizens' \nsafety. When 20 beautiful first graders are slaughtered, our government \nhas failed that duty. When 12 are killed and 58 are wounded in a movie \ntheater--a safe place--our government has failed its duty. When people \nare gunned down in malls, parking lots, and their offices, our \ngovernment has failed that duty.\n  I do not believe our values are stronger because we allowed \nindividuals to own weapons designed for the sole purpose of killing as \nmany people as possible. And we must not resign ourselves to these \ntragedies. They cannot become just another fact of American life. We \nhave a duty, I deeply believe, to take steps to stop these mass murders \nthat have one common element--the use of assault weapons and high-\ncapacity magazines.\n  Through hearings and markups, we have heard no compelling reason not \nto pass this legislation. Not a single court decision has been cited \nthat suggests a ban is unconstitutional. No one can credibly dispute \nlaw enforcement testimony that assault weapons are more lethal than \nother weapons. A majority of Americans support taking action.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote on this amendment based on its merits, \nnot with an eye toward politics or ratings from gun lobbying groups. It \nis a time to stand tall. As Gabby Giffords said: You must act. Be bold. \nBe courageous.\n  So I ask you to stand with the thousands of police chiefs and law \nenforcement officers who support this bill. Stand with the doctors and \nother health professionals who support this bill. Stand with the \nreligious leaders who support this bill. And stand with the victims of \ngun violence and their families who support this bill. The time has \ncome to take these weapons of war off our streets, away from criminals, \ngrievance killers, and the mentally deranged. I urge my colleagues to \nstand tall and support this amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I wish to add my voice to those who have \ncalled on this floor for actions that address the epidemic of gun \nviolence in America. I strongly favor passage of legislation to address \nthe loopholes that have allowed too many violent individuals to \ncircumvent the background checks designed to keep them from committing \nhorrific acts. I support the amendment offered by Senator Feinstein to \nadd to that legislation a ban on new military-style assault weapons and \nhigh-capacity ammunition magazines.\n  In May of 1999, I spoke to the Economic Club of Detroit in the \naftermath of the Columbine shootings. I was surrounded by educators, \nclergy, law enforcement officials, and businesspeople who had dedicated \ntheir lives to protecting young people from an epidemic of gun violence \nin our city. I asked, ``Are we willing to say enough is enough?''\n  That was 14 years ago next month. Since then, I have placed hundreds \nof speeches on this issue in the Congressional Record. After all that \ntime and all those speeches, the question remains: ``Are we willing to \nsay enough is enough?'' After Columbine, after Aurora, after Newtown, \nafter the deaths and injuries of thousands of innocent people, many of \nthem children, can we now say enough is enough?\n  This is what the National Law Enforcement Partnership to Prevent Gun \nViolence says on this topic:\n\n       Assault weapons were designed for the battlefield and have \n     no place in our communities. These weapons were developed to \n     enable a shooter to rapidly spray-fire multiple rounds at an \n     enemy in combat, not to gun down small children, moviegoers, \n     firefighters--or the law enforcement officers protecting \n     them.\n\n  This coalition includes the International Association of Chiefs of \nPolice, the Major Cities Chiefs Association, the International \nAssociation of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators, the National \nAssociation of Women Law Enforcement Executives, the National \nOrganization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, the Police Executive \nResearch Forum, and the Police Foundation. These groups--each of them \ndedicated to the safety of our people--tell us that the threat these \nweapons present to public safety, indeed, to the safety of those who \nkeep us safe--is too great for us to allow it to continue.\n  Even in the aftermath of the Newtown shootings and other horrific \ntragedies, some have argued that the problem with our society is not \ntoo much weaponry but too little. What these folks want, essentially, \nis to send Americans into combat. This is particularly true of these \nassault weapons and high-capacity magazines, which are specifically \ndesigned for military combat.\n  Now, our local and State police forces spend billions of dollars \nevery year providing countless hours of training to law enforcement \nofficers on how to react in a situation where they might have to fire \ntheir weapon. The U.S. Marine Corps sends its recruits\n\n[[Page S2706]]\n\nthrough a 59-day course before they are considered ready for combat, \nand those marines train relentlessly to keep their combat skills sharp. \nYet, as any experienced police officer or marine or soldier will tell \nyou, for all their training and skill, combat is chaotic. Telling \nfriend from foe is never easy. And now some voices call for bringing \nthat same level of combat to our streets and schools.\n  We can no longer be frozen into passivity. We must instead respond to \nthe majority of Americans who support a Federal assault weapons ban and \na ban on high-capacity magazines. Their voices and the voices of \nanguished families and of deeply concerned law enforcement officials \nshould carry the day. We should heed those voices, support the \nFeinstein amendment and the underlying bill, and finally take action \nagainst this plague of violence.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask that all time be equally \ndivided between both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 719\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, the Second Amendment of the U.S. \nConstitution is not merely about hunting, recreational shooting, or \nmarksmanship, nor is it discretionary. This is one of the provisions of \nthe Bill of Rights that the Founding Framers of our Constitution were \nso passionate about that they made sure it was included in our \nConstitution as part of the first 10 amendments to the Constitution. It \nis not a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. But its real significance is \nmuch greater. Indeed, the Second Amendment has long been viewed as a \nbulwark of individual liberty. It guarantees the most basic civil right \nin a free society, the right that allows responsible, patriotic, law-\nabiding citizens to defend themselves, to defend their families, and to \ndefend their homes--all of this without having to rely on the \ngovernment.\n  It is no mystery to any of us that the Federal Government--or State \nor local governments, including law enforcement--is not omnipresent. \nThere are many parts of our country where law enforcement is a long way \naway or simply unavailable. So the Second Amendment preserves the right \nof responsible, law-abiding citizens to be able to protect themselves, \ntheir families, and their homes without having to rely upon an \nomnipresent law enforcement presence.\n  The Founding Fathers understood that the right of self-defense can \nbecome meaningless without the right to keep and bear arms. Some are \npushing to curtail Second Amendment rights in the hope of preventing \nanother mass shooting. I share the sorrow of the families who are \ngrieving over their loved ones who were lost. I have had the privilege \nand honor of meeting some of the families. I wish it were as easy as \nsome would suggest to solve the problem with the wave of a magic wand \nor to pass some bill. Here is the inconvenient fact that advocates of \nstrict gun control ignore--one of the facts. Every mass shooting \ncommitted in the United States over the last 63 years, including the \nNewtown shooting, occurred in a gun-free zone. In other words, in each \nof these horrific instances the attacks took place in an area where \nlaw-abiding citizens had effectively been disarmed.\n  I listened to the remarks of the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia who I know passionately believes there has to be some \nsolution legislatively we could pass that would prevent the repetition \nof some of these terrible tragedies. But she conceded herself that no \nbackground bill would have prevented Adam Lanza from acquiring these \nweapons which he effectively stole from his mother and then murdered \nher with those same weapons before committing further atrocities at \nSandy Hook Elementary School.\n  We do know that if the current law was enforced that the Virginia \nTech shooter would have been prevented from acquiring guns legally \nbecause we know he had already been adjudicated mentally ill by the \nState of Virginia. But those records were never transmitted to the FBI \nto be included in a background check. We know the shooter in Tucson \nfailed a drug test, a disqualifying fact for somebody to be able to \nlegally purchase firearms, given a background check. But that \ninformation was never transmitted to the FBI, so the Tucson shooter was \nnot prevented from buying weapons, even though he should have been \ndisqualified if the background check system had been working the way it \nshould.\n  I believe the most appropriate response to the recent mass shootings \nis to make sure that our current laws involving mental illness, drug \nuse, mental health adjudications are enforced more aggressively and \nmore efficiently. But at the same time, while we are trying to find a \nsolution to these problems and not just engage in meaningless \nsymbolism, we should not be making it harder for law-abiding citizens \nto exercise their constitutional rights under the Second Amendment.\n  We can and we should embrace realistic, effective solutions to the \nmental health problem because no one I know believes that a mentally \nill person should be able to purchase a firearm. But we also should not \nerode the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens in the process. \nI think we will have an opportunity to vote on such a bill during the \ncourse of these debates.\n  In order to bolster the freedom of law-abiding citizens to keep and \nbear arms, I am offering an amendment that would allow Americans with \nconcealed handgun licenses issued by their own States to exercise those \nrights in other States whose State law authorizes the issuance of a \nconcealed handgun license. This is not a national standard. This is \nrespecting the rights of individual States to determine whether they \nwill in fact issue a concealed handgun license and to allow those \npersons who have a concealed handgun license issued by their home State \nto have that firearm legally in another State.\n  This is an interesting chart. You will notice that only two places in \nthe country--the red, the District of Columbia and the State of \nIllinois--are the only two places in the country that do not have a \nregime of concealed handgun license issuance--only two, the District of \nColumbia and Illinois.\n  This amendment would not allow for concealed carry in Illinois or the \nDistrict of Columbia, both of which have banned that entirely. Nor \nwould this amendment affect the right of every State to set its own \nlaws with regard to concealed carry. It would not establish a national \nstandard for concealed carry and it would not allow anyone to disobey \nthe laws of his or her home State. What it would do is effectively \ntreat concealed carry licenses as a driver's license. If you are \ndriving from Virginia to Texas, you do not have to obtain a separate \ndriver's license for each State you drive through, but you do have to \nobey the speed limits and other laws of the State in which you are \ndriving. This legislation would create a similar system for concealed \ncarry permits. If it becomes the law of the land, someone with a \nconcealed carry permit in Texas would no longer have to worry about \nobtaining a separate one when he or she was traveling across the \ncountry. However, all Texans would still have to follow the concealed \ncarry laws in the State in which they happen to be located, just as \nresidents of other States still have to follow the traffic laws of the \nState, even if they have a Texas driver's license. If they are in New \nYork they still have to obey the traffic laws of New York.\n\n  This bill is very similar to an amendment that won the support of 58 \nSenators back in 2009, including 13 Democrats who are still serving in \nthis Chamber. I would add that, for those who argue about the \neffectiveness of background checks--and I certainly agree that for \npeople in the business of selling guns that background checks\n\n[[Page S2707]]\n\nare and should be the standard--but a concealed handgun license is like \na background check on steroids. It is far more intrusive into the \nprivacy and the background of the person who applies for a handgun \nlicense, so this standard ought to be one that those who support a \nrobust background check regime could also support.\n  It is also a bipartisan idea that would make it easier for law-\nabiding citizens to exercise their Second Amendment rights and it would \navoid the ``gotcha'' and a prosecution that might otherwise occur. If \nconcealed handgun licensees happen to be traveling across the country \nand possess a firearm, without this law they might otherwise be \nprosecuted for a criminal offense.\n  Just one final point. For more than two decades now, one of the \nbiggest supporters of concealed carry has been a remarkable Texas woman \nby the name of Suzanna Hupp. In October 1991, Suzanna and her parents \nwere finishing their lunch at a Luby's cafeteria in Killeen, TX, when a \nmentally ill man drove his truck into the restaurant, pulled out his \ngun, and began opening fire on customers.\n  When Suzanna realized what was happening, she reached into her purse \nto retrieve her handgun, but then she remembered her gun was not in her \npurse, it was in her car because Texas law at the time did not \nauthorize a concealed handgun permit. As Suzanna told the Senate \nJudiciary Committee in chilling testimony a few months ago, ``I wanted \nto be a law-abiding citizen.''\n  Her father courageously tried to tackle the gunman but was shot in \nthe chest. Her mother was also eventually killed too. Thankfully, \nSuzanna escaped and she quickly became a powerful champion of concealed \ncarry, which Texas legalized in 1995. Suzanna later on ran for the \nTexas legislature, where she served for 10 years. I thank her for all \nshe has done to bring this issue home in ways that all of us can \nunderstand, and to protect the Second Amendment rights of responsible, \npatriotic, law-abiding citizens. Suzanna understands very well that we \nmust never ever criminalize law-abiding citizens exercising their \nSecond Amendment rights by passing misguided legislation which \nencroaches on those rights and does not solve the real problem, which \nwe can do and I hope we will take up in enforcing existing laws and \ndealing with the mental health component that is a common element in so \nmuch of this legislation.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to call up my \namendment numbered 719.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn], for himself and Mr. \n     Vitter, proposes an amendment numbered 719.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To allow reciprocity for the carrying of certain concealed \n                               firearms)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___.

Madam President, I know this afternoon at 4 p.m. we will \nvote on a series of amendments. For all of us who were worried and \nconcerned about these episodes of senseless gun violence, I think we \ncan actually find a solution not by encroaching on the rights of law-\nabiding citizens who are exercising their constitutional rights but by \nfocusing on the areas where we can make a difference.\n  We need to enforce current laws on the books better, more \nefficiently, and more uniformly. We also need to deal with the mental \nhealth component which is common to so many of these mass shooting \natrocities.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, my home State of Vermont does not require \nits citizens to obtain a permit to carry a firearm in a concealed \nmanner, and the people of Vermont have exercised these privileges \ncarefully and respectfully. Citizens respect the wishes of private \nproperty owners and restrictions in government buildings, and this is a \nregulatory framework that has worked in Vermont, and it is a set of \nrules that have been considered and adopted by the people and elected \nofficials of Vermont, without interference from those who do not know \nVermont or its citizens.\n  These are judgments made by State elected officials with the advice \nof State law enforcement leaders. These are not judgments made for the \nStates by Federal legislators who think they know better and want to \nsecond guess the best judgments of State and local officials.\n  In matters of State police power, the Congress has traditionally not \nmeddled in State affairs. That is how it has always been and that is \nhow it should remain. That is what the 10th Amendment provides. What \nmight work in Vermont might not work in Chicago. And it is not up to me \nas a Senator from Vermont to tell the elected and law enforcement \nofficials in Illinois what their public safety laws should be.\n  The amendment we now consider would nullify the laws of all 50 States\n\n[[Page S2708]]\n\nthat govern who from out of State may or may not carry a concealed \nweapon in that State. In fact, this amendment would permit a citizen of \na rural Western State to bring his guns to the District of Columbia or \nBoston or other urban cities and override their public safety \ndeterminations. This is not a well-considered approach, and it is an \nimmense imposition on law enforcement officials in a host State who \nwill be commandeered by the Federal Government to police the concealed \ncarry laws of 49 other States. I voted against an early version of the \nBrady bill because it imposed unconstitutional burdens on State and \nlocal law enforcement. The Supreme Court agreed with my view and ruled \nthat unconstitutional.\n  In addition, this amendment would force a jurisdiction that is \nlocated within a State that may issue concealed carry permits but which \ndoes not allow citizens to carry concealed firearms in that political \njurisdiction to favor out-of-state residents by requiring that they be \nallowed to carry a gun even though the instate resident is prohibited \nfrom doing so. This amendment should offend everyone's sense of State \nsovereignty and self-government.\n  This amendment is not about correcting some existing restriction of \nthe Second Amendment right. That right is secure. Nor can it be about \nacting where the States have refused to act. The States are doing an \nexceptional job of entering reciprocity agreements with each other, \nbased upon discussions and agreements between State officials and \nwithout meddling by the Federal Government. Thirty-seven States have \nreciprocity agreements with at least one other State; some have \nagreements with many other States. This amendment would unnecessarily \ntrample on the 10th Amendment to the Constitution. It places an \nideology over the rights reserved to the sovereign States.\n  I would hope that those who claim to believe in the principles of \nfederalism would recognize the dangers associated with legislating a \none-size-fits-all approach in matters of public safety and local \nconcern. And what of the practical concerns, which Philadelphia Police \nChief Charles Ramsey laid out in testimony in the House Judiciary \nCommittee in September of 2011?\n  The Federal preemption of State laws represents a serious \nencroachment on State sovereignty. It is a subject we have examined \nthoroughly in the Judiciary Committee during the years of the previous \nadministration and in relation to efforts then to strip the citizens of \nVermont and other States of their rights to seek justice in the courts.\n  In a case called Wyeth v. Levine, the Supreme Court rejected efforts \nby a pharmaceutical company to shield itself from accountability under \nState law with Federal bureaucratic regulations when it grievously \nharmed a Vermonter. The Federal preemption of State laws is a very \nserious matter and one that the Congress should not consider lightly.\n  Yet, despite the fact that the Judiciary Committee held three \nhearings and four executive business meetings to debate and consider \nlegislative proposals, not once did the measure we now debate come up \nfor discussion. Now, without having any regular order, the proponents \ndemand that this amendment be made law.\n  This amendment, which would federalize the concealed carry laws of \nevery State, is a slippery slope. If we vote to enact such precedent, \nthen a future Congress with different views for a different era would \nhave firm ground to preempt the laws of all 50 States to restrict or \ncondition the ability of citizens to carry a concealed firearm.\n  We, as Senators, ought to be very careful about the path we are asked \nto take with this amendment.\n  This is not a measured approach. It is blanket preemption. It is not \nlike the measured approach I took with the Law Enforcement Officers \nSafety Act, which permits highly qualified active and retired law \nenforcement officials to carry firearms across State lines. In that \nlaw, we have rigorous requirements. We have law enforcement officials \nwho have training, who are sworn to uphold the law, and who have \ndedicated their careers to protecting the public. That is a measured \napproach, and it is far different from the amendment we debate now.\n  Many in this Chamber talk reverently about the importance of State \nsovereignty and the 10th Amendment. Many in this Chamber decry the \npresence of ``big government'' in the lives of Americans. Well, nothing \nreeks of big government like trampling the judgment of 50 State \nlegislatures that are in a far better position than we are to set local \npublic safety policy.\n  This amendment comes at the behest of special interests. As I have \nsaid repeatedly, we should not be taking orders from special interests. \nWe are the Senators elected to represent the best interests of 314 \nmillion Americans.\n  I urge Senators to have the courage to oppose this amendment. It is \nunwise and unnecessary. For those who appreciate the ability of \ncitizens to carry concealed firearms, opposing this amendment will help \npreserve those abilities.\n  Let's respect the virtues of federalism and let the States act in \ntheir own best judgment about who may or may not carry a concealed \nfirearm in their State. Let's be cautious in our approach in matters of \nState police power and respect the values enshrined in the 10th \nAmendment to the Constitution.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I wish to oppose amendment No. 719.\n  Amendment No. 719 would create a public safety crisis by forcing \nnearly every State to recognize the concealed carry permits issued by \nother States, even if the permit holder could not qualify for a permit \nin the State to which he is traveling.\n  Imagine this: A man convicted of a domestic violence crime against \nhis former girlfriend obtains a concealed carry permit from his State. \nUnder amendment 719, he could travel across State lines and confront \nhis ex-girlfriend, even if she lives in California, where his \nconviction would have prevented him from obtaining a concealed carry \npermit.\n  In other words, States with the weakest conceal carry permitting \nstandards will set the national standard regardless of existing State \nlaws.\n  States vary widely on how to regulate concealed weapons. For example, \nCalifornia prohibits possession by individuals convicted of violent \nmisdemeanors; requires completion of a firearm safety training course; \ngives law enforcement broad discretion to approve or deny a concealed \ncarry permit application; and requires applicants to show that they \nhave ``good moral character'' and ``good cause'' to carry a concealed \nweapon.\n  On the other hand, Mayors Against Illegal Guns found that at least 28 \nStates grant concealed carry permits to individuals convicted of \nstalking; at least 7 States grant those permits to people convicted of \nmisdemeanor assault and battery; at least 12 States grant permits to \nindividuals with no firearms safety training; and at least 9 States \ngrant concealed carry permits to teenagers.\n  Ignoring these differences, amendment No. 719 would allow \nnonresidents who cannot meet a State's permit standards to carry a \nconcealed weapon into the State.\n  This amendment would also endanger law enforcement officers. \nAccording to the California Police Chiefs Association, there is \ncurrently no national data system that records legitimate concealed \ncarry permits, so it is impossible for an officer on the street to \ndetermine whether a permit is valid during traffic stops or other high-\nrisk situations.\n  The vast majority of States have either rejected reciprocity or \nlimited it to States with equivalent or higher standards. In fact, \nseveral States--such as New Mexico, Nevada, Arkansas, and Wyoming--have \nrescinded reciprocity with other States that no longer meet the State's \nminimum standards.\n  Major national law enforcement organizations--including the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police and the Major Cities \nChiefs Association--as well as the National Network to End Domestic \nViolence, the American Bar Association, and Faiths United, are also \njoining with Mayors Against Illegal Guns to oppose amendment No. 719.\n  Congress should not support a law that undermines State law \nprotections, puts our police officers in greater danger, and allows \nunfit and dangerous individuals to carry concealed weapons in another \nState.\n\n[[Page S2709]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me in rejecting amendment No. 719.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 715\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise to discuss the background check \namendment proposed by our colleagues Senator Manchin and Senator \nToomey.\n  I grew up in northern Maine where responsible gun ownership is part \nof the heritage of virtually every family. In fact, I cannot think of a \nfamily in my hometown of Caribou that did not have firearms in their \nhomes when I was growing up, and that includes my own family. I \nstrongly support our Second Amendment rights, and two recent Supreme \nCourt decisions in District of Columbia v. Heller and McDonald v. \nChicago make clear that those constitutional rights pertain to the \nindividual.\n  As we have studied this important issue during the past several \nmonths, I have met with countless people who hold a wide range of \nviews. They include the Sportsman's Alliance of Maine, known as SAM, \nMaine law enforcement officials, the NRA, victims of gun violence, \nlicensed gun dealers, firearms manufacturers, mental health \nprofessionals, and school superintendents, among many others. These \ndiscussions have been so helpful to me as I seek to better understand \nthe issues which confront us as we shape this bill.\n  We have discussed issues, including the inadequacy of mental health \nservices, gaps in the reporting of data to the National Instant \nBackground Check System, school safety, excessive violence in video \ngames and movies, the lack of effective laws for gun trafficking, and \nstraw purchases aimed at getting guns in the hands of criminals. Those \nare just some of the many issues I have had the benefit of discussing \nwith my constituents.\n  As a result of these extensive discussions, I have decided to support \nthe bipartisan compromise authored by Senators Joe Manchin and Pat \nToomey. Their bipartisan effort would strengthen the background check \nsystem without in any way infringing on our Second Amendment rights. I \nwould note their proposal represents a vast improvement over the \nprovisions currently in the bill.\n  There were particular provisions of the legislation which was drafted \nby Senator Schumer that I oppose, such as the background check \nprovisions which are in the bill. For example, if a father gives a gun \nas a gift to his son or daughter or a brother sells his hunting rifle \nto his brother, the provisions of the legislation would require that \nthose individuals undergo background checks. I found that to be \ncompletely unnecessary and onerous.\n  In addition, the bill that is on the floor now has burdensome \npaperwork requirements that are unnecessary and that many believe are \nunworkable as well.\n  By contrast, the Manchin-Toomey compromise takes a much more \ncommonsense approach by requiring background checks only for commercial \ntransactions. Their approach clearly exempts family gifts and transfers \nand truly private sales. Their amendment protects private sellers from \nlawsuits if the weapon is cleared through the expanded background check \nand is subsequently used in a crime. That is the same kind of \nprotection that licensed gun dealers receive now.\n  The compromise also authorizes the use of a State concealed carry \npermit instead of a background check when purchasing a firearm from a \ndealer, recognizing the rigorous background checks and approval process \nthese concealed carry permits require. Their amendment also improves \ninterstate travel laws for sportsmen and sportswomen who transport \ntheir firearms across State lines in a responsible way.\n  The term ``transport'' includes staying in temporary lodging \novernight, stopping for food, buying fuel, vehicle maintenance, and \nmedical treatment, which will improve the quality and completeness of \nthe data in the NICS. Their amendment would also mandate improvements \nthat would require States and the Federal Government to send relevant \nrecords on criminals and people who are dangerously mentally ill \nthrough State plans that are developed in conjunction with the \nDepartment of Justice, which is another important improvement made by \nthe Manchin-Toomey amendment since we know there are gaps in the \nreporting that make the background instant check system less effective \nthan it should be.\n  The bill also fixes an unjust situation, where veterans have been \ninappropriately reported to the database without due process. The \namendment requires a veteran to receive extra due process prior to \nlosing his or her right to buy a gun, and that is only fair. \nSpecifically, it requires that the VA either establish or designate a \nboard for the purpose of hearing appeals by veterans who are considered \nadjudicated as mentally ill and the veteran can appeal directly to this \nboard or an outside court of jurisdiction.\n  It was critical to my support of the Manchin-Toomey amendment that it \nexplicitly bans the Federal Government from creating a national \nfirearms registry. I am completely and unalterably opposed to creating \na national registry of gun owners that would be maintained in \nWashington by the Federal Government. The bill imposes serious criminal \npenalties on any individual who misuses or illegally retains firearms \nrecords.\n  I am also pleased that the Manchin-Toomey proposal would create a \nnational commission on mass violence. This is a proposal I have long \nadvocated and is very much needed. It would convene experts to study \nall aspects of these horrible attacks and mass murders that have \nplagued our country, caused so much anguish to the families left \nbehind, and have caused unbearable anguish for the survivors as well.\n  Obviously, this debate is just beginning on the Senate floor, and the \nManchin-Toomey amendment is just one of many that will be considered. I \nwill support some amendments, others I will strongly oppose. It is \nimpossible to predict, at this early point before we have cast a single \nvote on the many amendments that have been filed to this bill, what the \nbill will look like in the final analysis and whether I shall be able \nto support it. I do believe the Manchin-Toomey background check \namendment is a reasonable, commonsense, thoughtful proposal that I can \nand will support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 717\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to call up my \namendment No. 717.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Barrasso] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 717.\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To withhold 5 percent of Community Oriented Policing Services \nprogram Federal funding from States and local governments that release \n sensitive and confidential information on law-abiding gun owners and \n                     victims of domestic violence)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. PROTECTING THE PRIVACY AND SAFETY OF LAW-ABIDING \n                   GUN OWNERS.\n\n       Section 1701 of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and \n     Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3796dd) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(l) Protecting the Privacy of Law-abiding Gun Owners.--\n       ``(1) Definition.--In this subsection, the term `private \n     gun ownership data' means information held by a State or unit \n     of local government that concerns--\n       ``(A) a license or permit of an individual to purchase, \n     possess, or carry a firearm;\n       ``(B) a license or permit of an individual relating to \n     ammunition; or\n       ``(C) the location of an individual gun owner.\n       ``(2) Withholding funds for noncompliance.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Subject to subparagraph (B), and \n     notwithstanding any other provision of this part, if a State \n     or unit of local government receiving a grant under this part\n\n[[Page S2710]]\n\n     publicly releases private gun ownership data during any \n     fiscal year, the Attorney General shall withhold 5 percent of \n     the amount that would otherwise be provided to the State or \n     unit of local government under this part for that fiscal \n     year.\n       ``(B) Exception.--Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any \n     release of private gun ownership data that is necessary in \n     the course of--\n       ``(i) a bonafide criminal investigation; or\n       ``(ii) a trial, hearing, or other proceeding of any court, \n     board, commission, or agency.\n       ``(3) Redistribution of withheld funds.--On the first day \n     of the first fiscal year after a fiscal year in which amounts \n     were withheld from a State or unit of local government under \n     paragraph (2), such amounts shall be made available to States \n     and units of local government that do not publicly release \n     private gun ownership data.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I rise today to speak about this \namendment which to me is very simple and very straightforward. This \namendment is designed to protect the privacy and the safety of law-\nabiding gun owners.\n  If a State or local government releases private information on gun \nowners--which we know has happened--then that State or local government \nwill lose part of its funding that comes from the Federal Government. \nThis includes private information on individuals who have licenses to \npurchase, possess, or carry firearms.\n  Again and again we have seen the irresponsible release of gun \nownership information. Most recently, a newspaper published an \ninteractive map of data received by government officials of gun owners \nin various parts of New York. One may wonder how the publication got \nsuch a list. They obtained this sensitive list from county officials. \nThe map included the names and addresses of individuals who have \nfirearm permits in the counties involved.\n  These individuals--law-abiding gun owners, retired law enforcement \nofficers, victims of domestic violence--all had this information about \ntheir private lives released. The release of this information by county \ngovernment did nothing to increase public safety and, in fact, I \nbelieve the government compromised public safety. By releasing the \nnames and addresses, I believe the government put these permitholders \nand their families at risk. It also put a mark on the backs of their \nneighbors who may not have any firearms. Eventually, this newspaper \ntook the map down, but the damage was already done.\n  In January of this year, a criminal attempted to burglarize a home in \nWhite Plains, NY. The homeowner was in his seventies and his gun \ninformation was released on the Internet. Thankfully, the robber did \nnot successfully steal the firearms. Less than a week later--also \nearlier this year, in January--another home in New City, NY, that was \ndisclosed on the Internet was robbed. This time, the robber \nsuccessfully stole two handguns and two firearm permits--legally \nobtained firearm permits now stolen.\n  The timing of the disclosure and the robberies clearly appears to be \nmore than just a coincidence. These criminals had the names, addresses, \nand a map. That is all they needed. And where did they get it? Because \nof the release of the information by the government.\n  This, to me, was an irresponsible disclosure.\n  It goes beyond that. They have also released information that put a \nvictim of domestic violence at risk. According to a New York State \nSenator, the county officials also disclosed the name and the location \nof a victim of domestic violence who had a legal gun permit.\n  Throughout my medical career I have treated victims of domestic \nviolence. I have seen firsthand the importance of not disclosing the \nlocation of victims of domestic violence. Often they move among a \nnetwork of safe houses. They start a new life in a new city. This \nindividual was so threatened that she contacted her State Senator, for \none. While I don't know the specifics of her case, I do know there was \nsomeone in her life who posed a threat that warranted a gun permit. \nVictims of domestic violence should never have their location disclosed \nby State or county officials--not under any circumstances I can think \nof. This, to me, is a perfect example of the unintended consequences of \na government releasing sensitive information.\n  As we can see from these examples, there are many unintended \nconsequences that put the public at risk. The county officials were \nresponsible, in my opinion, and they certainly did not increase public \nsafety. I believe they harmed it.\n  So now we have two handguns that were stolen in the hands of \ncriminals because of the fact that the list was released and then made \npublic in a broader way. We now have a victim of domestic violence \nwhose identity and location have been disclosed. This release of \nprivate gun ownership information not only puts the lives of gun owners \nand law enforcement and victims of domestic violence at risk but also \ntheir unarmed neighbors.\n  I bring this amendment to the floor. While this information clearly \ninvolves gun owners, it is about privacy and our rights as individual \ncitizens. It is about protecting the privacy of law-abiding citizens \nwho are exercising their Second Amendment rights. So today I ask my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 719\n\n  I also wish to say a word about another amendment proposed earlier \nthat we will be voting on later today which has to do with the \nconcealed carry issue. I have a Washington Post front-page story from \nthis past Saturday, April 13, and the article quotes a Member of this \nbody. It is a front-page article that carries over. It says: ``Somebody \ncould come from Wyoming''--well, I am a Senator from Wyoming. \n``Somebody could come from Wyoming to the big cities of New York or New \nHaven or Bridgeport and carry a concealed weapon.''\n  As a surgeon, I did some of my surgical training in New Haven and \nBridgeport. So I am a Senator from Wyoming, and it mentions places \nwhere I did my surgical training, and I do have a concealed carry \npermit issued by the State of Wyoming.\n  I bring this to the attention of this body to say that I would, with \nthis concealed carry permit, under the amendment I support, be able to \ncarry concealed in Wyoming as well as if I returned to the place where \nI got some of my surgical training. What we need to have is this sort \nof reciprocity.\n  In Wyoming, we don't just hand out permits such as this. There is an \nentire regimen an individual must go through to obtain a concealed \ncarry permit. First, a person has to prove they are proficient in \nhandling a firearm by taking a course and getting signed off by a \ncertified inspector, complete an application, pay a fee, and then of \ncourse submit fingerprints to the FBI for an evaluation. So a person \nhas to go through all of those things. I will tell my colleagues, \ncriminals do not apply for concealed carry permits. Criminals issue \ntheir own.\n  If an individual is currently prohibited by Federal law from carrying \na firearm, they are going to continue to be prohibited under this \namendment. This amendment allows law-abiding individuals to lawfully \ncarry concealed firearms across State lines while following the laws of \nthe host State. Just like a driver's license, this amendment is a \nlicense for self-defense across State lines in accordance with State \nlaws.\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote in support of my amendment as well \nas the one we just heard about from Senator Cornyn about concealed \ncarry.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 45 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, first of all, I wish to thank all of my \ncolleagues because I know it has been a difficult time and there are an \nawful lot of people who have different comments on this legislation. \nThey have different feelings about it. There are an awful lot of facts \nand nonfacts, truths and untruths that have been out there, and I wish \nto set a few of those things straight.\n  I think the Presiding Officer knows I am a proud gun owner. I come \nfrom a tradition in West Virginia, the same as the Presiding Officer \nfrom North Dakota. I am an A-rated lifetime, card-carrying member of \nthe National Rifle Association. I agree wholeheartedly with the mission \nof the NRA, which is to defend the Second Amendment rights of law-\nabiding, gun-owning\n\n[[Page S2711]]\n\nAmerican citizens such as the Presiding Officer and myself, to promote \nfirearms and hunting safety. As a matter of fact, as Governor, I \npromoted the Eddie Eagle Program in West Virginia along with our \nfriends. The NRA's mission includes promoting marksmanship and \neducating the general public about firearms.\n  I carry my card with me. I have had this for quite some time. It is a \nlifetime membership. Ever since I became a member, I have read all the \nmagazines, as have most of us when we get them, and I have gotten all \nthe special notices about when there was something of concern. I have \nalways read their material, and I have said, Oh, that is great; I am \nglad someone is saying this and speaking out.\n  I was surprised when the latest alerts from the NRA were filled with \nso much misinformation about the firearms background check legislation \nthat Senator Toomey and I are trying to get in front of the Senate to \nbe passed. They are telling their members that our legislation would--\nand I quote--I want to quote this--``criminalize the private transfer \nof firearms by honest citizens, requiring lifelong friends, neighbors \nand some family members to get Federal Government permission to \nexercise a fundamental right or face prosecution.''\n  Where I come from in West Virginia--I don't know how to put the words \nany plainer than this--that is a lie. That is simply a lie. Anybody who \ncan read knows that is not factual. There is nothing in this bill--\nthere is not a universal background check. There is nothing in this \nbill that says if a person is living in a neighborhood and they want to \nsell a neighbor their gun, they can't do it. No background checks are \nrequired. If a person comes from a State with the gun traditions we \nhave in our State, the gun culture, that person can give it to their \nson, their grandson, any of their family members, and no background \ncheck is needed. Why they would say the private transfer of firearms by \nhonest citizens--this bill protects honest gun-loving, law-abiding \ncitizens more than any piece of legislation we have had in the last two \nto three decades, and I think people who have read the bill know that.\n  I remember when the NRA used to feel a lot differently about \nbackground checks and it wasn't all that long ago. Back in 1999, their \nexecutive vice president, Wayne LaPierre, testified before Congress \nthat background checks were reasonable. In fact, he said it over and \nover and over. Let me quote Mr. LaPierre: ``We think it's reasonable to \nprovide for instant checks at gun shows just like at gun stores and \npawnshops.''\n  Because the law says if a person goes to a gun store now that is a \nlicensed dealer, a person has to do the background check, and by law \nthey have to keep the record, and by law they cannot use that as a \nregistration. They cannot, by law. In our bill, we even make sure any \ntype of information for registration cannot be used. We said if a \nperson tries to do it--if a government agency or a person who works for \nthe government tries to use any of these records, it is a felony with \n15 years of imprisonment. That is how much this bill protects my rights \nas a law-abiding gun owner.\n  Mr. LaPierre: ``We think it's reasonable to provide mandatory instant \ncriminal background checks for every gun sold at a gun show.'' We have \ntalked about this before. The law today says that if I go to a gun show \nand there is a licensed dealer, that dealer still has to do a \nbackground check on me and keep the proper record. But I can go to a \ntable or go outside in the parking lot and nothing is required of me--\nnothing. All we are doing is taking current law and making it uniform \nso everybody plays by the same set of rules. We think it helps \ntremendously.\n  We talked about criminals and people who have been adjudicated \nthrough a court of having mental illness and it has been determined \nthey are incompetent. We don't think those people should be able to buy \na gun at a gun show or online or at a gun store. We believe the law-\nabiding gun owners whom I know in West Virginia--and I am sure the \nPresiding Officer knows in North Dakota--would not sell their gun, even \nthough they don't have to go through a background check, to someone \nthey know is mentally insane or has a criminal intent. That is not how \nwe transfer or sell our guns in West Virginia.\n  I will tell my colleagues this. I have talked to all my gun owners \nall over my State, and I am so proud of them. They have heard all of \nthis hogwash out there and all the lies from people trying to \nmisrepresent. When I talked to them, over 87 of them said, I agree with \nyou; you are right. They have read the bill.\n  This is tough, I understand, but all I am asking is for people to \ntake the time to read it and make sure they know what is being \nproposed.\n  I would be OK if the NRA just said, Listen, we have tried the \nbackground checks and guess what. The Federal Government didn't do its \njob the way it was supposed to. They are right. The Federal Government \ndid not clamp down. They did not require the States to turn in all of \ntheir records and impose any type of a penalty.\n  Guess what. In our bill, we fix that. I have told people before, I \nhave been in the legislative process for quite some time. I have been \nGovernor of my State and I have been involved in so many different \naspects of government. I have never seen a perfect bill. I really have \nnot. I have never had a perfect bill that I have ever voted on that did \nnot have to be worked on.\n  So I would say to my friends--whether it be the NRA or any gun \norganization--if you do not like the thing you supported 10 years ago, \nthen work with me and let's fix it. If you believe they did not turn \nall their records in, I have got penalties. Also we have incentives for \nthe States to do their job. We will fix that.\n  If you are saying there have been some of these agents who have been \na little bit rogue, and they wanted to use these records, and you \nstill, in your mind, believe they are going to take your records, we \nhave said, now if they do it, it is a felony with 15 years \nimprisonment.\n  We are fixing everything you have told me. If you are saying as a \nlaw-abiding gun owner, I am looked upon as if something is wrong with \nme: Why would I want to own a gun? Why would I have a gun?\n  There are three types of gun ownership in America. You have a \nsportsman who likes to hunt, shoot, enjoy the family outings. You have \none who buys it for the defense of themselves and their family. And you \nhave a pure constitutionalist. I do not relate to this group here: that \nI am afraid my government is going to come after me and I have to \ndefend myself against the U.S. Government or the military. I am not \nfearing that, so I am not in that category. I am in these two \ncategories which most Americans are: either you are a sportsman or you \nwant to defend your family and yourself and your property.\n  This bill protects that right more than any bill we have ever had \nbefore us. It will do it more than it has ever been done in the last \ntwo to three decades. I can stand at any crowd--and I have been going \nin front of some of the most ardent gun-support crowds--I have given \nthem the bill and let them read the bill and I have taken every \nquestion they have asked me--every question. At the end, you might have \none or two who say: I am sorry, I think you are overreaching. I think \nthat basically I should have the right to buy, sell, do anything I want \nwith a gun. This might be the same person who believes there should be \nno laws for anything, that you should not have to have a driver's \nlicense to drive a car, that you should not have to pay income taxes, \nthat you should not have to abide by any laws we have on the books. I \nrespectfully disagree, but I respect their position. That is a very \nsmall minority but, boy, can they talk. They are very loud, and I \nunderstand.\n  So the only thing I am saying is, if some of the friends I have known \nforever over at the NRA--if somebody made a mistake when they put this \ninformation out, please correct it because, I can tell you, in \nWashington or in West Virginia or as a human being, the only thing you \nhave is your word and your credibility, and make sure when you tell \nsomeone something, you tell them the facts and the truth.\n  If that is your friend and it is someone you want to represent, \nhonestly, say: Let me tell you both sides. You make your decision. I am \ngoing to defend you. I am an unconditional friend.\n\n[[Page S2712]]\n\nI am your friend no matter what, through thick or thin. Now we go on to \nthe next thing, if you will, when things do not work out. I understand \nthat. But I am just saying: Tell me everything. Tell me what I can \nexpect of someone who might not agree with me and tell me what I can \nexpect of the people who will agree with me. I can handle that.\n  I will tell my friends, if you lose your credibility in Washington, \nyou have lost everything. I used to get all the magazines I received, \nall the special notices they wanted me to be alerted to. I start \nquestioning, if you did not represent it accurately, how could I make \nan honest decision on how I should feel? That is all.\n  Madam President, I do not need to tell you. You know how \nrelationships are built and how they are kept, and that is the most \nimportant thing here in this body. I say that with the utmost respect \nfor everybody in this body. I understand some of our colleagues believe \nthat supporting this piece of legislation is risky politics. I think \nthere is a time in our life, a defining time in public service, a time \nwhen you have the ability to stand when you know the facts are on your \nside and walk into the lion's den and look that lion in the eye and \ntell that lion: Listen, not today; not today.\n  Even if politics are risky, remember the words of Andrew Jackson.\n\n       The brave man inattentive to his duty is worth little more \n     to his country than the coward who deserts in the hour of \n     danger.\n\n  I am not saying any of that. Everybody has their purpose and reason. \nThis piece of legislation, the longer people read it, the more they \nstudy it, the more it sells itself.\n  My good friend Jon Tester from Montana spoke right on this floor 2 \ndays ago. I said: Jon, if you want to come down and say something, \nplease do. I did not know what Jon was going to say. But I did \nencourage Jon: Please read it. Well, flying to Montana and back, you \nhave a little bit of time to read, and Jon used that time to read the \nbill, frontwards and backwards. He spoke about the things in the bill \nit did and the things it did not do. That is what we have been talking \nabout: that 90 percent of Americans--83 percent of West Virginians--\nsupport a criminal background check or a mental background check. They \ndo not support infringing on an individual's right. If you are out in \nparts of my State--my beautiful State of West Virginia--where you know \neverybody, you know who is responsible or not, you know a family member \nyou want to give a gun to. We know that. We did not infringe on that.\n  But they also believe that on the Internet you might never know \nsomebody and that some background check should be required. If you read \nthe New York Times today, you will see an article there that is very \nalarming and alerting. It allows us to see into the world of Internet \ntransfers of guns--people who are known felons, people who are making a \nliving selling guns on the Internet because no one is checking \nanything. This bill would prevent that from happening.\n  Old Hickory also said:\n\n       One man with courage makes a majority.\n\n  One person, because, Madam President, you and the other ladies in \nthis body have given us so much strength. You really do. You bring \nbalance. As it is said in some of the movies, you complete us. You \ncomplete us as a body. You really do. I appreciate so much the \ngrounding and the way you ground us, and I thank you for that.\n\n  As shown on this chart, this is an al-Qaida member too, and I want to \nspeak about this. I was watching ``Morning Joe'' one morning, and they \nshowed a clip. They showed a clip of this gentleman, who is an \nAmerican, an al-Qaida terrorist who is an American. As you see there, \nif you ever click on this--this is very easy to pull up on your video--\nour gun laws are so outdated and so out of whack that even this person, \nwho wants to do damage and harm to every American--even this person--\nhas figured out how to exploit them, to arm themselves and people like \nhim in our country. If you have not, you need to see this. His name is \nAdam Gadahn--Adam Gadahn is his name--telling sympathizers--telling \nsympathizers of al-Qaida--how to get their hands on guns in America \nwith almost no questions asked--almost no questions. He says:\n\n       America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable \n     firearms. You can go down to a gun show at the local \n     convention center and come away with a fully automatic \n     assault rifle, without a background check and, most likely, \n     without having to show an identification card.\n\n  And then he finishes:\n\n       So what are you waiting for?\n\n  ``So what are you waiting for?'' Those are his words. Well, I am not \nwaiting. I am not waiting for him to get his hands on the guns. If you \nare a law-abiding American citizen, who can pass a background check, \nGod bless you. I will fight to the nth degree to defend your Second \nAmendment rights. But if you are this guy, with the purpose this guy \nhas for America and Americans, absolutely not. That is what we are \nasking. Our legislation shuts him down. It stops him cold in his \ntracks.\n  If al-Qaida's enthusiasm for gun show sales is not chilling enough, \nyou have to read today's New York Times article about how easy it is \nfor criminals to buy and sell guns on the Internet. Not only is it \nquick and easy, it is anonymous. You do not have any idea who you are \ndealing with. One of the people in the article describes these Internet \nsales as a ``gun show that never ends''--``a gun show that never \nends''--and I would add: never closes because the Internet is 24/7.\n  The Internet is a vast marketplace for guns. In 2000, the Department \nof Justice estimated that 80 online firearm auction sites and \napproximately 4,000 other sites offered guns for sale.\n  That was more than a dozen years ago, and we all know how the \nInternet has expanded since then. The online market may now exceed gun \nshows in terms of sales volume. We all know how we are using our \ntechnology more and more every day for our personal lives and how we \ndepend on it. For example, the National Shooting Sports Foundation \nsurveyed owners of modern sporting rifles in 2010 and found that 10 \npercent of them--10 percent of all rifles sold--had purchased their \nfirearms at gun shows whereas 25 percent had purchased them online--25 \npercent.\n  Believe me, I understand the political stakes for my colleagues--and \nI sympathize; I have been there; I understand--who come from States \nsuch as West Virginia. And no State has a higher regard for the Second \nAmendment right to bear arms than my State. In fact, on the Great Seal \nof the State of West Virginia, the preamble is: ``Montani semper \nliberi.'' In Latin that means: ``Mountaineers Are Always Free.'' So you \nknow how we feel. We are one of the few States that became a State \nduring the Civil War. We broke away from Virginia at that time.\n  But West Virginians are also guided by a little common sense. I have \nsaid this. In West Virginia we know what nonsense is, we know what \ncommon sense is, and now we know what gun sense is. That is all we are \nasking for.\n  I am proud of all of my West Virginians. When they read our \nlegislation, they understand that all we are doing is using common \nsense to protect the safety of the public, especially our kids and at \nthe same time protect the Second Amendment right to bear arms.\n  John Adams once said:\n\n       Facts are stubborn things.\n\n  ``Facts are stubborn things.'' It is hard. It is hard. And I am \npretty stubborn myself, as I know, Madam President, you are, and all of \nour colleagues. If we were not, we would not be here.\n  So I am going to go through our legislation again and tell you what \nis the myth out there and what is the fact about our legislation.\n  Let's start with the myth that the NRA is repeating to their members. \nLet's start with that.\n  Here is the myth: This legislation will require background checks \nwhen a gun owner sells, loans, or gives a firearm to a relative, \nneighbor, or friend. It is going to prohibit that from happening. That \nis what they are saying this legislation does.\n  Here is the fact: Current law exempts such transfers from background \nchecks, and our bill does nothing to change that--nothing to change \nthat.\n  You can loan your hunting rifle to your buddy without any new \nrestrictions or requirements or you can give or sell a gun to your \nbrother or your sister, your cousin, your uncle, your coworker without \na background check. You can post a gun for sale on the cork bulletin \nboard at your workplace or on your church bulletin board without a \nbackground check.\n\n[[Page S2713]]\n\n  We are not going to do anything to turn law-abiding gun owners into \ncriminals, which is what they want you to believe any legislation and \nour legislation--mine and Senator Toomey's and Senators Kirk's and \nSchumer's--would do. It does not do that.\n  There is another myth: Nothing in this legislation would have \nprevented or will prevent any tragic mass shootings in the future.\n  Madam President, I know you were visited by the families, as most of \nour colleagues were, from Newtown--a most difficult time. Not one of \nthem ever asked us to take the guns away. Not one of those families \never asked us to repeal the Second Amendment. They never infringed on \nany of that. And most of them to a ``T'' said: I know this would not \nhave saved my baby. I know this law today that you are working on would \nnot have saved my baby. They know that. They said: Maybe we can save \nsomebody else's baby. That is all.\n  But let me tell you, this bill has a component called the Commission \non Mass Violence because, as you go around and you talk to the children \nthroughout the schools of your State, respectfully--I have been all \nover West Virginia--this generation has been desensitized to the \nviolence that you and I grew up being scared to death of.\n  They have been desensitized. They can get on a video game and see \nthings we can never imagine. This Commission on Mass Violence is put \ntogether by people of expertise who can tell us about guns. When a \nperson says: Oh, I think that gun ought to be banned, wait a minute. \nThat is my hunting rifle. It might look a little different, but it does \nnot shoot any different. You might not know about it, so do not ban \nthat gun until you know. So this Commission basically puts the \nexpertise of guns on gun people who can explain it to us and then make \nan informed decision. This piece of legislation--the Commission on Mass \nViolence--puts together people with expertise in mental illness.\n  I go to grade schools, I go to the kindergartens since this happened \nat Newtown. Do you know what they tell me? They say: Senator, I can \nidentify a child who has problems. I can identify a child who comes \nfrom a home with problems. They have mental challenges. They need help. \nI have nowhere to go. I have nowhere to send them. They have no \ninsurance. They have no type of help or support.\n  We can fix that. But you have to listen to the people who understand \nmental illness.\n  Then, on top of that--this is a sad scenario because if we would have \nhad the Commission on Mass Violence, and that Commission would have \ncome back, and part of that Commission says, on school safety--as a \nGovernor, and I know as an official in the Presiding Officer's State, \nwe built a lot of schools, we modeled a lot of schools. Not one time \ndid an architect ever come to me and say: Governor, we have to put \nbulletproof glass on all first floors of our schools. Bulletproof \nglass.\n  Now, think about this. Adam Lanza shot out the front door and stuck \nhis arm through and opened the door to get into that school. It was \nlocked down. Most of the schools now have looks on them. Most of the \nclassrooms have locks. If you can shoot the glass out and stick your \narm into the door, what good is it?\n  We would have never thought about that. If we could have done that, \nmaybe, just maybe, we could have prevented this horrible tragedy. I do \nnot know. But the families are not asking us to look back, they are \njust asking to look forward. They are saying there could be another \nchild, that there could be another massacre; can we stop it?\n  I do not say this bill is a panacea. But if I can stop one crazy \nperson, if I can stop one criminal who has nothing but hatred and harm \nto inflict on other people, if I can do that, I have done my job, I \nthink I have, and I can go home.\n  As one of the Newtown parents, Francine Wheeler, said: Please help us \ndo something before our tragedy becomes your tragedy. This is so \ncompelling. It really is. Our bill will ensure that the States get \ntheir records up to speed. The NRA was correct. They said: Hey, you \nhave not done your job. I agree with them. We did not. But we are going \nto.\n  I have often said: You can either throw the baby out with the \nbathwater or you can change the water. I intend to make a change. That \nis all I am asking.\n  Our bill is going to prevent felons--it is going to prevent this guy \nand people like this guy from just going to the gun shows like a \nsupermarket and getting whatever they want to get to do harm to us. It \nwill not stop them all. If we can slow them down, we might have saved \nan American's life.\n  A national registry. I have talked about this so many times. That \ncannot happen. Section 122 of this bill:\n\n       Prohibition of a National Gun Registry. Section 923 of \n     Title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding from our \n     bill: The Attorney General may not consolidate or centralize \n     the records of the acquisition or disposition of firearms, or \n     any portion thereof, maintained by a person with a valid \n     current license under this chapter; an unlicensed transferor \n     under this section; possession of ownership of firearm, \n     maintained by any medical or health insurance entity.\n\n  It goes on and on.\n  All I have asked for is for everyone to please read the bill. I do \nnot know what the outcome will be. I know we are close. I know it is a \ntough decision. I know that. I feel good. I believe I am here for this \npurpose. I believe that and I am willing to walk anywhere that would \nallow me to speak the facts.\n  As I said, I have never seen a perfect bill. I am sure we can even \nimprove on this legislation. But I will say, everybody was asked for \ninput. No matter what side of the fence people were on on the gun \nissue, they were asked for input. Whether it came from an organization \nrepresenting millions of people, I wanted their input. Whether it came \nfrom a person who wanted to ban everything, I wanted their input. Then \nthey were able to come together and say: If I am a law-abiding citizen, \nthen let me exercise my rights as a law-abiding citizen.\n  The Second Amendment is very cherished by us and very sacred in West \nVirginia as it is in North Dakota and everywhere else. We made sure the \nculture we grew up with was protected and enhanced. We made sure of \nthat.\n  I can go to any group in America and show them. When they see the \nfacts, they will agree. I have been there. I know it happens.\n  So I finally will say: If you are a law-abiding citizen, and you are \na law-abiding gun owner, you want to be treated and looked upon as a \nrespected law-abiding citizen and gun owner, this bill does it for you. \nIf you believe we should be able to treat our veterans better than we \nhave because veterans today, if they are just evaluated by a VA court, \nif you will, and determined that--that is just not right. They can be \nput on the NICS list immediately. We have a 30-day period that every \nveteran coming out who might have some challenges--and God only knows, \nthose men and women have sacrificed so much, what it has done to their \nlives. We owe them everything. We owe them the right to be able to live \nas a law-abiding citizen and to get back into the mainstream of America \nwithout having to fight for rights.\n  This bill does that for veterans. This bill does that. We notify \n150,000 veterans--we notify 150,000 veterans who might be on the NICS \nand do not even know they are on it and give them that 30-day repeal \nperiod. We do that in this bill.\n  So if you want to really honor a veteran, if you want to thank them \nfor their services and make sure they are treated with the utmost \nrespect, this bill does that. If you are a criminal, if you have been \ndeemed to be mentally incompetent through a court, you are probably not \ngoing to like the bill. I am the first to tell you that. I am sorry. \nYou are not going to like it. I am not going to make any excuses. I do \nnot think you want guns for the right reasons anyway. So I hope I can \nkeep them from you. That is what I would say. I hope I can keep them \nfrom you.\n\n  I hope you cannot go down with an al-Qaida person over here who is an \nAmerican terrorist, go with him and buy a gun. I hope you cannot do it \nat a gun show. I hope you cannot get on the Internet, where they do not \nknow who you are and what you look like or what your intentions are, \nand buy a gun.\n  I would like to maybe find out if I can stop you. So I plead guilty \nto that. If that is what it is, I would. But I am proud of the work we \nhave done. I am proud of all of the Senators. I know all Senators have \nto make a decision. I respect that.\n\n[[Page S2714]]\n\n  I do not think ever in our lives has a bill come together with so \nmany pieces of it and so much involvement and input, that took into \nconsideration law-abiding gun owners like myself and the Presiding \nOfficer and so many of us in this body, and respected that and enforced \nit; and also the respect of our veterans; we fixed that; also that the \ngovernment hasn't done its job but could do a better job, and may could \ndo it; and the ability to keep a person who should not have a gun \nstrictly at a commercial transaction.\n  I do not know of any bill that we have had before or that we might \nhave again that will do it all.\n  With that, I would say that it has been a pleasure to work with all \nof my Senators. They have worked hard. I know it is not going to go \naway. Whatever happens today will happen. I believe we have done a good \njob. I just ask my colleagues to consider this before we vote sometime \nthis afternoon and make sure they feel good and comfortable and can go \nhome and defend their position. That is all. Everybody has to do that. \nWe have to respect that. I do.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I rise to urge my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to join a strong bipartisan coalition which is taking real action \nto end senseless, deadly gun violence. This includes truly commonsense \nreforms which have nothing to do with infringing on our Second \nAmendment rights and the Second Amendment rights of our law-abiding \ncitizens.\n  We have seen the Newtown parents here in Washington bravely telling \ntheir stories. They deserve better than this body turning their backs \non them. The families of Aurora deserve better than this body turning \ntheir backs on them. The families of the more than 30 people who die \nevery single day at the hands of gun violence deserve more from this \nbody.\n  My friends, it is simply time to act. Today is the day for this body \nto show the American people their voices matter. When 90 percent of \nAmericans demand us to expand background checks, we can deliver.\n  We should be able to agree we no longer need military-style weapons \nand ammunition clips on our streets. We should be able to agree it is \ntime to crack down on the illegal handguns being trafficked on our \nstreets into the hands of criminals.\n  Four years ago I met the parents of Nyasia Pryear-Yard. Nyasia was a \nbeautiful 17-year-old honor student killed in the prime of her life by \nan illegal handgun when she was just spending time with her friends.\n  I vowed to Nyasia's parents and classmates I would stop the flow of \nillegal guns which make their way onto our streets and into the hands \nof criminals by finally making gun trafficking a Federal crime and \nholding offenders accountable with stiff penalties. We have the \nopportunity today to give law enforcement the tools and resources they \nneed and have long asked for. This is not a Republican or a Democratic \nidea. It is a smart idea and the action Nyasia's parents deserve from \nus.\n  According to the New York City mayor's office, 85 percent of the guns \nused in crimes come from out of State. At least 90 percent of those \nguns are illegal. They are illegally trafficked into our cities and \nState. Of all the laws we have on the books today, effectively none are \ndirectly focused on preventing someone from driving from one State to \nanother with stricter gun laws, parking their car in a parking lot, and \nselling hundreds of firearms directly into the hands of criminals. It \nis shocking to me as a mother and as a lawmaker.\n  Instead, prosecutors primarily rely on laws which prohibit making \nfalse statements in connection with the purchase of a firearm. These \nare paperwork violations with penalties too low to be effective law \nenforcement tools.\n  Over the past 3 fiscal years, more than 330,000 guns used in violent \ncrimes show telltale signs of black market trafficking, 420,000 \nfirearms were stolen, and thousands of guns with obliterated serial \nnumbers were recovered by law enforcement. While law enforcement is \nworking overtime to track down illegal guns and apprehend those who \ntraffic these weapons, current law restricts their ability to \ninvestigate and prosecute these crimes.\n  We can all agree this simply makes no sense and leaves all our \ncommunities vulnerable. All across this country in small towns and big \ncities, families are saying enough is enough. It is time to get serious \nand do something to prevent the next tragedy.\n  Now we are able to do so. Our bipartisan Stop Illegal Trafficking in \nFirearms Act would empower law enforcement to investigate and prosecute \nillegal gun traffickers, straw purchasers, and their entire criminal \nnetworks. This bill is not everything I wanted when I set out on this \nmission in 2009, but it is a good bipartisan compromise. It is a \ncompromise I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support. \nIf you do, we can stop the illegal flow of guns which are coming into \nour city neighborhoods, reduce gun violence, and reduce senseless gun \ndeath.\n  Law enforcement officials across the country need this legislation to \nprotect our communities from illegal weapons. If you are a responsible, \nlaw-abiding gun owner watching this, you should support this \nlegislation too. My friends who are Second Amendment supporters, gun \nowners, and hunters support this commonsense legislation.\n  I am urging all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us. \nStand with families in our communities all across the country who are \nlooking to us to take action. It is time to prevent the next senseless \ntragedy, prevent the next death, and the next Nyasia Pryear-Yard.\n  I urge you to stand with the brave men and women of our law \nenforcement at every level who are asking us to take these critical \ncommonsense measures needed so they can do a better job for us and keep \nour families safer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, as we close this debate on this \nhistoric bill, I urge my colleagues to again heed and hear the families \nof Newtown. They are here talking about not only the horror and \nunspeakable and unimaginable tragedy that befell them on December 14, \njust 4 months ago, but to speak also for the 3,400 or more who have \nperished since as a result of gun violence, the thousands more who will \ndie needlessly if we fail to take action, and the many others who have \ndied tragically as a result of gun violence.\n  Newtown shook America. It shocked and changed our country. We owe it \nto the families and we owe it to ourselves to heed and hear their \nmessage. We need to do something about the guns. That is what they told \nme again and again in Newtown and Connecticut and across the country. \nAnd those families have come here, mustering their courage and \nstrength, showing us what is great about America--the grit and \ngreatness of our Nation.\n  Somewhere in that time period, there were many bracelets, and I was \nhanded one I have worn since. It says, ``We choose love.'' ``We are \nNewtown. We choose love.'' And that is what we should do today.\n  Those 20 beautiful children and 6 great educators whose pictures have \nbeen before us day after day, whose images have been before America \nweek after week during these 4 months, for them, we are all Newtown. \nLet's choose love.\n  They are not the first to have perished in a mass killing. Well known \nto America, the names are now engraved in our memories, so that we \nmerely need to say them to evoke the grief and tears--Aurora, Tucson, \nVirginia Tech. All of those names and others are likely not to be the \nlast, and nothing we are doing here will end entirely the plague of gun \nviolence. We will not solve the whole problem because there is no \nsingle solution or even necessarily a set of solutions we are debating \ntoday that will end all the tragic bloodshed. But we can save lives. We \ncan make a start. We can literally stop a major part of it with \ncommonsense measures that evoke common ground.\n\n[[Page S2715]]\n\n  With a background check system, we can stop criminals, felons, the \ndangerously mentally ill, domestic abusers, and others who should not \nhave guns from buying firearms and using them as weapons of war.\n  With a ban on illegal trafficking, we can stop felons and other \ncriminals from trading and transporting guns across State lines, making \na mockery of strong State laws, such as Connecticut's, which protect \nits people, and stop them from making straw purchases.\n  With measures on school safety, we can secure those educational \ninstitutions that have proven vulnerable again and again. The Campus \nSafety Enhancements Act will help us do that, and we can make our \nchildren less vulnerable.\n  With an assault weapons ban, we can begin to reduce and eventually \nend the flow of these military-style assault weapons designed to kill \nand maim human beings.\n  With a ban on high-capacity magazines, which I will offer through \namendment No. 714, we can make killers less lethal, stop them from \nkilling their victims as rapidly and numerously. We can gain time in \nthose situations of mass killings where a few seconds can actually save \nlives.\n  With these measures and others that will be offered here today on \nmental health, for example, we can choose love. We can choose to make \nsomething positive of that unspeakable and horrific tragedy which \nbefell Newtown and which has befallen many others before and since. We \ncan do something. We can take action.\n  On the universal background check, which my colleague Senator Manchin \nspoke about a short time ago and which he has authored with Senator \nToomey, we can choose a bipartisan commonsense measure. It is not \neverything I would hope would be in a background check measure, but it \nis a genuinely important improvement on current law.\n  We know background checks have worked on the 60 percent of sales \nwhere they have been applied because they have stopped about 2 million \nfelons and other dangerous people who are prohibited by law from buying \nweapons from actually going into stores and purchasing them.\n  I understand the argument that we need more prosecutions and that \nexisting laws need to be enforced more vigorously. As a prosecutor, I \nam very sympathetic toward that argument, and I will support zealously \nmore resources and even better management to result in more \nprosecutions. We need to enforce existing laws more effectively, but \nthat goal should not stop us from improving those laws, especially when \nlaw enforcement itself--our police and prosecutors at every level: \nState, Federal, and local--urges us to improve those laws to enable \nthem to prosecute more of the dangerous people who use guns for evil \npurposes.\n  We ought to listen to those law enforcement officers, as I did for \ndecades as a U.S. attorney and the State attorney general for 20 years. \nI am listening to them now when they say to me that we need a universal \nbackground check system, we need to make our laws more effective \nagainst assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, as well as on \nschool security and illegal trafficking.\n  Ninety percent of the public, 90 percent of everyone in this Nation \nsupports this commonsense measure and 74 percent of the members of the \nNRA. This issue is not about the NRA or any special interests--although \nthey have maintained a stranglehold over this type of legislation for \nover a decade, maybe a generation--it is about a bipartisan compromise \nforged out of a clear need for rational, sensible action that we now \nhave an obligation to adopt.\n  Nobody wants to take away guns. Nobody wants to take away rights. The \nSecond Amendment guarantees the right to possess firearms. But some \nfirearms should not be possessed, and some people should not possess \nany firearms. That is what brings us to this point, this historic point \nin a debate that should evoke bipartisan support, and I hope Members on \nthe other side of the aisle who are still in doubt will come to support \nthis measure. We need only a few votes. We have the vast majority of \nDemocrats.\n  I salute Senators McCain, Kirk, Collins, and others on both sides of \nthe aisle who have made difficult decisions. But if this decision has \nseemed difficult to them and to many others, think of how difficult it \nhas been for the Newtown families to come here and share their grief \nand pain with us, and they support the ban on high-capacity magazines \nbecause they know from their experience how lethal high-capacity \nmagazines make any firearm--even more lethal than they would be \notherwise.\n  I salute my colleague Frank Lautenberg, who has been a champion of \nthis cause for some time, as well as Senator Feinstein, who included a \nhigh-capacity magazine measure in her bill--it is in her amendment \nnow--and my colleague Senator Murphy, who has been a partner in this \neffort. He and I have listened to the families of Newtown when they \nhave told us why they support a ban on high-capacity magazines, which \nis supported by 65 percent of all Americans and 55 percent of gun \nowners. It is supported by groups across the board, from law \nenforcement to health care, gun safety, education, child welfare, and \nreligious groups.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a list of those groups supporting a ban on high-capacity \nmagazines.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Groups That Have Endorsed This High Capacity Magazine Ban\n\n       The groups that have endorsed the high capacity ammunition \n     magazine ban we are debating today include:\n\n\n                            law enforcement\n\n       International Association of Campus Law Enforcement \n     Administrators\n       International Association of Chiefs of Police\n       Major Cities Chiefs Association\n       National Association of Women Law Enforcement Executives\n       National Law Enforcement Partnership to Prevent Gun \n     Violence\n       National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives\n       Police Executive Research Forum\n       Police Foundation\n       Women in Federal Law Enforcement\n\n\n                              health care\n\n       American Academy of Nursing\n       American Academy of Pediatrics\n       American College of Surgeons\n       American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\n       American Medical Association\n       American Public Health Association\n       Association for Ambulatory Behavioral Healthcare\n       Doctors for America\n       National Association of School Nurses\n       National Physicians Alliance\n       Physicians for Social Responsibility\n\n\n                      education and child welfare\n\n       American Federation of Teachers\n       Child Welfare League of America\n       Children's Defense Fund\n       National Association of Social Workers\n       National PTA\n       National Education Association\n       Save the Children\n\n\n                               gun safety\n\n       Arizonans for Gun Safety\n       Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence\n       Coalition to Stop Gun Violence\n       Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence\n       Mayors Against Illegal Guns\n       Newtown Action Alliance\n       Sandy Hook Promise\n\n\n                               religious\n\n       African Methodist Episcopal Church\n       Alliance of Baptists\n       American Friends Service Committee\n       Catholic Charities USA\n       Catholics United\n       Faiths United To Prevent Gun Violence\n       Jewish Council for Public Affairs\n       National Council of Churches\n       National Episcopal Health Ministries\n       Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)

Madam President, we have listened to the families of \nNewtown talk about high-capacity magazines.\n  Bill Sherlach, for example, who was the husband of Mary Sherlach--we \nhave seen her picture here--had this to say about high-capacity \nmagazines:\n\n       It's just simple arithmetic. If you have to change \n     magazines 15 times instead of five times, you have three \n     times as many incidents as where something could jam. \n     Something could be bobbled. You just increase the\n\n[[Page S2716]]\n\n     time for intervention. You increase the timeframe where kids \n     can get out. And there's 11 kids out there today that are \n     still running around on the playground pretty much now at \n     lunchtime.\n\n  And those 11 kids he talks about are alive because the shooter needed \nto change magazines.\n  Another Sandy Hook family member, Nicole Hockley, the mother of Dylan \nHockley, said the following:\n\n       We looked at the search warrants . . . and know that [the \n     shooter] left the smaller capacity magazines at home, that \n     was a choice the shooter made. He knew that the larger \n     capacity magazine clips were more lethal.\n\n  David Wheeler, the father of Benjamin Andrew Wheeler, said the \nfollowing:\n\n       The more bullets you can get out the end of that gun in the \n     least amount of time, that is the single area that I believe \n     affects lethality. And the size of the magazine placed in \n     that weapon is a direct contributor to that--a direct \n     contributor to that factor. There is a place for 30-round \n     magazines, in the military, on the battlefield.\n\n  The families of Newtown have spoken clearly and powerfully, but the \nfacts of other shootings support the ban on high-capacity magazines \nagain and again. In Tucson, AZ, for example, Jared Loughner emptied a \n33-round magazine in 19 seconds, killing 6 and injuring 13 before \nstopping to replace his magazine. When he went to reload, a bystander \ntackled him. Others joined in, subduing and disarming him. Loughner was \nstopped because he had to pause to reload. His 13th round killed 9-\nyear-old Christina-Taylor Green. If Loughner had been limited to a \nmagazine with 10 rounds, that little girl very likely would still be \nalive today. If Lanza had been limited to a 10-round magazine, \nbeautiful girls and boys might well be alive today.\n  Newtown and Tucson are only two instances in which a shooter was \nstopped when he had to reload or when his firearm ran out of \nammunition.\n  In Queens, NY, in 1993, Colin Ferguson boarded the Long Island \nRailroad with a 9mm pistol with a 15-round magazine. He opened fire, \nkilling 6 and injuring 19 others in 3 minutes. When he went to load \nanother magazine, he was tackled and disarmed.\n  In Chapel Hill, NC, in 1995, Wendell Williamson walked the streets of \nChapel Hill with an M-1 rifle. He opened fire, killing two. When he \npaused to reload, a bartender tackled him and disarmed him.\n  In Springfield, OR, in 1998, Kip Kinkel went to his high school with \nseveral firearms and 1,127 rounds of ammunition. He opened fire, \nshooting 50 rounds, killing 2 students and injuring 24 more.\n  As his firearm ran out of ammunition and he began to reload, several \nstudents tackled him and restrained him until the police arrived.\n  There are many others. In fact, half of the mass killings since 1982 \ninvolved high-capacity magazines. Half of all those mass slaughters \nwere enabled by high-capacity magazines.\n  Facts are stubborn things, as Ronald Reagan used to say. Everyone is \nentitled to his own opinion but not to his own facts, as Daniel \nMoynihan reminded this Chamber many times.\n  The most tragic stories for me involve law enforcement officers \nkilled in the line of duty. In Connecticut they include Officer Robert \nFumiatti of the New Haven Police Department; Master Police Officer \nPeter J. Lavery of the Newington Police Department; Patrolman Brian A. \nAselton of the East Hartford Police Department; Officer James V. \nSpignesi, Jr. of the Connecticut Department of Environmental \nProtection; Officer Walter T. Williams, III of the Waterbury Police \nDepartment; Officer Daniel Scott Wasson of the Milford Police \nDepartment; Patrolman Kenneth Bateman, Jr., of the Darien Police \nDepartment; Patrolman Gerald T. DiJoseph of the Bridgeport Police \nDepartment; and the first, whom I came to know, at least through his \nfamily--although I never knew him personally Trooper Russell Bagshaw. I \nhave known many of these families and had the privilege of coming to \nknow their children in many instances as well. I want to talk about \nRussell Bagshaw in closing for just a moment.\n  Russell Bagshaw of the Connecticut State Police was in his patrol \ncar, driving the streets of northeastern Connecticut in North Windham \non a summer night in 1991. He was 28 years old and a 4\\1/2\\-year \nveteran of the Connecticut State Police.\n  Each of these men I have mentioned died as a result of gunfire from \ncriminals. Some of these shooters got a stolen weapon, perhaps \nillegally trafficked. None of them should have had access to any \nfirearm. Russell Bagshaw surprised two robbers coming out of a local \nsporting goods store. One of the robbers shot him with a semiautomatic \n9mm pistol that had a second handgrip under the barrel, and a 30-round \nmagazine filled with hollow point bullets.\n  Before Trooper Bagshaw had even a chance to use his radio or exit his \nvehicle, the shooter unloaded 17 hollow point bullets at the cruiser \nthat took 6.6 seconds from that 30-round, high-capacity clip. The \nshooter fired haphazardly, but he had enough to pierce the bulletproof \nvest Bagshaw was wearing above the left armhole and to kill him \ninstantly.\n  I attended his funeral, with lines and lines of his fellow troopers \nand others from all around the country. I had the privilege of meeting \nthese families--and most especially his family--brave and strong, just \nas the Newtown families are.\n  Neither Russell Bagshaw's training nor any of the other preparations \ncould stop or protect from this carnage. In fact, the troopers I met \nafter the horrific tragedy of December 14 in Newtown and Sandy Hook \ntold me that their bulletproof armor could not have defended them \nagainst the assault weapons with the number of rounds that Adam Lanza \nhad at that time.\n  There is no preparation, no bulletproof vest, no armor that can \nprotect against these kinds of weapons shot at the range that many of \nthem are. That is why we should listen to law enforcement--listen to \nthe police and public officials and prosecutors who have told me since \nI began working on this cause in the early 1990s, when we passed the \nfirst assault weapon ban in Connecticut and I defended it in court, \ntried the case, and then went to State supreme court successfully \ndefending our law against exactly the same constitutional arguments \nmade now. They are equally without weight at this point.\n  So I urge my colleagues, whether they are wearing this wristband or \nnot, to choose love. I know it will be difficult. It was difficult for \nmany Connecticut legislators, and I carry with me the pen that our \nConnecticut Governor used to sign our law that significantly \nstrengthened Connecticut's protection against these weapons, against \ncriminals bearing them, against illegal sales, and against gun \nviolence.\n  This cause is not going away whatever the outcome today. The vote \nwill be close on many of these amendments. The Newtown families are not \ngoing away, the Connecticut effect is not going away, and we are not \ngoing away. Unfortunately, gun violence is not going away, and we need \nto redouble and reinvigorate our efforts. Whatever the outcome here \ntoday, we are not going away.\n  The world has watched Newtown exhibit the kind of strength and \ncourage that we regard as uniquely American. Now the world is watching \nthe Senate, and we will be held accountable for what happens here. \nHistory is watching. Let's be on the right side of history.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise as a parent, as a father, as an \nAmerican who saw the horror of Newtown.\n  Too many times I have come to this Senate floor to say I offer my \nthoughts and prayers to the parents of the victims of an assault weapon \nattack. Too many times. Columbine, Aurora, Virginia Tech, Newtown. How \nmany times will we have to offer our thoughts and prayers to the \nvictims of gun violence?\n  I have two beautiful children, Alicia and Rob, and they are the most \nimportant and cherished people in my life. I don't know what I would do \nif anything happened to either one of them. So I am here for them and \nfor the children they may have one day and for every child in Newtown \nand across America whose small voice has been silenced by a gun.\n  I don't think it is an exaggeration to say that each and every Member \nof the Senate felt a loss that day just 4 months ago. Here we are, 4 \nmonths later, trying to do something--but still not enough--for those \nchildren, for\n\n[[Page S2717]]\n\nthose families, for all the families who have suffered the devastation \nof a shooter with the ability and the will to kill innocent people--as \nmany as an assault weapon can kill as quickly as it can fire--a shooter \nwith a desire to get off as many rounds in as short a time as possible.\n  In my view, we are already too armed. We are by far the most armed \nNation in the world. There are more guns in America--almost 90 per 100 \nresidents--than in any other nation. Do you know there are five \nfederally licensed gun dealers in America for every McDonald's? Think \nabout it. Think about how many times you see a McDonald's. Well, \nimagine five times as many gun dealers. There are about 310 million \nguns in America. But consider that those 310 million guns are owned by \nonly about 40 percent of American households.\n  Now we are in the midst of a debate in which some are arguing that \nnot only should we not ban assault weapons, but we should force every \nState to allow people to carry concealed weapons.\n  How does that help reduce gun violence? How are we reducing gun \nviolence if we allow people to carry concealed weapons across State \nlines; if we allow someone in Florida or Virginia to carry their gun to \nNew York City and Times Square or my home State of New Jersey? Is that \nthe legacy we want to leave the children and families of Newtown?\n  I strongly oppose any amendment that would allow reciprocity for \nconcealed weapons. Yet even as we skirt the real issues, banning the \nweapons and the ammunition devices that have caused our Nation so much \nheartbreak, we would have those who see this as an opportunity to \nweaken gun laws; those who see this as a way to push, from my view, a \nradical agenda and put more firearms into the hands of those who don't \ndeserve them.\n  My home State of New Jersey has a gun control regime specifically \ntailored to a densely populated State. Our State requires affirmative \npermission to buy a firearm. But we leave that decision to those who \nknow the State best in terms of its security--the State Police. They \nconduct a thorough background check, even more thorough than the \nFederal background check, and then the police sign off and give a \npurchaser a card to buy a firearm.\n  Of course we have commonsense safeguards to ensure the Second \nAmendment is not violated, including appeal rights. But under an \namendment offered by one of my colleagues, soon New Jersey's carefully \nconstructed firearms law, if this amendment were to be adopted, would \nbe eviscerated. Soon New Jersey's law would only be as good as the \nleast restrictive States. This amendment, in essence, is mandatory \nconcealed carry reciprocity. Not the current type of concealed carry \nreciprocity where States might voluntarily enter into agreements to \nallow their permits to be used in another State. No. This amendment \nforces States to accept other States' concealed carry permits.\n  I guess so much for the States rights advocates that I have listened \nto here so many times.\n  At least 28 States grant concealed carry permits to those convicted \nof stalking, and at least 7 States grant concealed carry permits to \nthose convicted of misdemeanor assault and battery. At least 12 do not \nrequire any firearms safety training before the issuance of a concealed \ncarry permit. Florida and Utah do not even require residency for a \nconcealed carry permit. Yet this amendment would force States such as \nNew Jersey to accept these permits even if the out-of-State concealed \ncarry permit owner would not be eligible to simply possess a gun under \nour laws, much less carry.\n  This amendment would turn our positive discussion on how to best \nprotect our children into another feather in the cap of the NRA and its \ngun manufacturers, another example for it to show how it has a \nstranglehold on this national discussion. And, in my view, this is just \nasking for more gun violence, not ending it. Not banning assault \nweapons is asking for more gun violence. Allowing larger clips with \nmore firepower does nothing to end the violence. It is not about \nhunting. If you need 100 rounds to hunt a deer, you are in sad shape.\n  Do we honestly think it makes sense to allow someone without a \nmandatory background check to buy an assault weapon that can fire up to \n13 rounds a second with something called a bump fire stock? Should we \nnot even be considering making weapons that can fire 13 rounds a second \nlegal on the streets of America?\n  Bang. That is one round fired. It took me 4 seconds to say those five \nwords. In those 4 seconds, if I had an assault weapon, I could have \ngotten 52 rounds--52 bullets--fired in the time it took me to say five \nwords. There is no need for that kind of firepower on the streets of \nAmerica. There is no need for the same weapons of that sort to be on \nthe streets of Newark, NJ, or Newtown, CT, as they are in Baghdad, \nKabul.\n  Any attempt that uses the Second Amendment as an excuse to allow that \ntype of firepower on the streets without some common sense applied to \nit is not solving a problem, it is creating one.\n  I will support efforts during this debate to go even further in \nkeeping mass slaughter weapons out of the hands of criminals. I do not \nbelieve assault weapons--some of them having names such as ``Street \nSweeper''--are about anything other than mass killing. I strongly \nbelieve in banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazine clips \nthat allow a deranged individual to kill dozens of people in a matter \nof seconds. There is simply no rationale for having these weapons on \nour streets--unless your intent is to inflict terror and destruction \nand mass casualties.\n  In a nation where there are already 310 million guns and far too few \nregulations as to who owns and carries them, I believe we have a \nresponsibility to take these assault weapons off the street. I \nunderstand that not everyone shares that view, but the one thing I \ncannot understand is how someone can argue against something as simple \nand as basic as requiring a background check before putting a deadly \nweapon in a person's hand.\n  We owe it to the American people. We owe it to the children of \nNewtown, to the families who are still trying to pick up the pieces \nfrom that tragic day. We owe it to the family of the 6-year-old boy \nfrom Toms River who was shot recently by a 4-year-old neighbor with a \n.22 caliber rifle that was in the house. He did not survive the wounds. \nWe owe it to every victim of gun violence to send a message that \nAmerica will no longer be the most armed Nation in the world without at \nleast having commonsense gun safety regulations.\n  Who among us would be content with the counsel of patience and delay \nwhen we lose a neighbor or lose a loved one to the type of violence we \ncould have prevented by a vote in the Senate today? It is time for some \nprofiles in courage, and I believe that in the men and women of the \nSenate there exists that opportunity and that moment for a profile in \ncourage to stand up for what is right. That is the opportunity that is \npresented to us today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that I be recorded as cosponsor \non the Grassley amendment No. 725.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I rise to speak on the issue the Senate \nis considering. It has been an interesting 3 or 4 weeks as we have \nconsidered and talked and thought about how we address what is best for \nour country and how we do that in a way that will protect the \nConstitution and protect individual rights and protect States rights. A \nlot of ideas have been thrown out, many of them with great infirmities \nin terms of either impacting Second Amendment rights, impacting 10th \nAmendment rights or the infirmity that they will not do anything to \nactually solve the problem.\n  I come from a State that is very pro-gun. I am very pro-gun. I own a \nmultitude of weapons. I know how to handle them, I know how to fire \nthem, and I know how to safely store them. The issue in front of us is, \nhow do we protect this Second Amendment right and the Supreme Court's \nrulings that have affirmed our individual right to self-defense and our \nindividual right to freedom? I believe I actually have an answer that \nthe Senate could coalesce around.\n\n[[Page S2718]]\n\n  As I talk to the most avid gun owners in Oklahoma, many of whom are \nopposing me trying to reach a compromise, the one question on which \nthey agree with me is this: What if you could know as a gun owner or \nwhoever you are--if you have a gun and you are going to sell it, what \nif you could know that you are not selling that gun to somebody on the \n``do not buy'' list?\n  We have all these words going on now. Background check--there is no \nbackground check with the NICS list. It is a check against people who \nare prohibited from buying. It is not a very good list, by the way, \nbecause the States have not complied, the courts have not complied with \npeople who have been convicted of felonies. We have a lot of problems \nin terms of a ``do not buy'' list.\n  We have to think of this list like the ``do not fly'' list that \nHomeland Security has. Nobody wants to get on an airplane with somebody \nwho is on that ``do not fly'' list because they are on that list for a \nvery good reason.\n  Most gun owners--as a matter of fact, I have not met one yet who \nwants to sell a gun to somebody who is on a ``do not buy'' list, which \nis called the NICS list. So how do we do that? How do we do that in \nsuch a way that we do not raise the cost, limit the freedom, or \notherwise impede a free activity that is available, guaranteed under \nour Constitution?\n  The other thing I have learned is that the easier laws are to comply \nwith, the more compliance you will get.\n  My proposal is very simple and straightforward. Let's create a way \nthat whoever is selling a gun in this country can know they are not \nselling it to a criminal, they are not selling it to somebody who is \nprohibited, which is an illegal alien, a child sex abuser, a felon--\nthose people. How do you know? And can we do that in a way that doesn't \ninhibit commerce, doesn't inhibit your rights as an individual under \nthe Second Amendment, doesn't inhibit the rights of a State under the \n10th Amendment? How do we do those things?\n  You know, it is not hard. With our rights come some responsibilities. \nWhat if I could tell you that you could take out your cell phone and go \nto a portal and you could get a certificate that says--on your cell \nphones or printed out on your printer--that you are not on the list, \nand with that would be a PIN number, so that whomever could be selling \nyou a gun would say, ``I am going to check your PIN number to see that \nthis is not bogus, now show me your ID,'' and you could actually \nconfirm whether somebody was on the list? That is how we control it. We \nmake it easy. We don't put up large hurdles.\n  I find myself caught between both extremes in this debate. I actually \nthink it is smart policy to make sure we put in place something \nallowing law-abiding citizens to do the right thing, to actually make a \ndifference. If we were to do that, a large percentage--not all of \nthem--of the transfers of weapons and guns to people who should not \nhave them would stop.\n  The emotion associated with all the violent events over the last 3 or \n4 years tends to cause us to lose sight of some pretty commonsense \nprinciples. We are not going to stop all gun violence in this country. \nPeople who are going to do illegal things are still going to do them. \nWe cannot stop it all, but we can do straightforward, simple things \nthat can make a big difference in lessening the availability of weapons \nto people who should not have them.\n  The other thing we can do is we can make it so that veterans do not \nautomatically lose their Second Amendment right because for a short \nperiod of time, due to their service, they were incapable of managing \ntheir financial affairs. That is the right thing to do. We can do this. \nThat is in this proposal.\n  But what I fear is going to happen is nothing. So what we are going \nto be offering when there is a time to allow other amendments is my \namendment No. 727, which does the following things:\n  It reauthorizes the ``no buy'' list at an appropriate level.\n  It creates reforms to the grant system so that States will comply \nwith reporting those people who are dangerous to themselves or somebody \nelse, so we incentivize States to do that.\n  We create a protection for the Second Amendment rights of veterans.\n  We require the courts to submit to the ``no buy'' list those who are \nconvicted of violent felonies. We require some transparency in State \nreporting so we can know whether a State is actually complying by \nreporting those who are a danger to themselves and other people, those \nwho are truly mentally infirm. That is because one of our big \nproblems--if you take Virginia Tech, the individual who committed that \ncrime was known by the State to be a danger to themselves or somebody \nelse. Yet they did not report it to the ``do not buy'' list. We \nincentivize that.\n  We allow for exceptions for people who are already authorized in \ntheir State to purchase guns, whether it is a concealed carry permit or \nwhether it is what the State may use to say: Here is your authorization \nto say you are not on it. In other words, we give States primacy \nprotecting the 10th Amendment. If they want to go further, they can, \nbut we also allow them to innovate, which is one of the things our \nforefathers wanted us to make sure we did when we did things in \nWashington.\n  We create a consumer portal that is easy. We also create penalties if \nyou misuse that portal for some other purpose.\n  We enforce a destruction of those records into that portal so that \nthe government cannot use that as a list to know who is purchasing \nguns. So we eliminate the concern over record-keeping and its assault \non the Second Amendment.\n  We also sunset this, so if it actually doesn't make a marked \nimprovement--which I think it will--in 5 years, it goes away and we do \nsomething different.\n  The other thing is we limit the ATF's ability to grossly violate the \nintent of previous laws in terms of demand letters on federally \nlicensed firearm dealers.\n  I daresay there is a difference in culture on guns in this country \ndepending on where in the country you are, but there is a place to be \nfound in the middle, in the Senate, for doing something that is common \nsense. What we are proposing is something that is simple, it doesn't \ncost any money to speak of, it is easily accessible, it is verifiable \non both ends of the commercial transaction, it does nothing to \neliminate the Second Amendment provisions in the Constitution or take \naway 10th Amendment rights of States, and it will actually decrease \ntransfers of weapons to those who are on the ``do not buy'' list. Is it \na comprehensive plan? No. Will it solve the problem? Yes. Will it work? \nYes.\n  Some of the criticisms we heard--if there is no record, how do you \nknow they did it? If 90 percent of the people in this country--which is \nwhat the media are all quoting--want us to do that, 90 percent of us \nthink there ought to be an enhancement to the ``no buy'' list in terms \nof utilizing it, that same 90 percent of the people are the gun owners \nin America. So if 90 percent is the number, then you are going to have \nat least 90 percent compliance with this very simple, straightforward \nway that you can know you are complying with the law.\n  The other area that is confusing is that people want--and why they \nwant--a record of a gun. It is for the investigation of a crime. Well, \nguess what. The best way to not ever have that crime is to have an \neffective check on the ``do not buy'' list. It will not eliminate all \ncrime, but they say the infirmity with ours is that the weapon cannot \nbe traced. That is right, it cannot be traced. The vast majority of \nused weapons are not sold through gun dealers or at gun shows. They are \nsold by average, everyday Americans to somebody else.\n\n  If we don't want the straw purchasers, felons, or illegal citizens \nbuying them, then what we ought to do is set up something that 90 \npercent of Americans are going to comply with. It is not hard to do. It \nis easy to do the right thing. It doesn't please the gun control \ngroups, and it doesn't please the hard Second Amendment rights groups.\n  If we think about it and actually make it easy for people to know \nthat they could not sell a gun to somebody on the ``do not buy'' list, \nAmerica would comply, and we would actually see a positive outcome of \nthis debate.\n  I am amazed at the misinformation people have about guns when they\n\n[[Page S2719]]\n\ncome to the Senate floor and talk about them when they have never fired \nsome of those weapons, have never held them in their hands, and do not \nknow what they are designed for.\n  I plan to come back tomorrow when I will bring up this amendment for \nconsideration.\n  Our Founders had a Bill of Rights, and we have a Constitution. It was \nreally designed for moral and good people. In that bill, as affirmed by \nthe Supreme Court, was a Second Amendment right, and that is not going \naway. That right is not going to go away. Even if we were to take it \naway, the Supreme Court would probably bring it back.\n  We really ought to be leading and talking about what the real \nproblems are in our country. What are our real problems? One of the \nreal problems is that we are not a moral and great people anymore \ncompared to what we were when our Founding Fathers drafted those \ndocuments. We are in some moral decline, and that is because of an \nabsence of real leadership at a lot of levels and in a lot of areas in \nour country. We ought to recognize that we cannot legislate away the \nevilness about us. We cannot fix it all with a law. We fix it in the \nway we live our lives and the way we treat one another and how we reach \nout to give our lives for another person every day.\n  One of the crucial things is that we have become self-focused as \nAmericans rather than Nation focused, and that is why we have seen this \nmoral decline come upon us.\n  What I think our country is looking for is real leadership on the \nprinciples which matter, that change people's minds about what they do \nand how they do it. We are getting into a much larger debate than guns. \nEvil is out there. That criminal element is out there. That mental \nillness is out there. We are not going to address all of that with a \nfew laws on guns. We are going to address that by character-based, \nmorally led, morally affirmed leadership at all levels throughout our \ncountry.\n  As a physician, I am trained to fix the real disease, not treat the \nsymptoms. This debate is about symptoms. It is an important debate. \nThere are things we can do, but the real disease is our moral decline \nas a country.\n  The historians talk about it. John Taylor, the Scottish historian, \ntalked about it. It is about the decline of all republics and what \nhappens to them. America is built for a good, moral people. We have to \nhave the leadership that calls us back to that.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 720\n\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to call up my \namendment numbered 720.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Burr] for himself, Mr. \n     Wicker, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Risch, Mr. Cochran, Mr. \n     Moran, Mr. Thune, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Enzi, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 720.\n\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I ask that the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To protect the Second Amendment rights of veterans and their \n                               families)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title I, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 114. CONDITIONS FOR TREATMENT OF CERTAIN PERSONS AS \n                   ADJUDICATED MENTALLY INCOMPETENT FOR CERTAIN \n                   PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 55 of title 38, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     section:\n\n     ``Sec. 5511.

Conditions for treatment of certain persons as adjudicated \n              mentally incompetent for certain purposes.''.\n\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I rise today in the middle of an important \ndebate on gun control to talk about an issue that should have been at \nthe forefront for years, and it deals with our Nation's veterans.\n  I am specifically talking about 129,000 of our Nation's war heroes. \nDue to a determination within the Veterans' Administration, these war \nheroes have been deprived of their Second Amendment rights to own \nfirearms.\n  This is apparently a much tougher issue to understand than I thought \nbecause it makes common sense to me that we should hold all individuals \nto the same threshold before we take their constitutional rights away. \nIf a person is a Social Security beneficiary and Social Security makes \na determination that person has a hard time handling their finances, \nSocial Security will assign a person to him or her who will help them \nto navigate the financial challenges that a senior runs into. They \ndon't just send somebody to do that and then turn around and put their \nname on the NICS list, which is the instant background check that \nautomatically deprives a person of their Second Amendment right.\n  The IRS doesn't equate the fact that because someone cannot handle \ntheir finances that they are mentally incapable or that they are a harm \nto themselves.\n  What we have is a Veterans' Administration that when they find the \nveteran needs help with their financial affairs, the VA sends their \nname to the FBI, and they go on a NICS list. All of a sudden that takes \naway their Second Amendment right to own a gun.\n  It says anybody who lives in that house--so it could be a spouse, a \nchild, including an adult child--cannot own a firearm because the \nruling says there cannot be a firearm in the residence. Clearly, after \nan appropriate determination, if a veteran, or any other American, is \nfound to be a harm to themselves or has a mental disability, we would \nall agree that person should be disqualified from gun ownership.\n  Let me say for the purposes of my colleagues--and for the American \npeople--this is not the standard we currently apply at the Veterans' \nAdministration. We look at a veteran who served his country and we say: \nYou cannot balance your checkbook, so we are going to assign a \nfiduciary to you to balance your checkbook. That person cannot own a \nfirearm. Think about that. The fiduciary may be the spouse, and \nsuddenly that name goes to the NICS list. Why? Because within the VA an \nexaminer has determined that an individual could not handle their own \nfinances.\n  The examiner is not a medical professional. I am talking about \nsomebody who made a determination as to whether this veteran could \nhandle the deposits of their VA checks and line up the payments which \nthey need to make. If it has been determined they could not do that on \ntheir own, that would therefore automatically trigger that veteran's \nname. That name would be sent to the FBI and they would then be \ndeprived of their Second Amendment rights in this country.\n  Let me suggest that the current process is arbitrary. It doesn't look \nat whether they represent a danger to themselves or to others. It is in \nno way relevant to whether the individual should have access to \nfirearms. To the credit of those who have brought amendments to the \nfloor for the gun bill, they have tried to address this issue.\n  I commend Senator Manchin, Senator Toomey, and Senator Kirk--who has \nbeen passionate about this--but what they have tried to do is say: We \nhave to get an appeals process that is streamlined and easier.\n  What I am saying to my colleagues is, these are people who should \nhave never had their Second Amendment right taken away. They should not \nbe on the NICS list. There has been no judicial determination of mental \nincompetence and no judicial determination\n\n[[Page S2720]]\n\nthat they are a threat to themselves or to others. There has been no \nmedical determination of a mental disability that would cause them to \nbe a threat to themselves or anybody else. We have simply made a \nfinancial decision that they were not capable of handling their own \nfinances.\n  What I disagree with is that I don't want the Senate to focus on what \nshould be the appropriate appeals process. What my legislation, \namendment No. 720, does is get to the heart of it. It says what we are \ngoing to do is require the VA to go through a different process to make \na determination before taking their Second Amendment right away.\n  Some will say the VA has an appellate process. We have 129,000 \nveterans today who currently have had their Second Amendment right \ntaken away. Only 200 of those veterans have sought relief. Only 200 out \nof 129,000 veterans have sought relief. Here is the shocker: In less \nthan a dozen cases the appeal has been reversed. The determination has \nbeen reversed in less than a dozen cases.\n  Why would only 200 people appeal this decision which was arbitrarily \nmade by the Veterans' Administration? Well, the VA doesn't provide any \nhelp. As a matter of fact, the veteran is on his or her own. Even the \ncost for the appeal is absorbed by the veteran.\n  We have made it as difficult as we possibly can to deprive veterans \nof their Second Amendment, and then to say we are going to make it even \nharder for you by making it harder for us to reverse this because now \nveterans will be required to have financial skin in the game. Well, out \nof the 128,000 who haven't applied, having looked at only a half dozen \nbeing appealed, where is the incentive to invest money? A person might \nas well throw it down a rathole.\n  So what I am suggesting to my colleagues is that the standard \nshouldn't be, Can you take care of your finances; the standard should \nbe and ought to be, Are you a harm to yourself or to others--a \ndetermination that everywhere else in society is made by the bench, by \na judicial review.\n  My good friends who offered an amendment to fix the appellate process \nsuggested we should internally, within the VA, set up this appeals \nprocess whereby we overcome some of the hurdles of the costs and \nwhether a veteran has aid. Let me say to my colleagues: Are we \nconfident we can set up a real appeals process within an agency that is \nso blind they put 129,000 people on the NICS list and deprived them of \ntheir Second Amendment right? Can we take the individuals who made this \ninterpretation and believe they can go through a fair appellate review \nof an applicant's request to be taken off the list? I personally don't \nbelieve that can happen. For that reason I am offering an amendment to \nthis bill to change the standard--not to eliminate whether a veteran is \nlisted as a harm to themselves or others, and that, in itself, would \ntake away one's Second Amendment ability to own a gun, but it is to say \napply the same standard to veterans we apply to every other American.\n  Imagine what would happen if every Social Security beneficiary who \ngot assigned somebody to help with their finances lost their Second \nAmendment right to have a gun. We would kill ourselves, 100 Members of \nthe Senate, trying to get to the Senate floor to change the law because \nthe pressure would be so great. The numbers may not be as big as we \nmight see out of Social Security, but that is the entire population.\n  I suggest to my colleagues I can't think of a population in America \nthat deserves their Second Amendment right protected more than those \nwho laid their life on the line to protect this Republic we have.\n  In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to support amendment No. 720. I \nam not sure what the disposition of this piece of legislation will end \nup being, but I am convinced that with the addition of amendment No. \n720--a vote in favor of this amendment makes whatever this bill looks \nlike at the end of the day a better bill, one that fairly represents \nour Nation's veterans, and I think continues our commitment to people \nwho have made the ultimate sacrifice to their country.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, they say when a person outlives their \nchild, it is unnatural; it violates the laws of nature, and a person is \nnever ever the same. We all wish we never have to experience that \nphenomenon.\n  But on Friday, December 14, 20 sets of moms and dads sent their first \ngraders off to school at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, CT, \nexpecting, as every parent does, to see them come home on Friday and \nthen go out and spend a wonderful weekend with their kids. It was going \nto be a great weekend because it was the Christmas season. As a parent \nof a little boy who is a little bit younger than the first graders who \nwent into that classroom that day, I know how amazing the Christmas \nseason can be with a little one. Whether they were going to be picking \nout their Christmas tree or putting up outdoor lights or visiting Santa \nClaus, it was going to be the kind of weekend parents live for.\n  Those parents sent their kids off to school that morning and a few \nhours later, one shockwave of violence later, 40 parents had outlived \ntheir children.\n  I have been so angry for months. I have been angry at Adam Lanza. I \nhave been angry at his mother for giving him access to those guns. I \nhave been angry at this place for 20 years of inaction. But, mostly, I \nhave been angry at the people in this Chamber and outside of this \nChamber who say what we are discussing here right now this week \nwouldn't have changed what happened in Newtown. I am angry for this \nfirst simple reason: They are wrong. Guns have become so much more \npowerful in this Nation over the past several decades--so powerful that \nthe assault weapon, the military-style assault weapon that was brought \ninto that school that day, was fired at 20 children and every single \none of the kids who was hit died. None of them survived because of the \npower of that weapon. It got off over 150 bullets in a time period that \nwas perhaps only 5 minutes long, from a weapon that could discharge 6 \nbullets a second. If there had been a weapon of lesser power in that \nschool that day, there might be kids still alive.\n  Second, the shooter, to get 150 rounds off, only had to switch \nmagazines 6 times. During at least one of those exchanges, a bunch of \nkids ran out of the room, and they are alive today. If we had a \nlimitation on magazines that was closer to 10 rounds, Adam Lanza would \nhave had to have changed clips 15 times, providing another 9 \nopportunities for some subset of those 20 kids to run out and rejoin \ntheir parents for the weekend.\n  In addition to passing laws that would have changed the reality in \nSandy Hook, we have an obligation to make sure it doesn't happen again, \nand we have an obligation to do something about the routine, everyday \ngun violence plaguing this Nation. Twenty-eight people died in Newtown \nthat day, including 26 at the school, the shooter, and his mother. But \nevery single day the average is higher. Thirty people on average are \ndying across this country from gun violence. From a statistical point \nof view, December 14 was just an average day.\n  So what do we do? The amendments we are debating here today offered \nby my Democratic colleagues are a good step in the right direction. I \nsuggest there are three rules that should guide our actions. Frankly, I \nthink these are pretty simple rules that the vast majority of the \nAmerican public in every single State we represent here would agree \nwith.\n  First, I believe people should be able to own guns, to protect \nthemselves, to shoot for sport, to hunt, but the criminals shouldn't be \nable to own guns. If someone opposes the Manchin-Toomey amendment, they \ncannot say with a straight face they oppose criminals getting guns. If \na Member votes against Manchin-Toomey, they are basically saying they \nare OK with more criminals having guns.\n  Ninety percent of Americans want us to make this commonsense change. \nNinety percent of Americans want us to crack down on the number of \ncriminals who have weapons out there, because they know almost 40 \npercent of gun sales in this country are done without a background \ncheck.\n  For a while, I could only explain opposition to near universal \nbackground checks through the power of the gun\n\n[[Page S2721]]\n\nlobby, because I thought people must know in their heart that a simple, \neasy thing to do is to make sure criminals don't own guns, so there \nmust be some external pressure that is forcing people to do the wrong \nthing. The longer I have spent in this place, the more I am convinced \nthere are people who actually believe we should go back to the days of \nthe wild, wild west; that we should usher in a new era of gun control \nDarwinism, in which the good guys have guns and the bad guys have guns \nand we hope the good guys shoot the bad guys. The gun lobby frankly \ntells us this. We should probably listen to them. They say the only way \nto stop a bad guy with a gun is to give a good guy a gun, that the \ngovernment should get out of the way.\n  The second rule is this: Some guns are too dangerous to have on the \nstreets. We have always accepted this premise. We have always said \nthere are certain weapons that should be in the hands of law \nenforcement and the military only. Guns have changed over the years. \nGuns that used to be in the hands of the military now are available to \nthe public and Adam Lanza had one of those weapons when he walked into \nthat school. These are military weapons. These aren't weapons one needs \nto defend one's home. These are not weapons we need to go out and shoot \nat targets or hunt in our forests. These are weapons designed to kill \nas many people as quickly as possible, and they are finding their way \ninto our schools and our movie theaters and our places of worship. Some \nguns are too dangerous to have on the street.\n  Third, some ammunition too easily allows for mass murder. The young \nman who walked into the movie theater in Aurora had a weapon and \nattached to it was a 100-round drum. Who on Earth needs a 100-round \ndrum of ammunition to protect themselves, to go out and shoot for \nsport? Nobody does. It should be illegal. Thirty rounds is too much as \nwell. Thirty-round clips, one-hundred-round drums, too easily lead to \nmass murder and it is being seen in this country over and over and \nover.\n\n  We can take a step forward to realizing those three basic principles \ntoday on the floor of the Senate. We can vote for the Manchin-Toomey \namendment supported by 90 percent of the American public which will \nmake sure less criminals have guns, something that everybody out \nthere--except for a subset of people in this Chamber--agrees on. We can \nmake the decision to take these dangerous assault weapons off the \nstreets, allowing for thousands of weapons to still be legally \npurchasable, but to say the most dangerous ones should stay in the \nhands of the military and law enforcement, and we can say enough is \nenough when it comes to these high-capacity clips.\n  We know the shooting stopped in Aurora and Tucson when they exchanged \nmagazines. We know kids escaped in Newtown when the shooter exchanged \nclips. Less bullets per magazine means more people survive these mass \nshootings. We can do that today as well.\n  When we vote today, I would suggest that of all of the victims we can \nthink about--and I have been coming down to the floor for the last 2 \nweeks talking about victims; I probably told the story of 50 or 60 or \n70 victims on the floor of this Senate--that we think of two \nspecifically. I would end today by talking first about a woman from \nChicago named Shirley Chambers. Shirley raised her four kids, three \nboys and one girl, in the infamous Cabrini-Green housing complex in \nChicago. That is where ``Good Times'' supposedly took place. It was a \ntough life, but she remembers her kids riding tricycles throughout the \nneighborhood and she said they were all happy kids.\n  On January 26 of this year, seven people were killed from gun \nviolence--seven people in 1 day were killed from gun violence in \nChicago. One of them was her son Ronnie Chambers. His mother buried him \nsoon after his death. Ronnie was one of the 3,300 people who had been \nkilled by gun violence in our cities and in our suburbs since December \n14 of last year. She had four kids, but after Ronnie died Shirley was \nchildless, because all four of her children had been killed by guns on \nthe streets of Chicago: Carlos, Jerome, LaToya, and now Ronnie, all \ngone. She said, ``My life will never ever be the same again.'' Isn't \nthat the understatement of the decade.\n  Lastly, I want my colleagues to think of Mark and Jackie Barden. I \nhave talked a lot about little Daniel on the floor of the Senate, so I \nwill end my remarks in this debate with him. Mark and Jackie lost \nDaniel that morning. These parents from Newtown have been so generous. \nThey have visited our offices. They have allowed myself and Senator \nBlumenthal to come to this floor and to tell the story of who their \nkids were and who their kids would have been. Mark and Jackie said this \nof Daniel after he died:\n\n       Everyone who has ever met Daniel remembers and loves him. \n     Words cannot express what a special boy Daniel was. Such a \n     light. Always smiling, unfailingly polite, incredibly \n     affectionate, fair, and so thoughtful towards others, \n     imaginative in play, both intelligent and articulate in \n     conversation; in all, a constant source of laughter and joy. \n     Daniel was fearless in his pursuit of happiness and life. He \n     earned his ripped jeans and his missing two front teeth. \n     Despite that, his mother said, he was just so good. He \n     embodied everything that is wholesome and innocent in the \n     world.\n  Every morning, the Bardens' kids would leave for school in \nsuccession. They all went to different schools. Daniel was the \nyoungest, so he left the latest. Like most kids, he never got out of \nbed until he absolutely had to. So every morning, his older brother, \nwhom he adored, left for school before Daniel had gotten up. But not on \nDecember 14. Every single morning that school year, Daniel had slept in \nas his brother went off to school. But on Friday morning, something \ndifferent happened. Daniel got up early, and as his brother was walking \ndown the driveway to the bus, for the first time that entire school \nyear, Daniel ran after him in his pajamas and flip-flops, and he hugged \nhis older brother, and he said goodbye.\n  Losing a child is unnatural, but what should be just as unnatural is \na Senator's unwillingness to do something to change that reality. \nOccasionally, in truly exceptional moments, we hold the power here that \nis so big and so bold to change the reality of life and death. We \ncannot amend what happened to the Bardens. Their loss will sear \nforever. We cannot change the fact that Shirley Chambers lost her four \nchildren. She will bear that loss for the rest of her life. But we can \nreduce the likelihood that more kids will die of gun violence in \nChicago. We can reduce the chances that another Sandy Hook will happen. \nThese parents cannot understand the casual willingness of this body to \nturn our backs on a chance to make sure that kind of loss does not \nhappen to more parents. To them, that would be truly unnatural.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 725\n\n(Purpose: To address gun violence, improve the availability of records \n   to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, address \nmental illness in the criminal justice system, and end straw purchases \n      and trafficking of illegal firearms, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask consent to set aside the pending \namendment and call up my amendment and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley] for himself, Mr. Cruz, \n     Mr. Graham, Mr. Thune, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Hoeven, Mr. Hatch, Mr. \n     Flake, Mr. Coats, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Wicker, Mr. \n     Johnson of Wisconsin, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Risch, Mr. Rubio, Ms. \n     Murkowski, Mr. Boozman, Mr. Johanns, Mr. Portman, Mr. \n     McConnell, Mr. Blunt, Mr. Vitter, and Mr. Coburn, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 725.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, the Senate will vote today on an \namendment that I am offering for myself, Senator Cruz, Senator Graham, \nand many others, as a substitute.\n  I believe that the underlying bill infringes on the Second Amendment \nrights of law-abiding gun owners and it does not provide for adequate \nmeasures against criminals who commit gun violence.\n\n[[Page S2722]]\n\n  My approach is much better than the Manchin-Toomey amendment.\n  The current background check database, called NICS, is broken. Not \nenough accurate information on prohibited persons is making its way \ninto the database. This is particularly true for mental health records.\n  Checking firearms purchasers against an incomplete database will not \nbe effective in stopping prohibited persons from gaining access to \nguns.\n  Additionally, we should not further strain the existing, broken \nsystem by expanding the use of an incomplete database to more \ntransactions, as Manchin-Toomey would. We should fix the existing \nsystem. And that is what my amendment does.\n  First, we should reauthorize NICS. So the Grassley-Cruz amendment \nreauthorizes NICS Improvement Act grants to States for providing mental \nhealth records.\n  The amendment codifies one of President Obama's Executive orders that \nrequires the Attorney General to issue guidance to federal agencies \nabout which records they must submit to NICS.\n  It improves NICS as well by clarifying the definition of \n``adjudicated mentally incompetent,'' so that it includes only actual \nadjudications, not a single psychiatrist's diagnosis.\n  Manchin-Toomey does not.\n  Mental health records would also be improved by requiring the Federal \ncourts to make available to NICS information concerning such situations \nas defendants who plead guilty to a crime by reason of insanity.\n  This approach is consistent with what Washington Post columnist \nCourtland Milloy writes today. He says:\n\n       [T]he national gun-control legislation set for debate in \n     Congress would rely on a bureaucratic dragnet of ``background \n     checks'' so extensive that anybody's hands could end up being \n     the wrong ones. Including mine.\n\n  He thinks that gun control supporters are ``bent on harassing [him] \ninto giving'' up his gun.\n  He also offers a prescription for the actual problems:\n\n       Go after the criminal. Take his illegal gun. Leave \n     everybody else alone.\n\n  My amendment reflects that view. It enhances criminal prosecutions of \nthose who use guns.\n  The real way to fight gun crime is to pursue criminals, not law-\nabiding citizens.\n  Under my amendment, Federal gun crime prosecutions are to be \nincreased. This will happen because the very successful Project Exile \nwill be expanded nationally. This initiative requires Federal and State \nofficials to develop agreements on enforcing gun laws. It requires the \nU.S. Attorney to designate at least one assistant to prosecute firearms \ncases. Project Exile will be expanded to 18 jurisdictions, including \nthree tribal jurisdictions, with high violent crime rates.\n  The Grassley-Cruz amendment authorizes $15 million per year for \nProject Exile, which will cover more Federal prosecutors and ATF \nagents.\n  Manchin-Toomey does not.\n  The amendment also establishes a task force for prosecuting felons \nand fugitives who fail NICS background checks.\n  Right now, thousands of people who are prohibited from owning guns \nfail background checks. Yet, the Justice Department prosecutes less \nthan 1 percent of them. More of these criminals need to be prosecuted.\n  Manchin-Toomey does not address the issue.\n  The amendment also increases the maximum sentence from 5 years to 10 \nfor those who lie and buy on the form that needs to be filled out when \npurchasing a gun from a licensed dealer.\n  We also need to think hard before the Justice Department asks gun \ndealers to sell guns to felons and then doesn't track them. That is why \nOperation Fast and Furious was such a disaster. It led to the death of \na brave Border Patrol agent, Brian Terry.\n  To avoid such an ill-considered operation in the future, the \namendment requires the Attorney General, the Deputy, or the head of the \nCriminal Division to personally approve any programs for selling guns \nto criminals.\n  The Leahy amendment's similar provision would allow the Director of \nATF to make this determination. But the ATF Director did not object \nduring Fast and Furious. So that defeats the whole point of requiring \nhigh-level approval.\n  Oversight work on Fast and Furious showed the need for Federal \nstatutes against straw purchasing and gun trafficking. The amendment \ncontains such offenses, but in a more targeted way than does the Leahy \namendment.\n  And now that there is a trafficking offense, the amendment strikes \nATF's unnecessary ability to issue demand letters collecting \ninformation on purchasers of certain rifles along the southwest border.\n  The way to target gun violence is to direct efforts against \ncriminals, not law-abiding citizens. So the amendment increases the \nmaximum penalty from 10 to 15 years for transferring a firearm to a \nprohibited user, as well as the penalty for illegally possessing a \nfirearm.\n  It creates a 15-year maximum sentence for transferring a firearm to \nsomeone knowing that it will be used for a crime of violence, drug \ntrafficking crime, foreign narcotics kingpin crime, or terrorism.\n  Contrary to what the majority would have the American people believe, \nmass shootings are not only about guns and mental illness. They are \nalso about what has happened to us as a society.\n  So the amendment authorizes a study by the National Institute of \nJustice and National Academy of Sciences on the causes of mass \nshootings.\n  There are other proposals on that subject before us. But they are \ncareful not to look at the entire problem. I don't want to single out \nany possible cause. But I also don't want to exempt any potential \ncause.\n  So some of the mass shooters, for instance, watched and used \ndisturbing video games. The possible influence of violent video games \nshould be part of what is examined.\n  The amendment also expands the rights of law-abiding gun owners.\n  It allows interstate firearms sales by permitting out-of-State \ndealers to sell in a State if they comply with all State laws in which \nthey are selling.\n  It permits members of the armed services to buy a gun in their State \nof residence or where they are stationed.\n  The amendment allows firearms dealers to access NICS to run \nbackground checks on their prospective employees. But unlike Manchin-\nToomey, the amendment requires that the rights of the prospective \nemployee be respected. The employee would have to be provided notice \nand have to give their consent before such a check could be run.\n  Also unlike Manchin-Toomey, the amendment would expand the rights of \nlawful gun owners to travel through other States without fear of \nprosecution. Manchin-Toomey, whatever its intent, would make it more \nlikely that law-abiding gun owners would be arrested and prosecuted as \nthey traveled through other States.\n  Title II of the amendment addresses mental health.\n  It reauthorizes the bipartisan Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and \nCrime Reduction Act.\n  These funds are used for mental health courts, crisis intervention \nteams, veteran treatment courts, police academy efforts, and prison \nservices.\n  The amendment allows Byrne grants to be used for mental health \nprograms and operations by law enforcement or corrections.\n  It allows COPS grants to be used for training law enforcement to deal \nwith mental illness.\n  To restore the gun owning rights of our veterans, a judicial \ndetermination would be necessary to determine that a person is a danger \nto himself or others to be considered to have been adjudicated mentally \ndefective.\n  Title III is focused on school safety.\n  It reauthorizes the Secure our School grants at the prior funding \nlevel of $30 million per year for 10 years.\n  To safeguard taxpayer money, it would require that different offices \nthat award grants at the Justice Department consult with each other \nbefore these grants are awarded.\n  We want to help as many different schools as possible.\n  Finally, we should understand that Manchin-Toomey would not have \nstopped Newtown.\n  People who steal guns do not submit to background checks.\n  We heard testimony in the Judiciary Committee that background checks \nwill be effective only if they are universal and accompanied by gun \nregistration.\n\n[[Page S2723]]\n\n  We should not start down the path to gun registration, as history \nshows where that leads.\n  Manchin-Toomey creates, not closes, loopholes by requiring background \nchecks for some private sales but not others.\n  We have heard from gun control groups that were it to pass, they \nwould immediately seek to expand background checks even further.\n  This would be a running start on a slippery slope.\n  The way Manchin-Toomey works, if someone takes out an ad for a gun in \ntheir church bulletin or farm bureau newsletter, they would have to \nproceed with a background check.\n  Manchin-Toomey's exception for family member transfers provides cold \ncomfort.\n  If the family member transfers the gun to another family member he \ndoes not know, but is found later that he had reasonable cause to \nbelieve is prohibited, they could face 5 years in jail.\n  Even worse, for the first time, a violation of Federal law would be \nbased on a violation of State or local law.\n  A family member may not know the firearms laws in the place where the \nother family member resides.\n  Those laws are published.\n  Ignorance of the law is no excuse.\n  A person would have reasonable cause to believe that a family member \nwas in violation of them even if the person did not actually know those \nState or local laws.\n  If they transferred the gun to a family member, and they did not know \nthe permitting rules in another state, under Manchin-Toomey, that \nfamily member could face up to 5 years in jail.\n  That is unacceptable.\n  We cannot have the fate of law-abiding citizens turn on assurances of \nprosecutorial discretion.\n  Finally, my amendment, and not Manchin-Toomey, protects the rights of \nlaw-abiding gun owners to travel through other States if their guns are \nunloaded and ammunition is secured.\n  Manchin-Toomey seems to do this but it does not.\n  It cuts back on existing protections.\n  It provides that the criminal immunity does not apply if the \ntransportation does not violate any gun felony.\n  But some State laws say that not having a State permit for a gun is a \nfelony.\n  So a law-abiding gun owner who did not have a permit would commit a \nState felony.\n  Under Manchin-Toomey, they could be arrested and prosecuted.\n  Other States that make gun transportation crimes misdemeanors could \nchange those to felonies and eliminate the force of the Gun Owners \nProtection Act.\n  My amendment contains commonsense measures to fight gun violence in \nour communities and protect the 2nd Amendment rights of law-abiding gun \nowners.\n  This is the better way to go.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, today the Senate is scheduled to vote on \nan amendment proposed as a partisan Republican alternative to the \nbipartisan legislation that was reported by the Judiciary Committee and \nthat has been the business before the Senate for the last 2 weeks. The \ncommittee held three hearings and four markups starting in January and \nconcluding in the middle of March. Republican members of the Committee \nparticipated but did not offer this substitute at any juncture. When \nMajority Leader Reid introduced the Safe Communities, Safe Schools bill \non March 21 and then was forced to end a filibuster to proceed to it \nlast week, the sponsors of this measure were among those filibustering. \nThey justified their filibuster on the fiction that the bill before the \nSenate somehow violated the Second Amendment. Of course it does not. If \nfurther proof were needed, the fact that they have now reversed \nthemselves to offer a substitute that steals large portions of the \nbipartisan underlying bill provisions would be it.\n  The amendment the Senate is now being forced to vote on contains 81 \npages of legislative text, and was filed just this morning, so I am not \neven sure of the amendment number. This last-minute alternative is \napparently being offered so that Republicans who fear crossing the \nWashington gun lobby can go home and say that they voted for something. \nI invited all members of the Judiciary Committee to work with us and to \nbring forward their best ideas to reduce gun violence in our society \nand to have them be fully heard in the Judiciary Committee, in regular \norder. When Senator Grassley and others came forward, we worked with \nthem to incorporate changes in the Leahy-Collins gun trafficking bill \nand the Boxer school safety bill to accommodate them. This is our \nreward. No good deed goes unpunished apparently. I am disappointed that \nafter the tremendous effort so many Senators on the Judiciary Committee \nmade to carefully consider and debate legislation, to reach across the \naisle to build consensus, and to work with a seriousness of purpose \nthat would honor the victims of Newtown, Connecticut and all of those \nwhose lives have been affected by gun violence, that this is their \nresponse.\n  The Republican amendment was never proposed during the months of \nJudiciary Committee consideration. It has not been the subject of \nhearings. No Senator who supports this effort will have any standing to \ndemand regular order on any other matter, least of all on consideration \nof comprehensive immigration reform legislation that will next be \nconsidered by the Judiciary Committee.\n  I oppose the Republican alternative and encourage other Senators who \nare serious about making progress in the effort to reduce gun violence \nto do the same. This amendment is not a serious effort to fulfill the \nextraordinarily important obligation we took on as Senators after the \ntragedy in Connecticut.\n  The Senators from Connecticut have spoken eloquently over hours and \ndays on the Senate floor. Senators Kaine and Warner from Virginia gave \nmoving remarks on the anniversary of the tragedy at Virginia Tech. They \nhave helped to celebrate the memory of those who lost their lives in \nConnecticut, in Virginia, and in other terrible events. They have \ncarried to the Senate the voices of millions of Americans who are \ndemanding that we take meaningful action. I commend them for their \nwork. There are measures on which we will vote today that will carry \nout our responsibility. The alternative that Republicans put forward \nfor a cover vote is, in my view, not one of them.\n  I am especially disappointed that after working so closely with the \nRanking Member on the legislation to combat straw purchasing and \nfirearms trafficking that Senator Collins, Senator Gillibrand, Senator \nKirk and I introduced, and after earning his support on that measure in \nthe Judiciary Committee, that his amendment contains a proposal that \nwill take us backward, not forward, when it comes to dealing with these \nserious problems. Anyone serious about the problems on the Southwest \nborder involving straw purchasing and gun trafficking should be \ndetermined to give law enforcement the tools they desperately need. The \nLeahy-Collins bill does that. The watered-down version shoehorned into \nthis Republican alternative does not.\n  The legislation that Senator Collins and I introduced was drafted \nwith input from law enforcement. It provides the tools law enforcement \nneeds to combat straw purchasing and gun trafficking, and it has the \nsupport of numerous major law enforcement organizations. We did not \njust work with law enforcement, however. We consulted with other \nSenators from both sides of the aisle, including Senator Grassley, and \nincorporated their suggestions. We even worked with the National Rifle \nAssociation to address all of its substantive concerns.\n  In contrast, the junior Senator from Texas, a self-proclaimed leader \nof the filibuster against considering any gun violence legislation, \nintroduced his watered-down version of our bill on straw purchasing and \ngun trafficking just this week. He did not offer amendments when the \nJudiciary Committee, a Committee on which he is a member, met to \nconsider and report the Leahy-Collins-Gillibrand bill. His bill takes \nthe serious proposal Senator Collins, Senator Gillibrand and I \ndeveloped and strips out almost all of the important tools that law \nenforcement requested and needs. As far as I can tell, his bill has not \nbeen endorsed by any law enforcement groups. Ours is endorsed by the \nNational Fraternal Order of Police, the Federal Law Enforcement \nOfficers Association, the FBI Agents Association, the National District \nAttorney's Association, and all nine of the members of the National\n\n[[Page S2724]]\n\nLaw Enforcement Partnership to Prevent Gun Violence, including the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police, the Major Cities Chiefs \nAssociation, the Police Executive Research Forum, and others.\n  There is no wonder as to why. The trafficking provisions suggested by \nthe Republican alternative essentially give straw purchasers a road map \nto avoid prosecution. As long as straw purchasers ask no questions and \nbury their heads in the sand, they cannot be held accountable. The \nRepublican substitute requires prosecutors to prove beyond a reasonable \ndoubt that a straw purchaser knew for certain that he was buying for a \nprohibited person. A straw purchaser could have every suspicion in the \nworld that the actual buyer is a dangerous criminal, but as long as he \ndeliberately shields himself from getting confirmation of that fact, he \nis untouchable. Willful ignorance will be their shield.\n  The substitute also gives gun traffickers the same road map. The bill \nSenator Collins and I have proposed prohibits an individual from buying \na gun and giving it to someone you know will then give it to a \ncriminal. The Republican proposal inexplicably removes this provision. \nSo as long as the organizer of a firearms trafficking ring uses a \nmiddle-man between the straw purchaser and the ultimate recipient, it \nis simple to avoid prosecution for providing guns to dangerous \ncriminals.\n  The proposal from the junior Senator from Texas also takes out the \nprovision in the Leahy-Collins bill that allows law enforcement to use \nwire taps to investigate straw purchasers and gun traffickers. And it \nalso takes away the ability to prosecute gun traffickers for money \nlaundering and racketeering and to seize their ill-gotten proceeds. How \ndoes this make us safer? What is the rationale for weakening these law \nenforcement tools?\n  Not content to undermine the straw purchasing and gun trafficking \nmeasures Senator Collins and I have proposed, the Republican substitute \naids the Mexican drug cartels by eliminating an existing tool that the \nJustice Department needs to combat violence on the Southwest border. \nThe ability of cartels to purchase firearms in the Southwest has led to \nterrible violence. In order to investigate and stem the flow of \ndangerous weapons to the cartels, the Justice Department requires \nlicensed gun dealers in that area to report sales of multiple long guns \nsuch as assault rifles to the ATF. This practice has provided law \nenforcement with major investigative leads, yet the Republican proposal \nprohibits it.\n  The Republican substitute also interferes with state prosecutions of \ngun crimes. Under existing law, a person who is traveling through a \nstate with a gun he is not allowed to possess in that state can assert \nas a defense that he was merely traveling between two states in which \nhis possession would be legal. This is fair. But the Republican \nproposal takes this defense and places the burden on the state \nprosecutor to disprove the defendant's claim beyond a reasonable doubt \nin all cases, even if the defendant has offered no evidence at all to \nsupport his claim. If the state prosecutor fails to meet this high \nburden, the Republican proposal requires the state to pay the \ndefendant's attorney's fees. This is a clear intrusion on the \nlongstanding police powers of states.\n  I previously have spoken about the amendment proposed by Senators \nManchin and Toomey. That amendment contains a number of important \nprovisions. One aspect of the amendment that has not received enough \nattention is the additional due process it affords to veterans who have \nbeen deemed mentally incompetent by the Department of Veterans Affairs. \nThe amendment provides that before veterans who have been adjudicated \nmentally incompetent lose their right to a firearm, they can go before \na board or a court to evaluate whether they can safely use a firearm. \nThe amendment requires that veterans be notified of this opportunity. \nThis adds to existing law that allows veterans who are no longer \nmentally incompetent to regain their right to a firearm. These laws are \nimportant and I support them.\n  I cannot support the Republican proposal, however, because it rolls \nback the existing laws that prohibit mentally ill people from \npossessing and using guns. It rolls back these laws not only for \nveterans, but for many civilians deemed mentally incompetent. It would \nforce the FBI to purge existing records from the background check \nsystem for those mentally incompetent people. This is dangerous. It is \nunwise, and it makes us less safe.\n  What this Republican alternative proposes is weak and unworkable and \nwill be of little use to law enforcement. I urge all Senators to reject \nthis proposal. We have heard much criticism and blame directed at the \nJustice Department for not adequately enforcing existing laws. But when \nCongress passes toothless laws it is Congress and not law enforcement \nthat is to blame. The Republican alternative is not a serious solution \nto the plague of gun violence.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I want to speak today about the series of \nvotes that are going to be taking place this afternoon on gun rights. I \nwanted to start off by telling a little story and explain why there are \nsome difficulties with some of those amendments that are here.\n  I had a person in Cheyenne come to me and say: I advertised a gun I \nwanted to sell. The guy was from southern Colorado, so he had to drive \nabout 300 miles. But he was former FBI and had a concealed carry \npermit. He was willing to drive up to Cheyenne and wanted to do it the \nright way--both of them wanted to do it the right way.\n  The person from Colorado was willing to pay the fee for doing a gun \ncheck. The person in Cheyenne arranged for a federally licensed dealer \nto do that. So they met at the gun store with the gun. Of course, \ncredentials as a former FBI agent is probably good enough to get \nthrough a gun check. Concealed carry permit, there is reciprocity in \nWyoming for that. They did not think there would be any problem. They \nlooked at it and put it into the system and got word back that he would \nknow in 5 days. Well, it is a long trip to get a gun. The person had a \ngun that was just like it. He was convinced of the credentials, so they \nwent to his house and finished the transaction. The fellow from \nColorado went home. The fellow from Cheyenne went down to retrieve his \nother gun. He found out that it is now in the Federal system. So he can \nhave a background check done on himself to get his own gun back.\n  So there are difficulties with the gun check. They are not immediate. \nThere is not a computer that immediately says: This person is not in \nthere so go ahead and sell them a gun. It can be a 5-day process, \nwhich, for a 3-day gun show can be a bit of a problem, or even a \nshorter one than that.\n  I want to talk a little more broadly about gun rights because the \nSenate will be voting on proposals today that affect rights not created \nby the law but, rather, were created by the Constitution that last a \nlot longer than anything we do in this body. Wyoming is a State of gun \nowners. A large number of Wyoming residents grow up learning to respect \nand lawfully use firearms.\n  As a matter of fact, many schools and youth organizations build \nhunter safety and gun safety into their curriculums so that young \npeople become familiar with the responsibilities of gun ownership at an \nearly age. Therefore, it should be no surprise that a majority of \nWyoming residents have called on me to oppose any legislation that puts \nadditional restrictions on the freedoms they enjoy and use daily.\n  I have been saying for some time that the bill before the Senate does \nnot focus on the problem. There is no doubt that we need to do more to \ncurb the senseless acts of violence which continue to occur in this \ncountry.\n  One of the things we need is parents to be more careful and more \nrepetitive at telling their kids it is not right to kill people, it is \nnot even right to bully them, and it is definitely not right for them \nto kill themselves. Until we can get that message across to our kids, I \nhope that we do not rely on a few votes by this body to make everybody \nfeel\n\n[[Page S2725]]\n\ncomfortable that all of the problems are taken care of. They will not \nbe.\n  The Senate should focus on making sure current laws are enforced; \nthey are not. Finally, our Nation and its communities should be doing \nmore to foster the idea that life has to be respected. However, the \nproblem with several of the proposals we will vote on today is that \nthey add to programs with track records of failure.\n  Additionally, I oppose limiting the rights of gun owners to transfer \ntheir firearms to their neighbor or loan hunting rifles to their family \nmembers. The underlying bill the Senate is debating would restrict that \nright in many areas and would only make gun ownership more burdensome \non lawful citizens.\n  My colleagues in other States may not realize this, but in Wyoming \nguns are not used just for self-defense and recreation. They are a \ntool. Ask the rancher who uses a rifle to defend his livestock from \npredation or the outfitter who uses a gun to protect clients in the \nback country.\n  Firearms do have everyday uses in Wyoming. Sometimes it is necessary \nto transfer or loan a gun to a nephew, a niece, or an employee. But \nunder what is being considered, that right may be severely infringed. I \ndo not condone acts of gun violence. I am a father and a grandfather \nand will do everything I can to keep guns out of the wrong hands. \nHowever, I am not willing to infringe on the constitutional right of \nlawful gun owners when the laws already designed to protect us are \nbeing unenforced.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, since 1968, more Americans have been killed \nby gun violence in the United States than have died in all the wars in \nAmerican history combined. This is a heavy toll on public safety and \npublic health. As a body, this Senate can do more and should do more to \nmake our communities safer.\n  It has been too many years, too little action, too much tragedy and \nheartbreak since the last debate on guns. I know all my colleagues \nshare my utter horror at the mass shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary \nSchool in Connecticut last December. Yet our responses to this and \nother tragedies are vastly different. I am motivated by them to demand \npassage of serious, concrete, and comprehensive measures to try to \nsafeguard innocent and precious lives, to prevent the next Newtown, the \nnext Aurora, the next Tucson, and countless other devastating examples \nof senseless gun violence.\n  Unfortunately, it seems we are on the verge of throwing up our hands \nand saying there is nothing we can do. But there is something we can \ndo.\n  We will take a series of votes this afternoon to reinstate the \nassault weapons ban and prohibit high-capacity magazines, amendments I \nam cosponsoring, and a compromise effort to close the gun show loophole \nand require better background checks. These measures balance protection \nfor responsible gun ownership with protection for public safety.\n  As someone who has served in the U.S. military, I believe carrying a \ngun is a serious responsibility. However, today it is far too easy for \ncriminals, domestic abusers, gang members, and terrorists to buy \nweapons.\n  Today's New York Times describes just how easy it is. One South \nCarolina man is noted as:\n\n     a fugitive from the Rhode Island police who has two \n     outstanding felony warrants as well as a misdemeanor warrant. \n     His legal status bars him from owning guns, but he was \n     recently seeking to buy an AK-47 assault rifle on [the \n     website] Armslist and was also trying to trade a Marlin \n     rifle. He posted photos to his Facebook account of an AK-47 \n     he had already purchased, along with a variety of other guns.\n\n  Clearly, the system is broken, and there is room for common sense \nreform. Indeed, we need to close gaping loopholes in current law which \nallow the sale of firearms at gun shows or online without \naccountability or background checks to determine whether the buyer has \na criminal record.\n  The Manchin-Toomey compromise, while not perfect and not my ideal \nsolution, would go a long way toward closing these loopholes. I wish to \npersonally commend both Senator Manchin and Senator Toomey for their \nbipartisan, and, indeed in many respects, courageous steps to try to \nmake this legislation possible for all of us.\n  In March of 2004, during the 108th Congress, when Democrats were in \nthe minority, Senator McCain and I worked together on bipartisan \nlegislation to close the gun show loophole. With his great leadership, \nwe passed an amendment 53 to 46, which was one of several successful \ngun safety amendments. Ultimately, the gun lobby defeated the \nunderlying bill, a bill it originally supported and identified as a top \npriority. This was because we had managed to pass sensible gun safety \nmeasures, at least in the amendments to the legislation.\n  This is proof that passing sensible legislation to keep guns out of \nthe hands of dangerous individuals is possible with bipartisan \ncooperation. We have done it.\n  Gun ownership is a fundamental right in this country, but reasonable \nlimitations on military-style assault weapons and high-capacity \nammunition clips are fully consistent with the Second Amendment.\n  Indeed, in the 2008 majority opinion in the Heller decision, Justice \nScalia made clear that the Second Amendment is ``not unlimited'' and is \nnot ``a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner \nwhatsoever and for whatever purpose.''\n  Limiting access to military-style weapons and strengthening \nbackground checks would help save lives and make our communities safer. \nWe also need to improve access to mental and behavioral health care. \nOne of the ironies is that more often an individual with mental illness \nis the victim of gun violence or other types of violence than the \nperpetrator of violence. However, it is still important to take any \nopportunity to help strengthen our mental health system.\n  This is why I support the Harkin-Alexander amendment which, among its \nmany provisions, would include my bipartisan youth suicide prevention \nmeasure, the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act reauthorization, \nlegislation which was led very courageously and successfully by our \nformer colleague, Senator Gordon Smith. I urge my colleagues to support \nthese amendments and to muster the same kind of bipartisan cooperation \nSenator McCain, I, and several others had years ago.\n  It is my wish we can reach a sensible consensus. Indeed, an \noverwhelming majority of Americans are demanding this. There is no \nquestion what the American people want. The question we will settle is \nare we responding to the American people or are we responding to a very \nnarrow self-interest. I hope we will respond to the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, this afternoon I, rise to defend the \nSecond Amendment to our Constitution. Recent mass killings, such as \nthose in Connecticut and Colorado, are the impetus for the gun control \nlegislation we are discussing before the Senate now.\n  I mourn the victims of these senseless acts of violence carried out \nby serious and disturbed individuals. Unfortunately, this legislation, \nI believe, would do nothing to prevent such tragedies going forward.\n  The harsh but unavoidable fact is no amount of government \nintervention can prevent irrational people from doing terrible things. \nTherefore, we should not react to these tragedies in an irrational \nmanner in the Senate which would erode a fundamental right of every \ncitizen in the United States.\n  The Second Amendment states, as you well know, unambiguously, ``The \nright to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.'' It makes plain to \ncriminals their targets have the right to defend themselves, their \nfamilies, and their property.\n  Since criminals do not follow the law and never will follow the law, \nnew restrictions will hinder only the law-abiding among us, I am \nafraid. Make no mistake, this is only the first assault on the Second \nAmendment. More background checks today, gun registration\n\n[[Page S2726]]\n\ntomorrow, who knows what will follow after this. Congress should reject \nit all now.\n  My opposition to the legislation before the Senate is not abstract. \nGun control laws have proven ineffective in reducing violent crime. As \ngun ownership in the United States has increased over recent years, \nnationwide crime rates have decreased. Nonpartisan studies, however, \nshow no correlation between the now-expired assault weapons ban and the \ndecrease in crime rates. Still, violence has spiked in certain parts of \nthis country.\n  In Chicago, for example, murder rates are soaring. Yet Chicago has \namong the most Draconian and restrictive gun laws in the country. These \ntrends have developed not because of gun control legislation but in \nspite of it.\n  Despite this failed record, the legislation before the Senate pushes \nmore of the same. This so-called compromise amendment would do nothing \nbut compromise our Second Amendment rights.\n  First, it would drastically expand background checks for gun \npurchases in an inconsistent and unenforceable manner. The legislation \nmandates background checks for all firearms purchases at gun shows \nbetween two nonlicensed parties. Yet it is unclear whether the same \nbuyer and seller would have to run a background check if they meet at a \ngun show but wait until it is over to execute the sale.\n  The legislation also mandates background checks for any gun purchase \npursuant to an advertisement by a buyer or seller. This would be \nextremely difficult to enforce under a narrow definition of what \nconstitutes an advertisement. Under the extremely broad definition \nprovided in this amendment, enforcement would be virtually impossible.\n  Will determined criminals not simply avoid gun shows and \nadvertisements? We can bet they would. I believe we should not restrict \ntransactions between law-abiding citizens, especially when we will not \nprevent such transactions between criminals.\n  This amendment would also allow health care providers to place a \npatient in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System \ndatabase. I believe this would violate patients' privacy and remove \ntheir Second Amendment rights based on subjective judgments and without \nany clear guidelines or due process.\n  It is unclear whether a patient must be informed of the health care \nprovider's decision to submit his or her private health information to \nauthorities. This provision could very well discourage those who need \nmental health services from seeking them for fear their constitutional \nrights may be abrogated. We should not put doctors and patients in this \nposition.\n  In addition, the FBI estimates enforcing these background checks \nwould cost approximately $100 million annually. At the same time, this \namendment would prohibit the FBI from charging federally licensed \nfirearms dealers to run these background checks.\n  To carry this out if it were to become law, the money must come from \nsomeone. Will it be gun buyers or taxpayers? Either way, I oppose it.\n  Again, this legislation is just the first step. It would lay the \ngroundwork for even more Draconian and ineffective gun control \nmeasures. As one of the Justice Department's leading crime researchers \nhas stated, the government's ability to implement near-universal \nbackground checks would rely, at least in part, on ``requiring gun \nregistration.'' I oppose that.\n\n  Mr. President, there are as many guns in this country perhaps as \nthere are people, according to some estimates. That is more than 300 \nmillion people, and there are probably over 300 million guns. The \nbureaucracy we have today cannot track all of the people illegally \nresiding in this country, why then would anyone believe the bureaucracy \ncould track all of the guns illegally possessed in this country? And \nwho would pay for that? Would gun owners again be subject to still more \nfees or taxes for exercising their Second Amendment rights?\n  Who would have access to this so-called registry? Would the public \nknow who owns guns and who does not? Who would ensure this sensitive \ninformation is protected and not used for political purposes, and how?\n  We do not know the answers to these questions, but we do know that \nsuch restrictions will not prevent the next tragedy. We should not \nstart down this dangerous road. What should we do instead? I have a few \nsuggestions.\n  Instead of undermining the Second Amendment, Congress should focus \nits attention on three areas: First, I believe robust prosecution of \nviolent criminals is the best deterrent to violent crime. Prosecutors \nshould punish to the fullest extent of the law individuals who misuse \nguns, knives, or anything else to commit violent crimes. There should \nbe no leniency whatsoever for the commission of such crimes.\n  Secondly, we should examine and address any deficiencies--and we have \nthem--in our mental health system. Time and again we have seen a strong \nconnection between mental illness and violent crime. We should not fall \nprey to the delusion government can prevent all bad things, nor should \nwe assume simply throwing money at the problem will solve it. We \nshould, instead, do a better job of helping those with mental illnesses \nbefore their problems spiral out of control.\n  Third, I would suggest we should weigh the impact of violence in the \nentertainment industry on violent crime in this Nation. Many video \ngames, movies, television shows, and songs contain graphic depictions \nof violence. Common sense tells us that glorified violence can distort \nimpressionable minds, particularly those afflicted with mental \nillnesses or mental challenges. Still, many in Hollywood defend the \nFirst Amendment to the Constitution with the same wild-eyed zeal they \ntrash the Second Amendment to the Constitution.\n  I stand here to defend the Bill of Rights in its entirety.\n  In closing, let me mention that since January 1 of this year I have \nheld public meetings in each of my State's 67 counties. Overall, my \nconstituents are deeply concerned about any infringement upon their \nSecond Amendment rights. They are concerned about their ability to \nprotect themselves, they are concerned about their ability to protect \ntheir families, and they are concerned about their ability to protect \ntheir property.\n  They are concerned that the activities, traditions, and way of life \nthey have long and peaceably enjoyed, and which are protected by the \nConstitution, could possibly be outlawed. They are concerned they may \nunknowingly run afoul of a new gun control law because the proposals \nbefore us are so illogical and inconsistent and contrary to common \nsense.\n  I believe this bill is an overall legislative misfire. I have \noutlined what I believe would constitute a clear-eyed response to the \nsituation at hand. I will continue to vigorously oppose gun control \nlegislation, and I will continue to stand firm in defense of the Second \nAmendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Would the good Senator from Alabama yield?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I will be glad to yield for a question, but my time is \nup.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I respect the Senator's views. He is a \ntrue friend. But on the bill Senator Toomey and I have been working on, \nif I could point out and ask the Senator's concerns and consideration \nabout that, if he would, especially relating to the Second Amendment. I \nam a defender, I think Senator Toomey is, as is the Senator, a defender \nof the Second Amendment.\n  In our amendment we basically strengthen and enforce and promote it. \nHere is what we have: We allow dealers to sell guns at gun shows in \ndifferent States, which they can't do now. We allow Active-Duty \nsoldiers to buy guns in their home States, which they can't do now. We \nfix a legal discrepancy that will allow people in transit across the \nState to carry an unloaded and locked weapon. And we explicitly state \nthe bill does not expand the authority of the ATF. Plus we make it a \npenalty by a felony and 15 years imprisonment by registration.\n  Mr. SHELBY. May I respond?\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I would tell the distinguished Senator and my friend from \nWest Virginia, for whom I have a lot of respect, that I totally \ndisagree. This is the first step in the erosion of our\n\n[[Page S2727]]\n\nrights under the Second Amendment. That is why I oppose this \nlegislation. I totally and fundamentally disagree with the author.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I respect the Senator's position on this, and I thank \nhim.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nto talk about the pending amendments for about 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this debate we are having about gun \ncontrol legislation and how to solve a difficult problem is a good \ndebate. Quite frankly, I never understood why we would not want to have \nthis debate. This is an issue where most Americans very much would like \nto see something of substance accomplished. But the goal is to do \nsomething of substance that will address the underlying problem, not \njust pass legislation, quite frankly, in a more feel-good category.\n  Senators Manchin and Toomey are very sincere. I know they are trying \nto fix a problem that is seen by a lot of people to be a problem, and I \nunderstand where they are coming from. But I want to take my time to \ntalk about two things.\n  The President has given a lot of speeches about this issue, very \nemotional in nature--that State of the Union Speech--and he has \nliterally traveled all over the country to sort of gin up support for \nthree things: a universal background check, the banning of assault \nweapons, assault rifles, and limiting magazine sizes. At the end of the \nday, the Senate will take up these measures individually and somewhat \ncollectively, and here is what I think will happen.\n\n  I think when it comes to the magazine size limitation, that is not \ngoing to pass the Senate simply because there are thousands, if not \nmillions, of magazines beyond 10 rounds out in the current marketplace. \nFrom a criminal point of view, this legislation wouldn't affect them \none bit. They will get a magazine of whatever size they would like. It \nwould affect law-abiding citizens and put them in a bad spot.\n  The best way to interrupt a shooter in a Newtown situation is not to \nlimit the magazine size but to have a security officer in the school \nwho can confront the shooter before they get to the kids. Don't kid \nyourself that having to reload is going to be the answer to \ninterrupting a crazy person bent on destroying the lives of innocent \npeople. In a school environment, in my view, the best way is to \nconfront that shooter with a trained law enforcement officer. The \nGrassley-Cruz-Graham amendment has money put back into the system--\nmoney President Obama cut out of school safety, some $300 million, at a \ntime when that was very unwise. So we would restore that money.\n  Two months ago, maybe a little longer, there was a young woman at \nhome in the Atlanta suburbs with her twin daughters--I believe they \nwere twin daughters--and there was a home invasion by someone who had \njust been released from jail. She took her children up on the second \nfloor and hid in the closet. She got on the cell phone and called her \nhusband asking what to do. She grabbed a .38 revolver. The guy broke \ninto the closet, she fired six times, emptying the gun and hitting him \nfive to six times. He was still able to get up and drive away.\n  Approximately one-third of the assaults in this country are committed \nby more than one person. In the hands of that mother, six shots were \nnot enough. It wouldn't bother me one bit if she had 30 rounds. In the \nhands of a mentally unstable person or convicted felon, one bullet is \ntoo many. That is why I oppose the magazine size limit. It does not \naddress the problem.\n  Now, as to the AR-15, there are 4 million of these rifles available. \nIt is one of the most popular selling sportsman's rifles in the \ncountry. I have been in the military for almost 30 years. It is similar \nto the M16, but it is a semiautomatic, not a fully automatic rifle. The \nreason I own one is because I like to shoot. I am not going to bother \nanybody. I am not going to do anything wrong with the gun. I passed the \nbackground check to get the rifle.\n  Why an AR-15? Vice President Biden, who is a good friend, has \nsuggested a double-barrel shotgun is the best way to defend a home in \ncase you find a lawless environment. We have had hurricanes, \nearthquakes, or other natural disasters where law enforcement is not \navailable to families because the system is broken. They can't call, \nthey can't travel, there has been a catastrophic event, such as Sandy, \nHugo or Katrina. These things happen in the real world where law and \norder breaks down.\n  The Vice President was talking to a young man who was worried about \nthis, and he said: You don't need an AR-15, you need a double-barrel \nshotgun. That is the best way to defend your home.\n  To be honest with you, I disagree. If there is a roving gang in the \ncommunity, and there are three homes, one without a gun, one with a \ndouble-barrel shotgun, and one with an AR-15, they are going to pick \nthe AR-15 last. Now, you may not agree with me, but I think that makes \nsense as a self-defense weapon. So that is why the assault ban is not \ngoing to pass.\n  Less than 2 or 3 percent of all murders in this country are committed \nwith a rifle of any kind. Most murders committed in this country, \nviolent acts, with a gun, are committed with handguns.\n  At the end of the day, the magazine limitation is not going to pass \nbecause it doesn't address the problem. In the hands of a mother, six \nrounds is not enough; in the hands of a criminal, one is too many. The \nAR-15, 4 million guns available; the assault weapon is a very popular \nselling gun, and I think under Heller that type of weapon would be \nprotected. It is not the gun you own, it is who owns it.\n  At the end of the day, the universal background check is not going to \nmake it. Senators Manchin and Toomey are trying to find a solution in a \nsmaller way. I appreciate that. But here is my concern about background \nchecks.\n  Last year, 80,000 people failed a background check, and 9,000 of the \npeople who failed the background check were convicted felons on the run \nfrom the law. Yet only 44 people were prosecuted out of 80,000. Of \nthose 9,000, I can't find one case where the law enforcement community \nfound out a criminal on the run from the law tried to buy a gun and \nthey went and picked him up. We at least ought to be catching dumb \ncriminals. If they are dumb enough to fill out a background check while \nthey are on the run, the system ought to catch them.\n  Let me tell you of another problem we found. In 2005, there was a \nyoung lady named Alice Boland, who is a paranoid schizophrenic, a very \ntroubled young lady with a history of mental illness, who pled not \nguilty by reason of insanity for trying to kill the President of the \nUnited States and a Secret Service agent. The threats were made at the \nCanadian border, and she eventually came to South Carolina with her \nfamily.\n  She was adjudicated by a Federal court, pled not guilt by reason of \ninsanity, and the plea was accepted. She was confined to a mental \nhealth institution by the court. When she got out, she went home, and \nin February of this year she went to Walterboro, a small community near \nCharleston, and bought a .22 semiautomatic pistol. She filled out the \nbackground check, and her plea of not guilty by reason of insanity was \nnot entered into the background check system. The fact she was confined \nto a mental health institution by a Federal court didn't make it into \nthe background check system.\n  She bought the gun, went to a private school--Ashley Hall in \nCharleston--went to the office area where the staff was located, pulled \nout the gun, and the gun didn't fire. Thank God it didn't. But our \nbackground system doesn't catch people like her.\n  There are 14,000 people in South Carolina who have been adjudicated a \ndanger to themselves and others by a competent court under due process \nwho are not in the Federal background system. There may be up to 1 \nmillion people.\n  The Grassley-Cruz-Graham bill will fix that problem. It would make \nsure before you get a law enforcement grant from the Federal \nGovernment, the State that requests the grant has to enter into the \nFederal database people who have been held mentally a danger to \nthemselves or others by a competent court. It looks like we could at \nleast do that to get thousands, if not up to 1 million people, who have \nbeen deemed to be a danger to themselves or others\n\n[[Page S2728]]\n\ninto the background check system before we expand it.\n  So I support Grassley-Cruz-Graham. I think it has a comprehensive \napproach. It has an antitrafficking component to it. It has a task \nforce that will have $50 million available to the Federal law \nenforcement community to go after people who fail a background check or \nwho are felons. I think it is a much better approach than the other \nlegislation on the floor.\n\n  So I will be opposing Manchin-Toomey. I appreciate the spirit in \nwhich it has been offered, but I think defending the background check \nsystem is not the problem. Making the background check system capture \nmental health adjudications and doing something about a felon who fails \na background check is a wiser approach rather than expanding a broken \nsystem.\n  When we only have 44 people out of 80,000 prosecuted, something is \nwrong. Why create more paperwork where nobody is going to do anything \nabout it. Let's focus on the problem.\n  So I think this has been a good debate for the Senate. When it is all \nsaid and done, after a reasoned debate, the President's proposal--more \nemotional than practical--of a universal background check, which would \nhave included a private sale, no matter what he said, is not going to \ncarry the day in the Senate.\n  We should be going after the criminal, not the law-abiding citizen, \nand all of us should want to make sure that those who are a danger to \nthemselves and others do not have access to a weapon. That is a \ncommonsense approach to a hard problem.\n  I look forward to the votes today and the votes to come because this \nis an issue which should be debated. I am not afraid to voice the \ncourage of my convictions. Everyone in this body is sincere about their \napproach to the problem, but I think at the end of the day what is \ngoing to prevail is common sense.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, would the Senator from South Carolina \nyield for just 1 second?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Absolutely.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I appreciate so much the Senator's sincere approach.\n  The only thing I would say is that my and Senator Toomey's approach \nand what we are doing is not a universal background check and would not \ntouch the private sector.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Absolutely. It is taking a more limited approach. I \ntotally understand it.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I thank the Senator, and I appreciate it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                        Boston Marathon Bombing\n\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I rise today to give my first speech from \nthe floor of the Senate. I rise with a heart heavy with mourning, but I \nalso rise with the gratitude of a fearless people--gratitude for the \nNation's prayers, strength, and resolve.\n  Two days ago there was a cowardly and despicable terrorist attack in \nthe city of Boston. Two times blasts from hidden bombs rocked the \nstreets of Copley Square. Two times courageous Bostonians ran toward \ndanger to help their fellow citizens. Three were killed, more than 170 \nwere wounded, and many remain in critical condition.\n  Two days ago was Patriots' Day in Massachusetts.\n  Patriots' Day is one of our most cherished holidays. We celebrate the \nlives of ordinary men and women who, in the hour of reckless darkness \nand peril and need, rose before dawn in Lexington and Concord and let \nthe world know that liberty and freedom, a government of the people, \nwould be established on this Earth. We celebrate Patriots' Day with \nreenactments and pancake breakfasts, with barbecues and baseball, and \nwith the Boston Marathon.\n  The marathon is always the greatest of celebrations. We love the \nspeed of the winners, we love the endurance of the participants, and we \nlove the passion of the supporters, but, as the Scripture says, ``The \nrace is not to the swift or the battle to the strong . . . but time and \nchance happen to them all.''\n  To all the families who lost their children; to all those who were \ninjured and wear the scars of tragedy; to all the citizen heroes, the \nfirst responders, the healers who acted with courage in the midst of \nchaos; to all those who bore witness at Boylston Street; and to the \npeople of Boston and Massachusetts: No one can replace what we have \nlost. No one can relieve the weight of our sorrow. But here today and \nin the days and weeks ahead, wherever we are, we will grieve together, \nhurt together, and pray together.\n  Today I rise to remember the lives of those we have lost, to support \nthose who survived, and to honor those who served.\n  Today we remember Martin Richard, an 8-year-old who, like third \ngraders everywhere, spent time drawing pictures, a little boy who loved \nto play soccer, hockey, and baseball in his neighborhood in Dorchester. \nWe also pray for his sister and his mother to recover from their \ninjuries.\n  We remember Krystle Campbell, who grew up in Medford and never missed \nthe marathon. Lively and happy, Krystle was always there for others. \nWhen her grandmother was recovering from an operation, Krystle moved in \nto help her because that is the kind of young woman she was.\n  We remember Lu Lingzi, who came to the United States from China to \nstudy statistics. She loved Ben & Jerry's ice cream, and she posted to \nher friends that morning that she had a wonderful breakfast. Her \npassing ignites the world in our common humanity.\n  We will miss them.\n  To those of you who were injured on April 15, know that we are here \nfor you. Every year during the marathon we are one family. We cheer for \neach other and we carry each other across finish lines. When tragedy \nstrikes, we are also one family. We hurt together and we help together. \nIn the weeks and months ahead your struggles will be our struggles, \nyour pain our pain, your efforts our efforts. We will be together \nthrough sorrow and anger, rehabilitation and recovery. We will be \ntogether because we are one family.\n  To those who served, we honor you. In ancient times the heroes of \nmyth and legend were part mortal, part god, for it was thought that no \nmortal man or woman could truly be great. This week the people of \nBoston and the people of this country prove the ancients wrong. Our \nheroes are our friends and our neighbors. They work in Copley and at \nChildren's, and when they were called to act, they answered.\n  There was the man in a cowboy hat who came to Copley to hand out \nAmerican flags in memory of his sons. When the bombs went off, he raced \nto help a young man who lost both his legs, applying a makeshift \ntourniquet, lifting the man into a wheelchair, and navigating him \nthrough the chaos so he could get medical attention.\n  There was the man who realized that spectators would be trapped by \nthe barricades and started to remove them, only to be hit by the second \nblast. Bandaged and burned, he told me yesterday that he was glad and \nhe celebrated not because he lived but because he helped.\n  There were the marathoners who ran past the finish line to Mass \nGeneral, unconcerned with their own sweat and tears but resolved to \ndonate their blood.\n  There were the brave firefighters, police officers, EMS, and guards, \ncoordinating the first response and bringing protection in the wake of \nperil.\n  There were world-class hospitals, doctors, nurses, and support staff \nwho refused to accept fatigue and worked through the night.\n  There were friends, strangers, neighbors, and shopkeepers who gave a \nhome to everyone who was stranded, food to those who were hungry, and \ncomfort to all who needed it.\n  Across this Nation, whether on Facebook or PeopleFinder, Monday, the \nwhole country was connected to Boston. Our city, our Commonwealth, and \nour country have been through a grim ordeal. We have seen terror \nbefore, but we will not be afraid, and we will not let it change us. \nBostonians are tough. We are fighters, and we will not be broken.\n  Yesterday I met a woman who is recovering in the hospital. Badly \ninjured, clearly in pain, she focused on getting back to work. She said \nthat people counted on her, so she would be back soon. That is the \nstrength and resilience of Boston. Our spirit is indomitable, our will \nis unyielding. Our Governor and our mayor have demonstrated unwavering \nresolve.\n  The men and women of law enforcement are hard at work. In the coming\n\n[[Page S2729]]\n\nhours, days, and weeks, when we learn more from their investigations, \nwe will identify who did this, and we will bring them to justice.\n  In times of calamity, in times such as these, we must remember the \nwords of John Winthrop, who counseled the founders of Boston:\n\n       [t]o do justly, to love mercy, to walk humbly with our God. \n     For this end, we must be knit together, in this work, as one \n     man. . . . We must delight in each other; make others' \n     conditions our own; rejoice together, mourn together, labor \n     and suffer together. . . . So shall we keep the unity of the \n     spirit in the bond of peace.\n\n  May God bless those who have gone and leave them at peace. May He \nsupport those who survive and help them carry forward. May He protect \nthose who serve their fellow man. And may He always watch over the \npeople of Boston, of Massachusetts, and of these United States of \nAmerica.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/17/senate-section/article/S2729-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CONDEMNING THE HORRIFIC ATTACKS IN BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS\n\n  Ms. WARREN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 101) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in today's Record \nunder ``Submitted Resolution.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. COWAN. Mr. President, on Monday a great Boston tradition and a \nhistoric holiday in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts were marred by a \ncowardly and detestable act of violence. Dozens of innocent civilians, \ngathered to watch an iconic, peaceful athletic event, were injured by \nexplosions and three lives were lost. I am honored today to join the \nsenior Senator from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Ms. Warren, in \noffering a resolution honoring the heroes and remembering the victims \nof that horrible day.\n  We continue to pray for the injured and hope they begin to heal, and \nwe mourn those who were killed and the families who survive them.\n  As a community, our hearts ached on hearing about the youngest \nvictim, Martin Richard, a vibrant 8-year-old boy from Dorchester--the \nsame age as my son--who came to watch his father finish the marathon, \nwho lost his life. We share in his family's grief and continue to send \nour prayers to his mother and sister, who are still in the hospital \nwith very serious injuries.\n  Yesterday we struggled to watch Patty Campbell fight back tears as \nshe talked about her beautiful and always smiling daughter Krystle. \nThis 29-year-old woman from Arlington and Lingzi Lu, a Boston \nUniversity graduate student who was from China's northeastern city of \nShenyang, were also tragically taken from us by this heinous act.\n  Events such as those of Monday remind us that, yes, evil still exists \nin the world, but these events also remind us how unified and resilient \nthe American people are. While the city of Boston witnessed terror, we \nalso witnessed remarkable displays of bravery, support, kindness, and \ncompassion.\n  The Nation and the world saw the best of the people in the \nCommonwealth during Monday's tragic events. Countless residents showed \nsuch strength and grace in the face of this terrible tragedy.\n  I am in awe of the bravery shown by our police, fire, and emergency \npersonnel. I am so proud of the medical providers, volunteers, and \nspectators who rushed toward the noise and smoke to help the injured \neven as they themselves remained in imminent danger. They helped to \nevacuate the victims and worked into the night and following days to \noffer care and protection.\n  Doctors, nurses, residents, and volunteers worked and continue to \nwork in some of the best hospitals in the Nation right there in Boston \nto save lives and help victims recover.\n  I am also grateful for the support the Commonwealth has received from \nthe President, national law enforcement, and my colleagues here in the \nCongress. The people of the Commonwealth are comforted that the Federal \nresources needed to help care for the victims and bring to justice \nthose responsible for this assault will be provided. We appreciate that \nthese tangible actions by the Federal Government represent the \nintangible support given to us by citizens in every State across this \nNation.\n  As we remember those lost and injured, we know that what is good \nabout the human spirit will triumph over the cowards who attacked us. \nMake no mistake, we will find them and justice will be done. The city \nof Boston, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the American people \nwill come together and overcome this senseless tragedy. You may visit \nterror upon us, but we will never be terrorized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, given the importance of this debate, I \nbelieve it is important for me to explain why I am supporting amendment \nNo. 715, offered by Senators Manchin and Toomey, to S. 649, the Safe \nCommunities, Safe Schools Act of 2013.\n  Like all Americans, my heart goes out to the people of Newtown, \nConnecticut; Aurora, Colorado; Tucson, Arizona, and all other cities \nand towns impacted by senseless gun violence. These tragic events are \nimpossible to fully comprehend unless you were there and extremely \ndifficult to relate to unless you experience the effects personally. \nThe rest of us are left with more questions than answers, and \ndiffering--albeit well-intentioned--solutions designed to preserve our \nway of life while doing our best to ensure these horrible events are \nless likely tomorrow.\n  As everyone is aware, in January of 2011, the citizens of my home \nState--as well as people around the country and world--were shocked and \nhorrified by the senseless violence of a severely disturbed young man \nwith a gun. Six people were killed and 13 injured. One of those victims \nwas a bright young Congressional staffer named Gabe Zimmerman, who was \nhighly regarded by his colleagues and had a future filled only with \npromise. Yesterday, here in the Capitol at a room dedication for Gabe \nZimmerman, we were provided with a very real portrait of a man who was \ndoing what he loved, serving the people of Arizona, when his life was \ntragically cut short. I think his father's comments are worth repeating \ntoday. Ross Zimmerman, Gabe's father, said:\n\n       An echo of Gabriel will persist, perhaps for centuries. It \n     isn't worth the loss, but the echo is good and true. . . . I \n     ask that you and our descendents take inspiration from my \n     son's echo as you conduct the affairs of this Congress and \n     the affairs of this nation.\n\n  Another life impacted by those tragic events is that of Congresswoman \nGabrielle Giffords. Her life, while still filled with great promise, \nwas unalterably changed that fateful day. Congresswoman Giffords, and \nher loving husband Captain Mark Kelly--who are both with us here in \nWashington today to witness this debate--reflect the determination of \nthe American spirit and are beautiful examples of how good really does \ntriumph over evil.\n  Gabby, Mark and the countless other examples of heroism and \nresilience that America witnessed in Tucson, Aurora, Newtown and \nelsewhere around the Nation, are clear reminders of why we are all here \nserving, and the gravity of the issues we are asked to address. Their \npresence here today further reminds us that we are here to serve a \ncause greater than our own self-interest. There is nothing like looking \nin the eyes of a still-grieving parent who has just lost a young son or \ndaughter to remind you of that fact.\n\n[[Page S2730]]\n\n  For over three decades in Congress, I have built as strong a record \nas anyone in this body in defending the Second Amendment. I have \nconsistently opposed the efforts of anti-gun activists to ban guns and \nammunition, staunchly defending the Constitutional rights that \nArizonans hold dear. I have voted against assault weapons bans because \nI believed they would not work and opposed efforts to cripple firearms \nmanufacturers by making them liable for the acts of violent criminals. \nI have proudly lent my signature to Supreme Court briefs defending an \nindividual's right to bear arms. In my view, the wisdom of our Framers' \ninclusion of the right to bear arms is self-evident. And as an \nArizonan, I understand the significance of gun ownership to the people \nof the West, whether for self-defense, sport, or simple ownership.\n  Just as I have long defended the Second Amendment to the \nConstitution, I have also long believed that it is perfectly reasonable \nto use available tools to conduct limited background checks, as this \namendment prescribes, to help ensure that felons and the mentally-ill \ndo not obtain guns they should not possess. In my view, such background \nchecks are not overly burdensome or unconstitutional.\n  Is this a perfect solution? No. Would it prevent all future acts of \ngun violence? Of course not. Would it have prevented the most recent \nacts of gun violence? In all likelihood, no. But, it is reasonable and \nit is constitutional.\n  I approach the issue of gun rights with profound respect for our \nConstitution, and the freedoms and rights that it bestows on each and \nevery one of us. I am also guided by a firm commitment that we should \ndo everything we can, within the bounds of the Constitution and the \nprinciples of individual rights and federalism on which it is based, to \nstem the rising tide of gun violence in this country. In this instance, \nneither the United States Supreme Court nor the lower Federal courts \nhave held that restrictions on possession for certain classes of \nindividuals violate the Second Amendment. In Heller v. District of \nColumbia, the Court held that the Second Amendment protects an \nindividual right to a well-armed militia. In his Majority opinion, \nJustice Scalia observed:\n\n       Nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on \n     longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by \n     felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying \n     of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and \n     government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and \n     qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\n\n  In this instance, I agree with Justice Scalia that a background check \nsystem is not a restriction of the Second Amendment right to keep arms. \nThe issue is plain to me because a background check system only seeks \nto ensure that sellers of firearms do not transfer guns to a prohibited \nclass of owners. Restrictions on ownership by certain classes of people \nhave existed in federal law for 45 years and have not been \nconstitutionally invalidated by the courts.\n  In addition to Constitutional concerns, many have expressed concerns \nabout the establishment of a national gun registry. If this amendment \nwould establish such a registry, I would oppose it. But, it does not. \nIn fact, the amendment reinforces the existing Federal ban of a \nnational firearms registry. The amendment explicitly states, ``Nothing \nin this title, or any amendment made by this title, shall be construed \nto allow the establishment, directly or indirectly, of a Federal \nfirearms registry.'' But, the amendment does not stop there. It would \nalso provide for a harsh penalty of 15 years for any person who \nattempts to create a registry and re-affirms that any regulations \nissued by the Department of Justice to ensure criminals and the \nmentally ill do not obtain firearms cannot create a firearms registry.\n  Mr. President, every once in a while I have seen some acts of \npolitical courage and quite often we praise each other and ourselves, \ndirectly or indirectly, for the positions we take and the votes we \npass. I wish to take a moment and express my appreciation to the two \nsponsors of this amendment, Senator Manchin and Senator Toomey. Both \ncome from States where there are avid and dedicated and legitimate gun \nrights advocates. It would have been easier for both Senator Manchin \nand Senator Toomey to ignore this situation and not reach across the \naisle to each other to see if we could come up with what I think most \nAmericans--in fact, I have seen polls indicating that 80 percent of the \nAmerican people--support, reasonable background checks that do not \ninfringe on the constitutional rights of our citizens. I congratulate \nboth Senator Manchin and Senator Toomey for taking this position.\n  You may not win today, I say to my two colleagues, but I will say \nthat you did the right thing. You did the right thing. It has been my \nexperience, as a Senator in this body for some years who has not always \ndone the right thing, that doing the right thing is always a reward in \nitself.\n  Sooner or later this country will take up this issue and it will take \nup the mentally ill issue, and I hope it will take up Hollywood \nviolence, and I hope it will take up those programs that may incite \nyoung people to go out and want to acquire a weapon and use it. But \nwhat they have tried to do today I think is an act that should be \nappreciated by those of us who, many times, avoid taking the tough \ndecisions. I think they are an example to all of us.\n  I yield.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Will the Senator yield for a second? Let me say to \nSenator McCain, I thank the Senator. I truly do. Because with the \nSenator's truly busy schedule--and everybody knows in how many \ndirections you are pulled and how you are working--he took time to read \nit. He took time to see we did not invade anybody's private \ntransactions. He took time to see that basically we had a Commission on \nMass Violence that would look at the culture of violence in our \ncountry. I can only thank the Senator. For someone with the stature of \nthe Senator in this body, to take the time to go through that bill word \nby word and know that it does protect our Second Amendment rights, it \ndoes the things we try to do in a comprehensive way, I want to say \nthank you.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleague.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 730\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I call up my amendment which is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself, Mr. \n     Alexander, Mr. Franken, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Bennet, Mr. \n     Roberts, Ms. Baldwin, Ms. Ayotte, Mrs. Hagan, Mr. Murphy, and \n     Mr. Blumenthal proposes an amendment numbered 730.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Today, I offer this bipartisan amendment with my colleague Senator \nAlexander and several other members from the Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions Committee to reauthorize and improve programs administered \nby both the Departments of Education and Health and Human Services \nrelated to awareness, prevention, and early identification of mental \nhealth conditions, and the promotion of linkages to appropriate \nservices for children and youth.\n  The tragic shooting in Newtown, CT, in December brought the issue of \nmental health care to the forefront of public dialogue. Many people \nacross the nation, including the President, have said that we need to \ntake a long hard look at access to mental health services across the \ncountry. I was pleased to have the opportunity to start that dialogue \nwith my colleagues on the HELP Committee in January when we held a \nhearing to examine the state of our Nation's mental health care system.\n  A starting point of any conversation about mental health is \nrecognizing that one of the most insidious stereotypes about people \nwith mental illness is that they are inherently violent. It is deeply \nregrettable that some of the discussion in the wake of the Newtown \ntragedy has sadly reinforced this stereotype. As my colleagues in the \nSenate know and as the President has emphasized, people with mental \nillness\n\n[[Page S2731]]\n\nare much more likely to be victims of violent crimes than they are to \nbe perpetrators of acts of violence.\n  However, for too long, mental health care has not been at the \nforefront of public dialogue, despite the fact that mental illness \naffects one in four Americans every year, and serious mental illness \naffects 1 in 17. Unfortunately, there is still a stigma associated with \nmental illness, and that stigma results in too many people suffering in \nsilence without access to the care that could significantly improve \ntheir lives.\n  Unlike many other chronic diseases, mental health problems often \nbegin at a young age. Half of all mental illnesses manifest by age 14, \nwith another quarter appearing by the age of 24. However, less than \nhalf of the children with an identified mental health illness receive \ntreatment, and the average lag time from the first onset of symptoms to \nreceiving treatment is almost a decade.\n  This lack of treatment has huge consequences. Some 30,000 Americans \ndie by suicide each year, and it is a shocking fact that people with \nserious mental illness die 25 years earlier than Americans overall, \noften from treatable causes like diabetes and smoking-related chronic \nconditions.\n  The shame in this is that with access to the right treatments and \nsupports, most people with mental illnesses can recover and lead \nproductive, healthy lives. But we need to make the critical investments \nthat will enable this to happen, and this amendment is about making \nthose investments.\n  In the past several years, we have made two important steps forward \nin mental health care. First, in 2008 Congress passed the Paul \nWellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity \nAct. This long-overdue law put an end to the absurd practice of \ntreating mental and physical illness as two different things under \nhealth insurance. We followed this up with another important step \nforward in the Affordable Care Act, by requiring coverage for mental \nhealth and substance use disorders as an essential benefit in health \ninsurance plans and extending Federal parity protections to 62 million \nAmericans.\n  Building on these important insurance reforms, we started working in \nthe HELP Committee a few months ago to put together a targeted package \nto address some of the most pressing mental health care challenges in \nschools and communities. And last week, the HELP Committee unanimously \npassed and reported out the Mental Health Awareness and Improvement \nAct, which is this amendment.\n  The first title of this amendment provides a number of strategies to \nmake sure we are addressing the concerns of students with mental health \nneeds, starting with prevention and early detection. According to the \nNational Institutes of Mental Health, 20 percent of America's 75 \nmillion school-aged children have some mental health needs. This means \nthat 15 million students in our K-12 schools have some sort of mental \nhealth need. A RAND Foundation study found that only a quarter of those \nstudents needing mental health support received any type of services to \naddress their needs. That means over 11 million school-aged children \nmay be struggling with mental health concerns and not receiving the \nsupport that will help them in school, in their home and in their \ncommunities.\n  I worked with Senators Bennet, Alexander, and Murphy on language in \nour amendment that encourages schools to develop and implement \nschoolwide prevention and early intervention programs such as Positive \nBehavior Interventions and Supports, PBIS. Such schoolwide programs \nreach every single student in a school; every grade; every classroom. \nAnd the programs provide students with both clear information about \nwhat the expectations are for positive behavior and interactions, and \nthe support they need to be successful to meet those expectations.\n  Schoolwide programs such as Positive Behavior Interventions and \nSupports are important, but we also know that schools often lack \nsufficient mental health services for students who need more \ncomprehensive services. We also need to help schools link to mental \nhealth services. An NIH study found that most mental health services \nfor school-aged children were provided in schools. But schools do not \nalways have the expertise to provide those services. I worked with \nSenator Franken to direct the Department of Education to allow for \ngrants that would link local schools to community-based mental health \nservices, thereby expanding a school's ability to support children who \nhave more complex mental health needs and allowing for the training of \nschool personnel to meet students' mental health needs.\n  Finally, this title allows for the use of Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act title I funds to create or update school crisis \nmanagement plans. These plans are key to ensuring the safety of all \nstudents and school personnel.\n  Because these programs are schoolwide and reach every student, this \nmeans students receive the support they need early--often before \nproblems develop. It also means that students who need more \ncomprehensive and complex services are identified early and can be \nlinked to those services as soon as possible so that problems don't \nbecome worse.\n  This combination of prevention and early detection of needs, as well \nas expanding the services and supports available to schools, will help \naddress the wide gap in mental health supports for school-age children.\n  The second title of this amendment focuses on programs at the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. I worked with my colleagues \nSenator Reed and Murkowski to reauthorize the Garrett Lee Smith \nMemorial Act, which focuses on suicide prevention on college campuses \nand through grants to States. The bill authorizes ``Mental Health \nAwareness Training Grants,'' a commonsense idea introduced by Senators \nBegich, Blumenthal, and Ayotte to train school and emergency personnel, \nas well as other individuals, to recognize the signs and symptoms of \nmental illness, to become familiar with mental health resources in the \ncommunity, and to safely de-escalate crisis situations.\n  I worked with Senator Murray to reauthorize and strengthen the \nNational Child Traumatic Stress Initiative, which supports a national \nnetwork of child trauma centers in order to coordinate the collection, \nanalysis, and reporting of data concerning evidence-based treatments, \ninterventions, and practices for children and their families who have \nexperienced trauma.\n  I also worked with Senator Sanders to authorize and improve the \nNational Violent Death Reporting System at CDC which provides valuable \ninformation about violent deaths so we can look for ways to prevent \nthem.\n  Finally, the amendment calls for additional information to be \ngathered on mental health services for children, integrating mental \nhealth and substance use disorder treatments with primary care and the \nimplementation of recommendations made after the Virginia Tech tragedy \nin 2007.\n  Before I yield the floor, I wish to join my colleagues in expressing \nmy appreciation to Senator Manchin and Senator Toomey. They have \nprovided great leadership in bringing this legislation forward so that \nwe can have background checks. We will be voting on that legislation \nlater this afternoon.\n  I think it is another example around here--and maybe people will \nlearn this too late--of how we can sit down and talk. We won't know \nwhat kind of agreement can be reached until we sit down and talk to \npeople. A person may think he or she is miles apart on an issue, and in \nthe beginning maybe they are, but by talking and working things out, we \ncan reach good agreements. This is a good example of that.\n  The one element I would add to that is that the amendment I just \ncalled up is an important part of this bill in that it deals with \nmental health services both to children in school and out of school. \nAgain, I believe this is a very important part of what we ought to be \ndoing to reduce violence and respond to the mental health care needs of \nour young people.\n  Again, I thank Senator Manchin and Senator Toomey for their \ntremendous leadership on this important issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in watching this debate, at times I see a \nSenator who actually wants to stand up\n\n[[Page S2732]]\n\nand be the conscience of the Nation. Unfortunately, some quickly want \nto step back from that precipice and be the conscience of a lobby on \none side or the other.\n  As far as being the conscience, we saw that last Thursday when the \nSenate rejected the ill-conceived filibuster against considering the \nSafe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013. The vast majority of \nAmerican people did not want it filibustered. They wanted us to have \nthe courage to stand up and vote yes or no, not vote maybe, which is \nwhat a filibuster is.\n  After considering the bipartisan efforts of Senator Manchin and \nSenator Toomey to plug loopholes in the background check system, the \nSenate will consider a partisan alternative offered by Senator \nGrassley, and I will speak about that in a moment.\n  Before I do that, I would like to talk about what Senator Collins and \nI have done. I have a bipartisan amendment that will prevent criminals \nfrom circumventing the existing background check system.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 713\n\n(Purpose: To increase public safety by punishing and deterring firearms \n                              trafficking)\n\n  Mr. President, I call up my amendment numbered 713, the Leahy-Collins \namendment, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy] for himself, Ms. \n     Collins, and Mr. King, proposes an amendment numbered 713.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this amendment makes some minor changes to \nthe Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act. Our act is designed to \ngive law enforcement the necessary tools to combat the practices of \nstraw purchasing and illegal trafficking in firearms. An example of \nthat is when somebody legally buys a handgun for $500 and then turns \naround and sells it for $1,500 to a drug cartel or somebody who could \nnot buy it themselves. Usually they buy a lot more than one weapon; \nthey buy a whole lot. They will buy them legally and then sell them to \npeople who could never legally buy them. We have seen what that has \ndone in Mexico with its drug cartels. We have seen what it has done \nwith the drug cartels and gangs in some of our major cities.\n  I commend Senator Collins for her work in developing this amendment \nand for her strong support of the law enforcement officials who \nrequested this legislation to help them keep our communities safe.\n  Straw purchasers circumvent the purposes of the background check \nsystem. Straw purchasers put guns into the hands of someone who is \nlegally prohibited from having one. And it was an ATF whistleblower who \ntestified last Congress that the existing firearms laws are \n``toothless.'' We can create better law enforcement tools and that is \nwhat we are doing with the Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act. We \nneed to close this dangerous loophole in the law that Mexican drug \ncartels, gangs and other criminals have exploited for too long.\n  We know that many guns used in criminal activities are acquired \nthrough straw purchases. It was a straw purchaser who enabled the \nbrutal murders of two brave firefighters in Webster, New York, this \npast Christmas Eve, and it was a straw purchaser who provided firearms \nto an individual who murdered a police officer in Plymouth Township, \nPennsylvania, last September.\n  We need a meaningful solution to this serious problem. We also \ninclude suggestions from Senator Gillibrand to go after those who \ntraffic in firearms by wrongfully obtaining two or more firearms. We \nworked hard to develop effective, targeted legislation that will help \ncombat a serious problem and that will do no harm to the Second \nAmendment rights of law-abiding Americans.\n  This Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act--originally introduced \nas S. 54--will make important changes and better equip law enforcement \nofficials to investigate and prosecute the all-too-common practices of \nstraw purchasing and illegal trafficking of firearms. As I said, these \nare people who are not prohibited by Federal law from purchasing a gun. \nThey purchase a firearm on behalf of a person or at the direction of a \ndrug trafficker, criminal, or organization, and that is how these large \ncriminal organizations are supported. That is how these illegally \nobtained guns are often sold and resold across State lines. Of course, \nthis results in the proliferation of illegal firearms and gun violence \nin our communities.\n  Gun trafficking and straw purchasing make our communities less safe. \nWe recently saw a case where a woman was arrested as a straw purchaser \nafter she bought a weapon for a man who then, it appears from the \nevidence, used that weapon to kill the head of the Colorado prison \nsystem. That man was blocked from buying a weapon. Somebody else bought \nit for him.\n  Under current law, there is no specific statute that makes it illegal \nto act as a straw purchaser of firearms. Nor is there a law directly on \npoint to address the illegal trafficking of firearms. As a result, \nprosecutors must cobble together charges against a straw purchaser \nusing so-called ``paperwork'' violations such as misrepresentations on \na Federal form. These laws are imperfect, and do not give prosecutors \nthe leverage needed to encourage straw buyers, often the lowest rungs \non a ladder in a criminal enterprise, to provide the information needed \nfor investigators and prosecutors to go after those directing and \nprofiting from such activity.\n  Our bill and this amendment would change that. They will add two new \nprovisions to our Federal criminal code to specifically prohibit \nserving as a straw purchaser of firearms and trafficking in firearms. \nThe bill establishes tough penalties for these offenses in an effort to \npunish and, importantly, deter this conduct. I was accused at the \nCommittee markup on this bill of being too tough on these crimes. I \nbelieve we need a meaningful solution to these serious problems.\n\n  Another key provision of our bipartisan bill is that it complements \nexisting law that makes it a crime to smuggle firearms into the United \nStates by specifically prohibiting the smuggling of firearms out of the \nUnited States. In light of what we know is occurring, particularly on \nour Southwest border, this is an important improvement to current law \nand another tool that was needed but missing over the last few years.\n  The provisions in our legislation are focused, commonsense remedies \nto the very real problems of firearms trafficking and straw purchasing. \nOur bill does not affect lawful purchases from Federal firearms \nlicensees, and in no way alters their rights and responsibilities as \nsellers of a lawful commodity. We listened to concerns about family \nmembers who give firearms as gifts and other transfers that are not \ndesigned to get around the existing background check system. As a \nresult, the bill contains important exemptions for the innocent \ntransfer of a firearm as a gift, or in relation to a legitimate raffle, \nauction or contest.\n  In an effort to encourage even broader support for our bill, Senator \nCollins and I have made changes to our bipartisan bill to emphasize \nthat this legislation will have no adverse effect that would impact \nlaw-abiding gun owners. We have consulted a lot of people on this \nmatter, including law enforcement officials, prosecutors, victims, and \nthe National Rifle Association. We have consulted gun owners and \nothers. We have brought together some very diverse views, which is what \nthat legislation is supposed to do. We want to combat the destructive \npractices of straw purchasing and firearms trafficking. I am pleased \nthat our discussions with all of these groups resulted in legislation \nthat reflects diverse views yet is a focused approach to combat the \ndestructive practices of straw purchasing and firearms trafficking, \nwhile protecting the Second Amendment rights of Americans.\n  The amendment has all of the important provisions of the measure that \nwas debated and voted on by the Judiciary Committee and passed with a \nbipartisan majority. These include two new Federal criminal statutes \nthat will help law enforcement go after straw purchasers and firearms \ntraffickers.\n\n[[Page S2733]]\n\nAfter the bill was reported out of Committee, a Committee report was \nfiled in relation to it that made our intent plain in the meaning of \nthe bill. The clarifying language likewise ensures that lawful gun \npurchasers can buy firearms from licensed dealers as bona fide gifts or \nraffles or as contest prizes and so on. This amendment should also \neliminate any concern about imposing potential liability on the \noriginal purchaser of a firearm for the criminal acts of the ultimate \nrecipient of the firearm after it is conveyed by that purchaser and \nreconveyed a number of times. The amendment also includes other \ntechnical changes to conform the bill to existing law regarding the \nforfeiture of firearms and ammunition.\n  Throughout our committee process and discussions, no one was \nquestioning the constitutionality of these provisions, and they have \nall accepted the fact that they will help law enforcement. In fact, the \nrequired nexus to interstate commerce in the bill is identical to that \nalready in existing law. Our bill does not create a national firearms \nregistry, nor does it place any additional burdens on law-abiding gun \nowners or purchasers.\n  I worked with Senator Collins, Senator Durbin, Senator Gillibrand, \nand others to provide a real world, common sense solution to the \nproblem of gun trafficking and straw purchasing. There is wide \nagreement that straw purchasing and illegal gun trafficking have to be \nstopped, and that is why law enforcement so strongly supports our \namendment. In fact, this measure was introduced at the request of law \nenforcement officials who have said for years that they lack the legal \ntools necessary to combat illegal straw purchasing and firearms \ntrafficking. It will provide needed tools to fight against the drug \ncartels and other criminals who threaten our communities.\n  Like our original bill, the amendment we now offer has the support of \nnumerous law enforcement organizations, including the National \nFraternal Order of Police; the Federal Law Enforcement Officers \nAssociation; the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the \nMajor Cities Chiefs Association; the FBI Agents Association, the \nNational District Attorneys Association--an organization on which I was \nprivileged to serve as vice president; and all nine member \norganizations of the National Law Enforcement Partnership to Prevent \nGun Violence.\n  I mention all these things because we took months doing this. We met \nwith everybody. We worked. We listened to opposing views and supporting \nviews. Then we had hearings and then we had a markup. But all of a \nsudden, late this morning, with no hearings, no markup, no chance to \ndebate it, we have a partisan alternative led by some members of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee.\n  In contrast to the broad law enforcement support we have earned for \nour attempt to combat gun trafficking and strawpurchasing, there is \nsuddenly a Republican alternative which would gut the protections and \ntools that our law enforcement community needs. That partisan \nalternative was released late this morning and surprisingly the effort \nis led by members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. None of their \nprovisions was considered through regular order or even offered and \ndebated in committee.\n  People always speak about regular order, but none of these provisions \nwere considered through regular order. None of them were offered or \ndebated in committee. All of a sudden, wait, wait. We can't have this \nthing that law enforcement wants. We can't have this thing that might \nactually stop drug cartels and organized crime from getting these guns. \nWe have suddenly come up with a new idea this morning. Sorry we don't \nhave time to talk about it. Sorry we don't have time to have hearings. \nSorry we can't go through the committee. Sorry we can't have votes. \nTrust us.\n  As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I took my \nresponsibility seriously when the committee considered gun violence \nlegislation. We held three hearings. We had four lengthy markups. There \nwere many amendments circulated and we debated them. The distinguished \nPresiding Officer is a member of that committee. He was there for all \nthose hearings. He was there for all that debate. They went on \nsometimes for a long time, but we voted up or down, and we worked to \nbroker bipartisan compromises.\n  The results: Some of those same members who serve on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee circulated this lengthy substitute--just hours \nbefore the scheduled vote on their half-baked alternative. It is a weak \nand counterproductive alternative. The substitute is a weak and \ncounterproductive alternative, and this weak and counterproductive \nalternative, this partisan substitute, has not been the subject of one \nsingle hearing or any committee debate or vote.\n  The lengthy partisan substitute does several things to make our \ncommunities less safe. One of its provisions directly undermines what \nSenator Collins and I wish to accomplish. We want to stop trafficking. \nWe want to stop drug cartels and organized crime and bank robbers and \nthose who would murder government officials. We want to stop them from \nbeing able to get these guns through straw purchases. The Republican \nsubstitute requires prosecutors to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that \na straw purchaser knew for certain that he was buying for a prohibited \nperson. A straw purchaser could have every suspicion in the world that \nthe actual buyer is a dangerous criminal, but as long as he \ndeliberately shields himself from getting confirmation of that fact, he \nis untouchable. Willful ignorance will be their shield.\n  What this alternative Republican amendment does--the one that was \nsuddenly sprung on us with no hearings, no votes late today--is it \nactually has a roadmap of how to avoid prosecution, how to do the \nthings the drug cartels want and organized crime wants, and to make \nsure they will never be prosecuted. As long as straw purchasers ask no \nquestions, bury their heads in the sand, they can't be held \naccountable. They can buy these guns. They can meet somebody in a back \nalley who is trying to hide his face and say: I could have bought this \nlegally. Give it to me. Here is your money. Besides that, I will pay a \n300-percent profit and then get away with it.\n  The Republican substitute will help the Mexican drug cartels by \neliminating an existing tool that the Justice Department needs to \ncombat violence on the Southwest border. The Republican substitute also \ninterferes with state prosecutions of gun crimes. Under existing law, a \nperson who is traveling through a state with a gun he is not allowed to \npossess in that state can assert as a defense that he was merely \ntraveling between two states in which his possession would be legal. \nThis is fair. But the Republican proposal takes this defense and places \nthe burden on the state prosecutor to disprove the defendant's claim \nbeyond a reasonable doubt in all cases, even if the defendant has \noffered no evidence at all to support his claim. If the state \nprosecutor fails to meet this high burden, the Republican proposal \nrequires the state to pay the defendant's attorney's fees. This is a \nclear intrusion on the longstanding police powers of states.\n  I urge everyone who cares about helping law enforcement and keeping \nfirearms out of the hands of criminals to oppose the Republican \nsubstitute, number 725, and to support the bipartisan, Leahy-Collins \namendment, number 713.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is notified the majority time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I appreciate that. I hope we will not pass this. I hope we \nwill not strip State and Federal law enforcement in their effort of \ntrying to protect us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 725\n\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Grassley-Cruz \nsubstitute amendment. This amendment has come through the extended \nprocess of consideration of legislation and, indeed, I think this \namendment has come to pass precisely the way the process should operate \nas a result of multiple hearings in the Judiciary Committee; taking \nwitness testimony, examining what the evidence demonstrates is the \nproblem, and then endeavoring to craft a solution that multiple \nSenators have contributed to. It has been a long collaborative process. \nAt this point this amendment has over 20 cosponsors, and I am hopeful \nand believe that when it\n\n[[Page S2734]]\n\ncomes to a vote, it will receive some significant bipartisan support.\n  In my view the approach of the Federal Government to violent crime \nshould be very simple. It should be focused on stopping violent \ncriminals, and we should devote every resource to stopping violent \ncriminals from committing horrific acts of violence. Every one of us \nwas horrified by the crime in Newtown, CT--at the senseless killing.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator suggested this went through the process, went \nthrough the Judiciary Committee. I have been on the committee for 36 \nyears. I have been chairman for a number of years. I don't recall when \nthis happened. Would the Senator from Texas tell me when it was ever \nvoted on. Did we ever have a markup? Did we ever have a hearing?\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, as the distinguished chairman is well aware, \nthis amendment was not put before the committee, but it is as a result \nof the process in the committee; the testimony that was given in \nmultiple hearings that I was honored to attend with the chairman and \nwith the Presiding Officer, and it is in response to that testimony and \nthat evidence that over 20 Senators have come together to craft \nlegislation that actually addresses the problem.\n  Indeed, I would note, my biggest concern with the legislation--the \nDemocratic legislation on the floor--is it doesn't address the problem. \nIt doesn't target violent criminals. Instead, what it does is it \ntargets law-abiding citizens. If we are to be effective in stopping \nviolent crime--and I am confident every Member of this body wants to do \neverything we can to stop violent criminals from harming innocents \namong us--the approach that is effective, in my judgment, is targeting \nviolent criminals while at the same time safeguarding the \nconstitutional rights of law-abiding Americans. That is exactly what \nthis substitute does. I wish to talk about several aspects of it, all \nof which are directed at targeting bad actors, at targeting violent \ncriminals rather than law-abiding citizens.\n  One of the disturbing things we discovered in the course of these \nextended hearings in the Judiciary Committee is that the Obama Justice \nDepartment has not made it a priority to prosecute felons and fugitives \nwho attempt to illegally purchase firearms. Indeed, we learned that in \n2010, over 48,000 felons and fugitives attempted to illegally purchase \nfirearms. Of those 48,000, the Obama Justice Department prosecuted only \n44. That is 44 out of over 48,000. At the hearing, we heard from a \npolice chief who yelled at a Senator and said he didn't have time to \nworry about paperwork violations. I would submit that if a convicted \nfelon is trying to illegally buy a gun, that is not a paperwork \nviolation, and that is a prime area for focusing law enforcement \nresources, to figure out why that felon wants a gun and to go and \nprosecute them.\n  If a fugitive fleeing from justice tries to illegally purchase a gun, \nwe need to have the resources to prosecute it. So one of the things \nthis bill does is to create a task force within the Department of \nJustice devoted to prosecuting felons and fugitives who attempt to \nillegally purchase guns. It provides $50 million--$10 million a year \nover 5 years--to provide the additional resources to make sure that \nwhen felons and fugitives try to illegally purchase guns, we go after \nthem, we prosecute them, we put them away, and we prevent them from \nacquiring those guns and using them in horrific acts of violence.\n  A second aspect of this substitute focuses on gun crimes--instances \nwhere felons use a gun in the commission of a crime. In 1997, in \nRichmond, the U.S. attorney there pioneered a program called Project \nExile, which was tremendously successful. I note that was the U.S. \nattorney under a Democratic President, Bill Clinton. Project Exile put \nserious Federal resources to prosecuting under Federal law anyone who \nuses a gun in the commission of a crime. As a result of that innovative \nplan, we saw tremendous success.\n  In 1997, before Project Exile had been implemented, Richmond had the \nthird highest murder rate in the Nation. Yet, in 1998, after Project \nExile was implemented, homicides dropped 33 percent. The next year, in \n1999, homicides dropped an additional 21 percent. It was a program that \nworked.\n  When President George W. Bush was elected, he expanded the program \nwith Project Safe Neighborhoods, focused the same, putting law \nenforcement resources and priorities and prosecuting the use of guns in \na violent crime. Unfortunately, under the current administration, this \nhas not been a priority. Indeed, in firearms cases, prosecutions have \ndropped 30 percent in the Obama Justice Department.\n  All of us are united in wanting to stop violent crime and, in \nparticular, stopping violent crime with firearms. I would suggest the \nmost effective way to do so is to ensure we are prosecuting violent \ncriminals who use firearms. For that reason this amendment creates a \nnational Project Exile that would, in particular, focus on the 15 \njurisdictions with the highest violent crime rates and three tribal \njurisdictions with the highest crime rates. It would devote $45 \nmillion--$15 million a year for 3 years--for more assistant U.S. \nattorneys and agents to prosecute violent gun crimes, to target exactly \nwho we want to target--violent criminals. I would note as well that \nthis legislation also includes new language criminalizing straw \npurchasing, criminalizing trafficking but doing so in a way that \ntargets bad actors and doesn't sweep innocent, law-abiding citizens \ninadvertently into its reach.\n  A third area of focus is school safety. Unfortunately, the Obama \nadministration, in the past several years, has reduced the funding for \nschool safety by over $300 million. Indeed, next to me are detailed \nexamples: The Secure Our Schools grants were cut $110 million in 2012; \nreadiness and emergency management for schools was cut $20 million to \n30 million annually in 2012; school safety initiative was cut $53 \nmillion in 2011; and the safe and drug-free school grants were cut $184 \nmillion in 2010. This substitute restores funding for school safety.\n  If the effort is to protect our kids--and I know all 100 Senators \nwant to do everything we can to protect our kids--one of the most \ndirect ways is to make sure there are resources on the ground \nprotecting our kids. So this bill would provide $300 million in \nfunding--$30 million a year for 10 years--to do exactly that, to \nprovide funding for the secure our schools grants.\n  A fourth area is improving the existing background checks as it \nconcerns mental illness. If we look for a common theme among these mass \nmurders we have seen in recent years, one of the most disturbing themes \nis we have seen person after person with serious mental illness \naccessing firearms and using them to commit horrific acts of violence. \nOne of the real problems with our existing background check system is \nsome 18 States have essentially refused to comply with reporting mental \nhealth records. Some 18 States have reported fewer than 100 records to \nthe background check system. If adjudications of someone as a danger to \nothers--having a serious mental illness that makes them a danger to \nothers--if those adjudications are not reported to the background check \nsystem, then the existing system cannot operate. I would note my home \nState of Texas has devoted considerable efforts to reporting those \nrecords and, indeed, over 200,000 mental health records have been \nreported from the State of Texas to ensure that those with serious \nmental illness who are a danger to others are prevented from accessing \nfirearms.\n  If the objective is to stop violent crime, then it seems to me we \nshould focus on criminals. I would note that quite intuitive statement \nis not one which I am alone in viewing in that way.\n  Recently, a survey was done of over 15,000 law enforcement \nprofessionals about what measures would be effective stopping violent \ncrime. Mr. President, 79.7 percent of law enforcement professionals, in \nthis survey done by police, said, one, expanded background checks would \nnot be effective in stopping violent crime; 71 percent of law \nenforcement professionals said the assault weapons ban being considered \nby this body would not be effective in stopping violence crime; \ninterestingly enough, 20.5 percent of law enforcement professionals \nsaid if the assault weapons ban were passed, it would actually make \nviolent crime worse; and 95.7 percent of law enforcement \nprofessionals--virtually unanimous--said the\n\n[[Page S2735]]\n\nmagazine restrictions that are being considered by this body would not \nbe effective in stopping violent crime.\n  I would suggest we should listen to the men and women on the ground, \nto the police officers, who risk their lives defending us, defending \nour children, and we should trust their assessment.\n  I wish to make two final observations.\n  One, there has been considerable discussion about expanding \nbackground checks. Right now, background checks are required of any \nindividual who purchases a firearm from a licensed Federal firearms \ndealer. That is the existing system, and the system that the amendment \nI am proposing would work to improve.\n  There is an amendment pending before this body to expand that system \nsignificantly and in particular to cross a threshold that has not \npreviously been crossed: to require Federal Government background \nchecks for purely private sales between private individuals. If an \nindividual wants to sell, for example, his shotgun, and he puts an ad \non Craigslist advertising that shotgun, under the pending bill, by \nputting that ad on Craigslist, that individual would be required to \nsubmit to a Federal background check, would be required to go to a \nFederal firearms dealer to do so, and would, of necessity, have to pay \nwhatever fee was set.\n  I would note that fee could well be substantial. We do not know what \nthat fee would be, but we do know the District of Columbia right now \ncharges $150 to conduct a background check. If the fee turned out be \nanything in the order of what the District of Columbia charges, the \neffect of passing that bill would essentially be a Federal Government \npenalty, potentially as much as $150, on an individual who wanted to \nsell his or her shotgun or rifle to another law-abiding citizen in a \npurely private transaction.\n  I would suggest if the objective is to stop violent crime, in all of \nthe hearings we had before the Judiciary Committee, there was no \nevidence submitted that purely private transactions between private \ncitizens were a significant source of firearms used in crimes and that \nregulating them would help reduce violent crime. Indeed, as I said, one \npolice chief told the committee he did not have time to prosecute \nfelons and fugitives who were illegally trying to purchase guns.\n  If law enforcement does not have time to prosecute felons and \nfugitives, then I would suggest they especially do not have time to \nprosecute private citizens in a private consensual sale, when neither \nof those individuals have committed a crime; they are law-abiding \ncitizens. That is not an effective use of law enforcement resources.\n  But even more problematic, extending background checks to private \ntransactions between private individuals--if this body did that--I \nbelieve would put us inexorably on the path to a national gun registry. \nThe reason is simple: Because by extending background checks to private \ntransactions--the Department of Justice has been very candid about \nthis. The Deputy Director of the National Institute of Justice \nexplained that with respect to universal background checks, \n``effectiveness depends on requiring gun registration.''\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I appreciate my colleague's courtesy.\n  I would ask my colleague this: Isn't it the case that the very \nbackground check proposed in Manchin-Toomey is the same one that has \nbeen used for 17 years for FFLs, for Federal firearm licensees? Isn't \nit the exact same one?\n  Mr. CRUZ. What is not the exact same is extending it to a private \nindividual selling to another private individual.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. But it is the same technique, it is the same entry into \nthe book, and everything else.\n  Mr. CRUZ. But what is consequential is extending it to private \nsellers, not licensed dealers. Because the argument surely would be--if \nthis bill passed, the argument would immediately become: Well, it \ncannot possibly be effective because we do not know who owns those \nfirearms.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Just one more question.\n  Has my colleague in the last 17 years detected any move out of \nWashington for a national registration, any specific substantive move \nby ATF, the Justice Department, or any other Federal agency to begin a \ncampaign, a move to any kind of national registration?\n  Mr. CRUZ. In my opinion, adopting mandatory Federal Government \nbackground checks for purely private transactions between law-abiding \ncitizens puts us inexorably on the path to a push for a Federal \nregistry.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. But my colleague has not detected any move of that as of \nyet?\n  Mr. CRUZ. It is not currently proposed.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. OK.\n  Mr. CRUZ. But if the bill that is being considered were adopted, it \nwould put us on that path, and I think that path would be profoundly \nunwise and would be inconsistent with the Second Amendment right to \nkeep and bear arms.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague for his courtesy.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield to my friend from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I thank my friend from Texas.\n  I am a little bit confused since it is my and Senator Toomey's \namendment, working with Senator Kirk and Senator Schumer. We excluded \nall private transactions. We did not ever even go close to a private \ntransaction. Ours is only at gun shows, gun stores, and Internet sales, \nwhich is controlled now.\n  Mr. CRUZ. With respect, the legislative language, as I understand it, \nis triggered whenever there is any form of advertising, be it on the \nInternet or on Craigslist or The Greensheet or anything else, and that \nsweeps in a whole category of new sellers, purely private sellers who \nare not commercial firearms dealers.\n\n  Commercial firearms dealers are already, as my friend is well aware, \nsubject to significant regulation. Shifting to a new category of \nprivate law-abiding citizens is a major threshold and one that I think \nis unwise.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. On the Internet right now, as I understand the law as we \nhave it, without changing anything--mine or yours--if I buy from you in \nTexas, and you send me that gun, it has to go by law through a licensed \ndealer for me to go get a background check to pick it up. We have not \nchanged that, sir. All we do is say if you buy in State or out of State \nthey are treated the same.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Well, except the bill also applies to any advertising. It \nis not limited to the Internet. I would apply to a listing on \nCraigslist, to a listing in the local newspaper. If an individual \nwanted to sell his or her firearm and advertised in any way, they would \npotentially be guilty of a felony for not going through the Federal \nbackground check.\n  What I would suggest--and I want to be respectful of my time because \nI think I am nearing the conclusion of it--what I would suggest is all \nof us want to stop violent crime. In drafting this substitute, what a \nnumber of Senators endeavored to do is look at the most effective \nproposals to do exactly that: to stop violent crime. My view is, if you \nhave a violent criminal, we should come down on them like a ton of \nbricks. But at the same time we should be especially careful to \nsafeguard the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens.\n  The Second Amendment is a critical part of the Bill of Rights, and \neach of us has taken an oath to defend the Constitution--an oath that I \nknow every Senator takes quite seriously.\n  I would suggest there is no evidence to support the claim that \nregulating millions of law-abiding citizens, who do not currently pose \na threat, would be remotely effective to stop violent crime. What it \nwould do is increase the pressure substantially for a national gun \nregistry.\n  I would suggest, instead, the contrast between this substitute and \nthe Democratic bill is striking. The Democratic bill includes no \nadditional resources for prosecution at all. It does not focus on \nprosecuting criminals. I would suggest that omission is quite striking.\n  It is my hope that--we are going to have a vote on background checks; \nthis body will decide its view in terms of whether to expand those to \nprivate citizens--but I am hopeful that after\n\n[[Page S2736]]\n\nthat vote, when this substitute is considered, we will see some \nsignificant bipartisan agreement that says let's provide the resources \nto the men and women of law enforcement to go after violent criminals, \nto go after and to incapacitate those with serious mental illness. \nLet's do everything we can to stop violent crime and protect the most \nvulnerable among us.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Will the Senator yield for one quick moment?\n  If I may ask the Senator, would he agree that a bill or an amendment \nshould be posted for 48 hours prior to voting?\n  Mr. CRUZ. Is the Senator suggesting that the Senate should move these \nvotes?\n  Mr. MANCHIN. No, no. I am saying, does the Senator believe we should \nhave 48-hour postings?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I think that is ordinarily the right process to follow. In \nthis case, this bill, this substitute took considerable time and was \nthe result of extended negotiation among a great many Senators. And I \nknow my friend from West Virginia has gone through those extended \nnegotiations before and surely will again. This was filed as soon as \nthere was agreement that brought people together in an area that is my \nhope we should be able to find consensus. We should be able to find \nconsensus on targeting violent criminals. That is what this bill \nendeavors to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  First, I want to thank my colleague from Texas for his courtesy.\n  I wish to address two issues here: first, the bill that my good \nfriend from West Virginia and my friend from Pennsylvania have worked \non long and hard, that Senator Kirk and I are sponsors of as well; and, \nsecond, concealed carry.\n  I have always said that background checks are the sweet spot of this \ndebate--the sweet spot because it will do the most good and has the \nbest chance of passing. If this is the sweet spot, we should take \nadvantage of it. Let us step to the plate and not make this a sour day \nfor those in Newtown, for those whose families have been victims of gun \nviolence, and for all Americans.\n  The bottom line is simple: The Brady law was passed in 1994. The NICS \nsystem came into effect in 1999. And the very system of background \nchecks that we are proposing has stopped 1.7 million transactions of \nguns being sold to felons. It is certain that tens of thousands of \npeople are walking God's green Earth because of the background checks \nrequired in the Brady law. But those who have criminal intent and wish \nto get guns, even though they would not be allowed to under Brady, find \nways around it, and they have. The two leading ways around it are the \ngun shows and sales on the Internet.\n  This amendment is very simple. All it does is take the same method of \nbackground checks and the same method of recording those checks that we \nuse now when you walk into a gun shop and apply it to gun shows and to \nsales on the Internet--no more, no less.\n  I have not seen any cry from the other side of the aisle to repeal \nthe background checks mandated under the Brady law. I have not seen any \ncry saying, they do not work. We have simply seen that they do not \ncover 40 percent, approximately, of gun sales. The bill I originally \nintroduced I guess is the gold standard. It covered them all. But in an \neffort to compromise, Senators Manchin and Toomey, with considerable \ncourage, worked with us and now individual sales are not covered. But \nthe sales on the Internet and sales at gun shows are.\n  I say to some of my colleagues who have been allies in the pro-gun \ncontrol movement: Do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. This \nis a strong, good bill. I say to my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, the only objection--the only objection we have heard to this \nbill, this proposal of Senators Manchin, Toomey, Kirk, and myself--is \nthat it will lead to registration.\n  Well, then let me ask or let me refer to my colloquy with the Senator \nfrom Texas. Has there been a single step toward registration as this \nsystem has been in place since 1999, 14 years? Not one. So why is it \nall of a sudden that if we extend these to gun shows and Internet \nsales, registration will come down upon us like a plague within a \nmatter of months? The argument, and it is the only argument made \nagainst background checks, that this will cause registration to occur, \nis a canard, plain and simply, an excuse. Because the opponents cannot \nargue against the substance, they come up with this fearmongering \ntactic that this will lead to registration. There is not one jot of \nevidence that the existing law, the same as the new law we are \nproposing, has led to that.\n  I would urge my colleagues to step to the plate. Pass this amendment. \nI understand the views on the assault weapons ban, which I so strongly \nsupport, and the limitation on clips, which I so believe in. They may \nnot get a number of votes. But this one is close. This one is close. In \nmy judgment, this one will save more lives than any other. Let us show \nthe courage, let us show the wisdom, let us show the conviction that \ndoing the right thing is the right political thing, and move it.\n  One more point. The arguments of reciprocal conceal carry would do \ndevastation to the urban areas of New York. To treat the forests of \nWyoming like Times Square or Yankee Stadium would be wrong. I would \nurge we reject that as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak about the \nissue before us, gun violence and the Second Amendment to the \nConstitution. We have all been enormously saddened by the recent \nsenseless acts of violence that have affected our Nation. In Congress, \nwe have all been deeply moved, and we are all motivated by the \ntragedies.\n  However, unfortunately, the legislation currently before the Senate \nwould do virtually nothing to address the causes of this violence. This \nlegislation, in my judgment, would take us down what I would regard as \na dangerous path. Rather than focusing on the underlying causes of gun \nviolence, this legislation would place onerous restrictions on law-\nabiding Americans, who have a right and are exercising their Second \nAmendment rights.\n  It should trouble us that the first response to recent tragedies is \nto curtail the Bill of Rights. These rights were so incredibly vital to \nthe birth of this great Nation. The Founders specifically limited the \npower of the government to restrict these rights. But this legislation, \nin my judgment, goes beyond and pushes beyond those constitutional \nlimits. The bill before us would have a number of adverse effects.\n  For example, it would prevent a Nebraskan from using a neighbor's \nshotgun to go trap shooting on a nearby farm or an uncle from giving a \nniece a hunting rifle as a birthday gift without receiving FBI \napproval. As my colleague from Iowa has pointed out, the Deputy \nDirector of the National Institute of Justice has written that \nuniversal background checks can only be enforced if coupled with \nnational gun registration.\n  This legislation--I agree with the Senator from Texas--would be a \nfirst step on the path toward a national gun registry, a far cry from \nthe vision of our Founders, who exercised this very fundamental right \nto secure our freedom.\n  The fact is, had this legislation been law, it would not have \nprevented any of the recent atrocities that have affected families in \nour Nation.\n  We will also have the opportunity to vote on a series of amendments. \nOne such amendment we will consider is the so-called assault weapons \nban, which would prohibit law-abiding citizens from possessing certain \nfirearms based upon cosmetic characteristics. Once again, this ban \nwould do little to prevent future gun violence.\n  Furthermore, I find it so incredibly ironic that its proponents think \nthese weapons are a problem in the hands of law-abiding citizens but \napparently see no problem with the same weapons being glorified in \nHollywood movies and video games. Apparently we should ban these \ndevices in rural Nebraska where we grow up around firearms but allow \nour children to idolize Hollywood\n\n[[Page S2737]]\n\nstars committing mass shootings on the big screen and then try it out \nfor yourself in a graphic video game where the game is interactive, \nviolent, and you are literally shooting at people.\n  At the end of the day, this legislation is so incredibly flawed that \nno amount of tweaks or changes can ever possibly improve it. That is \nwhy I am a cosponsor of the alternative of the Senator from Iowa, a \ncomplete substitute which seeks to address the root causes of gun \nviolence and correctly balances the need to secure our Second Amendment \nrights.\n  This amendment focuses on adequate enforcement of the gun laws \ncurrently on the books, as well as the mental health needs of our \ncountry. We owe it to the victims of gun violence to pass legislation \nthat will actually address the causes of these tragedies; otherwise, it \nwill not stop. As Senators who took an oath to uphold the Constitution, \nwe owe to it all Americans to protect this fundamental right, this \nright contained in the Bill of Rights that is so vital to the very \nfreedom we enjoy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise to address this issue for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, first, let me mention I am a gun owner. I \nhave an A rating with the NRA. The Second Amendment is extremely \nimportant to me, my constituents, Pennsylvanians generally, to \nAmericans generally.\n  Let me be very clear about this too. The Second Amendment does not \napply equally to every single American. That is not even a \ncontroversial notion. The Second Amendment was never meant to apply to \nyoung children. Nobody disputes that. The Second Amendment does not \napply to people who forfeit their Second Amendment rights by committing \ncrimes for which they are convicted. It cannot apply and does not apply \nto people who have been adjudicated as mentally dangerous. These are \nthe three classes of Americans for whom the Second Amendment does not \napply, as it does and should and must for everyone else.\n  So the goal Senator Manchin and Senator Schumer and Senator Kirk and \nI set out on when we began this process--I want to thank my friend from \nWest Virginia. He has worked harder than anybody on this. Senator \nSchumer has worked very hard as well; Senator Kirk, who from the \nbeginning provided very important leadership on this. The goal was to \nsee if we could find a way to make it a little bit more difficult for \nthe people who have no legal right to have a gun to obtain one. That \nwas the goal. Along the way, we thought that if we can find some ways \nto better secure the opportunities for law-abiding citizens to exercise \ntheir Second Amendment rights, that would be terrific to work into \nthis. We did that as well.\n  How do we attempt to make it a little bit more difficult for \ncriminals and the dangerously mentally ill to purchase handguns? We do \nit actually in two ways. One is to strengthen the existing background \ncheck system. By strengthening, what I mean is encouraging States to \nprovide the information they already have, and that some do provide but \nsome do not. In other words, the States have records about people who \nhave been adjudicated as dangerously mentally ill, for instance, those \npeople who plead not guilty to a crime by reason of insanity, those \npeople who are deemed to be mentally incompetent to stand trial. We \nhave records at the States of people who have been adjudicated as \nmentally unfit to have a firearm.\n  Then, of course, it is States that have the criminal records. So all \nwe are doing is encouraging these States to provide this information so \nthat when a criminal attempts to buy a handgun or a long gun or when \nsomeone who is dangerously mentally ill attempts to do so, the \nbackground check system can capture them.\n  That is the first big piece. It does not create a new system. It does \nnot expand in any way the existing system except to encourage States to \nprovide the information they already have.\n  The second thing we do is we ask to have a background check at gun \nshows. We already have background checks if you buy from a licensed \ndealer. In my State of Pennsylvania, anyone who buys a handgun anywhere \nat any time has a background check. What this would do in Pennsylvania \nis it would extend background checks for commercial sales which are \nconducted at gun shows, and for advertised sales over the Internet.\n  I have got to tell you, there is absolutely no way that this can be \nconstrued as an infringement on Second Amendment rights. You do not \nhave to take my word for this. But I would take Justice Scalia's word \nfor this, in the Heller decision, where he quite rightly came to the \nconclusion, as did a majority of the Supreme Court, a conservative \nmajority came to the correct conclusion in my view that the Second \nAmendment is an individual right. It is not contingent on membership in \na militia, it is not a collective right of multiple people. The \nFounders did not acknowledge collective rights. It is an individual, \npersonal right. They were correct.\n  But in that decision, Justice Scalia also observed there is nothing \nunconstitutional about legislation that would limit or restrict and try \nto prevent the purchase of firearms by people who do not enjoy this \nright. So that is what we do.\n  I know there has been a great deal of concern about a registry. No \none would oppose a Federal registry of firearms more than I. There is \nno need for the government to have one. Only bad things could result. \nFortunately, Senator Manchin and I are completely in agreement on this. \nSo while it is already illegal, we further strengthen the prohibition \nagainst that by stating in our amendment that any Federal employee, not \njust those who are members of the ATF but any Federal employee who even \nbegins the process of compiling the data that could lead to a registry \nwould be committing a felony subject to 15 years imprisonment.\n  That is a pretty tough reality, that anyone thinking--even thinking \nabout doing this, I think would weigh very seriously, and thereby, I \nbelieve strongly, we preclude the possibility, the danger of an \ninappropriate registry.\n  Finally, I mentioned we enhance the opportunity for law-abiding \ncitizens to enjoy their Second Amendment rights. We do it in a variety \nof ways.\n  One is we clear up some risks people take, law-abiding citizens who \nare traveling across multiple States, such as a sportsman who packs a \nweapon quite properly but who is traveling into a State which has a \ndifferent regime. We clarify that person is not committing any crimes \nor violating any laws.\n  We allow the purchase of handguns out of State. They are subject to \nbackground checks. Why not?\n  Current law prohibits Active-Duty military personnel from buying a \nweapon in their home States. We repeal that as well.\n  A similar measure to this--without the benefits to Second Amendment \nsupporters and expansion of background checks--was on the House floor \nin 1999. That bill was endorsed by the NRA. I voted for it and a \nmajority of Americans voted for it. We did so because it was common \nsense. This isn't gun control, this is common sense. This is a modest \nmeasure to increase the chances of keeping guns out of the hands of \npeople who have no legal right to have a gun.\n  We are going to have a close vote today. I wish to thank all of my \ncolleagues who considered this and have given us every opportunity to \nmake our case. I wish to again thank Senators Manchin, Schumer, and \nKirk for the very hard work they have done.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Manchin-Toomey amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President our thoughts and prayers are with the \nvictims and their families of yesterday's cowardly attack. I appreciate \nthe updates I have received from the FBI about the matter and await the \noutcome of their investigation. The President is right to emphasize \nthat Americans will not be terrorized.\n  In the aftermath of the explosions in Boston we were reminded once \nagain how Americans come to each other's aid in a crisis. We witnessed \ncitizens and first responders selflessly helping others. Just as first \nresponders in Newtown responded in minutes and went headlong into a \nsituation without knowing what they would encounter, in Boston we saw \nsimilar heroism.\n\n[[Page S2738]]\n\nFirst responders risk their lives to protect the public. That is what \nthey do over and over again across the country. I believe that as a \nresult of the bravery and speedy response of first responders in \nConnecticut, lives may have been saved on December 14. And we remember \ntoday that 6 years ago the Nation was stunned by the rampage at \nVirginia Tech.\n  Our law enforcement officials deserve our respect and support. Law \nenforcement officers and first responders risk their lives to protect \nthe public. That is why I find it so disappointing to hear some blame \nlaw enforcement for not preventing these tragedies.\n  The legislation before the Senate today to improve the Nation's \nbackground checks system and prosecute gun trafficking would \nsignificantly assist law enforcement in their efforts to keep the \npublic safe. I spoke yesterday about the pending amendment, the \nbipartisan Manchin-Toomey amendment to close the gun show and other \nloopholes in the background check system while respecting and \nprotecting the Second Amendment rights of responsible gun owners. The \nSenate has had this amendment before it since last Thursday. I trust \nthe Senate will vote on it today, and I hope the Senate will adopt it.\n  We have had background checks for decades. These checks are an \naccepted part of the process of buying a gun. Like millions of other \nresponsible gun owners, I understand that this check is necessary to \nhelp keep guns out of the hands of criminals and those who are \ndangerous to themselves and others due to mental illness.\n  Since 1998, more than 2 million sales to prohibited people have been \nprevented thanks to background checks. That is 2 million times a \npotentially dangerous person trying to get a gun was denied a gun. Is \nthat a good thing, a positive thing, in the interest of safer \ncommunities? Of course it is. Who can credibly argue otherwise?\n  What we are now trying to do is improve the background check system. \nWe all know there is a huge loophole in our background check system. \nCriminals and others prohibited from buying guns at gun stores can get \naround the background check requirement by going to gun shows. I know \ngun store owners in Vermont. They follow the law and conduct background \nchecks. They wonder why others who sell guns do not have to follow \nthese same rules. I agree with these responsible business owners. This \nloophole needs to be closed.\n  The Manchin-Toomey bipartisan amendment closes the loophole in a way \nthat does not infringe upon Second Amendment rights. Sales at gun shows \nand sales using online or print advertising will now be governed by the \nsame requirements as gun stores in Vermont and elsewhere. This will \nmake us safer. It is focused on gun shows and commercial sales, not \nfamily gifts or transfers between friends and neighbors. The bill does \nnot require background checks for temporary transfers of guns for \nhunting or target shooting. Instead, the bill requires background \nchecks for the kind of sales that can be easily exploited by people who \nintend to do harm.\n  Why would we not try to plug the loopholes in the law that allow \ndangerous criminals to buy guns without background checks? This is a \nsimple matter of common sense. The NRA testified in 1999 in favor of \nmandatory criminal background checks for ``every sale at every gun \nshow.''\n  This is about plugging loopholes in background checks. No court has \nheld that background checks, which have been with us for decades, \nviolate the Second Amendment. Indeed, when the U.S. Supreme Court \nexpressly held that the Second Amendment provide an individual right in \nthe Heller case, it also said that ``longstanding prohibitions on the \npossession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill'' do not violate \nthe Second Amendment. No one should oppose this amendment on Second \nAmendments grounds because it does not undermine the Second Amendment.\n  Some have expressed frustration about the level of prosecutions under \nexisting gun laws, and some have suggested that instead of making \nsensible changes to our public safety laws to prevent gun violence, \nFederal law enforcement officials should focus exclusively on existing \nlaws. I share some of that frustration, but I do not agree it is a \nvalid excuse for Congress to do nothing. Improvements in the \nenforcement of existing laws and efforts to give law enforcement \nofficials better tools to do their jobs are not mutually exclusive, \nthose efforts complement each other.\n  I have noted that Americans are looking to us for solutions and for \naction, not filibustering or sloganeering. This is something we can \ncome together to accomplish. No one can or will take our Second \nAmendment rights or our guns away. They are not at risk. But lives are \nat risk when responsible people fail to stand up for laws that will \nkeep guns out of the hands of those who will use them to commit crimes \nof violence. This is something we can come together and do to make \nAmerica safer and more secure.\n  I have also been encouraging the Senator from West Virginia in his \nefforts. He has shown great leadership, sensitivity, and perseverance. \nI commend Senator Toomey for his willingness to join in this \nlegislative effort. Together, they have done the Senate and the country \na great service.\n  Improving the background check system is a matter of common sense. \nSenators Manchin and Toomey have shown that it can be accomplished in a \nway that better protects our communities and fully respects our Second \nAmendment rights. I am pleased to support this bipartisan solution.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 714\n\n  Several opponents to the gun violence measure pending have tried to \njustify their opposition to legislation designed to keep guns out of \nthe hands of criminals by claiming that these measures would not have \nprevented the tragedy in Newtown or any other mass killings. I think \nthat argument makes no sense.\n  We should be responding to protect our communities with a broad \napproach to help law enforcement go after gun traffickers and straw \npurchasers who arm drug cartels and plug loopholes in our background \ncheck system.\n  In addition to those important steps, the pending amendment to limit \nammunition clip size directly addresses some of our most recent gun \nviolence tragedies. It is clear that several victims of gun violence \nwould be alive today if the gunman had been required to pause \nmomentarily to change his ammunition clip. When I decided to call for \nhearings on gun violence before the first Judiciary Committee several \nmonths ago, I wanted the public to hear directly from victims of gun \nviolence. We began our first of three hearings with former \nCongresswoman Gabby Giffords. She called on us to act in the wake of \ntoo many American tragedies and her battle to recover from gun violence \nis an inspiration to all of us fighting for legislation today.\n  At that same hearing, her husband, CAPT Mark Kelly, testified about \nthe day his wife was gunned down. He said:\n\n       The shooter in Tucson showed up with two 33-round \n     magazines, one of which was in his 9 millimeter. He unloaded \n     the contents of that magazine in 15 seconds. Very quickly. It \n     all happened very, very fast. The first bullet went into \n     Gabby's head. Bullet number 13 went into a 9-year-old girl \n     named Christina-Taylor Green, who was very interested in \n     democracy and our Government and really deserved a full life \n     committed to advancing those ideas. If he had a 10-round \n     magazine--well, let me back up. When he tried to reload one \n     33-round magazine with another 33-round magazine, he dropped \n     it. And a woman named Patricia Maisch grabbed it, and it gave \n     bystanders a time to tackle him. I contend if that same thing \n     happened when he was trying to reload one 10-round magazine \n     with another 10-round magazine, meaning he did not have \n     access to a high-capacity magazine, and the same thing \n     happened, Christina-Taylor Green would be alive today.\n\n  That was a direct quote from CAPT Mark Kelly's testimony. It is \nchilling to think that something we could pass today could save the \nnext Christina-Taylor Green.\n  The Judiciary Committee also heard from Neil Heslin, whose son was \nmurdered at Sandy Hook. He testified in support of limiting high-\ncapacity magazines. We cannot forget his son Jesse or the 19 other \nprecious children who were gunned down in December or the brave \neducators who sacrificed their lives trying to protect children.\n  A reasonable limit on the size of ammunition clips is a modest step \ngoing forward. This amendment would not apply retroactively. No lawful \ngun owner will have to turn over anything.\n  It is a cruel irony that in some States we are more protective of the\n\n[[Page S2739]]\n\ndeer being hunted than our children. In Vermont, we have very few laws \naffecting the right to bear arms, but we do limit the ammunition clips \nused in hunting. It is not a threat to the Second Amendment to limit \nclip size in hunting, so why is it a threat to limit them when the \npotential targets are people? The reality is that the Second Amendment \nis not under threat, but our children are.\n  I am a responsible gun owner. I have owned and shot weapons with many \ndifferent styles of ammunition clips, so I understand the issue we are \nconsidering. Requiring a gun owner to change clips more often is not \ntoo much to ask when we see the human costs of high-capacity magazines \nin mass shootings. The law enforcement organizations that work on the \nfrontlines in our cities and towns support this amendment. The grieving \nfamilies are right to raise this issue because even if we save one or \ntwo lives with this change, it is worth it.\n  Just as I said in 1993 when I voted for the Feinstein-DeConcini bill, \nthis amendment is not going to solve all violent crime, but it will \nmake people safer. I believe that limiting the size of ammunition clips \ngoing forward could save lives in the next mass shooting. I do not want \nto wonder if we could have done more when another son or daughter is \nkilled. I will support this amendment. It is the right thing to do for \npublic safety and to honor the young lives lost in Newtown, in Aurora, \nand in Tucson.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of commonsense \nlegislation to address the epidemic of gun violence in America.\n  In the aftermath of the Newtown tragedy, Americans across the country \nbegan a solemn discussion about gun violence, and an emerging consensus \nhas formed around several much-needed reforms.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee heard compelling testimony in support \nof these measures, we debated them, and we reported them to the full \nSenate. It is time now for the Senate to debate and pass this \nlegislation. We can achieve greater safety in our schools, movie \ntheaters, churches, and malls, and on our city streets, without \ninfringing on anyone's constitutional right to bear arms.\n  A large majority of the public wants to keep dangerous weapons off \nthe streets and out of the hands of criminals.\n  The legislation that we are voting on includes several important \nprovisions. First, it would close loopholes that allow millions of gun \npurchasers each year to evade the background check system without \nscrutiny. Under current law, a convicted felon, a drug addict, a \ndomestic abuser, or someone who has been determined by a court to be \ndangerously mentally ill, can easily evade background checks by \npurchasing firearms at a gun show or online.\n  The American people understand that allowing so many gun purchasers \nto evade background check laws does not make sense: Universal \nbackground checks are supported by over 90 percent of the public. As \nPresident Obama has said, ``How often do 90 percent of Americans agree \non anything?''\n  Second, to stop people from subverting existing gun laws, this \nlegislation clearly outlaws straw purchases, where an individual buys a \nfirearm for someone who cannot legally buy one. It also clarifies and \nexpands existing trafficking laws to give our law enforcement officials \nthe tools they need to combat gun violence.\n  Third, the legislation includes a commonsense grant program to \nimprove school and campus safety. No parent should have to worry, when \nthey walk their son to the bus stop, or drop their daughter off at her \ndorm, whether they are safe. I hope we can all agree on the importance \nof protecting our children.\n  We will also be considering an assault weapons ban as an amendment. \nThis proposal, which I cosponsor, helps restrict the sort of military-\nstyle assault weapons that have no place in a civilian setting.\n  I know that in the politics of this issue, the assault weapons ban \nhas uphill sledding. But I would certainly hope we can agree on a ban \non high-capacity magazines. The full assault weapons ban has the \nsupport of the majority of Americans; the ban on high-capacity \nmagazines has even more overwhelming support from the public. In recent \npolling, 65 percent of Americans said that they support a ban on high-\ncapacity magazines.\n  It is no wonder that the public overwhelmingly supports this ban. As \nwe heard in testimony before the Judiciary Committee and in other \nvenues, in almost every mass shooting in the past few years, high-\ncapacity magazines led to additional deaths and injuries.\n  John Walsh, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Colorado, testified \nthat in Aurora the shooter used a hundred-round drum and was able to \nmurder 12 people and injure 58 in a matter of 90 seconds. The carnage \nonly stopped when that ultra-large feeding device jammed.\n  Captain Mark Kelly testified that in Tucson, the shooter had a 33 \nround magazine and was able to kill 6 people and injure 12 in a matter \nof 15 seconds. He was only overwhelmed when he eventually had to change \nmagazines. Nine-year-old Christina-Taylor Green was killed by the \nthirteenth bullet from that magazine. That little girl might well be \nalive today if her murderer had to stop to reload after 10 rounds.\n  We have heard no reasonable justification for why any civilian needs \nthese deadly devices. They are not appropriate for hunting. A number of \nlaws already restrict the number of rounds per magazine for hunting, \nand most sportsmen would not want to hunt with high-capacity magazines.\n  These magazines also are not necessary or appropriate for self-\ndefense. Opponents of this legislation talk about the need for high-\ncapacity magazines and assault weapons in nightmare scenarios: society \nbreaking down following a terrorist attack, or natural disaster; or \ngangs of armed intruders breaking into homes.\n  But there is no evidence that anyone has been made safer by having \naccess to these magazines, and law enforcement officials and experts \nhave repeatedly pointed to the dangers of keeping them in the home. \nEven some gun clubs ban their use on the range, because they are so \ndangerous.\n  I have also cosponsored an amendment to close the so-called ``terror \ngap.'' Believe it or not, under the existing law, someone on a \nterrorist watch list would not be allowed to board an airplane, but \nthere is nothing stopping him or her from buying a gun. This loophole \nis ridiculous and dangerous, and we should close it immediately.\n  These proposals are reasonable measures that would make our \ncommunities safer from gun violence. I urge the Senate to pass them.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 715\n\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form prior to the vote \non amendment No. 715, offered by Mr. Manchin.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. If you are committed to protecting Second Amendment \nrights, as I am, as well as the great citizens of this country, vote \nfor this bill. If you desire for all of our veterans to be treated with \ndignity and due process when they return from battle, vote for this \nbill. If you wish to keep criminals and dangerously mentally ill people \nfrom purchasing guns at gun shows and on the Internet, you should vote \nfor this bill.\n  To always remember those 20 babies, beautiful children, the six brave \nteachers, and to honor the most courageous family members I have ever \nmet in my life, please vote for this bill.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I strongly oppose this amendment.\n  Expanded background checks would not have prevented Newtown. \nCriminals do not submit to background checks now; they will not submit \nto expanded background checks.\n  The Deputy Director of the National Institute of Justice has written \nbackground checks will work only if they are universal and are combined \nwith gun registration.\n  This amendment would start us down the road to registration. It would \nopen, not close, loopholes.\n  It would require background checks when people advertise a gun for \nsale in their church bulletins or Farm Bureau newsletter. It subjects \npeople to Federal criminal liability up to 5 years for violations of \nState or local law, which is unprecedented.\n\n[[Page S2740]]\n\n  The pro-gun provisions would actually reduce existing protections for \nlaw-abiding gun owners.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this dangerous and misguided approach.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. TOOMEY.

The motion is entered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 725\n\n  There is now 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in \nrelation to amendment No. 725, offered by the Senator from Iowa, Mr. \nGrassley.\n  Who yields time?\n  (Disturbance in Visitor's Gallery.)\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. There will be order in the Senate. The gallery \nwill refrain from any demonstration or comment.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the Grassley-\nCruz substitute.\n  Now that the previous vote has been taken, I would suggest this is a \nbill we all should be able to support. This is a bill that provides \nmajor resources to prosecuting violent criminals, to going after \nfelons, to going after fugitives, to preventing them from getting guns. \nIt provides resources for school safety. It provides additional \nresources to improve the background check system and to encourage \nStates to provide more records on mental health illness.\n  This is a strong law enforcement bill. I know everyone in this body, \nregardless of party, wants to act decisively to stop violent crime, and \nit would be a shame if this amendment is subject to a partisan vote \nwhich would result in inaction rather than our standing together to put \nlaw enforcement resources toward stopping violent crime.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the argument we just heard is absolutely \nupside-down of what that amendment is. This amendment guts the bill, it \nguts the straw purchasing provisions, it guts the gun trafficking \nprovisions. It totally undermines law enforcement.\n  Law enforcement strongly supports the next amendment we have--the \nLeahy-Collins--but all this does, this substitute amendment, is aid \nMexican drug cartels, eliminates the tools being used to get law \nenforcement investigatory leads. It undermines rather than strengthens \nthe current background check.\n  We talk about do we enforce our laws. If you want to gut our laws, \nwhich this one does, don't argue they are not being enforced. This \nhandcuffs law enforcement, helps drug cartels, helps drug syndicates. \nIt is a bad amendment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown).

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 713, offered by the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Senator Collins and I, as well as other \nSenators in both parties, worked with law enforcement, worked with the \nNRA, worked with a whole lot of others to craft this amendment. It \ngives law enforcement officials the tools they need to stop the all-\ntoo-common practices of straw purchasing and illegal trafficking of \nfirearms. This gives us the tools to go after drug cartels that use \nstraw purchasers to get their guns and gangs in big cities that use \nstraw purchasers to get their guns.\n  It is an important law enforcement measure. Across the political \nspectrum, law enforcement supports it. Let's stand with law enforcement \nand vote aye.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise to speak against this amendment. It \nis worthwhile to strengthen the protections against straw purchasing \nand trafficking, but unfortunately this language, in my judgment, is \noverbroad and in particular has a real risk of criminalizing innocent \nconduct. For example, if your father asks you to purchase a firearm for \nhim and your father pays you, under this bill both you and your father \nbecome felons because it bans any purchase for another person if that \nindividual pays for it. In my judgment, that is overbroad, and that is \nthe reason why in the prior amendment we changed the language to target \nbad actors and to exclude innocent conduct, to avoid ensnaring those \nlaw-abiding citizens with no ill will and inadvertently making law-\nabiding gun owners into felons.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment.\n\n[[Page S2741]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay the motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 719\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 719 offered by the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. My amendment is called the Constitutional Concealed Carry \nAct because it is designed to protect the fundamental Second Amendment \nrights of American citizens who are traveling or temporarily away from \nhome while they hold a concealed handgun license.\n  There is only one State and the District of Columbia that do not \nrecognize some form of concealed gun carry law. In other words, it is \npart of the public policy of 49 States that concealed handgun licenses \nmay be obtained by lawful owners.\n  Our amendment would allow persons with concealed handgun permits be \nallowed to carry those weapons as they travel between jurisdictions and \navoid any sort of prosecution. This does not create a national \nstandard. It does not apply to jurisdictions that don't otherwise \nrecognize the right to the conceal carry law. In effect, it would act \nlike a driver's license so the gun owner doesn't have to get a separate \nlicense in each State they travel through. For those who believe \nbackground checks are important, this is a background check on \nsteroids.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. This amendment would wreak havoc in large portions of \nAmerica--suburban and urban areas. The bottom line is very simple: In \nWyoming maybe the conceal carry law works. Every police officer in \nAmerica, all of them, will say that the conceal carry law would be a \ndisaster in Times Square, the L.A. Coliseum, or in the Dallas, TX, \nstadium. It would be a disgrace. Police officers would not know who is \ncarrying and who is not carrying a weapon. Because there are no \nresidency requirements, criminals from our States could go to States \nsuch as Florida, get a conceal carry permit, and criminals and felons \ncould legally conceal and carry weapons in other States.\n  We hear a lot of talk about States rights. This is a classic States \nrights vote. Let Wyoming do what it wants to do with conceal carry, but \ndon't impose that on New York and vice versa.\n  I strongly, strongly urge that this amendment--which takes one way of \nlife in America and imposes it on all ways of life--be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have watched these votes and I must \nsay I view them with substantial dismay at the lack of courage in this \nChamber--courage to stand and say: We have had enough of these \nkillings. We have had enough of the development of highly militarized \nweapons--easy to shoot, big clips, 100-plus bullets in each, large \nvelocity guns--falling into the hands of grievous killers, juveniles, \npeople who are mentally disturbed. There will be no background checks, \napparently, and we have a proliferation of these weapons.\n  I have a hard time understanding it. We are here on 6-year terms for \na reason: to take votes on difficult issues. Everything needs 60 votes \ntoday. This is supposed to be a majority body. We have crafted an \nassault weapons bill to truly represent the people of America. Every \nsingle poll has shown support for this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Let me conclude by saying this: I know how this is \ngoing to end, and the despair and the dismay of families standing out \nthere whose safety we need to protect, and we don't do it--I am very \nchagrined and concerned. If anybody cares, vote at least to \nprospectively ban the manufacture, the sale, the importation of \nmilitary-style assault weapons. Show some guts. Thank you.\n\n[[Page S2742]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I strongly oppose this amendment. This \nwould result in the largest ban of guns in the history of our Republic.\n  Three studies that the Justice Department sponsored during the \nprevious ban found no evidence it was effective in reducing multiple \nvictim shootings or wounds per victim. It did not stop Columbine. It \nwould not stop Newtown. The ban does not apply to existing weapons such \nas those used at Newtown, and criminals who would steal such guns would \nnot care the least if they were banned.\n  We never received an opinion from the Justice Department that such a \nban would satisfy the Second Amendment. I surmise they are not able to \nconclude it is constitutional. A ban on guns based on their looks when \nmore powerful guns are exempt would not satisfy any standard of review. \nThese guns are commonly used, in the words of the Supreme Court, for \nself-defense. They cannot be constitutionally banned.\n  This is a slippery slope of compromising the Second Amendment, and if \nwe go down that road, we are going to find it easier to compromise \nother things in the Bill of Rights.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there is now 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 720, offered by the Senator from North Carolina, Mr. \nBurr.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I am going to be brief because I do want \nmy colleagues to listen. This is an important amendment.\n  Today, the VA determination is that if a veteran cannot handle their \nown finances, then their name is referred to the FBI and they are put \non the NICS list. Today, 129,000 veterans are on the NICS list. Yes, \nthere is an appellate process to get off, but the VA provides no help \nto the veteran. The cost is all incurred by the veteran. Only 200 \nveterans have applied for that reversal in the decision, and only 6 \nhave been granted. They should never be put on it. A determination that \nthey cannot handle their own finances is not a determination that they \nare a threat to themselves or to the public.\n  This bill is very simple. It says that if the VA makes a \ndetermination, there has to be a judicial decision to put them on NICS \nlists. That is the standard everywhere else in the Federal Government.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this very important piece of \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, when we began this debate, we talked \nabout strengthening the NICS system, we talked about how people who \nhave mental illness should be added to the list so they might not get \nguns. And here, in one amendment, in one fell swoop, we will take \n165,000 people off that list.\n  Does my colleague, my dear friend from North Carolina, believe every \nsingle one of those people should be allowed to carry a gun? Of course \nnot. If there are injustices to some of those folks, then let's have a \nsystem that deals with it. But you do not--you do not--in one fell \nswoop take 165,000 people, all of whom have some degree of \nincompetence, off the list.\n  It is unbelievable that at a time when we are supposed to be \nstrengthening the NICS system with people who are adjudicated or judged \notherwise mentally ill, we are considering tonight taking a giant step \nbackward and reducing the list. What is America going to think is going \non in this body?\n  I strongly urge a ``no'' vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask that my colleagues also listen to the families, to \nNicole Hockley, whose son, Dylan Hockley, was killed by a man who used \na high-capacity magazine. She said of the man who killed her son, he \nleft the smaller capacity magazines at home. He knew the larger \ncapacity magazines were more lethal.\n  I ask my colleagues to listen to Bill Sherlach whose wife Mary \nSherlach was killed on December 14.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment. In 2004, we had \na study by the Department of Justice, which is the last time we had the \nlarge-capacity magazine banned. It found no evidence banning such \nmagazines has led to a reduction in gun violence. The study also \nconcluded it is not clear how often the outcomes of the gun attack \ndepend on the ability of offenders to fire more than 10 shots without \nreloading.\n  The report found no evidence more people would be alive if a magazine \nover 10 rounds was banned.\n  Secondly, there is no evidence banning these magazines has reduced \nthe deaths from gun crimes.

Mr. President, at 2:24 a.m. this morning, the Group of \n8 finally unveiled their immigration reform bill. Since they began \ntheir meetings about 4 months ago, I have complimented them on their \ncommitment to reforming our broken immigration system. I have sought \ntheir cooperation to ensure the bill goes through the committee \nprocess, and I have argued the bill must be open to amendment during \nconsideration in committee and on the Senate floor. Every Member of the \nSenate must have an opportunity to read, analyze, and improve the bill.\n  The bill we received is just under 900 pages, and it tackles some \nvery important issues, including measures on border security, E-Verify \nand the entry-exit system. It includes the legalization program for \npeople here unlawfully, including DREAM Act eligible students and \nundocumented workers in the agricultural sector. It attempts to move \nour system to a merit-based and point system. It revises asylum \nprocedures and the court structure governing immigration appeals. It \nincludes reforms to the highly skilled visa program and seasonal worker \nguest worker program. It changes the way we implement the visa waiver \nprogram, and it includes a brandnew, low-skilled temporary worker \nprogram that allows willing workers to enter the country without being \nsponsored by an employer.\n  So you can see there is a lot covered in this bill. There are some \nnew concepts. Yet the majority seems to want us to push this bill \nthrough the committee process and are intent on getting it to the floor \nby June. The sponsor of the bill, the senior Senator from New York, \nsaid he hopes the bill will be done in 8 weeks.\n  On Friday, Secretary Napolitano is scheduled to appear before the \nJudiciary Committee. It is my intent to dig into the details of the \nbill with her to understand the mechanics and how the bureaucracy will \nhandle these changes. The Secretary had better have answers, especially \nsince this may be the only time we hear about how the administration \nwill implement the major overhaul.\n  The committee will then have a hearing on Monday to discuss the bill. \nHowever, the topics will be broad and all encompassing, I have been \ntold. We have experts who need to be heard on this bill. Most \nimportantly, because cost is a big factor around here, we need to hear \nfrom the Congressional Budget Office. Knowing how much this bill costs \ntaxpayers and whether it will actually be budget neutral is a \ncritically important matter.\n  Let me reiterate my desire to work on this bill. I think we need \nchanges to our immigration system and to approve legal avenues for \npeople to enter and remain in the United States, but this is not \nsomething to be rushed. We have to get this right; otherwise, the goal \nof the bipartisan group to solve the problem once and for all will not \nend. We have a long road ahead of us in order to pass this legislation \nto reform our immigration system. We cannot tolerate anything less than \na transparent and deliberative process to improve the bill.\n  So let me get back to the point I made just a few seconds ago. This \nis something that cannot be rushed. We have to get it right. Let me say \nwhy I emphasize that.\n  There are only a few of us in the Senate who voted on the 1986 \nimmigration bill. We thought we did it right. We thought by making it \nillegal, for the first time, for employers to hire undocumented \nworkers--and have a $10,000 fine if they did--would take away the \nmagnet that would bring people across the border so readily. Obviously, \nthey come for a better life for themselves, and who can find fault with \npeople who have good spiritual values, good family values, and good \nwork ethics wanting to improve themselves. That is what America is all \nabout. But entering the country illegally is not something a country \nbased upon the rule of law can tolerate.\n  Anyway, we made it illegal in 1986, and then added that fine. We \ndidn't anticipate a whole industry of fraudulent documents, so that if \nsomeone goes to an employer and says they are here lawfully and shows \nthem a passport that looks like it is the real thing, the employer \ncannot then be fined $10,000 for hiring them. So we thought we took \naway that magnet at the time and that we might as well legalize the 3 \nmillion people who were here. We did that based on the proposition we \nwere fixing this thing once and for all. But we know what happens when \nwe make it legitimate to violate the rule of law. Instead of 3 million \npeople, there are now 12 million people here in the country \nundocumented.\n  So when I read the preamble of the document put out by the Group of \n8--and I am not finding fault with this--they make it very clear: We \nintend to--and I am paraphrasing it--fix this system once and for all \nso it never has to be revisited.\n  That is exactly what we thought in 1986. Well, we were wrong. So that \nis why I come to the floor tonight to plead, as I did, about a 900-page \nbill that just came out at 2:24 this morning, and presumably the \nSecretary of Homeland Security is coming before our committee in less \nthan 48 hours to answer our questions. I wonder if she can fully \nunderstand it so she can answer our questions.\n  I think it is a legitimate question when the Group of 8 comes up with \na proposition that we are going to fix this thing once and for all. \nWell, I hope they have a pattern to do that, and I hope they don't make \nthe same mistake we did. But rushing this along has a tendency to be an \nenvironment for a screw-up like we had in 1986. We spent weeks and \nweeks on legislation to get it right, and we didn't get it right.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/17/senate-section/article/S2744-3", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2744-S2745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING ANTHONY LEWIS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Today I would like to pay tribute to \nAnthony Lewis who passed away on March 25. As a reporter covering the \nSupreme Court and through his books, including ``Gideon's Trumpet,'' \nMr. Lewis shaped the way millions of Americans understand the role of \nthe judiciary in safeguarding our democracy. He was truly an iconic \nfigure in American journalism and he will be greatly missed.\n  Reading Anthony Lewis changed the way so many of us thought about \njustice in this country. He brought legal decisions to life and made \nclear the impact the law has on our lives. He made us aware of the \nhumanity behind the technical legal arguments. Nowhere did he do this \nbetter than in ``Gideon's\n\n[[Page S2745]]\n\nTrumpet,'' his 1964 book about the Supreme Court decision in Gideon v. \nWainwright. That landmark case affirmed a fundamental principle of our \ndemocratic society: that no person, regardless of economic status, \nshould face prosecution without the assistance of a lawyer.\n  I have spoken countless times over the years about the importance of \nthat decision. And each time, whether it was here on the floor of the \nSenate, in the Judiciary Committee questioning nominees to the Supreme \nCourt, or in conversations with young law students, I have thought \nabout ``Gideon's Trumpet'' and the powerful impact that book had on me.\n  In fact, on the 50th anniversary of the Gideon decision, which was \njust days before Mr. Lewis's death, I introduced the Gideon's Promise \nAct, a bill intended to breathe new life into that seminal case and \nensure the fairness of our criminal justice system for all \nparticipants. Much of what I said about the anniversary of Gideon, and \nthe work that remains, finds its roots in my days as a young attorney \nwhen I read ``Gideon's Trumpet'' and was moved both by the unfairness \nit revealed of a system that allowed poor people to be jailed without a \nlawyer, and the powerful equalizing impact a courageous Supreme Court \ncan have when it is willing to stand up for those who are marginalized.\n  When I was a young law student, my wife and I had an opportunity to \nhave lunch with Justice Hugo Black shortly after he wrote the majority \ndecision in that case. It was a powerful experience. He recognized that \nthe Sixth Amendment's guarantee to counsel in a criminal case was \nfundamental to a fair trial. He called it an obvious truth. And I know \nfrom my days as a prosecutor how right he was.\n  Now, as we pause to remember Anthony Lewis and his contributions to \nour understanding of the right to counsel and so many other fundamental \nprinciples of American democracy, it is also fitting that we \nacknowledge that the promise made in Gideon remains unfulfilled. In too \nmany courtrooms it is better to be rich and guilty than poor and \ninnocent. The rich will have competent counsel, but those who have \nlittle often find their lives placed in the hands of woefully \noverburdened public defenders or underpaid court-appointed lawyers who \nare inexperienced, overworked, inept, uninterested, or worse.\n  And now our Federal public defender system, long held out as the gold \nstandard of indigent defense, is being hobbled by sequestration. In New \nYork, the Federal Defenders Office is being forced to furlough each of \nits 30 lawyers for 5\\1/2\\ weeks by the end of September, resulting in \ndelays in even the most significant terrorism cases. Chief Judge \nLoretta Preska of the Southern District of New York called these cuts \n``devastating.'' The head of the Federal Defenders Office stated: ``On \na good day, we're stretched thin. . . . Sequestration takes us well \nbeyond the breaking point. You simply can't sequester the Sixth \nAmendment.'' He is right.\n  I am hardly alone in my concern over this fundamental American right. \nLast month, four leading advocates for fairness in the criminal justice \nsystem, including former Vice President Walter Mondale, sent a letter \nto President Obama urging him to create a bipartisan commission on the \nfair administration of justice for the indigent accused. I applaud \ntheir efforts and I believe Anthony Lewis would have too.\n  Through his reporting on the Supreme Court and our Nation's civil \nrights challenges, Anthony Lewis opened the eyes of millions of \nAmericans to the power of law and judges to change lives. He helped \nshape my thinking as a young lawyer, and I hope his work will continue \nto be an inspiration for the generations to come. Our democracy will be \nstronger for it.\n  I ask that a copy of an article dated April 8 be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my statement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 8, 2013]\n\n           Citing Cuts, Lawyers Seek Relief in Terrorism Case\n\n                          (By Benjamin Weiser)\n\n       Federal public defenders who are representing a son-in-law \n     of Osama bin Laden on terrorism charges urged a judge on \n     Monday not to hold an early trial because automatic \n     government budget cuts were requiring furloughs of lawyers in \n     their office.\n       The request, which seemed to take the judge, Lewis A. \n     Kaplan, by surprise, follows requests that five or six \n     federal judges in Manhattan have received from public \n     defenders to be relieved from cases in the wake of the \n     automatic cuts, known as sequestration, said Loretta A. \n     Preska, the chief judge of the Federal District Court in \n     Manhattan.\n       ``It's devastating,'' Judge Preska said late Monday. She \n     praised the work of the federal defenders and said their \n     replacement in cases with publicly paid court-appointed \n     lawyers would probably lead to delays and higher costs.\n       Judge Kaplan said in court on Monday that he was \n     considering holding the trial of bin Laden's son-in-law, \n     Sulaiman Abu Ghaith--a onetime Al Qaeda spokesman charged \n     with conspiring to kill Americans--in September. After the \n     defense requested a later date, he said: ``It's extremely \n     troublesome to contemplate the possibility of a case of this \n     nature being delayed because of sequestration. Let me say \n     only that--stunning.''\n       The judge did not set a trial date, saying he would \n     consider the request, but the exchange shows how the forced \n     budget cuts are beginning to have an effect on the \n     administration of justice in federal courts in New York.\n       About 30 trial lawyers with the federal defenders office \n     handle around 2,000 criminal cases a year in federal courts \n     in Manhattan, Brooklyn and other locations, according to \n     David E. Patton, who heads the office.\n       The forced cuts, he said, will mean each lawyer in the \n     office will be furloughed for five and a half weeks through \n     the end of September, when the fiscal year ends.\n       ``On a good day, we're stretched thin,'' Mr. Patton said. \n     ``Sequestration takes us well beyond the breaking point. You \n     simply can't sequester the Sixth Amendment.''\n       ``Investigations have to be conducted,'' Mr. Patton added. \n     ``Evidence must be reviewed. Law must be researched. Those \n     things don't just happen by themselves.''\n       In seeking the delay, lawyers for Mr. Abu Ghaith, who was \n     arraigned in March, cited the need for overseas \n     investigation, the translation of voluminous materials and \n     other issues. ``We would urge the court to find a later \n     date,'' one lawyer, Martin Cohen, said.\n       Judge Preska said that lawyers had been allowed to leave \n     one of the cases in which the furlough problem had been \n     cited; the issue is pending in the others.\n       Newly appointed lawyers would have to ``get up to speed'' \n     on their cases, and because they are paid by the hour \n     (federal defenders are salaried), the public would probably \n     end up paying more, Judge Preska said. ``There's no \n     resolution,'' she said. ``Time is of the essence, and we're \n     very, very concerned.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/17/senate-section/article/S2745-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2745-S2746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          NATIONAL COALITION FOR THE HOMELESS 30TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the National \nCoalition for the Homeless, an outstanding organization of activists, \nadvocates, and community and faith-based service providers working to \nend homelessness in America. This year, the coalition celebrates its \n30th anniversary, marking three decades of triumphs and challenges in \ndefense of our Nation's most vulnerable individuals and families.\n  During the 1970s and 1980s, homelessness was thrust into the national \nspotlight as a growing problem. Structural changes in the economy, \nexacerbated by some tough economic downturns, thrust thousands of men, \nwomen, and children onto the streets, living without shelter. Out of \nconcern for the rights of this vulnerable population, a group of State \nand local homeless coalitions gathered together and established the \nNational Coalition for the Homeless in 1982. In these last 30 years, \nthe National Coalition for the Homeless has been at the forefront of \nthe fight against homelessness. The coalition's advocacy and passion \nhave helped define housing policy for the disenfranchised in America.\n  Through creative initiatives and outspoken advocacy, the coalition \nplayed an instrumental role in passage of the McKinney-Vento Homeless \nAssistance Act, the first comprehensive legislation to address the \nissue of homelessness in our country. Most recently, the coalition has \nspearheaded advocacy for the Hate Crimes Against the Homeless \nStatistics Act, a bill that would include crimes against the homeless \nin the crime data the Department of Justice collects. I was a member of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee during the 111th Congress and I was a \nproud sponsor of this bill. Homeless people are particularly vulnerable \ntargets for acts of humiliation and violence. I believe more needs to \nbe done to protect those who can't protect themselves. I am proud to \nreport Maryland was a pioneer in extending hate crime protections to \nhomeless people.\n  I have been concerned about homelessness for a long time. I believe \nhaving adequate shelter is a human right.\n\n[[Page S2746]]\n\nA home provides safety from the elements and random acts of violence. \nIt is a place where possessions and items as fundamental as medications \ncan be kept safely. Yet, homelessness persists as one of our Nation's \nmost pressing social problems and has grown more challenging in the \nwake of the housing market collapse and the return of veterans from the \nwars in Iraq and Afghanistan. As we continue to recover from the \neconomic downturn, it is imperative that the Nation not lose ground in \nthe struggle against homelessness, especially among Americans who have \nlost jobs through no fault of their own, those homeowners and families \nwho are struggling due to the ongoing foreclosure crisis, and our \nveterans.\n  I applaud the courage of the members and volunteers of the National \nCoalition for the Homeless. Their selfless striving to end homelessness \nin America has changed the lives of thousands and thousands of our \nfellow Americans, even when so many others have averted their gaze. I \nhope my colleagues will join me in congratulating the National \nCoalition for the Homeless on 30 years of service to our communities \nand in rededicating ourselves to work with the coalition on ending the \ntragedy and scourge of homelessness in the richest nation on Earth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/17/senate-section/article/S2746-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JOYE KADING\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to tell my \ncolleagues about a remarkable lady, Joye Kading. Joye is being honored \nthis week with the dedication of the Joye Kading Gallery at the Wyoming \nVeterans Memorial Museum.\n  Joye Kading is the founder of the Wyoming Veterans Memorial Museum. \nLocated at the former Casper Army Air Base, a training facility for \nbomber pilots from 1942-1945, the museum is housed in the original tar \npaper building that served as the enlisted men's club.\n  Joye saw the Casper Army Air Base through its entire lifetime. She \nwas there when the area was nothing but open Wyoming prairie, and \nwatched it develop into an operational air base. She saw it through its \nheyday, and she was there when the base shut down at the end of World \nWar II. In March 1942, when Lt. Col. Carl T. Nordstrom came to visit \nCasper to see if it was a viable spot for an air base, he hired Joye to \nserve as his secretary. Her tenacity, ingenuity, and initiative was so \nhighly regarded that she continued to serve as a secretary for many of \nthe Casper Army Air Base's top officials. Around the air base and in \nthe community, she was a confidant, a big sister, and always willing to \ngive a word of advice or just take the time to listen.\n  During her work with the officers and personnel at the base, Joye \ncollected photographs, letters, programs and other memorabilia. Her \ncollection became a central part of the historical records she \npreserved through the Wyoming Veterans Memorial Museum. Many of the men \nin Joye's photographs did not return from war. Joye's passion for \npreserving this unique part of Wyoming's history has ensured that \nstories of the servicemembers stationed in Casper will not fade away \nwith time.\n  In 2006, Kading was awarded the Daughters of the American Revolution \nNational History Award for her dedication and commitment to honoring \nveterans and preserving their history. Throughout her life, Joye Kading \nhas embodied the spirit of service to country and responsibility of \ncommunity. The newly dedicated gallery will serve as a permanent \nmemorial for Joye's important contribution to preserving Wyoming's rich \nmilitary history. She is a true American patriot and a cornerstone of \nWyoming's unique heritage. I am honored to call Joye Kading my \nneighbor, a former patient, and my friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/17/senate-section/article/S2746-2", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     REMEMBERING JEAN CLARK ROGERS\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, today I wish to honor and remember \nMrs. Jean Clark Rogers. Mrs. Rogers died on February 20 at the age of \n93 in the home designed by her beloved late husband George. Her \ndaughter, Sidney, was by her side.\n  Jean became an Alaska treasure who enriched the territory and State \nfor over 65 years. Mother to six adopted children, she was also a \ncelebrated children's book author, an educator, a volunteer, and a \npassionate friend of the arts.\n  With savings from her first job as a fifth-grade teacher, Jean Clark \nenrolled at the University of California at Berkeley. There she met and \nmarried the love of her life, George Rogers. In 1945, after completing \ntheir degrees, they set sail for Juneau where George had a job with the \nU.S. Office of Price Administration.\n  From the time she arrived in Juneau, Jean Clark Rogers made an \nimpact. An avid reader, she was also a talented writer who authored \nchildren's books that appealed to both children and adults. Her best \nknown work is ``A King Island Christmas,'' on which she collaborated \nwith a close friend and well-known Alaskan artist, Rie Munoz. The \ninspirational book describes an extraordinary effort by a small and \nisolated island community to celebrate Christmas in the midst of a \nwinter storm. Adapted into a libretto for an oratorio by playwright \nDeborah Brevoort, the work premiered at Juneau's Perseverance Theater \nin 1997 and is still performed throughout the United States. This \nAugust it will be presented by a Juneau cast at the Fringe Festival in \nEdinburgh, Scotland.\n  Literature was so important to Jean that she regularly provided \nanimated readings at schools and public libraries. Recognized \nendearingly by children as ``the lady who pushes books,'' she was \nawarded an honorary doctorate of human letters by the University of \nAlaska Southeast in recognition of her contributions to children's \nliteracy and literature.\n  Jean was a busy author and mother, but she always found time to \ncontribute to her State and her community. She served on boards for the \nAlaska Public Offices Commission, the Alaska Public Broadcasting \nCommission, and Juneau's Capital City Broadcasting, Inc.--the KTOO \nfamily of public stations.\n  Jean was an avid supporter of local performing arts groups. She loved \nto sing and added her voice to the St. Paul Singers and the Juneau \nLyric Opera. Rarely did she miss a performance of the Juneau Symphony, \nPerseverance Theater or Opera to Go. In oversized glasses and colorful \nattire, she stood out in the crowd.\n  Most recently, Jean Rogers became a visual artist. At age 87, her \nintricate collages of cut paper were exhibited at the Canvas studio in \nJuneau, where note cards featuring her designs enjoyed brisk sales.\n  Despite physical frailties near life's end, Jean found joy outside \nher challenges. She would comment on the beauty of the day or how much \nshe enjoyed a game of cribbage or dominoes.\n  While we mourn the loss of Jean's presence, all things shared by this \nremarkable woman live on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/17/senate-section/article/S2746-3", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2746-S2747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO CHIEF JUDGE ROBERT BELL\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to honor the career \nof an outstanding individual, Chief Judge Robert Bell. Judge Bell is a \ntrailblazer, a stellar legal mind, and a mentor to so many. We are \ntruly blessed to have had him at the helm of our State judiciary here \nin Maryland for 17 years. We honor him today for his unwavering \ncommitment to justice and for his service to the people of Maryland.\n  I often speak on the importance of our judges understanding and being \nconnected to the public they serve and the communities in which they \nserve. Judge Bell reached the highest levels of the judiciary, yet he \nnever forgot where he came from. He was raised in Baltimore and \nattended Dunbar High School, where he served as student body president \nand ran on a ticket with Reginald Lewis. He attended college at Morgan \nState University and then went on to Harvard Law.\n  Judge Bell has left an enduring legacy that has been shaped by his \nlife events. When he was 16 years old, he was arrested at Hooper's \nRestaurant in Baltimore because he refused to give up his seat. Judge \nBell became the plaintiff in a landmark civil rights case that helped \nlead to the end of segregation in public accommodations in Maryland.\n\n[[Page S2747]]\n\n  Judge Bell learned firsthand the power of our judicial system to \nachieve justice and has committed his career to the improvement of the \njustice system. Judge Bell has served on Maryland's bench for over 37 \nyears and has served at each level of our State's judicial system--the \nonly judge to have done so for 4 years at each level. Judge Bell \nstarted his legal career in 1975 as a judge of the district court for \nBaltimore City. In 1980 he moved on to the circuit court and was \nappointed to the court of special appeals in 1984. In 1991 he was \nappointed to the court of appeals, and in 1996 he was designated by \nthen-Governor Glendening as chief judge of the court--the first African \nAmerican to hold the position.\n  As chief judge, Judge Bell has been committed to the education and \ncontinued development of our State's bench and bar. He has made it his \npriority to make sure that Maryland's legal professionals are prepared \nto tackle an ever-evolving criminal justice system and are suited to \nbetter serve the public. Having personally worked with him for years on \nthe Advanced Science and Technology Adjudication Resource, ASTAR, \nProgram a program established by the Maryland judiciary under Judge \nBell's leadership to help adequately prepare judges presiding over \ncases involving advanced science and medical issues I can personally \nattest to his commitment in ensuring the continued education and proper \ntraining of Maryland's judges. This is just one example of many like it \nthat illustrate Judge Bell's commitment to the improvement from the \nMaryland judicial system. From spearheading initiatives to increase pro \nbono work in the State to implementing programs to help aid struggling \nhomeowners, Judge Bell has truly been an indispensable leader in not \nonly the legal community but also in the entire State of Maryland.\n  Judge Bell's life and resume are a display of civic engagement, and \nhis experience and service are unparalleled in the legal community and \nbeyond. I am honored to recognize the extraordinary life and remarkable \nachievements of Judge Bell today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/17/senate-section/article/S2747-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REMEMBERING GEORGE PAUL HORSE CAPTURE SR.\n\n Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life and \nlegacy of George Paul Horse Capture Sr., who passed away yesterday in \nGreat Falls, MT.\n  George was a member of the A'aninin--Gros Ventre--tribe. He was born \nin 1937 in the Little Chicago neighborhood on the Fort Belknap Indian \nReservation.\n  George had a remarkable life filled with service to his people and to \nour country.\n  Early in life, he served in the U.S. Navy, became the only minority \nperson serving as a California State Steel inspector at the time and \nwas educated at the University of California--Berkeley.\n  When he was hired as the Curator of the Plains Indian Museum at the \nBuffalo Bill Historical Center in Cody, WY in 1979, George became one \nof the first Native American curators in the United States. During his \ntime as curator, he worked closely with a number of Northern Plains \nIndian tribes to ensure they played a role in the museum exhibitions.\n  George spent a decade in our Nation's Capital, serving in various \ncapacities at the National Museum of the American Indian at the \nSmithsonian Institution. He played a key role in the development and \nconstruction of the new museum facility that opened in 2004.\n  During his time at the National Museum of the American Indian, George \nled the charge to return many sacred objects to the appropriate tribes. \nThe repatriation of those objects was part of George's lifelong mission \nto empower Indian people.\n  George's life and his commitment to his people and his community is a \nreminder of the power of each individual to make a difference.\n  Our thoughts and prayers are with George's widow, Kay Karol, and all \nof his family and many friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/17/senate-section/article/S2747-2", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:43 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n  H.R. 756.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Congress supports and respects the right to bear arms \n     guaranteed by the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States.\n       (2) Congress supports the privacy rights of gun owners in \n     the United States, including the existing prohibition on a \n     national firearms registry.\n       (3) Congress supports longstanding Federal law that \n     prohibits convicted felons and those with dangerous mental \n     illnesses from purchasing or possessing a firearm, along with \n     the national instant criminal background check system to help \n     prevent these persons from procuring firearms in the primary \n     market.\n       (4) Congress recognizes an inconsistency in Federal law, \n     where a prohibited purchaser is prohibited from accessing \n     firearms at a gun store, but can easily procure a firearm at \n     a gun show, flea market, or through an Internet \n     advertisement.\n       (5) Congress and the citizens of the United States agree \n     that in order to promote safe and responsible gun ownership, \n     violent criminals and the dangerously mentally ill should be \n     prohibited from possessing firearms and therefore, it should \n     be incumbent upon Congress to empower law abiding citizens to \n     prevent the transfer of weapons to such people.\n       (6) There are deficits in the background check system in \n     existence prior to the date of enactment of this Act and the \n     Department of Justice should make it a top priority to work \n     with States to swiftly input missing records, including \n     mental health records.\n\n     SEC. 3. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       Nothing in this Act, or any amendment made by this Act, \n     shall be construed to--\n       (1) expand in any way the enforcement authority or \n     jurisdiction of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and \n     Explosives;\n       (2) allow the establishment, directly or indirectly, of a \n     Federal firearms registry; or\n       (3) infringe on the right of law-abiding citizens to keep \n     and bear arms as explicitly guaranteed by the Second \n     Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which \n     every Member of Congress has taken an oath to support and \n     defend.\n\n     TITLE I--CONSOLIDATING FEDERAL PROGRAMS AND ENSURING THAT ALL \n INDIVIDUALS WHO SHOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM BUYING A GUN ARE LISTED IN \n         THE NATIONAL INSTANT CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM\n\n     SEC. 101.
