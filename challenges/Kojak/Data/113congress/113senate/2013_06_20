Mr. President, I indicated last night that I was going to \ncreate a vote at 11:30 this morning, but Senators Mikulski and Shelby \nhave asked that we put that over a little bit, so we are going to do \nthat at noon because they are having an important markup in the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  We will continue to work through amendments to the bill today. \nHopefully, we could have, at that time--at noon--a path forward on this \nlegislation. We have a number of amendments that are now pending. We \nhope to have a way of disposing of those, and I hope there is something \nthat can be worked out. Senator Landrieu and others have indicated they \nwant some amendments, and I hope we can work that out so we can move \nforward on the bill.\n  So we will continue to work through the amendments, as I indicated, \ntoday. The first rollcall vote, as I have indicated, will be at about \nnoon today.\n  Mr. President, we have made some significant advances on the historic \nimmigration legislation that is now before us. I am confident and I am \nhopeful that we can pass this bill. I have indicated on a number of \noccasions that we are going to do everything within our power to finish \nthis bill before the July 4 recess.\n  I have had conversations with the Republican leader and other \nRepublican Senators, and, of course, with my Democratic Senators, and I \nthink that is the goal, and I have no reason that we should not be able \nto meet that goal.\n  We have made progress on amendments. I expect and I hope that a group \nof Republican Senators working with the Gang of 8 will come forward \nwith a way that they think we can move forward on this bill dealing \nwith the border. As I have said all along, I am willing to look at any \nreasonable amendment--I think we all are--and I hope something can be \nworked out with my Republican colleagues and the Gang of 8.\n  I have said before, and I say it again, I appreciate very much the \nGang of 8 for their diligent work, both in crafting this legislation \nand in shepherding it through this transparent and thorough process. It \ngoes without saying that the chairman of the committee Senator Leahy \nhas been remarkably focused on how to get this done.\n  One of my favorite Senators I have had the opportunity to work with \nover the years is Chuck Grassley, the Senator from Iowa. He is the \nranking member of that committee. Even though we disagree on occasion \non how to move forward, I never remember having an unpleasant \nconversation with Chuck Grassley. So I appreciate his working on this.\n\n[[Page S4728]]\n\n  As I have indicated, he and Senator Leahy do not agree on parts of \nthis immigration bill, but that is the way things are and should be on \nthis legislation--all legislation. But he has been cooperative in \nhelping us meet his expectations and move forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/20/senate-section/article/S4728-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4728-S4729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SEQUESTRATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, a century ago, a person born in the United \nStates could reasonably expect to live to their late forties. I repeat, \n100 years ago, a person born in the United States could reasonably \nexpect to live to their late forties. Today, most people born in the \nUnited States can live into their late seventies or early eighties. \nThat is the way it is.\n\n  Look how things have changed over these last 100 years. Imagine \nadding more than three decades to life expectancy just in this period \nof time. This gift is due to a number of reasons. But the most \nsignificant reason is we have had 125 years of research done by one of \nthe great institutions of America: the National Institutes of Health.\n  Due to their research, fewer people die of cancer, for example, each \nyear than the year before. It is stunning, the advances we have made. \nIf one looks at their personal life, the things that happen in their \nfamily, think what it would have been a few years ago, such as with a \nterrible automobile accident or a dread disease like cancer. Think of \nthe work that has been done by these scientists to help us advance the \ncause of curing people.\n  Over the last half century, deaths from heart disease and stroke have \nfallen by 60 percent. That is just in 50 years. Because of the work \ndone, thanks to the Institutes of Health, scientists understand the \nheart about as well as any part of your body.\n  Now these wonderful scientists are beginning to study the brain, \nwhich is much more complicated than the heart, but still the heart is \nvery complicated. They are going to begin a study to find out \neverything they can about the brain. The most extensive research \nproject in the world is dealing with the brain, which is going to be--\nand it has already started--at the National Institutes of Health.\n  Because of antiviral therapies developed by NIH-funded projects and \nresearchers, now they have diagnosed HIV/AIDS to the extent that--I was \nout there on Monday, and I talked to them about that when I first came \nto the Senate, when someone was diagnosed with AIDS, it was a death \nsentence. Not anymore because of the work done there. They can count \ntheir life expectancy in multiple decades, when in the past it was \nmonths.\n  It would be impossible to count the lives NIH innovation has already \nsaved, and researchers are not close to realizing the limits of modern \nmedicine.\n  I was fortunate to have the opportunity, as I indicated, to visit the \nfacility on Monday morning. These facilities in Bethesda, MD, are \nstunningly important to visit, to witness, the fascinating work they do \nthere.\n  I toured one of the clinics where the best medical researchers in the \nworld are trying to solve the world's most elusive medical mysteries. \nThere are 27 different institutes that make up the National Institutes \nof Health. They are studying diseases that have yet to be identified, \nlet alone be cured. They have one institute where that is what they \ndeal with. On diseases, they do not know what the cause is.\n  I met a little girl there who is 7 years old--a beautiful child. They \nare trying to figure out why she has the problems she has. They have \nmade some progress, but they do not know yet. Once they identify--and \nthey have. They have found reasons why in that young lady and others \ncertain things are missing. I am not a scientist and I cannot probably \ndo justice to this, but there are certain things in the body--gene \nsequencing in the body--where something is missing or something is \nadded, such as a protein that should not be there. Now they can \nidentify this. It is tremendous that they can do that, but on a number \nof these diseases they are still--even though they have identified what \ncauses it, they do not know for sure how to fix it. That is what they \nare doing there.\n  In addition to the work being conducted by the nearly 6,000 \nscientists who work there--these are labs located on their campus; it \nis a huge campus--they award not only the work they do there, but they \naward thousands of grants each year to more than 300,000 researchers \nacross the country. Most of them are university based, but not all of \nthem.\n  These scientists are seeking the next breakthrough for treatments \nthey can do with drugs and even cures. They are reaching out for the \nnext advancement that will--to borrow Abraham Lincoln's words--add \nyears to our lives as well as life to our years.\n  But today the crucial lifesaving work at NIH is in jeopardy. The \narbitrary, across-the-board cuts of the mean and arbitrary sequester \nhave hit NIH very hard. The institutes have cut $1.55 billion from \ntheir budget this year alone.\n  Think of the work that is not being done there because of that. The \nlittle girl who I met there--think of the work that is not going to be \ndone with little girls and boys like her because, this year alone, $1.5 \nbillion is cut from their program.\n  What that means, among other things, is that NIH will award 700 fewer \ngrants this year than last, putting the next revolutionary treatment at \nrisk, whatever it might be. And faced with diminished funding \nopportunities and an uncertain future, promising young scientists are \nabandoning the research field altogether.\n  The Director of the National Institutes of Health is Dr. Francis \nCollins, the father of the gene sequencing that we now look to in the \nfuture to curing literally every disease. This wonderful man, who could \nmake a fortune by moving out of his scientific endeavors, has decided \nthat is his life's work. Not only does Dr. Collins feel that way, but \neveryone who works there. They are doing things to help us, our \nfamilies, our friends, America, and literally the world.\n  It is very sad to me that these wonderful people, who are dedicating \ntheir lives to not how much money they can make but how much better \nthey can make people feel and what they can do to cure diseases, are \nlooking for other places.\n  The best friend of someone who works for me here in Washington is one \nof the leading experts, if not the leading expert, in the world on a \ndisease called melanoma--cancer.\n  He is not applying for grants anymore at NIH because you cannot do \nthis work on a 1- to 2-year basis; it has to be long-term or you would \ndo not the research. It is happening all over. Not only that, people \nwho work there are leaving the institution.\n  NIH researchers are currently studying cancer drugs that zero in on a \ntumor more, with fewer sickening side effects. I say that--sickening \nside effects.\n  The Capitol physician, Dr. Brian Monahan, is a wonderful man. He was \na professor, taught medicine. He is a Navy admiral. He is board \ncertified in hematology, internal medicine, and oncology. As some know, \nmy wife has been through a pretty brutal bout with breast cancer. He \ntold me, when Landra was really sick lots of time--really, really \nsick--he said just a few years ago that they had to admit women to the \nhospital because they could not stop vomiting because of the medicine \nthey were taking. We have made progress. That does not happen often \nanymore. As sick as my wife was, she was not as sick as she would have \nbeen a few years ago.\n  At this wonderful facility, they are developing a vaccine to fight \nevery strain of influenza without a yearly shot, saving money and \nlives. A man at the institute there, on a blackboard--really a \ngreenboard--with a piece of chalk, drew a picture which showed me and \nmy staff what happens when influenza strikes and the reason we need now \na yearly shot for the flu. But we are very close to having one shot to \ntake care of flu all the time.\n  This flu is not anything to not worry about. In 1918, 100 million \npeople died because of flu around the world--100 million. We have a \ncouple types of flu right now that are potentially very damaging. These \nscientists are very close to having a vaccine that will take care of \nthe flu with one shot for always.\n  They are conducting clinical trials to help identify and treat those \nat risk of developing early-onset Alzheimer's, leading to more \nsuccessful treatment of this costly and debilitating disease. Many \nyears ago I was at an event in\n\n[[Page S4729]]\n\nLas Vegas. Next to me was a physician. I was a new Senator. He said: \nYou and Congress need to do something about Alzheimer's; otherwise, you \nare going to bankrupt America. With people living longer, there is more \nAlzheimer's coming all the time. We have made progress. We still have a \nlong way to go.\n  These innovations have the possibility not only to save lives but to \nsave us all billions of dollars each year on medical care. The NIH is \nan intellectual and economic leader the world over. Everybody looks at \nthe NIH as the premier research facility for disease.\n  But the senseless meat ax, unfair cuts we call sequester, puts all \nthat NIH does at risk. As we, this wonderful, great country of ours, \nare slashing investments in medical research--slashing--our competitors \nare redoubling their efforts: China, 25 percent increase in medical \nresearch; we are cutting billions. In just 2 years, with the sequester \ndeal, we will cut almost $4 billion. China is increasing theirs by 25 \npercent; India by 20 percent; South Korea, Germany, Brazil, 10 percent. \nWe are whacking ours, cutting these wonderful scientists. These \ncountries, all they are trying to do is duplicate our success, \nreplicate our success. While they are doing that, we are abandoning \ninvestments that brought us to where we are.\n  But medical innovation does not happen overnight. It takes years of \nresearch, years of trial and years of error, quite frankly, years of \nthe process of elimination. One of the institute Directors--we talked \nabout spinal cord injuries. They are making progress with something \nthey thought a few years ago worked really well, but further tests said \nit works only a little bit, not the way they thought it would.\n  Even when scientists know the cause of a disease--as I have \nindicated, they have figured out some of this with gene sequencing--it \ntakes an average of 13 years to develop a drug to treat that. These \nshortsighted cuts in the research funding will cost us valuable cures \ntomorrow. While these costs may not be felt this month, this year, or \neven this decade, their long-term consequences will be grave.\n  Now, we say it may not be felt this month. To the scientists working \nthere, they are going to feel it very quickly because some of them are \nleaving. Imagine if we had neglected our commitment to finding \neffective treatments for cancer, heart disease, or stroke a few decades \nago. Imagine if we had abandoned investments in treatment for HIV/AIDS \nin the 1980s and 1990s. Think of the burden that would have been not \nonly on the people who were sick and dying but the burden it would have \nbeen on our economy because of the huge cost, the lost time at work, \nand all the medical stuff. We do not have to worry about that anymore. \nImagine lives cut short.\n  We can all agree that reducing our deficit is a valuable goal. We \nhave done a good job--$2.5 trillion. But we should reduce the deficit \nby making smart investments, not by the making shortsighted cuts that \ncause pain and suffering and death. There is simply no price tag you \ncan put on that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/20/senate-section/article/S4729-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, a few months back one of our Democratic \ncolleagues warned of a huge train wreck on the horizon--the \nimplementation of ObamaCare. Yesterday we received another warning as \nObamaCare speeds down the tracks. This one came from the Government \nAccountability Office, which highlighted a number of missed deadlines \nthat cast doubt on the ability of the administration to even get the \nlaw up and running by October 1.\n  Of course, the GAO is not the first to issue such warnings. Some of \nus have been sounding a similar call literally for years. What we have \nsaid is that ObamaCare is set to become a bureaucratic nightmare. Most \nof the law's key provisions have not even been implemented yet. Not a \nsingle American has signed up for an exchange. Already it is turning \ninto one big mess.\n  It was not hard to see this coming. We are talking about a 2,700-page \npiece of legislation. We are talking about a law that has already \ngenerated more than 20,000 pages of regulations--literally a redtape \ntower 7 feet tall. We are talking about an edict that proposes to alter \none of the most personal, most private aspects of our lives in a \nfundamental way. So it does not take an expert to understand what that \nleads to--reams of paperwork; a massive new bureaucracy; the \ncoordination of numerous, hulking government agencies, including, of \ncourse, the IRS.\n  It cannot be done without the people the government is attempting to \nregulate--the doctors, the hospitals, States, small businesses, \nhundreds of millions of Americans--actually having a clue how to \ncomply. Nobody knows how to comply. The law is maddeningly complex. So, \nof course, ObamaCare is going to be a mess--going to be a mess. We said \nit would be. Actually, it already is. Yet earlier this month the \nPresident said that ObamaCare was ``working the way it is supposed \nto.'' That is literally what he said.\n  Maybe that is why just yesterday a survey of Americans showed that \nonly 19 percent--fewer than one in five--believe ObamaCare will make \ntheir family better off--only 19 percent. It found that a much greater \nnumber--roughly half of Americans--worried about losing the health care \ncoverage they already have.\n  There was another survey released too, a survey of small business \nowners. It found that 41 percent of small business owners said they had \nfrozen hiring, literally quit hiring people because of ObamaCare--41 \npercent of small businesses. About 20 percent said they had already \nreduced their workforces because of it. Forty percent quit hiring \npeople and 20 percent reduced their workforce because of ObamaCare. \nRemember, this is a law that is still being implemented, and many \nbusinesses already seem to be laying people off. I hope that is not a \npreview of what we will see once ObamaCare actually comes online. But \ngiven the evidence thus far, it is hard to draw a different conclusion.\n  The Kentucky Retail Federation recently cited ObamaCare as the thing \nhaving the most impact on their businesses' ability to grow. As the \nleader of that group put it, the companies in his federation are \nhesitant to take on new staff or to invest in their own business growth \nuntil they know how much health care reform is going to cost.\n  So if this is the law that is ``working the way it is supposed to,'' \nthen it is obviously a very bad law. It is Congress's duty to repeal \nbad laws. I hope that it will. I hope my Democratic friends here in the \nSenate will finally work with us to do just that because we cannot do \nit without them. They have the majority. If they can muster the will to \nadmit their mistake, I hope they can also find the will to work with us \nto start fresh on health care. This time, I hope they will actually \nwork together with Republicans to get something done for the American \npeople. In my view, that means pursuing effective, step-by-step reforms \nthat cannot only lower costs but they can also be implemented \neffectively and understood completely by the constituents we were sent \nhere to serve. I know my constituents back in Kentucky would expect as \nmuch of us, and frankly they should expect that much of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/20/senate-section/article/S4729-3", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4729-S4730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              SENATE RULES\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as I have talked about repeatedly over \nthe last few weeks, there is a cloud hanging over the Senate, an unease \nthroughout the Senate entirely on the Republican side and some on the \nDemocratic side as well, and that is this: We had a discussion at the \nbeginning of this Congress about what the rules of the Senate would be \nfor this Congress this year and next year. After that bipartisan \ndiscussion, we passed two rules changes and two standing orders. The \nmajority leader said we had determined what the rules of the Senate \nwere going to be for the next 2 years. He gave his word that we would \nnot break the rules of the Senate in order to change the rules of the \nSenate--the so-called nuclear option. Yet he has continued to hint that \nmaybe that was not what he had in mind.\n  So what my colleagues and I are asking the majority leader to do is \nto\n\n[[Page S4730]]\n\nstand by his word. Your word is the currency of the realm here in the \nSenate. We expect the majority leader to keep his word. His word was \ngiven unequivocally in January of this year.

The Republican whip.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1251\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n45 minutes between now and the time our vote is scheduled this morning \non my amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I won't be taking all of that time right now. I will \nreserve some time and hopefully other colleagues will come down to the \nfloor and engage in a discussion.\n  As you know, the past few days I have been talking about the \nimportance of border security in this immigration bill. To remind \nanybody who happens to be listening, I come from a State, Texas, that \nhas the longest common border with the country of Mexico, 1,200 miles.\n  While many of our colleagues or some of our colleagues come from \nStates such as California where in San Diego they have the fence there \nthat they view as restricting illegal immigration and entry into the \ncountry, Tucson, Arizona, has a little different situation because much \nof the land is Federal land. In Texas, our 1,200-mile common border \nwith Mexico is largely private property on the Texas side. It also is \nenormously diverse. You can go out to West Texas near Alpine where Big \nBend National Park is where you will see huge cliffs that go some 1,000 \nfeet down to the Rio Grande River. While some have said we need a fence \nacross the entire border, I daresay that putting a fence on a 1,000-\nfoot cliff is not going to enhance border security much. What I have \nargued for from the beginning is the need for a comprehensive border \nsecurity plan and for Congress to make a sincere and enforceable \ncommitment to follow through on that plan.\n  I do believe, in the 6 years since the last time we debated \nimmigration reform in 2007, there is an emerging consensus in the \ncountry. Many people are mad, and they deserve to be mad, about the \nFederal Government's failure to live up to its promises when it comes \nto our broken immigration system.\n  We can go back to 1986 when Ronald Reagan, the father of modern \nconservatism in the Republican Party, signed an amnesty for 3 million \npeople. His rationale was we are going to enforce our immigration \nsystem so this will be the first and last time any President will have \nto sign an amnesty.\n  We know the enforcement component didn't work, that promise was not \nkept, causing a lot of deeply seated skepticism in the American people \nas to whether Congress and Washington can be depended upon to keep \ntheir commitments when it comes to enforcing our laws and securing our \nborders.\n  My amendment that we will be voting on perhaps as early as noon today \nis designed to turn border security rhetoric into reality. More \nspecifically, what it adds is a trigger. We have been talking about \ntriggers to the Gang of 8 bill, the underlying bill, but it would \nrequire the Federal Government to have 100-percent situational \nawareness of our border, the southwestern border. We can do that from \nBorder Patrol, radar, ground sensors, and using all of the magnificent \ntechnology the Defense Department and our military have produced--\namazing American innovators--that our military has used effectively in \nplaces such as Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I don't believe there is any doubt, and I know our Gang of 8, the \npeople who wrote the underlying bill, believe that 100-percent \nsituational awareness of our border is possible and attainable if we \nhave the political will to make it happen and if our law enforcement \nauthorities are provided the appropriate resources to do it. And 100-\npercent situational awareness is one of the requirements.\n  The second is operational control. Right now we don't have control of \nour southwestern border. The latest Government Accountability Office \nestimate is only about 45 percent of our southwestern border is under \noperational control.\n  For example, a few weeks ago I was in South Texas in Brooks County in \ndeep Rio Grande Valley, the Rio Grande Valley sector of the Border \nPatrol, visiting with them. On 1 day they detained 700 people coming \nacross the southwestern border in the Rio Grande sector and 400 of them \ncame from countries other than Mexico. Some of the rescue beacons they \nhave down there for people who are in distress--immigrants coming from \nCentral America, coming from around the world through our southwestern \nborder into the United States--the rescue beacons they have down there \nthat I saw with my own eyes, where if people get in big trouble and \nthey realize they may lose their life unless they call the Border \nPatrol in to help them, are in English, Spanish and, get this, Chinese. \nChinese. This is in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas.\n  I asked the local law enforcement authorities, why Chinese? They \nsaid: Well, for a while, we got a whole lot of Chinese immigrants \ncoming across the border, being smuggled across into the United States.\n  I said: What is the going rate you have to pay the coyotes, as they \ncall them, the smugglers?\n  They said: About $30,000.\n  For $30,000 somebody from China can get somebody to smuggle them into \nthe United States, which is the reason why those rescue beacons were in \nEnglish, Spanish, and Chinese.\n  Indeed, the Border Patrol statistics reveal we have people who have \ncome across the border in the last year from 100 different countries \naround the world. A couple of years ago I had the opportunity, as a \nmember of the Armed Services Committee, to ask the Director of National \nIntelligence James Clapper and the head of the Defense Intelligence \nAgency whether this porous border was a national security issue. Both \nof them said it was, which is pretty obvious.\n  We know if people from 100 different countries can penetrate our \nsouthwestern border because of a lack of appropriate security there, if \nthey have the money and they are determined enough, they can come from \nanywhere in the world, including countries that are state sponsors of \nterrorism. Operational control of the border is very important.\n\n[[Page S4731]]\n\n  Third, my amendment offers a real trigger that requires a nationwide \nbiometric entry-exit system. That sounds a little obscure. Basically, \nwhat happens when you come to the United States from another country is \nyou are required to give fingerprints. That is a biometric identifier \nbecause you can't use phony documents or a fuzzy picture to claim to be \nsomebody you are not and get into the country illegally.\n  The importance of the biometric entry-exit system was noted \nparticularly by the 9/11 Commission, because several of the people who \nwere involved in the plot to kill 3,000 Americans on September 11, \n2001, entered the country legally, but they never left. Hence, the \nimportance of a biometric entry-exit system to document not just when \npeople come to America as tourists or students or whatever, but that \nthey actually leave when their visa is expired.\n  Right now, 40 percent of illegal immigration is a product of a \nfailure to have an effective entry-exit system because people come \nlegally and they simply stay and melt into the great American \nlandscape. Unless they come into contact with our law enforcement \nofficials, commit a crime--driving while intoxicated, domestic \nviolence, or the like--they are never going to be caught.\n  Fourth, my amendment requires nationwide E-Verify. E-Verify is the \nname given to a system with which all Federal offices have to comply. \nFor example, when somebody wants to be hired in my Senate office, \neither in Texas or up here in DC, we are required by law to run their \nname through the E-Verify system to verify this person is legally \neligible to work in the United States. That is an important part of the \nprovisions in my amendment that provide real triggers.\n  Let me talk a moment about triggers, because you are going to hear a \nlot of discussion about a trigger. A trigger is more than a promise. We \nknow there is a litany--indeed, there is a trail of broken promises--\nwhen it comes to our immigration system that dates back to at least \n1986.\n  What a trigger means is there is an enforceable mechanism that will \nprevent people from transitioning, in the case of my amendment, from \nprobationary status to legal permanent residency until the objectives \nset out in the underlying bill, 100 percent of situational awareness \nand operational control, are met, together with a biometric entry-exit \nsystem and nationwide E-Verify.\n  I wish to emphasize that my amendment uses the same standard, \nmetrics, and targets as the underlying bill. The difference between my \namendment and their bill is their bill promises the Sun and the Moon \nwhen it comes to border security, E-Verify, and entry-exit, but it has \nno enforceable mechanism.\n  I ask the question, why should the American people trust Congress? \nWhy should the American people trust Washington to enforce this part of \nthe essential bargain, the security part of the bargain, if it has \nfailed to do so in the past?\n  I would suggest to you that given the current trust deficit here in \nWashington, with scandals everywhere, that we can't reasonably expect \nthe American people to rely on ``trust us.'' We need something \nenforceable, which is what my amendment provides.\n  The trigger in my amendment is not designed to punish people. It is \ndesigned to realign incentives. Everybody from conservatives to \nliberals to people in the middle of the road--Republicans, Democrats, \nyou name it--everybody is incentivized to hit the standard set out in \nthe underlying bill, 100-percent situational awareness and operational \ncontrol.\n  Over the past few days I have cited a number of experts. We in the \nSenate have a lot of experts. We have people from different States, \nsome of whom, to be honest, know more about the subject than others. I \nhave cited a couple of experts, including the former head of Customs \nand Border Protection and the former Under Secretary for Border and \nTransportation Security at the Department of Homeland Security, all of \nwhom believe the border security requirements in my amendment--and \nagain I stress in the underlying bill--are reasonable and realistic.\n  No fewer than three members of the Gang of 8--Senator Bennet of \nColorado, a Democrat; Senator Flake of Arizona, a Republican; and \nSenator McCain, a Republican from Arizona--have said the 90-percent \napprehension rate for illegal border crossers is a perfectly attainable \ngoal.\n  Senator McCain 2 days ago said he had talked to the head of the \nBorder Patrol who said this is a perfectly realistic goal, 100-percent \nsituational awareness and operational control. I agree with that.\n  If the goal is attainable, why not make it mandatory? Why not make it \ngo beyond the usual promises and platitudes and demand actual results? \nThat is what my amendment does. It demands results, and it creates a \nmechanism that ensures those results will be delivered.\n  Again, this is designed to realign all of the incentives so all of us \nare absolutely focused like a laser in ensuring that the executive \nbranch and the bureaucracy will do what the bill promises will be done. \nIf we are able to accomplish that--I believe the American people are a \ncompassionate people and understand we have a very difficult hand to \nplay here because we haven't enforced our immigration laws for many \nyears now. If they believe sincerely this will end the illegality in \nour broken immigration system, if this will return law and order to our \nbroken immigration system, I believe they will accept dealing with the \n11 million people here in a humane and compassionate way.\n  If you think our immigration system is broken, as I do, and if you \nthink the status quo is unacceptable, that doing nothing is not the \nanswer, then I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment. \nIt is the only way, I believe, to get truly bipartisan and, even more \nimportant than that, truly effective immigration reform.\n  Mr. President, may I ask the Chair how much time I have remaining.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Thirty minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair.\n  As I mentioned a few moments ago, I wish to spend a few additional \nminutes talking about a portion of my amendment that hasn't received \nmuch attention because we have been focused so much on the border \nsecurity component. Indeed, I think most Americans would be shocked to \nlearn the underlying bill--the Gang of 8 bill--would allow eligibility \nfor immediate legalization of people with multiple drunk driving \nconvictions. Indeed, the bill even legalizes drunk drivers who have \nalready been deported, amazingly enough.\n  Just for perspective, in the year 2011, Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement deported nearly 36,000 people with DUI--driving under the \ninfluence--convictions. The problem is especially bad in Houston, TX, \nwhere I was born. Just last month, a Harris County Sheriff's Office \nsergeant named Dwayne Polk was killed by an illegal immigrant drunk \ndriver who had previously been arrested for driving under the influence \nand illegally carrying a weapon. After his earlier arrest he was \ndeported, but he eventually came back to Houston and once again drove \nwhile intoxicated, with the tragic results of SGT Dwayne Polk losing \nhis life.\n  In May of 2011, Houston police officer Kevin Will was killed by an \nillegal immigrant drunk driver who had been deported to Mexico on \nseveral occasions. In August 2007, an illegal immigrant drunk driver, \nwith a blood alcohol level three times above the legal limit, killed \nthree people on a Houston area freeway, including a husband, a wife, \nand their 2-year-old son. The driver who killed them was out on bail at \nthe time of the accident after having been arrested for domestic \nviolence.\n  For that matter, not only does the underlying bill legalize \nimmigrants with multiple drunk driving convictions, it also legalizes \npeople with multiple domestic violence convictions--domestic violence \nconvictions. That is mind-boggling.\n  I realize some people, when they hear the word ``misdemeanor,'' think \nwe are talking about jaywalking or a speeding ticket or something \nsimilar to that or driving a car without a functioning taillight, but \nthe truth is--and the former prosecutors in this Chamber know--the \ntechnical difference between a misdemeanor and a felony can be as \nlittle as 1 day additional time in prison.\n  Typically, a misdemeanor is punished, potentially, with up to 1 year \nin\n\n[[Page S4732]]\n\njail. Anything over that is traditionally called a felony. More \nclearly, felonious conduct is often pleaded down to a misdemeanor, \nparticularly in instances such as domestic violence, where the victim \nis either married to or lives with the assailant and there is \ndifficulty getting cooperation. Sometimes the only thing the prosecutor \ncan do, even in a case of a very serious physical or other assault, is \nto get a misdemeanor conviction, even though the underlying \ncircumstances are very serious indeed.\n  There are numerous States that classify certain domestic violence \ncrimes as misdemeanors, and there is a lot of variety in this, but that \ndoesn't mean the conduct at issue is any less of a domestic violence \noffense. By my count, 23 States have specific misdemeanor domestic \nviolence offenses. These include California, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, \nMinnesota, Rhode Island, and South Carolina.\n  Minnesota, for example, defines misdemeanor domestic assault this \nway:\n\n       Whoever . . . against a family or household member: (1) \n     commits an act with intent to cause fear and another of \n     immediate bodily harm or death; or (2) intentionally inflict \n     or attempts to inflict bodily harm upon another.\n\n  As I am sure my colleagues from Minnesota know, crimes that qualify \nas misdemeanor domestic violence under Minnesota law include domestic \nabuse with a deadly weapon--even domestic abuse with a gun. While it is \ncalled a misdemeanor in the statute books, it is obviously a very \nserious underlying offense.\n  I would love it if some Member of this Chamber would explain why \nconduct such as this should not be a bar to the generous opportunity \nafforded in the bill to obtain probationary status and eventually earn \na pathway to citizenship. Why should we include people such as this, \nwho have shown so much contempt for our laws?\n  We are not just talking about people who have come here to work in \nviolation of our immigration laws, we are talking about people who have \ncome in violation of our immigration laws and who have also committed \nserious offenses. We should have zero tolerance for anyone who enters \nour country and commits such a heinous act.\n  America has always been a deeply compassionate and understanding \nsociety, and nothing has changed, but when it comes to granting legal \nstatus to people who have violated our immigration laws, our criteria \nshould be very clear: no drunk drivers and no violent criminals, \nperiod. My amendment guarantees that, which is just one more reason why \nthis Chamber should embrace it.\n  For now, I wish to conclude by saying I read in the press, including \nthe New York Times, a story by Ashley Parker, dated June 19, 2013, that \nsays, ``Two GOP Senators are close to a deal on border security.'' It \ncites the efforts of my colleagues Bob Corker of Tennessee and John \nHoeven of North Dakota, who have been working behind the scenes to try \nto improve the border security component of the underlying bill.\n  I applaud them for their efforts, and I applaud them for moving the \nunderlying bill in a more positive direction when it comes to border \nsecurity. I am going to wait to pass final judgment until I actually \nsee language because the devil is so often in the details on things \nsuch as this. But I would point out that just before their efforts, \nwhich now reportedly would include an additional 20,000 Border Patrol \nagents, the underlying bill had zero additional Border Patrol agents--\nzero additional boots on the ground.\n\n  My amendment adds 5,000 Border Patrol agents. Reportedly--and, again, \nwe need to see the details of the proposal--Senators Corker and Hoeven \nwould add 20,000 additional Border Patrol agents.\n  To show what a dramatic change that has been, Senator Schumer, one of \nthe chief architects of the underlying bill, in a speech on June 12, \nsaid: Whatever CBO--the Congressional Budget Office--says, 6,500 border \nagents is a multibillion-dollar proposition, unpaid for, which is why I \nknow my colleagues on the other side rue the day when we vote for \nunpaid obligations.\n  Again, he said--and this is on June 12--how can you manufacture 3,500 \nnew personnel and say it doesn't add to the cost and will be \nreallocated? I want to know where it is going to be reallocated from.\n  Similarly, my colleague Senator McCain said: But those who think we \nneed more people, we do need more people to facilitate movement across \nports of entry, but we have 21,000 Border Patrol agents. Today there \nare, at the Mexico-Arizona border, people sitting in vehicles in 120-\ndegree heat.\n  He said, in a speech on June 18: What we need is not more people. He \nwent on to say: But the fact is, we can get this border secured, and \nthe answer, my friend, is as is proposed in the Cornyn amendment; that \nwe hire 10,000 more Border Patrol agents. He said: That is not a \nrecognition of what we need.\n  Finally, he said: No expert I have talked to, to say the best way to \ncontrol people from crossing the border illegally, which I desperately \nwant to do, works better with a huge amount of personnel.\n  So I point out those comments by Senator Schumer and Senator McCain, \ntwo of the leading members of the Gang of 8--their comments on June 12. \nSo if it is true, as reported in the New York Times and elsewhere, that \nSenator Corker and Senator Hoeven have moved them off the zero \nadditional Border Patrol agents to doubling the size of the Border \nPatrol agents, that is a substantial movement in terms of boots on the \nground.\n  I will conclude, for now, by saying this: I am looking forward to \nseeing the language that is being proposed, the alternative language. \nBut for now, I believe my amendment deserves the support of the Members \nof this Chamber because I believe it is the only way we have available \nto us to ensure our constituents, to look them in the face and say: We \nknow we have broken promises in the past when it comes to border \nsecurity. We know we promised 17 years ago there would be a biometric \nentry-exit system, when President Clinton signed that into law. But you \nknow what, we didn't do it. But we are serious about doing the \nenforcement and security measures now and, in fact, we have put a \nprovision in the bill which will guarantee it.\n  That is what my amendment will do.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nduring the quorum calls be equally divided among the Democrats and \nRepublicans in the Chamber.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Again, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we are looking at a lot of amendments \nright now, and I just want to call attention to one that I think is \nsignificant. It is one where, when people find out about it, they are \njust outraged that something like this could happen, and it is \nsomething that could be corrected with a very simple amendment.\n  My amendment addresses the 2001 U.S. Supreme Court decision of \nZavidas. There, the Court held that immigrants admitted to the United \nStates and then ordered removed couldn't be detained for more than 6 \nmonths. So something has to happen after a 6-month period.\n  Four years later, the Supreme Court extended the decision to people \nhere illegally as well. That is what we are talking about today. As a \nresult, the Department of Justice and Homeland Security had no choice \nbut to release thousands of criminal immigrants into our neighborhoods. \nThe problem with these decisions is that the criminal immigrants \nordered to be removed can't be deported back to their country if\n\n[[Page S4733]]\n\nthat country refuses to issue the necessary travel documents. In other \nwords, if the country doesn't want to take them back, they don't have \nto take them back. Yet we have to release them.\n  More importantly, these decisions have a serious impact on public \nsafety, as recent cases have illustrated.\n  Six years ago, a Vietnamese immigrant was ordered deported after \nserving time in prison for armed robbery and assault. He was never \nremoved because this Supreme Court decision handicapped our \nauthorities. Our immigration officials couldn't deport him without the \ncooperation of the Vietnamese Government--which they did not--and his \ndeportation was never processed. Now, this same immigrant, Binh Thai \nLuc, is suspected of killing five people in a San Francisco home in \nMarch of 2012.\n  The story of Qian Wu puts this situation in perspective. Qian Wu felt \na little safer after the man who had stalked, choked, punched, and \npointed a knife at her was locked up and ordered removed from the \ncountry. The man, Huang Chen, was a Chinese citizen who had illegally \nentered the United States. As has been the case at least 8,500 times in \nthe last 4 years, Mr. Chen's home country refused to let its violent \ncriminal return home.\n  Frankly, you can understand how this could happen--and it did happen. \nSo, handcuffed by the Supreme Court decision, immigrant officials \nreleased Mr. Chen back into the community, here in the United States, \nwhen they had nowhere else to send him.\n  As you can imagine, the story also does not have a happy ending. Upon \nhis release in 2010, Huang Chen murdered Qian Wu, the very person that \nwas concerned during this time.\n  As you can see, this is a real problem with serious consequences. \nThere are others like these people out there. According to statistics \nprovided by the Department of Homeland Security, there are many \ncountries that are not cooperating or that take longer to repatriate \ntheir nationals. Countries such as Iran, Pakistan, China, Somalia, \nLiberia are on the list.\n  The Supreme Court, in making their decision, said Congress should \nclarify the law. My amendment No. 1203, which I hope is going to be \nvoted on in the next short while, does exactly what we need to do by \ncreating a framework that allows immigration officials to detain \ndangerous criminal immigrants such as Binh Thai Luc and Huang Chen.\n  Specifically, immigrants can be detained beyond 6 months if they are \nunder order of removal but can't be deported due to the country's \nunwillingness to accept them back if several conditions are met, \nincluding if their release would, one, threaten national security; or, \ntwo, threaten the safety of the community and the alien either is an \naggravated felon or has committed a crime of violence.\n  I understand that the ACLU is scoring against my amendment. I view \nthat as a badge of honor and an additional reason to support my \namendment. It seems that the ACLU is only concerned with protecting the \nrights of criminals. It is time that we stop this nonsense. Again, all \nyou have to do is go out in public and tell people that we have this \nsituation where we are forced to release these criminals into our \nsociety merely because their country will not repatriot them.\n  So I ask support of my amendment No. 1203.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning \nbusiness for up to 12 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I quote:\n\n       He has endeavored to prevent the population of these \n     States; for that purpose obstructing the laws of \n     Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to \n     encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions \n     of new appropriations of lands.\n\n  That is the language of the Declaration of Independence.\n  One of the grievances against King George III, in the immortal words \nof Thomas Jefferson, was limitations on immigration: ``Endeavoring to \nprevent the population of these States.'' That was an original \nformulation, an original idea at the heart of the United States.\n  Looked at in the context of our history, this debate we are having \nthis week is somewhat disappointing but not surprising. It is serious \nin its particulars, but it is amazing in its totality.\n  Here we have a roomful of descendants of immigrants arguing about the \nconditions of immigration. Sure, most of our ancestors in this room \nentered the country legally, but that was because there were virtually \nno laws about immigration for the majority of our history. For most of \nour history, if a person could pay the cost, a person could enter the \ncountry. That is the fundamental premise of America.\n  What are we afraid of? Are we afraid of people with courage, people \nwith imagination, people with initiative, people with perseverance?\n  Before coming to this body, I taught at Bowdoin College in Maine a \ncourse on leaders and leadership and we attempted to define the \nqualities of leadership. At the end of the course each year we took an \nanalysis of what we had seen, and people with courage, imagination, \ninitiative, and perseverance are leaders. Those are the people we want \nin this country. That is what it takes to come here. That is what it \nhas taken to come here throughout our history.\n  And why are they coming? They are coming for opportunity. They are \ncoming for freedom. They are coming for a better life for their \nchildren, the same reason our ancestors came here. Isn't this what we \nall want--opportunity, freedom, and a better life for our kids?\n  Does this discussion affect the State of Maine? Well, yes, it does. \nWe have migrants and immigrants picking our crops in northern Maine, \nblueberries and potatoes and broccoli. We have a vibrant refugee and \nasylum-seeking community in Portland, ME, and in Lewiston. Many of \nthose from Africa come here with very different cultures. We have 52 \nlanguages spoken in the Portland public schools. Yes, we have strains \nand difficulties adjusting one culture to another. But we are making it \nwork and it is making our State richer spiritually, culturally, \nintellectually, and, yes, financially. It is working.\n  But isn't this discussion all about amnesty? I keep hearing about \namnesty. The mail I get says, Don't let them get amnesty. No, it is not \nabout amnesty. In my book, amnesty is a free pass. Amnesty is a ``get \nout of jail free'' card; it is a forgiveness. If a person is convicted \nof what we call in our State OUI--other places call it DWI--if a person \nis convicted of driving under the influence, that person pays a fine, \nloses their license, and sometimes they spend a few days in jail and \nthey are under a suspension or a probationary period for several months \nor perhaps even several years. But when it is all over--when a person \nhas paid their fine and had their suspension--they get their license \nback and they move on with their life and go from there. Nobody calls \nthat amnesty when a person gets their license back at the end of that \nperiod after they have paid their debt to society.\n  I would argue that a fine, which is contained in this bill, and 13 \nyears of what constitutes probation is not amnesty. It is not amnesty \nin anybody's book. People who are talking about calling it amnesty--\nthat is not accurate.\n  Why is this debate so important? Why is this issue so important? Why \nis this bill so important? In my view, immigration is the mainspring of \nAmerica. It is our secret sauce. It is what has made us who we are. No \nother country in the history of the world has been built the way this \ncountry was built. Except for the African Americans who were brought \nhere against their will and the Native Americans who were here when the \nEuropeans arrived, everybody else here came by virtue of immigration, \nand that immigration is, I believe, what has separated us from the rest \nof the world. It is the\n\n[[Page S4734]]\n\nconstant flow of new energy, initiative, and ideas, different cultures, \ndifferent religions, different backgrounds, and different creative \nenergies that have made this country what it is today. If we unduly \nlimit it or cut it off, we are sunk.\n  We are living in a negative demographic timebomb. Last year, I \nbelieve for the first time in American history, we had more deaths than \nbirths of White Americans. One doesn't have to be a mathematician to \nknow if that continues, we will shrink and shrivel as a society. We \nneed immigration to add to our population, to add to the ideas and \ncreativity.\n  What would we lose if we unduly limited immigration in this country? \nWell, I am standing in the shoes of Olympia Snowe, the daughter of \nGreek immigrants. Before Olympia Snowe, the holder of this office was \nGeorge Mitchell, the son of immigrants. Before George Mitchell it was \nEd Muskie, one of the great legislators of the 20th century in America \nand the son of an immigrant Polish tailor. We have among our number now \na brilliant young Senator from Texas who himself is the son of an \nimmigrant.\n  Immigrants are always going to be different and a little scary, and \nthat has been true throughout American history. We have had waves of \nimmigrations: Italians, Germans, Scottish people, Chinese, Irish. It is \nhard for us to believe, but a lot of the same sort of uneasiness about \nnew immigrants was applied to those groups. In New York in the 1800s, \nif a person went to apply for a job there might be a sign in the window \nof the store that said ``employees needed, jobs available,'' and then \nin parentheses it might say in big letters, ``NINA''--N-I-N-A. NINA \nstood for ``No Irish Need Apply.'' So uneasiness and fear and, yes, \nsome prejudice against immigrants has been a part of our history. But \nin the end, those people are the very people who have built this \ncountry, literally, and who have made this country what it is.\n  It is who we are.\n  There is also talk I have heard about wages and how all of these new \npeople are going to depress wages. Indeed, a couple of weeks ago I had \na meeting on my schedule in Maine with a union group and all it said \nwas ``union group to discuss immigration.'' I thought, These folks are \ngoing to be worried about wages and they are going to tell me this is a \nbad idea. Just the opposite. What they said was, We support the bill, \nSenator. We want immigration reform because now we have millions of \npeople in this country who are in the shadows who don't have the \nbenefits of the labor protections and that is what is drawing wages \ndown. That is what is providing a downward motion on wages and \nbenefits. When an employer knows he or she has that kind of leverage \nover an employee--if a person doesn't take the low salary or sometimes \nno salary at all--they may say, I am going to report you; you will be \ngone and deported, and that is an inherently uneven and unfair playing \nfield.\n  That is why I believe, and I think the CBO report has confirmed, that \nfixing this problem--putting the people who are here on a pathway to \nearn citizenship--will actually be a gigantic stimulus to our country.\n\n  So what we are doing here is very important. Yes, I know, we need \ncontrols, we need border controls. We need to control terrorism and \ncriminals coming into our country. And, yes, I know we shouldn't reward \nbreaking the law. But 13 years of probation and a fine is not rewarding \nlaw-breaking. Again, we have to ask, Why did these people break the \nlaw? They broke the law for the same reason our ancestors came here, \nand the only reason they didn't break the law was there was no law to \nbreak at that time. But they came here for opportunity and for a better \nlife for their children.\n  I have quoted Mark Twain before on this floor and I will probably do \nso repeatedly because he captures so many thoughts so succinctly. In \nthis case, what he said was: ``History doesn't always repeat itself, \nbut it usually rhymes.''\n  This discussion we are having here today is nothing new in American \nhistory. It has arisen time after time. It arose in the 1840s and 1850s \nwhen indeed a whole political party came up that was designed to keep \npeople out. It was called the Know-Nothing Party. The reason it was \ncalled that was because when people asked the members of the party what \nthey stood for, the members of the party would say they didn't know \nanything about that because they didn't want to talk about it. But they \nwere antiforeigner and anti-Catholic and it was designed to lock in the \nethnic and cultural society as it stood in 1850.\n  Abraham Lincoln was asked, when he was a member of the Illinois \nlegislature--I wish he had been a member of the Maine legislature but I \nhave to concede him to Illinois--how he felt about the Know-Nothings \nand whether he in fact was a Know-Nothing. Here is what he said:\n\n       I am not a Know-Nothing. How could I be? How can anyone who \n     abhors the oppression of Negroes be in favor of degrading \n     other classes of white people? Our progress in degeneracy \n     appears to me to be pretty rapid. As a nation we began by \n     declaring ``all men are created equal.'' We now practically \n     read it, ``all men are created equal except Negroes.'' With \n     the Know-Nothings in charge it will read, ``all men are \n     created equal, except Negroes and foreigners and Catholics.''\n\n  He ended pretty toughly. He said:\n\n       When it comes to this I should prefer emigrating to some \n     country where they make no pretense of loving liberty--to \n     Russia, for example, where despotism can be taken pure and \n     without the base alloy of hypocrisy.\n\n  I am not suggesting hypocrisy on the part of the people who are \ndebating this bill, but I do think this is not a new debate and we \ncan't fear new people coming into our country.\n  I believe this bill represents a fair-minded resolution of the \ncurrent conflict over immigration: control of the border to stem the \ntide of illegal immigration; penalties applied to those who broke the \nlaw; but an opportunity to earn citizenship after paying the penalty \nand a lengthy period of what amounts to probation.\n  I don't think this debate is about fences and fines and learning \nEnglish. It is about America itself: confusing, chaotic, creative, at \ntimes unsettling, but always erring on the side of freedom and \nopportunity.\n  We have young people coming to this country who want and will achieve \nan education and then we send them home. In my view, we should staple a \ngreen card to every diploma of every foreign student the moment they \nwalk through that graduation line so they can bring their ideas and \ncreativity to our society.\n  The constant infusion of new blood, new people, and new ideas isn't a \nthreat, it is who we are and it is what made us what we are--again, in \nthe words of Abraham Lincoln--``the last, best hope of Earth.''\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would ask notice from the Chair after I \nhave expended 10 minutes of my 12-minute time so I know I have a couple \nof minutes remaining, please.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 8 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair. I wish to get a 2-minute notice, \nplease.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I have been here numerous times over the \nlast couple of weeks to talk about why the essential bargain that needs \nto underlie this bill has to be one that is not based on phony promises \nsuch as the ones made in the past about restoring legality and order to \nour broken immigration system. It actually needs a mechanism that will \ncompel results and realign all of the incentives for people across the \npolitical spectrum, Republicans and Democrats alike, to make sure \nCongress, and the executive branch in particular, keep their promises \nwhen it comes to border security. That is what my amendment is about \nand that is what we will be voting on perhaps in the next half-hour.\n  The underlying metrics contained in my amendment are derived from \nthose in the underlying bill: 100-percent situational awareness and 90-\npercent apprehension. Some people may question\n\n[[Page S4735]]\n\nthat and say, How can we have 100-percent situational awareness? The \nfact is by using the technology currently deployed in places such as \nAfghanistan and Iraq. Technology such as that was featured in a Los \nAngeles Times article a few weeks ago called the VADER, a type of radar \npilot that was being tested on the western part of the border. With it \nwe can do a comprehensive job of seeing the border.\n  I am not talking about a Border Patrol agent seeing three people \ncoming across the border and not seeing a handful of others who scamper \nacross in some other place. I am not talking about that sort of \nimprecision. I am talking about using available technology such as \nthat, for example, demonstrated by AT AT recently came in and \ndemonstrated in my office the use of fiberoptic cable to create, in \nessence, an acoustic system which will identify people crossing the \nborder and which then will trigger cameras to focus on the individual \ncoming across to make sure it is not a deer or a javelina, that it is \nactually what the Border Patrol should be focused on; that is, people \ncrossing the border illegally.\n\n  They could basically lay that cable down the entire U.S.-Mexican \nborder for, I think they told me, somewhere on the order of $80 \nmillion. It is a lot of money, but it is not too much when it comes to \nsecuring our border.\n  Likewise, I mentioned the VADER technology. I know there are fixed \ntowers and radar systems and camera systems that are being used by the \nmilitary that need to be used by the Department of Homeland Security \nwhen it comes to protecting our border and keeping our commitments to \nkeeping America safe.\n  There are dirigibles, I will call them, blimps that are used \nsuccessfully in places such as Afghanistan and which should provide an \nability to see a huge stretch of the border, using, again, radar and \ncameras. So this idea of situational awareness--that that is somehow \nnot possible--simply ignores the technological advances that have been \nmade and deployed by our U.S. military in Afghanistan and Iraq and \nwhich could be deployed if we had the political will to make it happen \nalong the southwestern border.\n  I do not think it is too much to ask that of the people you actually \nsee, that the Border Patrol ought to detain 90 percent. Right now, \naccording to the Government Accountability Office--in 2011--our border \nis only 45 percent under operational control--45 percent. So that \nmeans, if you do the rough arithmetic, out of the 350,000 people who \nwere detained coming across our border last year maybe the Border \nPatrol seizes and detains half of the people. Who knows what it is. We \nare guessing. We know the enumerator, but we do not know the \ndenominator. So we need to deploy the technology and assets we have in \norder to meet that goal.\n  Again, I would refer to the New York Times article I talked about a \nmoment ago of June 19. The headline: ``Two G.O.P. Senators Are Close to \na Deal on Border Security.'' This refers to the efforts of our \ncolleagues Senator Corker and Senator Hoeven. I have applauded them \npublicly, and I will do so again in making sure under their agreement--\nwhich we have not yet seen, and we understand we will see language \nmaybe tonight--they have helped make sure that we focus more assets on \nthe border security issue. I think they have added very constructively \nto this process, but I think the problem is--and we will have to wait \nuntil we see the language--under this pending agreement it says they \nhave agreed to make the 90-percent apprehension rate a goal rather than \na requirement--a goal.\n  Well, the American people will not be fooled. When Congress says to \nthe American people, on something as important as border security: \nTrust us, it reminds me of the old sort of lame joke that the most \nfeared words in the English language are: I am from the government, and \nI am here to help.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. CORNYN. We are saying, in essence, on border security: We are \nfrom the government. Trust us. We have an aspirational goal to actually \nsecure the border, but you have no guarantee that it will be done.\n  That is why my amendment is so important, because what it does is not \ncreate any sort of punitive effect, but it realigns all of the \nincentives for people across the political spectrum--Republicans and \nDemocrats alike--to make sure the executive branch and the bureaucracy \nkeep their commitments when it comes to border security. Then I believe \nthe American people, demonstrating their typical generosity and \ncompassion, will say: Yes, we need to find a humane way to deal with \nthe 11 million people who are here.\n  Mr. President, I have a sheet in front of me entitled ``What They Are \nSaying About Border Security Metrics.'' This sheet has excerpts from a \nnumber of experts in the border security area who talk about the \nimportance not just of measuring inputs--how many Border Patrol agents, \nhow many drones, how many radar; I call those inputs--what they say is \nthat we actually need outputs, we need results, and we need metrics or \nmeasuring sticks to be able to show we are making progress toward the \nintended goal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this document citing these experts be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote to take up my amendment. I understand \nthe majority leader will likely move to table it in short order. I hope \nmy colleagues will vote no on that motion to table because I think this \nis an important building block in terms of restoring Congress's and the \nFederal Government's credibility when it comes to our broken \nimmigration system.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n           What They Are Saying About Border Security Metrics\n\n       ``Immigration reform proposals need to identify clearer \n     goals for border security and ways to measure success rather \n     than simply increasing resources.''--Greg Chen & Su Kim, \n     Border Security: Moving Beyond Past Benchmarks (Amer. \n     Immigration Lawyers Ass'n, Jan. 2013), at 1.\n       ``Strategic planning is necessary if [DHS] is to carry out \n     its border-security missions effectively and efficiently.

Brown, Measuring the \n     Effectiveness of Border Security Between Ports-of-Entry (RAND \n     Corp.: Homeland Security and Defense Center, 2010), at xi.\n       ``At present, evidence of significant improvements in \n     border control relies primarily on metrics regarding resource \n     increases and reduced apprehension levels, rather than on \n     actual deterrence measures, such as size of illegal flows, \n     share of the flow being apprehended, or changing recidivism \n     rates of unauthorized crossers. The ability of immigration \n     agencies and DHS to reliably assess and persuasively \n     communicate border enforcement effectiveness will require \n     more sophisticated measures and analyses of enforcement \n     outcomes.''--Doris Meissner et al., Immigration Enforcement \n     in the United States: The Rise of a Formidable Machinery, \n     (Migration Policy Inst., Jan. 2013), at 6.\n       ``Consternation and skepticism have been among the main \n     reactions to the Border Patrol's new border security \n     strategy. The Border Patrol's failure to define what was \n     really new about the strategy, the plan's lack of details, \n     and the absence of any metrics to measure the agency's \n     progress underscored existing concerns about the Border \n     Patrol's fuzzy strategic focus and lack of \n     accountability.''--Tom Barry, The Border Patrol's Strategic \n     Muddle: How the Nation's Border Guardians Got Stuck in a \n     Policy Conundrum, and How They Can Get Out (Center for Int'l \n     Policy, Dec. 2012), at 8.\n       ``For two decades, the only issue for border security has \n     been `how much more?' shift in the debate is overdue. \n     Congress should be demanding the best answers on what all \n     those enforcement dollars have purchased, and insist on \n     better performance measures in the future.''--Edward Alden, \n     Time to Measure Progress at the Border With Mexico (Geo. \n     Washington Univ.

May I ask, Mr. President, how much of my time remains?\n\n[[Page S4736]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this legislation has been pending on the \nfloor since the beginning of last week. We should have started \ndisposing of amendments during the first week the bill was on the \nSenate floor. But we have seen objection after objection by those who \nare opposed--and they are very much in the minority--to this \nlegislation. They objected to proceeding to comprehensive immigration \nreform. That cost us several days. To show that they are a minority, we \nfinally ended that filibuster so we could proceed to the bill with 84 \nSenators voting to proceed.\n  I realize some would rather not have any votes one way or the other. \nThat allows someone to go home and say, whether they are for or against \nit, yes, I am working on that because I voted maybe. Well, is there any \nwonder why we are at such a low level of approval in the American \npeople's eyes, the whole Congress? They expect us to vote yes or no. \nSometimes you have to vote for something that is unpopular. Well, we \nare elected to 6-year terms. We are supposed to do that. We are \nsupposed to represent over 300 million Americans, 100 of us. The \nAmerican people do not want us to delay and delay so we do not have to \nvote, so we can go back home and say: Oh, I am on your side, no matter \nwhat your side is. No. They expect us to vote yes or no even though it \nmay be controversial.\n  Last week and this week I have been working closely with the majority \nleader and Senator Grassley and others to make progress. We started \nvoting on amendments in an orderly fashion, but we still faced \nobjections. There have been 250 amendments filed to this bill. So far, \nwe have considered 11--11 votes, endless delays. We could be spending \nmonths on it. The American people expect us to have the courage to vote \nyes or no.\n  A lot of Senators who are not on the Judiciary Committee have \namendments. Some of these amendments are noncontroversial. Many have \nwidespread support. There ought to be a way to just adopt those. Some \nof these amendments are controversial. Well, then, let's vote on them. \nIn the Judiciary Committee, we considered a total of 212 amendments \nover an extensive markup, 35 hours of debate. More than half of the \namendments considered were offered by Republican members of the \ncommittee. We adopted 135 amendments to improve this legislation. All \nbut three were passed with both Democratic and Republican votes.\n  I hope Republicans will join me in making an effort to dispose of the \nmany noncontroversial items. The amendments, including the managers' \namendment, are noncontroversial. They have widespread support. They \nhave been filed by Senators on both sides over the past two weeks, and \nmany have already been discussed at length on the Senate floor. The \npackage contains bipartisan amendments to improve oversight of certain \nimmigration programs. It also contains non-controversial technical \namendments.\n  I see the distinguished majority leader on the floor. I am going to \nyield the floor. I am going to speak on this further, but my whole \npoint is that we have all kinds of noncontroversial amendments \ncosponsored by Republicans and Democrats alike, both Republicans and \nDemocrats on the same amendment. We ought to be adopting them and not \nstalling because a stall says: I want to vote maybe. I do not want to \nvote yes or no, I want to vote maybe.\n  I have served in this body longer than any current Member. I have \nserved here with nearly one-fifth of the Senators who have had the \nprivilege of serving in the body since the beginning of the country. I \nhave known great Republicans and great Democrats who must be \nwondering--in the past--what are we doing?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have not heard all of my friend's \nstatement. We have a list of 27 amendments that the chair has come up \nwith that are noncontroversial. One of them I was surprised we could \nnot put on the list because a Republican Senator objected because they \nthought it was controversial that we should do things in this bill, the \nimmigration bill, for the best interests of the child. That is \ncontroversial. That surprised me.\n  Mr. LEAHY. You know, I hear a lot of speeches that we should support \nfamily values, as both the Senator from Nevada and I do, but when you \ntry to put it in a bill--that it is obviously a family value, \nprotecting children--then we have an objection. Well, if you do not \nlike the amendment, vote against it. Let's vote on it.\n  Mr. REID. While Senator Landrieu was here on the floor last night, we \nhad a colloquy back and forth for a little bit. My friend the chairman \nof the committee and I can lament about the days when we would bring a \nbill to the floor and--the Energy and Water appropriations bill. The \ntwo of us have been longtime members of the Appropriations Committee. \nSenators Bennett, Johnson, and I, Pete Domenici, when he was the \nranking member with me--we would do the Energy and Water bill in a \ncouple of hours, a bill that was extremely important for the country. \nIt provided security for nuclear weaponry. But now we do not do that \nanymore. We have 27 amendments here. It is a sad commentary on things. \nBut these things would be accepted not in a managers' amendment, they \nwould just be done by unanimous consent. But, anyway, we cannot do \nthat.\n  Mr. President, I call for regular order with respect to the Cornyn \namendment No. 1251.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. REID. I move to table the Cornyn amendment. I ask unanimous \nconsent that there be 2 minutes equally divided prior to the vote on my \nmotion to table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the majority leader has moved to table my \namendment which provides a guarantee of actual results rather than \nfalse promises, which have been the sad litany of most of our history \nwhen it comes to immigration reform and border security.\n  Starting in 1986, when Ronald Reagan signed an amnesty for 3 million \npeople premised on enforcement, the American people, in their typical \ngenerosity and compassion, accepted that based on the representation it \nwould never happen again. In 1996, 17 years ago, President Bill Clinton \nsigned into law the requirement for a biometric entry-exit system, \nwhich would address the 40 percent of illegal immigration that occurs \nbecause people enter legally, simply stay, and melt into the great \nAmerican landscape, unless they happen to commit a crime or are \notherwise caught by law enforcement.\n  We cannot ask the American people to trust us because of this litany \nand sad story of broken promises when it comes to immigration reform. \nThat is why we need real enforcement, why my amendment needs to pass \nand not be tabled.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I support the tabling of the amendment. \nThere may be some good parts in it, but most of it is bad. The billions \nof additional taxpayer dollars I cannot support, with all of the \nbillions we already have in here.\n  The biggest reason I will not support it is because it imposes new \nunrealistic triggers. It says to people, we want to give you the \npathway to citizenship, but, guess what. We are going to keep the door \nclosed. You can pretend you are going to get citizenship, but we are \ngoing to make it impossible as we have a fully biometric entry-exit \nsystem at all air and seaports as a trigger.\n\n[[Page S4737]]\n\n  Most airports will not be able to do this, certainly not the little \nairports many of us use to fly in and out. That is unrealistic.\n  I appreciate the effort the Senator from Texas has put into this \namendment. But I must strongly oppose it.\n  This amendment would impose new, unrealistic triggers that must be \nmet before the pathway to citizenship becomes a reality.\n  To take one example, the amendment includes a fully biometric exit \nsystem at all air and seaports as a trigger before those in provisional \nstatus can earn green cards. But this presents extensive technological \nand infrastructure challenges that could take many years to fully \naddress. U.S. airports were not designed to accommodate immigration \nexit lanes, where biometrics could be collected.\n  This approach will not work. An attainable pathway to citizenship is \na central component of this bill. It is how we will bring people out of \nthe shadows so that we know who is here and can focus instead on who is \ndangerous--a critical step if we are serious about national security.\n  The triggers in this amendment will have the opposite effect. They \nare unrealistic. People will not come forward and register if they \nbelieve that they will remain in limbo.\n  In addition to making the triggers unattainable, the amendment also \nmakes the pathway to citizenship unfair and irrationally difficult. It \nwould make immigrants ineligible for Registered Provisional Immigrant \n(RPI) status if they have been convicted of a single misdemeanor \noffense related to domestic violence and child abuse.\n  I know this may sound reasonable on its face and we all agree that \ndomestic violence is unacceptable and that abusers should be punished \nfor their crimes. I am concerned, however, that this amendment may have \nthe unintended consequence of harming the very victims it seeks to \nprotect.\n  When we considered a similar proposal in committee, more than 150 \norganizations who work with the victims of domestic violence expressed \ntheir concerns that such a measure would have a chilling effect on \nreporting, and could even lead to victims getting caught up in the \ncriminal justice system. That's why the committee rejected the \nproposal.\n  The amendment would also dramatically increase the cost of the bill. \nIt would require billions of additional taxpayer dollars be spent on \nthe border each year. At some point, we must simply say that is too \nmuch. This amendment reaches that point.\n  This amendment does have some good provisions in it. It takes steps \nthat would help facilitate cross-border travel and commerce by \nimproving land ports of entry. I would welcome the opportunity to work \nwith the Senator from Texas on a few of those proposals.\n  But overall, the amendment goes much too far, and I cannot support \nit.\n  I strongly oppose this amendment, and I would vote to table the \namendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the managers of this bill and floor staff \nare working to try to come up with a path forward on this legislation.\n  We have a number of Senators who are concerned about amendments that \nthey feel are not controversial, and that is one track we are trying to \ncome up with.\n  The other track is a number of Senators are working with the Gang of \n8 to come up with a major amendment dealing with, as I understand, \nborder security and a number of other things. I am also told that \namendment is being drafted by legislative counsel. So I hope we can \nhave that amendment soon so people can look at it, and I hope we can do \nsomething with the noncontroversial amendments.\n  In the meantime, we have to understand this is not easy to do. But I \nthink we have a path forward. I am grateful to everyone for being as \nunderstanding as they are, because legislation is not easy, especially \non a major piece of legislation such as this.\n  But I do say this: This is not one of those bills that suddenly \nappeared on the Senate floor. People have been working on this \nlegislation for months. For months the Gang of 8 has been working on \nthis. We had one of the most thorough markups in recent history in the \nSenate. Hundreds of amendments were considered, scores were accepted--\nDemocratic amendments, Republican amendments. So this legislation we \nhave on the floor is not as if suddenly it is here and not much has \nbeen done about it.\n  Again, I repeat what I said before: We are trying to find a way \nforward.\n  Mr. President, in the meantime, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nToomey, Senator Landrieu, and then Senator Cruz be recognized for 10 \nminutes each in the sequence I just mentioned.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I wish to begin by commending my many \ncolleagues who put a lot of time and effort into this bill and attempts \nto refine it through this amendment process. But I have to say, with \nall due respect, I think a great portion of the debate we have been \nhaving in this body misses the fundamental point, the most important \naspect of what we ought to be addressing in immigration.\n  We have spent a lot of time working on and talking about what we do \nwith the people who are here illegally, and there is a path to \ncitizenship in this underlying bill for these folks.\n  We have talked an awful lot about border security. And border \nsecurity is an important issue. But I am strongly of the view that \nwhile that is important, border security reform is not sufficient to \nsolve the immigration problem we have. I would point out that however \nhigh we choose to build a wall on our border, someone can always build \na ladder that is 1 foot taller.\n  I think the most important part of this whole debate ought to be \nabout, What do we do about the next wave of immigrants, the next group \nof people who want to come to this country--future immigration that is \ncertainly going to happen? I think to address that we have to think \nabout what drives the immigration that has been happening, much of \nwhich has been illegal.\n  I think what drives it is poor people who have very meager prospects \nwho want to come to a rich country where there are great opportunities. \nIt is people who want to work hard and build a better life for \nthemselves and their families. It happens to be the exact same thing \nthat drove every previous wave of immigration.\n\n[[Page S4738]]\n\n  I think about the 25-year-old Mexican guy in central Mexico who lives \nin a poor community where prospects are grim and the standard of living \nis miserable. He wants to come here to build a better life, and he does \nso in the same way my grandparents in Ireland and my great-grandparents \nin Portugal wanted to come here, for the exact same reason.\n  My ancestors had very little education and no skills. They came to \nthis country to work, and that is what they did. When they did that, \nthey didn't weaken America, they didn't weaken our economy. They helped \nto build this country, they helped to build this economy, as all of our \nancestors did. That is true of immigrants who want to come here and \nwork, and we ought to have a legal avenue that allows these people who \nwant to build a better life for themselves and, in the process, will \nbuild a better America--we ought to allow that to happen.\n  In my view, this bill doesn't go nearly far enough in accommodating \nthe legal immigration we could and should have in this country, \nespecially with respect to low-skilled workers.\n  I will be the first to say the bill makes a lot of progress for high-\nskilled workers in two big areas: the H-1B visa. The cap that has been \ntoo low for too long is significantly raised. And although we have \ncreated hoops that people have to go through that are probably \nunnecessary, it is progress that we have a much higher cap.\n  There is also a new opportunity for graduate students in the STEM \nfields to get green cards, in time, and that is very constructive. \nThese people come here with a great deal of human capital, intellectual \ncapital, they are trained in fields where we need these skills, and the \nlast thing we should do is send them home to compete against us. It is \nterrific that this bill addresses that by welcoming these folks.\n  But for the category of low-skilled nonagricultural legal \nimmigration, this bill is wildly inadequate. I say that because the \nvisa that is created to accommodate these folks I think has terribly \nlow caps. In the first year, the cap is a mere 20,000 people. The next \nyear it is 35. It goes up to 75 eventually. These are absurdly low \nnumbers by any reasonable measure. Frankly, you could consider this the \nanti-immigration bill because these numbers are so low, and this is the \ncategory where there is the greatest interest in immigrating.\n\n  I would point out that early in the last decade, according to the Pew \nHispanic Center, there were 800,000 people coming here every year. In \n2007, the Kennedy-McCain immigration reform bill was reported out of \ncommittee with the support of Senator Kennedy, and that allowed for \n400,000 guest worker visas each year.\n  Yesterday or the day before, the CBO came out with a score of this \nunderlying bill, and interestingly they predict that fully 75 percent \nof all future illegal immigration that is expected under current law \nwill occur under this bill. I think part of the reason is because we \nare not providing an adequate legal avenue for people who want to come \nhere and work hard.\n  So I have an amendment. I will have more to say about this later, but \nI want to mention this to my colleagues and urge their consideration. \nIt is an amendment that lifts the cap each year. The first year it \ntakes the cap up to 200,000. It then goes to 250,000, 300,000, and \nfinally 350,000 in the fourth year.\n  I would point out that these caps on the W visas--the low-skilled \nworker visas--would still be lower in the fourth year than Senator \nKennedy agreed to in the first year, a few years ago. It doesn't change \nthe wage protections that are in the underlying bill. A worker would \nstill need a sponsoring employer. All of those provisions stay the \nsame. But we at least would increase the opportunity of people who want \nto come here legally and work hard to build a better life.\n  I know some of my friends, especially on the other side, are going to \noppose this. But I will tell you, if we do not raise the caps for the \nlow-skilled workers who want to come to this country, then the next \nwave of illegal immigration is guaranteed regardless of what we do at \nthe border. Anybody who thinks more legal immigration of people who \nwant to come here and work hard for themselves and their family is \nharmful to our economy or to America and we need to keep those people \nout, as, I am afraid to say, this bill does, that is a profound \nmisreading of American history. Throughout all of our history, from \nbefore we even became an independent Republic, the story of America has \nbeen one wave of immigrants after another. And while millions of people \nwere coming to this country, what was happening to America? We were \nbecoming richer. Wages were rising, our economy was growing, our \nstandard of living was increasing. That is what happens when people \ncome here to work; they increase the size of our economy.\n  We shouldn't view our economy as a pie where we are all fighting for \na slice and we don't want somebody else to get a bigger slice, because \nwhat happens when people come here through a legal system to work hard \nis they increase the size of the pie. They are consumers, they become \ninvestors, they become contributors to our economy and to our country, \njust as every single wave previous to them--including my grandparents \nand all of our ancestors--did as well.\n  I think this is the central challenge: Fix the broken immigration \nsystem so we won't have the next wave of illegal immigration, so we can \ncontinue to build a stronger economy that these folks will help to \nbuild. I think we need to address these caps as a part of the process \nof doing that.\n  I want to thank my colleague, Senator Johnson from Wisconsin, for \ncosponsoring this amendment. I know a number of other colleagues are \ninterested in sponsoring this. I will have more to say about this later \nin the week or next week, but I think this is a very important topic \nthat we need to address in this debate.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the time and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I came to the floor to speak about and \nfollow up on a 2-hour debate we had last night on the floor about \namendments pending to this bill that are uncontested.\n  But before I do, let me acknowledge the leadership for allowing \nSenator Toomey to come to the floor and offer his amendment. It is not \none--although he has made some good points--that I can agree with or \nothers will agree with. But at least he had the opportunity to come to \nthe floor, present his amendment and ideas, make his arguments, and \nhopefully at some time the Senate can vote on that amendment. That is \nthe process.\n  In the underlying bill, these quotas and goals and numbers of visas \nwere carefully and very fragilely compromised among Democrats and \nRepublicans that serve as the basis of the underlying bill. So any \nmajor adjustments to that would undermine a comprehensive immigration \nbill.\n  The bill we have to consider is not the perfect bill. We could have \nall written it differently. But the overriding objective to fix a \nsystem that is broken, to secure the border, to require taxes be paid, \nEnglish spoken, behind the line after people who have come here \nlegally, close these borders, improve technology, and give an economic \nimpact to this country overrides, in my view, these important but not \nmajor issues.\n  Having said that, there is an issue that I think deserves a \ntremendous amount of attention, and it is not just one amendment, it is \n27 amendments. The issue is there are currently 278 amendments filed, \nincluding Senator Toomey's amendment. So besides his, there are 277 \namendments pending to this bill.\n  Senator Harry Reid has said actually for 6 weeks now that he wants \nthis bill finished by July 4. Because the leadership has not been able \nto negotiate--which is very difficult, I understand; some of these are \nvery controversial amendments and who is going to get votes on what, et \ncetera, et cetera--it has really slowed us down.\n  I am not new to the Senate. I have seen this happen before. I am not \nwhining about it; I am acknowledging that is the world in which we \nlive. There is no magic button that can be pushed to fix this, but what \nwe can do is come together in a trusting way to pass uncontested \namendments--amendments that are not contested on the Republican side \nand that are not contested on the Democratic side. I am aware of about \n27.\n\n[[Page S4739]]\n\n  The staff, both Republicans and Democrats, has been working through \nthe night to identify off the list of 277 amendments besides that of \nSenator Toomey, some of those that are actually really good ideas that \nRepublicans and Democrats agree to, that do not upset the balance of \nthe bill, do not spend any major additional funding or minor funding, \nthat are in the principle and scope of the bill. It is our \nresponsibility as Senators to legislate. That is what we are trying to \ndo.\n  I would like to read this list of amendments that to my knowledge \nhave no contest. No one is opposing them. This is a list that was put \ntogether by Republicans and Democrats. Perhaps there is another list of \nwhich I am unaware. My only goal is to get the Senate to accept \namendments that are uncontested, that improve the bill, because that is \nwhat we are sent here to do.\n  I see the ranking member on the floor. I will yield in a minute, but \nI am going to take my full time and I will stay on the floor until we \ncan resolve these things.\n  But I point out that there are only 17 members of the Judiciary \nCommittee. I am not one of them. Those 17 members of the Judiciary \nCommittee, led by Senator Leahy and ably by Ranking Member Grassley, \nmet for 2 weeks, morning, noon, and night, hours and hours. Senator \nGrassley himself filed 77 amendments, and 38 were considered, 16 were \nadopted, and 22 were rejected. Senator Grassley as the ranking member \nis entitled to more amendments than anyone. The chair gets the most, \nthe ranking member gets the second most, and I think that is actually \nwhat happened.\n  The problem for those of us who are not members of the Judiciary \nCommittee, who are not authorized to offer amendments at the committee \nlevel because we are not on the committee--although we can informally \nwork with members, and I did that, as many Members did because we know \nwhat our job is around here--the only way we can have input into this \nbill acting on behalf of constituents who have come to us with very \ngood ideas.\n  Let me say the best ideas come not only from the little group here in \nWashington. We have very smart people out in the rest of the United \nStates who follow things very carefully. They call their Senators and \nRepresentatives--elected officials, nonprofit groups, citizens, \nbusinesspeople--and say: I read the bill. I am thinking this might be a \nbetter idea.\n  We get our staffs to work on it, and, voila, that is how many \namendments come forward.\n  What I am so angry about--and I will use the power I have as a \nSenator to push this point--is that when these ideas come and we have \nRepublicans and Democrats supporting them, we cannot even get a process \nto get these uncontested good ideas forward because we give all the \ntime and attention to the most controversial amendments. They are \nusually the ones that have no chance of passing whatsoever, that are \nmessage amendments for both sides, that undermine the bill we are \ntrying to work on, and our ability to legislate has gone out the \nwindow. I am not going to be a Senator with that window closed, so I \nplan to open it. I am going to use all the power of my office to open \nthe window of opportunity to legislate.\n  I am going to ask for 3 more minutes to read something into the \nRecord. I have a list of amendments in front of me, starting with \nSenator Begich, 1285; Cardin and Kirk, 1286; Carper, 1408; Carper-\nCoburn, 1344; Collins, as modified, 1255; Coats, 1288; Feinstein, 1250; \nHagan, 1386; Heinrich, 1342, Heller, 1234; Kirk and Coons, 1239; \nKlobuchar and Coats, 1261; Landrieu, 1338; Landrieu, 1382; Leahy and \nHatch, 1183; a Leahy technical amendment that has no number; Leahy, EB-\n5 clarification that has no number but is technical; Murray-Crapo, \n1368; Landrieu, 1341; Landrieu-Cochran 1383; Nelson, 1253; Reed, 1223; \nSchatz and Kirk, 1416; Shaheen, 1272; Stabenow, Collins, and King, \n1405; Udall, 1241; and Udall, 1242.\n  To my knowledge, none of these amendments are contested. Some of them \nare Democratic amendments, and some of them are Republican amendments. \nAt some point I am going to ask for these amendments to be included in \nthe base of this bill. I am not going to ask that at this exact moment, \nbut I am going to ask--well, I might ask the chair and ranking member, \nis this a list the Senator recognizes? If not, is there another list I \ncould see, observe, and put into the Record for this discussion? I ask \nthe ranking member of the committee, the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Has the Senator yielded the floor? I don't think I want \nto speak until I have it.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. No, I have not. I understand these amendments to be \nnoncontroversial. It is my understanding that there is no Republican \nopposition to the substance of these amendments. I could be wrong. If \nsomeone can tell me what the substantive objections to these amendments \nare, I will go back to work. I am happy to work on this all day. It is \nvery important. We have several days to finish this. If somebody could \ntell me either in writing or verbally what are any substantive \nobjections to these amendments, I promise I will do the work necessary \nto see what can be done to work them out.\n  I am going to ask because no one has come to me. I filed this list, \ntalked about this 2 hours last night. Everyone knows these amendments. \nEveryone has had a chance to look at them. No one has come to me to say \nthey object to any of these amendments. I am going to simply ask \nunanimous consent for them to be added to the bill.\n  Let me say that after these are added to the bill, we still will \nhave--let me do my math--we still will have 251 amendments to fight \nabout. So, you know, we will really enjoy the fight. I can fight as \ntough as the next guy. But could we possibly get amendments that \nMembers have worked together on?\n  How fascinating that Democrats and Republicans actually worked \ntogether to answer constituent letters and phone calls and concerns \nabout immigration and found a way to work together and put an amendment \ntogether. But, you know what. We go to the back of the line while \neverybody who has not worked, who just wants headlines--and I am not \nspeaking of Senator Grassley. He has done a great job in his \nleadership. But there are others who want to have press conferences and \nheadlines. I do not. I just want to legislate on behalf of the \nconstituents who have sent me here now for three terms.\n  I am going to ask unanimous consent to agree to these uncontested, to \nmy knowledge, amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Is there a time limit for me to speak?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana had 10 minutes, \nwhich has now expired. The Senator from Iowa has no time allocated to \nhim.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Reserving the right to object, and I probably will have \nto object, but let me explain first of all that this is a rare moment \nthat Senator Landrieu and I might be on the opposite side of the fence. \nAnd maybe when this is all done, we will not be on the opposite side of \nthe fence because 99 percent of the time that she and I have \nconversations, it is about foster care and adoption and all those \nthings. But let me speak to my reservation.\n  First of all, we have had this list that she speaks of since at least \nthis morning and maybe even earlier than this morning and we have been \ngoing through it. I will give a bottom line, but I want further \nopportunity to explain.\n  There is now to the chairman's staff a counteroffer that we have that \nI would like to have Senator Landrieu and other Senators take a look \nat. I had an opportunity last night to spend some time speaking with \nSenator Landrieu about this, trying to get a process in place. I guess \nthat process is in place now. We went through these amendments. But \nlet's say, first of all, when there are noncontroversial amendments \npresented to us by the majority party, it means they have stated that \nthey are noncontroversial and we go through the list. We may have a \ndifferent judgment on some of them because it is my conclusion that not \nall of the 27 so-called noncontroversial amendments are, in fact, \nnoncontroversial. Some of them are in\n\n[[Page S4740]]\n\nanother committee's jurisdiction, and we always take the leadership of \nother committees, when they are under other jurisdictions, into \nconsideration.\n  Normally amendments like this would take place in a managers' \namendment that comes near the end of the process because it takes time \nto go through. We could have 100 amendments on a list that somebody \nthinks are noncontroversial, so it takes some time to clear.\n  Despite what has been said, many of these on the list of 27 are not \nnecessarily easy, but we worked on them, we presented an alternative, \nand I ask for that to be discussed. In the meantime, then, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Is there a physical copy of the list you have presented \nto the Democrats? Could it be submitted to the Record?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The chairman's staff has it, and I ask the Senator to \nconsult the chairman.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I would like to ask that that list be read into the \nCongressional Record.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will not submit that list until after the chairman \nresponds.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent for that list to be submitted \nto the Record.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, do I have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent that the time until 2 o'clock \nbe equally divided between the two leaders or their designees and that \nthe majority leader be recognized at 2 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask that I take the Democratic \nleader's time for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Well, I am next because there was just a Republican on \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Texas is in order to be recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. What is the next order, please, after the Senator from \nTexas?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no order.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes after \nthe Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                                 Syria\n\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong concern \nabout President Obama's decision to arm the rebels in Syria. That \ndecision was signaled last week by Deputy National Security Adviser Ben \nRhodes. According to Mr. Rhodes the United States will start supplying \narms to selected rebel groups.\n  I fully understand the seriousness of the situation in Syria. Bashar \nal-Asad is a brutal dictator. Syria has been on the State Department's \nstate sponsor of terrorism list since 1979. For 2 years this brutal \ncivil war has raged, leaving at least 93,000 dead--100 reportedly \nthrough chemical weapons attack. The humanitarian situation in Syria is \na calamity. Millions of people have been displaced.\n  Iran and Russia stand to gain a major strategic victory if Asad \nremains in power, and we have to be concerned about the danger this war \nposes to our allies Israel and Jordan.\n  All Americans would like to see secular, democracy-minded forces in \nSyria come to power, but President Obama's failed policy over the last \n2 years has left us with no good options at this time. In the beginning \nof the uprising, there was a moment when the peaceful protesters could \nhave used the vocal energetic support of the United States. Instead, \nthe Obama administration stood by for months apparently in the hopes \nthey could make Asad see reason. Before long, military hostilities \nbroke out, but President Obama chose not to act, hoping instead to lead \nfrom behind.\n\n  In the course of the war, Asad has benefited from weapons from Iran, \nRussia, and fighters from Hezbollah. Our repeated entreaties to the \nRussians to help us resolve this crisis have fallen on deaf ears--most \nrecently this week when President Obama tried to reach a diplomatic \nsolution with President Putin, to have him once again refuse to be the \ngood-faith partner the administration seems to think he could be.\n  Meanwhile, the most effective, organized Syrian rebels are affiliated \nwith al-Qaida. There are two main al-Qaida entities active in Syria: \nJabhat al-Nusra and the resurgent al-Qaida in Iraq. While recent plans \nto merge them have foundered, they are both powerful and well armed.\n  In recent weeks a training video has been posted on an al-Qaida Web \nsite showing young rebel recruits in Syria singing not only about \noverthrowing Asad, but how ``the World Trade Center was turned into \nrubble.'' To commemorate the 65th anniversary of the founding of Israel \non June 6, al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahiri released a video calling \nfor Syrians to unite, bring down the Asad government, and to create a \nradical Islamic state.\n  On June 9, Zawahiri posted a letter on Al-Jazeera announcing that \nJabhat al-Nusra would be acting on his direct orders. As many as seven \nof the nine rebel groups that have been identified may have ties to al-\nQaida. Yet these murky connections make them all the more difficult to \nproperly vet.\n  As is normally the case when al-Qaida moves in, more and more stories \nare spreading about the desecration of churches, kidnappings, rapes, \nand beheadings. These forces are engaged in a deadly struggle with the \nAsad regime, and President Obama has chosen this moment to signal that \nit is now suddenly in our vital national security interests to \nintervene in Syria. It seems far more likely a recipe for disaster.\n  We are told the United States will provide only small arms and \nammunition and only to the more secular democracy-minded rebels, and \nthat they will not fall into the hands of those who attacked us on \nSeptember 11--not to mention more recently in Fort Hood, Benghazi, and \nBoston--although there are no details as to how the President plans to \ndifferentiate between good and bad actors.\n  Even if we could clearly identify the good rebels, so to speak, we \nwould be backing the weakest of the factions in Syria, and the support \nthe Obama administration has proposed will not be sufficient to bring \ndown Asad and put them in power. Once committed to this path, we risk \neither being forced to incrementally increase our support or face the \nhumiliation of losing to either al-Qaida groups or Asad or both, which \nwould delight both Iran and Russia. We could also see the factions of \nthe opposition use our weapons to turn on each other and see Asad \ntriumph in the chaos.\n  It is far from clear we could get the weapons to the so-called good \nrebels, even if we could figure out who they were. President Obama has \njust announced another $300 million in humanitarian aid for Syria, but \nonly about half of the aid already pledged has been delivered. The \nother hasn't been delivered because of logistical issues and the \nchallenges of keeping these resources out of the hands of bad actors. \nHow on Earth can we expect to deliver guns if we cannot even get MREs \ninto the country?\n  Regardless, let me suggest a simple rule: Don't give weapons to \npeople who hate us. Don't give weapons to people who want to kill us. \nU.S. foreign policy should be directed at one central purpose: \nprotecting the vital national security interests of the United States. \nArming potential al-Qaida rebels is not furthering those interests, but \nthere is something that is: preventing Syria's large stockpile of \nchemical weapons from falling into the hands of terrorists.\n  We know Asad has used these weapons, and there is good reason to \nsuspect the al-Qaida affiliated rebels would use them as well if they \ncould get their hands on them. This poses an intolerable threat not \nonly to our friends in the region but also to the United States. Right \nnow we need to develop a clear, practical plan to go in, locate the \nweapons, secure or destroy them,\n\n[[Page S4741]]\n\nand then get out. We might work in concert with our allies, but this \nneeds to be an operation driven by the mission, not by a coalition.\n  The United States should be firmly in the lead to make sure the job \nis done right, but our British allies, for example, are actively \nbolstering the units that could be used for chemical weapons removal. \nPresident Obama needs to assure us that the dangerous, arbitrary cuts \nto our defense budget caused by sequester have not eroded our ability \nto execute this vital mission.\n  News reports suggest that what planning has gone on involves \noutsourcing parts of this work to the rebel groups. This makes no \nsense. Moreover, it is deeply disturbing that President Obama has \nchosen not to communicate his decision directly to Congress or the \nAmerican people and, I would note, communicating not through a junior \nstaffer or a spokesperson. He, himself, needs to communicate to the \nAmerican people.\n  According to a Pew poll taken over the weekend, 70 percent of \nAmericans oppose arming the Syrian rebels--quite sensibly. In a case \nwhere his policy is so at odds with the will of the people, it is \nbeholden on the President to make his case and persuade us this \nproposed intervention is necessary. But just yesterday in his long \nspeech on national security at the Brandenburg Gate, President Obama \ndid not even mention his planned intervention in Syria. He told us he \nis a ``citizen of the world,'' but he is also President of the United \nStates, and he owes the American people an explanation.\n  President Obama needs to explain why arming the Syrian rebels is now \nworth our intervention when it wasn't 2 years ago. He needs to explain \nhow he has established which rebels are the appropriate recipients of \nthis support. He needs to explain how this limited support will make a \nmaterial difference in Syria, and he needs to assure us that his team \nis proactively planning to protect our national security by keeping \nSyria's chemical weapons out of the hands of either Hezbollah or al-\nQaida. But we don't know any of these specifics. We are apparently just \nsupposed to trust the President to manage Syria policy more effectively \nthan he has over the last 2 years and more effectively than he has \nmanaged events in Iran, Libya, and Egypt.\n\n  During the Green Revolution in 2009, the Obama administration stood \nby and allowed the Supreme Leader of Iran to brutally suppress his \npeople as they protested in the streets. Four years later, we have \nwitnessed the installation of the Supreme Leader's most recent \nselection for President of Iran. Some of the mainstream media refer to \nhim as a ``moderate,'' but he is a man who has referred to Israel as \n``the great Zionist Satan,'' and who vows to continue Iran's nuclear \nprogram. That is some moderate.\n  During the uprising in Tahrir Square in Cairo, President Obama \ncheered on the demonstrators but refused to take a leading role in \nhelping Egypt make the difficult transition to democracy, thereby \nopening the door to a Muslim Brotherhood regime that is now taking \nsystematic steps to hollow out that country's fragile constitution \nwhile turning a blind eye to the persecution of Christians and the \ndiscrimination against women. Just like the rebels in Syria, President \nObama is also working to arm the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.\n  During the revolution in Libya, President Obama decided removing \nMuammar Kaddafi was a vital national security issue, and he \nparticipated in NATO's mission to overturn him. But his strategy of \nleading from behind meant Kaddhafi's weapons stockpiles went unsecured \nand had been transferred to militants from Lebanon to Mali. The new \ngovernment in Libya, however well intentioned, proved incapable of \nmanaging the security threat from terrorist militias in the country, \nand tragically 9 months ago four U.S. personnel were brutally murdered \nin a terrorist attack. We have yet to track down and punish any of the \nterrorists who killed our personnel in that attack in Benghazi. With \nthis track record of incoherent and indecisive action resulting in \nsetback after setback to the United States, we are supposed to just \ntrust President Obama to do a better job managing the situation in \nSyria?\n  It seems to me if we are determined to confront Iran's nuclear \nprogram, we would do so better in Iran. Even if Hezbollah is defeated \nin Syria, there is little prospect that this would halt Iran's nuclear \nprogram.\n  I am also concerned about our ability to successfully negotiate what \nseems to have become a Sunni-Shiite civil war in Syria. It seems to me \nwe have no business in the middle of such a civil war. From what we \nknow of the President's policy, it seems we are backing into an \nintractable crisis where there are no good actors but plenty of bad \noutcomes for America.\n  Let me close with two simple observations: No. 1, don't arm al-Qaida. \nDon't arm those who hate us, and don't arm those who want to kill us. \nThat is basic common sense.\n  No. 2, when it comes to matters of vital national security, the \nPresident of the United States needs to come to the American people. \nWe, the people, hold sovereignty in this country, and it is not \nacceptable for the President to simply send out staffers to pass on his \ndecision. He needs to come before Congress and the American people and \nexplain those decisions.\n  All of us have deep concerns about arming the rebels in Syria, and I \nhope the administration will reconsider its policy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, before the Senator from Texas leaves the \nfloor, could I ask a question unrelated to his speech? I am sorry I \ndidn't get to hear most of it. I stepped off the floor temporarily.\n  The Senator has been so active on the debate on immigration, I wonder \nif the Senator is aware of a list of 27 noncontroversial amendments \nthat are from both Republicans and Democrats. Has the Senator from \nTexas had a chance to look at that list? And if not, could the Senator \nlook at it? If he has looked at it, does the Senator have any \nobjections to the amendments on the list?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank my friend from Louisiana. I was handed that list \nabout an hour and a half ago today. I looked at the titles on the list \nbut I have not had the time to study the specifics. I don't know if I \nhave any substantive objections to those specified amendments.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator for his answer. I ask the Senator \nand any other Senators who have not had a chance to look at this list \nthat has been widely circulated to take the time to look at the list. I \nknow my colleague is very busy and has many important issues to debate \non this bill, but these are important amendments to colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Texas for agreeing to look at the \nlist and let us know.\n  I am going to come back to the floor in a few minutes and ask \nunanimous consent for this list of amendments. I want to read the \namendments into the Record. These are noncontroversial amendments. What \nI mean by noncontroversial is, to my knowledge, is they are \nuncontested. They are Republican and Democratic amendments that seek to \nimprove the bill in response to communications from our constituents at \nhome. It is not just people around Washington and the beltway who have \ngood ideas about immigration issues. I am sure people in New Mexico \nhave great ideas, and people have very good ideas in Louisiana. The way \nthey get their ideas into the debate is by calling their Member of \nCongress, calling their Senators' office, writing letters, sending e-\nmails, giving us suggestions. This list represents some of that \ncommunication. That is why we come here, to represent those interests \nand to say: Look, this was an idea I had; it will strengthen the bill. \nOne of these ideas which I am very excited about came up through our \nsmall business roundtable for small businesses. They said: Senator, why \ndon't you mandate a mobile app for us, particularly in rural areas, \nbecause we don't have high-speed Internet. We can't run back 200 miles \nto check the local Internet to do this E-Verify. Why doesn't Homeland \nSecurity have a mobile device for the iPhone which everybody is \ncarrying--either iPhones or BlackBerrys--where a person hits a button \nor a mobile app for E-Verify. What an amazing, wonderful idea.\n\n[[Page S4742]]\n\n  This bill is going to spend billions and billions and billions of \ndollars securing the border. Could we spend just a little bit of effort \nhelping every small businessperson in America to use the E-Verify \nsystem smartly and efficiently? It would be such a relief to them to \nknow they don't have to put themselves at risk hiring people who don't \nhave the right certification. They can just go to the mobile app and \npull it up. That is what we are hoping.\n  We have 3 years to put this system into place. No small business is \nmandated to use the E-Verify system under the bill until these new \nsystems are in place. That is one of our amendments. There is no one \nwho has come to me to say: We hate the mobile app idea. We don't want \nto do the mobile app idea. It is a terrible idea. So let's put it in \nthe bill.\n  There are some other amendments in here--I don't know all of them \nbecause only some of them are mine. Let me read one from Tom Udall. I \ndon't know it specifically, but it says it makes $5 million available \nfor strengthening the border infectious disease surveillance project.\n  I know $5 million is a good amount of money, but compared to the \nbillions of dollars we are spending in some of our rural States--\nincluding New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, and Louisiana is rural--I \ndon't think there is anybody objecting to spending $5 million to \nstrengthen the border infectious disease surveillance project. That \nkind of smart investment--I am sure the Senator has done his homework. \nThat kind of smart investment could save taxpayers and the livelihoods \nof farmers everywhere. What a wonderful idea. We can't even get that \nadopted by a voice vote because we have broken down the trust and \nrespect of the Senate. I am going to do my very best, as calmly as I \ncan, to try to get that trust and respect back.\n  One of the other amendments prohibits the shackling of pregnant \nwomen. Now, we shackle a lot of people--and this is Senator Murray's \namendment--when they do wrong things. But I think people can understand \nthe benefit of expressing some strong views to not put shackles on the \nankles or wrists of a woman who is pregnant. It is a very stressful \nsituation. We want to support healthy births even in conditions where \nthe mother may not have all the legal paperwork. I think we can \nunderstand why that would be a sensitive thing to do, and I don't think \nthere is any Republican who would object to that. I don't think there \nis a Democrat who would object to that. That is on the list.\n  There are a lot of people who wish to speak, so I will just take 5 \nmore minutes.\n  There is a great amendment by Senators Klobuchar and Coats that \nrequires certification of citizenship and other Federal documents to \nreflect the name and date of birth determinations made by a State court \nin the situation of intercountry adoption. Some of our parents are \ngetting really hassled, American parents are getting hassled by \nAmerican courts because they have done God's will, adopted children \nfrom overseas. They have followed all the rules, all the laws, at \ntremendous expense to themselves, trying to help a child who is \norphaned or unparented, only to come back to the United States and \nbecause of some technical difficulties with our law, their birth \ncertificates are not honored.\n  This isn't right. I realize the Judiciary Committee cannot spend \ntheir time talking about this matter. In the scheme of things, it is \nminor. But let me tell my colleagues as an adoptive mother, to an \nadoptive American parent who has spent thousands of dollars and days \nand months trying to do what their pastors and ministers asked them to \ndo, to take in the orphaned, this is an outrageous situation, and with \none breath--just a breath--this could be done. But we don't have the \nbreath anymore because we have just completely fallen apart.\n  This can be fixed. There is nobody objecting to it, and that is what \nI am going to stand here and argue for.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no set amount of time.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I see my colleague so I am going to wrap up in 30 \nseconds and then yield the floor.\n  I will come to the floor again this afternoon and talk about these \namendments.\n  These Members have worked very hard, Republicans and Democrats, \namazingly, together, coming up with amendments that improve the bill. \nSome of these amendments are from Senators who are going to vote no on \nthe bill; some of these amendments are from people who are going to \nvote yes on the bill. It is not going to change the outcome of the \nvote. That is why I am so aggravated. If it did, then I could \nunderstand not taking them up. The acceptance of these amendments, yes \nor no, is not going to change the outcome of this bill, but it will \nchange the outcome of situations on the ground that are not good for \nAmerican citizens.\n  We are here to fix things, to help, to streamline, to save money, to \nimprove, to relieve pain, to help and expand opportunity. I am tired of \nbeing around here and not being able to do that. So I am going to ask \nfor this list--of course, it has been circulated widely and publicly. \nIt is on our Web site. It is on several Web sites. People can look at \nwhat we are talking about. If anybody on the Senate floor has an \nobjection, let us know.\n  Let me say one thing in closing. The counterlist that I am still not \nin physical receipt of but have seen, but it is a part of the \nCongressional Record because I required it to be, is a list of seven \namendments that are very controversial. So the Republicans have given \nus a list of seven very controversial amendments. That is not the list \nI am looking for. Maybe Senator Leahy is looking for that. Maybe \nSenator Reid is looking for that. I am not in charge of controversial \namendments. I don't even know how we are going to vote on those \ncontroversial amendments. I am not on the committee. I am not the \nleader of the floor. I don't know--I will take that and I will be happy \nto give it to the leadership.\n  I am just here on a list of noncontroversial amendments that I think \nRepublicans and Democrats can agree to that will not change the outcome \nof the bill, that will improve the bill. I hope we can make progress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                        Nuclear Arms Reductions\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise today to express great concern \nabout the announcement regarding plans to drastically reduce the U.S. \nnuclear deterrent by over one-third.\n  The strategic basis for this reduction is entirely unclear. The \nPresident must provide Members of Congress additional information on \nthe basis and the implications of his announcement. General Chilton, \nthen-commander of U.S. Strategic Command, testified before the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee in 2010. He said the New START treaty gave \nthe United States ``exactly what is needed'' to achieve its national \nsecurity objectives.\n  Given the assessments of our commanders, I am highly skeptical and \ngravely concerned about such dramatic reductions in a world of \nincreasing danger and proliferating threats. Regardless of how one \nfeels about these particular force levels, I believe there is broad \nconcern about any unilateral reductions in U.S. nuclear forces.\n  Mr. President, 2\\1/2\\ years ago, after lengthy deliberation and \ncontentious debate, this body ratified the New START treaty which \nreduced deployed U.S. nuclear weapons from between 2,200 and 1,700 to \nno more than 1,550. This debate was good for the Nation and produced a \nbipartisan consensus on arms control and nuclear modernization. Now \nthis administration is calling for reducing U.S. nuclear forces by one-\nthird, and it remains an open question if the Senate will even have a \nchance to weigh in on this decision. I sure hope we have the \nopportunity.\n  As Commander in Chief, it is the President's prerogative to adjust \nnuclear forces. But as Vice President Biden, then serving in this body \nas chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, wrote in a 2002 letter \nto then-Secretary of State Colin Powell:\n\n       With the exception of the SALT I agreement, every \n     significant arms control agreement during the past three \n     decades has been transmitted pursuant to the treaty clause of \n     the Constitution . . . we see no reason whatsoever to alter \n     this practice.\n\n  Secretaries of Defense Panetta and Hagel also testified before \nCongress\n\n[[Page S4743]]\n\nthat nuclear reductions, if undertaken at all, should be the product of \nnegotiated, bilateral, verifiable agreements.\n  I believe a change of this magnitude must be reviewed by Congress and \nsuch dramatic reductions must only be made in concert with other \nnuclear powers and the input of our allies.\n  Moreover, I believe it is premature to announce such dramatic \nreductions when the United States has yet to fulfill its obligations \nunder the New START treaty. Currently, our nuclear force levels exceed \nthe New START limits. Instead of providing a plan to implement the \nreductions required to comply with that treaty--something I and \nnumerous other Members of Congress have repeatedly asked for--the \nPresident opted to promise the world massive additional cuts.\n  I wish to repeat: We don't know how we are going to go from about \n1,650 to 1,550 warheads--a reduction of about 100. But instead of \nanswering that question, the President has stated his intention to get \nrid of another 500 or so warheads. That is one-third of our arsenal.\n  What is more, the President has apparently disregarded the advice of \nCongress, the bipartisan 2009 Perry-Schlesinger Commission, and his own \nNuclear Posture Review that additional nuclear reductions address the \ndramatic imbalance of Russian tactical nuclear weapons. Congress has \nexpressed its view on this subject several times, and the National \nDefense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2012 clearly stated the sense \nof Congress that:\n\n       If the United States pursues arms control negotiations with \n     the Russian Federation, such negotiations should be aimed at \n     the reduction of Russian deployed and nondeployed \n     nonstrategic nuclear weapons and increased transparency of \n     such weapons.\n\n  While the announcement mentioned these weapons, their reduction was \nclearly a separate afterthought, not the primary arms control objective \nthis body insisted it be.\n  In closing, I must remind my colleagues that the Senate approved the \nNew START treaty on the condition of modernizing our aging nuclear \ndeterrent. Although the promise was made before I entered the Senate, \nit was a promise made to this body and to the American people, and it \nis a promise I will make sure is kept. Modernization funding is more \nthan 30 percent below the target set by the President during New \nSTART's ratification. That is unacceptable.\n  I hope the President will address these issues in the coming days and \nfocus on building a strong bipartisan consensus on these issues and \npursuing commonsense objectives. Rushing toward dramatic reduction is a \nbad policy. It is a bad policy for any President, and it could have \ngrave consequences for our national security.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I want to commend the distinguished--oh, \nI am sorry.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I say to Senator Isakson, I think I am next \nin order.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I apologize.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. No problem. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about \ncomprehensive immigration reform. I believe the Senate is engaged in a \ncrucial debate to see if we can fix the system that we all know is \nbroken.\n  It has been a long road, not just because of the partisan climate \nhere, but because of the complex challenges we face--the challenge of \n11 million undocumented immigrants who live and work and raise families \nin communities across our Nation kept uncertain in the shadows; the \nchallenge of children brought here through no fault of their own, who \nlove this country as their own; and the challenge of securing our \nborder.\n  The majority of Americans know these challenges have to be met. \nImmigration reform has to be comprehensive. That is the reality of any \nlong-term solution.\n  It is also a reality that such reform will not be perfect, will not \nsatisfy everyone in every case. That is what compromise means. That is \nwhat bipartisan effort requires. But the American people are not asking \nfor perfection, they are asking for results; for an immigration system \nthat works, that makes sense, that secures our borders, that \nstrengthens families, and supports our economy.\n  I commend Chairman Leahy and the bipartisan authors of this bill for \ntheir leadership.\n  The committee made sure the process was open, was transparent, and \nwas inclusive. Many of the amendments adopted had bipartisan support, \nand over two-thirds of the committee voted for this bill. I hope the \nfull Senate will follow their example.\n  America has a rich history of immigrants helping to create a culture \nand economy that is the envy of the world. I am proud to come from a \nState where we celebrate our diversity. Native American, Hispanic, and \nEuropean traditions define my State.\n  We are a border State, and New Mexicans understand what is at stake \nwith border security. They know how important comprehensive immigration \nreform is.\n  This bill has the essential elements of that reform. It creates a \npathway to earned citizenship for undocumented individuals. This is not \nan amnesty. Folks have to pass criminal background checks, pay back \ntaxes and penalties, learn English, and must go to the back of the line \nbehind those who came here legally.\n  This road to citizenship takes 13 years--not an easy road but one \nthat will bring millions of people out of the shadows and into the hope \nand promise of the American dream.\n  This legislation also makes securing our border a priority. Much of \nthe debate has centered on this issue. In my opinion, the record is \nclear. As Senators from a border State--and I know the Presiding \nOfficer, Senator Heinrich, also from my great State of New Mexico and a \nborder-State Senator--we have seen firsthand how things have changed.\n  Over the past 12 years we have made some real progress. Is the job \nfinished? Of course not. But that is not a reason to oppose this bill. \nIt is a reason, in fact, to support it.\n  We spend a lot of resources on immigration and customs enforcement--\nmore than all other Federal criminal law enforcement combined. We have \nmore Border Patrol agents on our southern border than ever before. \nIllegal crossings are near their lowest levels in decades. We have \nramped up law enforcement and are deporting more criminals than ever \nbefore.\n  This legislation will build on that progress with a strong plan and \nwith the money to pay for it. It does not just call for 90 percent \napprehension of illegal border crossings, it provides $6.5 billion to \ndo it.\n  Commitment to border security is real, and this bill will improve on \nit with new technology and targeted resources. It makes a difference. \nIt changes the game plan. This is not conjecture, not pie in the sky. \nFor example, Congress appropriated $600 million for emergency border \nsecurity in 2010, and the effectiveness rate increased from 72 percent \nto 82 percent a year later.\n  So there is a proven record here, an impressive record. With border \nsecurity, this legislation has clear goals, has committed resources, \nand builds on a demonstrated success. But for some on the other side, \nthis is not enough. They demand absolute effectiveness or toss out the \npath to citizenship.\n  But let's be clear. No border can be completely secure--not ours, not \nanyone else's. So some may still cross illegally, may slip through.\n  We can do more. I believe additional border security should focus on \nviolent drug and firearms traffickers and should do more at ports of \nentry. But most undocumented immigrants come here to work. This bill \nwill change that dynamic with an effective universal employment \nverification system and crack down on employers who hire undocumented \nimmigrants. This is as crucial as fences and checkpoints, as crucial as \nagents patrolling the border or drones scanning the horizon because the \nlure of illegal immigration is jobs, and the jobs will not be there.\n  There is still work to be done. No one is arguing this bill is \nperfect. I have filed and cosponsored several amendments. I will just \nmention a few of them. Several of them, I know, are on the list that \nSenator Landrieu talks about as noncontroversial amendments. I know \nSenator Heinrich, the Presiding Officer, has an amendment on that list \nalso.\n\n[[Page S4744]]\n\n  The first adds a Federal district judge in New Mexico. In the \ncommittee markup, a bipartisan amendment was adopted to add Federal \njudges to the southwest border States. Unfortunately, New Mexico was \nnot included, even though it has a significant immigration caseload, \none that will increase with the additional enforcement provided by the \nbill. My amendment remedies this oversight.\n  I have also filed an amendment to expand the Border Enforcement \nSecurity Task Force units in the four southwest border States. BEST \nunits are teams of Federal, State, and local law enforcement focused on \ndisrupting serious border-related criminal activity, such as drug \nsmuggling and human trafficking.\n  Finally, I have filed an amendment that provides resources to all 20 \nborder States for vital early warning infectious disease surveillance. \nThis Federal funding program was created in 2003 to detect, identify, \nand report outbreaks of infectious diseases at the borders. But this \nimportant funding has ceased. We need to restore it.\n  I would urge the bill managers and authors to work with me on these \namendments to improve this bill and to protect New Mexico's interests \nas a key border State.\n  I again commend the members of the Judiciary Committee. I saw Senator \nGrassley in the Chamber a moment ago. I want to congratulate him and \nour chairman, Patrick Leahy. This legislation arrived on the Senate \nfloor with support from both sides of the aisle. I hope it will move \nforward in the same spirit of cooperation.\n  This bill is a historic moment for families, for our security, and it \nwill benefit our economy. As the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice just reported on Tuesday, this bill would reduce our deficit by \n$197 billion over the first 10 years and by at least $700 billion in \nthe second decade.\n  This bill speaks to the best of our traditions and our values. This \nis our opportunity to govern, to fix an immigration system that is \nbroken, and to move our Nation forward in the 21st century.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have refrained from being on the floor \nduring this debate, as I listened to it and watched, and I would \ncompliment my colleagues in trying to solve a very difficult problem. \nBut I just heard a speech by my colleague from New Mexico that quotes \nall sorts of statistics that are not accurate.\n  I am the ranking member on Homeland Security. Here is what we know: \nWe have estimates, and that is all we have. But we do not know the \ntotal attempts to cross our border. We do not know what they are. So \nwhen somebody quotes 70 percent to 80 percent, and you have no idea \nwhat the denominator is, you do not know what the numbers are.\n  Here is what the Council on Foreign Relations says about our border. \nHow did they get this data? They went out and interviewed 6,700 illegal \nimmigrants to find out their frequency of attempts, whether they have \ngone home, what their difficulty was, what their communities were like. \nHere is what they say right now is the control of our border: It is \nsomewhere between 40 and 65 percent.\n  So we have the administration that says one thing, but when you ask \nthem for details--as I have, as ranking member on Homeland Security--\nyou cannot get the facts because we do not know.\n  So I applaud my colleagues for bringing this bill forward. I would \nlove to get to yes on this bill.\n  I also want to raise the issue on the CBO scoring. What the CBO \nscoring said was we are still going to have 7.5 million people in the \nnext 10 years come across the border under this plan. So in reaction to \nthat, we have people who--other than one person on Homeland Security \nwho actually has sat through the hearings, who knows what is going on \nwith Homeland Security--we are going to come forward with a bill that \nis going to increase Border Patrol by 20,000 people. I can tell you, we \ndo not need 20,000 Border Patrol agents. What we need is a coherent, \nsmart strategy, with transparency, in the agency, Homeland Security, so \nwe as Members of Congress can actually see what is going on.\n  All we have to do is listen to what the administration says and then \nlisten to the people who are actually doing the work--who are the \nBorder Patrol agents, who are the ICE agents, who are the USCIS agents, \nwho are the CBP agents. When we talk with them, we get a totally \ndifferent story.\n  Why is it that the people who are actually doing the work are telling \nus a different story than what the administration is telling us? There \nis a disconnect there, and we need to understand what that is.\n  So I look forward to reading the details of the supposed border \nsecurity amendment. But ask yourself the question: Is it possible to \nsecure our border? If we were to have a terrible outbreak on either our \nnorthern or southern border that had a high fatality rate, a high \ninfectious rate, and we decided we were going to close the border \ntomorrow, could we do it.\n  There are great things in this base bill that will eliminate a large \nportion of the draw coming into our Nation through illegal immigration. \nThose are creating a decline in the attitude of those coming. They know \nif they come across, they are going to have to be able to prove they \nare a citizen to be able to get a job. I think that is absolutely \nright. There is some increase in the work visa programs and the special \nvisa programs--probably not enough.\n  But if you think, let's just believe the administration, let's \nbelieve what people say about this bill, if you can cut it down to 8, \n9, 10 percent, then the people coming across the border are not the \npeople looking for a job. The people coming across the border are the \npeople who tend to hurt our society--the drug runners, the human \ntraffickers, the terrorists.\n  So the question I would ask is, Shouldn't we know that what we are \ndoing as we establish a border security amendment will actually send \nconfidence to the people of this county that, in fact, we are going to \nsecure our border?\n  The vast majority of people in this country want to solve this \nproblem. I want to solve this problem.\n  The way we are going to go about it is we are going to get to see an \namendment sometime late tonight and then on Saturday we are going to \nhave to vote on whether to proceed with that amendment, not having had \nthe full time to actually consider what the outcome of the \nrecommendations of that amendment are.\n  So some of the mistakes have been made as we have brought this bill \nforward. This bill came through the Judiciary Committee. But almost \nevery other major thing that is of controversy in this bill is under \nthe purview and the control of the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee which got no sequential referral on this bill.\n  Where we are hung up on this bill is because we did not do regular \norder. We did not allow the process to work. We did not let the \nknowledgeable members of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee have an opportunity to impact this bill in a committee \nprocess. So now we are hung up with people who are not on that \ncommittee writing an amendment for Homeland Security.\n  We can write a good amendment for Homeland Security. I told Chuck \nSchumer and other Members of the Gang of 8 that. But we cannot do it in \n2 weeks. We cannot do it with one amendment. What we are going to get \nis waste, loopholes, and problems. The last thing we need to do is \nwaste another $5 or $6 billion on things that are not going to have a \ndifference in terms of solving the real problem, but we are going to \nclaim it solves the problem so we can pass a bill.\n  So I wish to get to yes on this bill. I wish to get to a way where we \nsolve this problem and do not create it again in the future. But my \nconcerns are both process and factually; that we are claiming things \nthat are not true. All you have to do is sit before the committees or \ngo talk to the leadership of the Border Patrol, ICE units, CPB, go talk \nto them. They are sitting there in amazement.\n  Three weeks ago, I had breakfast with Janet Napolitano. She said she \nwould send me their border control plan by area, by region, the next \nday. A piece of paper came, but there was no border control plan. So \nthe question I have is, where is the plan?\n  Of all the good recommendations that are in this bill, it is all \ngoing to be\n\n[[Page S4745]]\n\ncontingent on execution of what is in there. So we are going to pass a \nbill and pass an amendment and then we are going to ask the very \ncommittee that was excluded from making proper recommendations of the \nbill to oversight it. We will oversight it. But the fact is we will not \nhave any control to control it. So we will be raising the questions and \nthe ineffectiveness. Yet we will not have accomplished what we are \ntelling the American people we are going to accomplish.\n  What is that? It is that we are going to solve the problems with the \nillegals who are here. We are going to decrease the demand and draw \nacross our border. We are going to control our border, even though we \nwill not put that as a condition for granting people a movement from \nthe shadows to the open. We will not put that as a condition, even \nthough now with the supposed new border amendment the Border Patrol \nsays they can get us to 90 percent. We will not make that a condition.\n  So my feeling is, right now, there is a great attempt by eight of my \ncolleagues to try to solve this problem because we are in a hurry and \nwe are in a time crunch. We should not be because the House is not \ngoing to take up this bill, but they are going to bring their own. So \nwe ought to do it right. I have a lot of amendments. I would love to \nhave votes on them, would love to have them considered. I understand we \ncannot call up amendments right now, which is the same dysfunction the \nSenate has been operating under for the last 7\\1/2\\, 8 years.\n  People who are knowledgeable on the committees of jurisdiction do not \nhave the opportunity to improve the bill, to raise questions about the \nbill through their amendments, to refine the bill. It means we just \nwant to get a bill passed. It does not mean we truly want to solve the \nproblem. I look forward to a time to be able to come back to the floor \nand offer amendments that will actually improve this bill, that will \ngive transparency to the American public about what we are doing, that \nwill give transparency on how we are going to spend all this money that \nwe are going to take from the very people we are trying to move out of \nthe shadows, and we are not just going to throw money up against a wall \nand saying we did something when, in fact, we are not going to \naccomplish the very purpose that we put forward in this bill.\n  People who come to this country--and I would put myself in the same \ncategory. If I was caught in the lack of economic opportunity, I would \ntry any way I could to get into this country of opportunity. But what \nmakes this country a land of opportunity is the rule of law. What we \nare doing is we are saying--the irony is the people who come here and \nbreak the law to get the opportunity from the rule of law, if we do not \nfix it to where that does not happen again, we are going to unwind the \nrule of law in this country.\n  That is the glue that holds this Nation together. It goes something \nlike this: If they do not have to abide by the law, neither do I. So we \nget an unwinding of the fabric and the confidence in the rule of law in \nthis country. We ought to be very careful with what we do as we say \nlaws do not apply. That is what we are saying with this bill, to a \ncertain group of people, the laws we had on the books are not going to \napply. We ought to make sure that does not happen again.\n  I wish to come back at some time when I can present the ideas of a \nlot of people who actually have a lot of experience and a lot of \nknowledge on homeland security and how it operates and how the \ndifferent divisions within homeland security operate.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until \n4 p.m. be equally divided between the two leaders or their designees \nand that I be recognized at 4 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I was scheduled to come in at 2 o'clock. I \nappreciate the leader accommodating me 5 minutes early. There is talk \nabout an imminent compromise among the Gang of 8 and perhaps a couple \nof others that would move this bill along. I have made it clear that \nthe bill, as currently written, is flawed and would not be something \nthat would get my vote. So anything that would move us toward a better \nsolution, toward better enforcement of the border, such as 20,000 \nadditional security agents on the border, would be a positive step.\n  I do wish to make it clear, however, that the bill as written would \nnot stem the tide of illegal immigration. The bill as written would not \nprovide a solution to our broken immigration system. Without further \namendment, my understanding of the new compromise that is about to come \nforward also would be deficient.\n  I appreciate people working toward a consensus. I look forward to \nreading the amendment as it is presented, if it is indeed presented \nlater this afternoon or later this weekend. But there are still changes \nthat need to be made so we can improve the bill. I would point out to \nmy colleagues that a Congressional Budget Office report released the \nday before yesterday indicates that border security components of the \nimmigration bill as written will not stem the tide of illegal \nimmigration in a meaningful way, because large numbers of people are \nprojected still to overstay their visas.\n  Should the legislation pass in that form, even the Congressional \nBudget Office, a bipartisan, independent call-it-by-the-numbers office, \npredicts that the reforms agreed to by the so-called Gang of 8 would \nreduce illegal immigration by only 25 percent, far short of what the \nbill's supporters have contended.\n  Dependable border security and interior security are crucial to the \nsuccess of the entire immigration system. This means putting in place \nthe proper infrastructure and technology, including a national E-Verify \nsystem for employers. I congratulate and commend and encourage the \njunior Senator from Ohio Mr. Portman for his efforts to move toward a \nconsensus in that very important area of the bill too. These steps, \nsecuring the border and strengthening E-Verify, should proceed efforts \nto grant legal status. I think most Americans agree with that.\n  I have offered a number of amendments. I wish to take these few \nminutes to make my suggestions about how to improve this bill. But \nfirst and foremost, I wish to urge my colleagues, urge the leadership \nof the committee on both sides of the aisle and the leadership of this \nSenate to give this Senate an opportunity to speak on the issue of \nsanctuary cities.\n  Most people are aware that one of the great ways to flout the law, as \nit has been, has been for a local jurisdiction to say to people who \nhave overstayed their visas, to people who have come here illegally or \nstayed here illegally: Come to our city and we will provide you \nsanctuary. Come to our city and we will ignore the law of the land and \nmake sure we do our part that it is not enforced against you--so-called \nsanctuary cities.\n  As a Member of the other body, I voted for legislation and amendments \nto crack down on this.\n  If this bill works as it should work, then there should be no \nillegals in the country seeking sanctuary in a sanctuary city. My \nlegislation to prohibit the practice of sanctuary cities, in my view, \nshould be accepted by consensus. If the authors of this bill believe it \nis a solution to our broken immigration system, then there should be no \nneed for a city to say we are going to take in people who are not here \nlegally because, by definition under this bill, we will have said the \nsystem is fixed.\n  Under my amendment, these jurisdictions would be denied State \nCriminal Alien Assistance Program funds if they insist on continuing to \nbe sanctuary cities. We would deny, under my amendment, law enforcement \ngrants from the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice for the \ncontinuation of so-called sanctuary cities.\n  My amendment would also encourage information-sharing by law \nenforcement officials and stipulate that individuals who violate the \nimmigration law should be included in the National Crime Information \nCenter database. Why would that be the least bit controversial? It \nwould also ensure States have access to Federal technology that is \nhelpful in identifying immigrants\n\n[[Page S4746]]\n\nwho are not here by permission and who are deported.\n  I would say to my colleagues, any bill that comes out of the House of \nRepresentatives will almost surely have a sanctuary cities provision. \nWe need a vote on this Senate floor so our constituents back home and \nour individual States can know where we stand on this issue.\n  I would again emphasize if we believe the law will work, if we \nbelieve this new plan will fix the broken system, then there should be \nno need for any jurisdiction to call itself a sanctuary city.\n  Secondly, I have a separate amendment that would double penalty fees. \nIt would double from $1,000 to $2,000 the fee illegal immigrants must \npay at various steps of the process. We all know $1,000 amounts to far \nless than what is often paid to so-called coyotes who smuggle people \nacross the border. Penalties are supposed to hold people accountable \nfor breaking the law and not serve as merely an inconvenience.\n  I have a second amendment that would increase the penalty in the \nlegislation from $1,000 to $2000.\n  I have a third amendment that would require the Secretary to adjust \nthese statutory fees and penalties for inflation, index them for \ninflation. What could be simpler than that? A $1,000 penalty in 2013 \nmight not amount to the same degree of penalty in 2015 or 2019. We \nindex many of our amounts and figures under statute according to \ninflation. My third amendment would simply allow for annual inflation \nadjustment.\n  Fourthly, I have an amendment that would strike the ability of \nillegal immigrants to apply for provisional legal status if they have \npreviously filed a frivolous application for asylum, one that has been \ndetermined by the authorities to be frivolous. By law those who have \nknowingly filed a frivolous application, for example, containing \nstatements that are deliberately fabricated, or responses that are \ndeliberately fabricated, should be permanently barred from receiving \nany benefit under the new act.\n  Another amendment I have would expedite removal proceedings of \nillegal immigrants with serious criminal offenses. What could be \nsimpler and more straightforward than that. It would require the \nSecretary of Homeland Security to initiate expedited removal \nproceedings against those who are deemed ineligible for provisional \nlegal status, for example, by law, because they would belong to a gang \nor they have committed an aggravated felony, committed an offense \nagainst a child or a domestic violence offense. It would seem to me \nthis sort of an amendment should be the sort of amendment the Senator \nfrom Louisiana, Senator Landrieu, was speaking about only a few moments \nago that should be accepted by consensus through a voice vote.\n  Finally, I have an amendment to ensure that those found ineligible \nhave their provisional legal status revoked. If an application is \nsubmitted and the duly constituted authorities under this new act \ndetermine the individual is not entitled to the relief requested, then \nprovisional legal status should be revoked. For example, this would be \nif he or she is found to be ineligible, if he or she used fraudulent \ndocumentation or did not fulfill the continuous physical presence \nrequirement of the bill, then that status is denied and the individual \nshould then have conditional status revoked.\n  I conclude by saying I appreciate the good-faith effort that has been \nmade by the leadership on both sides of the aisle, by the leadership of \nthe committee, and by people acting ad hoc as a self-appointed group of \n8 or group of 10. We need to make it clear that any agreement announced \nwith great fanfare this afternoon, or perhaps this weekend, is not the \nend of it.\n  We have a lot of time left for excellent ideas to improve this bill, \nto bring it around to the point where people such as myself could vote \nfor it, where people such as my constituents back home can feel that it \nis, in fact, a solution to a broken system, and we can forward this \nlegislation on to the House of Representatives with a national \nconsensus behind it.\n  No great changes have been made in the Congress to broad policy \ndisagreements without bipartisan consensus. I hope that amendments such \nas the six I have described, particularly my amendment with regard to \nsanctuary cities, would be adopted so we can move toward a consensus \nthat we do not have at this point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I appreciate the comments of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Mississippi.\n  I rise to speak on immigration reform and to discuss an amendment I \nwill be introducing to S. 744, the comprehensive immigration reform \nlegislation the Senate body is carefully considering and debating. That \namendment is the Hoeven-Corker border security amendment. It is being \nfinalized, and I plan to introduce it this afternoon, along with the \nSenator from the great State of Tennessee, Senator Bob Corker, who is \nhere with me. I want to thank him for the tremendous work he has done \non this legislation. He has been absolutely inspirational to work with, \na great leader, and somebody who is working to do immigration reform \nthe right way, to get a bipartisan solution that truly addresses the \nchallenges we face with immigration reform and to get it done the right \nway.\n  In addition to Senator Corker and myself, other sponsors include \nSenator John McCain, Senator Lindsey Graham, Senator Marco Rubio, \nSenator Jeff Flake, Senator Kelly Ayotte, Senator Dean Heller, and \nothers who are joining us on this legislation. I believe a number of \nthem will be down here to provide their comments as well.\n  I believe the first order of business for immigration reform is to \nsecure the border. I will repeat that. I believe the first order of \nbusiness for immigration reform is to secure the border. Americans want \nimmigration reform, of that there is no doubt, but they want us to get \nit right. That means, first and foremost, securing the border.\n  In 1986, President Ronald Reagan and the Congress granted legalized \nstatus to between 3 and 4 million illegal immigrants. The intent was to \nonce and for all resolve the illegal immigration problem, but obviously \nit didn't. Here we are today with more than 11 million illegal \nimmigrants in this country. Here we are today with a border that has \nstill not been secured.\n  Ironically, illegal immigrants continue to come into our country \nbecause we have not secured the border at the same time--at the same \ntime--our immigration laws do not meet the needs of our modern-day \nworkforce for STEM-trained workers, other specialty and high-demand \nareas. In fact, one of the strengths of the underlying bill, the \nunderlying legislation drafted by the Gang of 8 on a bipartisan basis, \nalong with amendments that have already been added in committee, one of \nthe strengths is it includes provisions that will help us with our \nworkforce needs. These provisions were adopted from legislation myself \nand other Senators fostered, such as legislation led by the esteemed \nSenator from Texas John Cornyn, which would allow an increased number \nof college graduates, postgraduate degreed individuals with degrees in \nSTEM--science, technology, engineering, math-trained individuals--and \nother highly skilled, highly trained people who could stay in this \ncountry. These are people we need to help grow our economy and to help \ncreate jobs.\n  We also want people who can bring capital and job-creating \nopportunities to come to our country. I believe the underlying bill has \ncaptured these concepts. The immigration innovation legislation I was \nproud to cosponsor with Senators Hatch, Klobuchar, Coons, and others is \nincluded in this bill.\n  We are not done. We must do more to secure the border in this \nlegislation. That is exactly what we are offering here today. It is a \nvery straightforward way to secure our border and to do so before \nallowing a pathway to legal permanent residency for those who came here \nillegally.\n  Furthermore, it will ensure that we do not repeat the error we made \nbefore, failure to secure our border while at the same time fixing our \nimmigration laws. It builds on what is already in the underlying bill, \nand it provides objective, verifiable standards and metrics to do so.\n  Our legislation will provide significantly more resources to secure \nthe border, more manpower, more fencing, more technology. Those \nresources must\n\n[[Page S4747]]\n\nbe fully deployed and operational before green card status is allowed. \nThe legislation provides five specific conditions which must be met \nbefore anyone in RPI status, registered provisional immigrant status, \ncan be adjusted or transitioned to LPR, lawful permanent resident \nstatus, green cards.\n  These conditions are: First, we are including a comprehensive \nsouthern border security plan right in the legislation. This is a $3.2 \nbillion high-tech plan. The plan is detailed border sector by border \nsector, and it includes combinations of conventional security \ninfrastructure such as observation towers, fixed and mobile camera \nsystems, helicopters, planes, and other physical surveillance equipment \nto secure the border.\n  The plan also includes high-tech tools such as mobile surveillance \nsystems, seismic imaging, infrared ground sensors, and unmanned aerial \nsystems equipped with infrared radar cameras, VADER radar, and long-\nrange thermal-imaging cameras. The Secretary of Homeland Security, \ntogether with the Secretary of Defense and the Comptroller General of \nthe United States, the GAO, must certify to the Congress that this \ncomprehensive southern border security strategy is deployed and \noperational. That means in place and operating, other than routine \nmaintenance. That is the first requirement before the adjustment to LPR \nstatus.\n  Second, DHS must deploy and maintain 20,000 additional Border Patrol \nagents on the southern border. That is in addition to the number of \nBorder Patrol agents on the border now, which is right at about \n20,000. So we will double the number of armed Border Patrol agents to \ndetect and turn back those individuals who would try to cross our \nborder illegally.\n\n  Third, DHS must build 700 miles of fencing. That is double the amount \nrequired in the underlying bill, which calls for 350 miles of fencing. \nSo 700 miles of fencing--that compares to about 42 miles of fencing we \nhave in place right now.\n  Fourth, the Secretary of Homeland Security must verify that the \nmandatory E-Verify system has been implemented to enforce workplace \nlaws so that illegal immigrants are not employed.\n  Fifth, the electronic entry-exit identification system must be in \nplace at all international airports and seaports in the United States \nwhere U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers are currently \ndeployed.\n  So these are the requirements. These are the requirements, and they \nmust be met before lawful permanent residency is allowed. No green \ncards, other than for DREAMers and blue card ag workers, until these \nrequirements are met.\n  Once again, simply put, we must secure the border first. That is what \nAmericans demand, and that is what we must do to get comprehensive \nimmigration reform right. That is what this legislation does, and it \ndoes it with objective and verifiable methods. We ask our colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to join with us and pass this legislation.\n  Madam President, at this point I would like to turn to my \ndistinguished colleague from Tennessee, whom I want to thank again for \nhis tremendous work, which is ongoing. I can't say how much I \nappreciate his good efforts and his good faith on a bipartisan basis. I \nturn to him now for his comments as well as to then enter into a \ncolloquy with our colleagues who have worked so hard and played such a \nleadership role in this legislation.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota \nfor his outstanding leadership. One would expect that from someone who \nserved in such a distinguished way as Governor of his State. He has \ndone an outstanding job on this issue, and I thank him for being a \ngreater partner.\n  I know we still have some work to do. The fact is that we still have \nto introduce this amendment, and work is underway right now, but I want \nto thank him, his staff, and those all around him for the way he has \ndug into this issue, solved the problems that I think Americans are \nlooking at relative to security issues, and for working with us in the \nway he has. So I thank him very much.\n  I thank the Gang of 8 for the work they have done over the last \nmultiple months to bring us to the place we are, where we have an \nopportunity to do something America needs; that is, solve the \nimmigration issue we have and also ensure that in doing so we \nabsolutely have secured the border.\n  One of my colleagues called this amendment--and again, it is being \nvetted right now. We hope to introduce it a little later today. There \nis a broad agreement about what the content is, and it is being vetted \nand will be introduced later today.\n  Some people have described this as a border surge. The fact is that \nwe are investing resources in securing our border that have never been \ninvested before--a doubling, again, of the Border Patrol and $3.2 \nbillion worth of technology that the Chief of the Border Patrol says is \nthe technology he needs to have 100 percent awareness and to secure our \nborder; dealing with the exit program and dealing with E-Verify. So all \nthese things are in place.\n  I thank Senator Cornyn of Texas, who began the process of focusing on \nborder security. I realize his amendment failed earlier, but I think \nwhat he helped us do is build momentum toward an amendment that I \nconsider to be far stronger and even better. But his efforts in looking \nat a border security measure helped us in this regard.\n  I am not the kind of person who speaks for a long time--I think \npeople understand that--but I want to say that the Senator from North \nDakota has done an outstanding job of laying out the many elements of \nthis amendment that hopefully will be voted on in the very near future. \nAnd I do think the American people have asked us, if we pass an \nimmigration bill off the Senate floor, to do everything we can to be \nsure we have secured the border. That is what people in Tennessee have \nasked for, that is what people in North Dakota have asked for, that is \nwhat people in Arizona have asked for, and that is what this amendment \ndoes.\n  This amendment has the ability, if passed, to bring a bipartisan \neffort behind immigration reform that would then send the bill to the \nHouse. Look, I do wish this amendment had some other measures relative \nto interior security, but I think the House can improve this. I think a \nconference can improve this. So I hope we have the opportunity down the \nroad to see that occur.\n  I thank all those involved in crafting an amendment that tries to \ndeal with the sensibilities on both sides and at the same time secures \nour border in such a way that we can put this issue mostly behind us \nand we can have an immigration system in our country that meets the \nneeds of a growing economy--the biggest economy in the world--and that \nfocuses on making our country stronger, not weaker, and hopefully we \nwill put this debate behind us.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CORKER. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. First of all, could I say that all of us who have had the \nhonor of working with the Senator from Tennessee and the Senator from \nNorth Dakota are greatly appreciative of the work they have done. If \nthere is going to be broad bipartisan support for the final product, it \nwill be because of what the Senators from Tennessee and North Dakota \nhave done, and I am very grateful for that.\n  I think it is important--wouldn't the Senator from Tennessee agree--\nthat people understand that this is a very tough bill, and it required \na lot of cooperation from our friends on the other side of the aisle to \ngo along and agree with this. I think they have shown a great deal of \ncompromise in order to reach this point and agree with us on this \nlegislation, for which clearly we need bipartisan support.\n  But I would like to ask the Senator for a couple of specifics \nbecause, again, I think it is important that we understand how tough \nthis legislation is. Is it not true that we know already that E-Verify \nmust be used by every employer in the country before anyone under this \nplan could be eligible for a green card? Isn't that true? It is already \nthere?\n  Mr. CORKER. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And the electronic entry-exit system at all international \nairports and seaports has to be up and operational before anyone is \neligible for a green card; is that true?\n  Mr. CORKER. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Now, thanks to the Senator from Tennessee and the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, is it true that\n\n[[Page S4748]]\n\nadditional technology must be deployed and operational in the field--\nand that includes new VADER radar systems, integrated fixed towers, \nunmanned aerial systems, fixed cameras, mobile surveillance systems, \nground sensors--to the point where the head of the Border Patrol has \nassured us that if these technologies are in place and operational, we \ncan have 100 percent situational awareness and 90 percent effective \ncontrol of the border?\n  Mr. CORKER. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So to put the final piece of this puzzle together, is it \nnot true that the Senator from Tennessee and the Senator from North \nDakota have called for 350 miles of additional border fencing in \naddition to the 350 miles already there and that 20,000 new, full-time \nBorder Patrol agents be hired and deployed before someone is eligible \nfor a green card? Is that a fact?\n  Mr. CORKER. That is correct. I don't know of anybody who has proposed \na tougher measure, when we look at it all combined, than the measure \nthat hopefully will be on the floor in the very near future.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I wonder if the Senator from North Dakota would like to \nrespond to that.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Well, I appreciate the esteemed Senator from Arizona \nagain emphasizing these points. That is what this is all about. This is \nabout securing the border. And all of the things the Senator from \nArizona just identified are in the bill. They are requirements. The \nplan itself, this $3.2 billion comprehensive southern border strategic \nplan, is detailed border sector by border sector. And again, this puts \neverybody in the same place saying that we are going to secure the \nborder first because there are no green cards until we secure the \nborder.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And is it not true, I say to my two colleagues--Madam \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a colloquy with both \nthe Senator from Tennessee and the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is it not true, I say to my friends, that on our side of \nthe aisle there is understandable skepticism--and well-founded \nskepticism on the part of my friend from Texas--because we have seen \nthis movie before. In 1986 we gave amnesty to 3 million people and we \nsaid we would secure the border. Then in 2006 we passed a border \nsecurity appropriations, and there was going to be plenty of money. Yet \nit was never funded.\n  So for those of us from the Southwest particularly but people all \nover America, is it not true that there is understandable skepticism \nthat we would not pass legislation that is binding? And is it not true \nthat we can't make this, as far as border patrol and as far as miles of \nfencing, any more binding than it is in my colleagues' amendment?\n  Mr. CORKER. Absolutely.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I would like to add that it is not just all these things \nthat we are putting on the border and that we are requiring that these \nthings be in place and certified and operating before we go to green \ncard status, but also it is about eliminating the incentive to try to \nget across the border. When we put E-Verify in place and we have a \nproper guest worker program, we take away the incentive to try to get \nacross the border. So we secure the border, but we also take away the \nincentive to come across because someone can come across legally \nthrough the guest worker program. And if they come across illegally, we \nare going to find them and they can't get a job. So it is both. That is \nwhat we mean when we talk about comprehensive border security and a \ncomprehensive approach.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would ask my colleagues one more question. With all due \nrespect to every Member of this body, when we look at this legislation \nand we look at these triggers and the technology that is going to be \nrequired, which, if operational, the head of the Border Patrol has said \nwill give 100 percent awareness and 90 percent effective control, plus \nthis increase in fencing, plus Border Patrol agents and the already \nexisting in legislation E-Verify--and I think the Senator from North \nDakota is very correct. If we remove the incentive, if people know they \ncan't get a job in this country unless they have the proper documents, \nthen people will stop coming illegally. It also addresses the issue of \nthe 40 percent who are here who never crossed our border illegally but \ncame on a visa and overstayed it.\n  So I would just ask for maybe a subjective opinion. Is it possible \nthat one could ever argue against this legislation now by saying that \nit does not give us a secure border?\n  Mr. CORKER. I think it would be very difficult. And I thank the \nSenator from Arizona for raising this issue. If the issue one has is \nsecuring the border, with this immigration bill, if this amendment \npasses, which I hope it will, I don't know how anybody could argue that \nthe reason they are not supporting this legislation is because we \nhaven't addressed securing the border. We have addressed that. We have \naddressed that in spades in this legislation.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his leadership on \nthis issue and the other side of the aisle for working with us. I don't \nthink anyone who votes against this bill could argue as their reason, \nif we pass this amendment--and we need to get it to the floor. We are \nstill working out some issues, and hopefully we will be done in a few \nhours. But I don't know how anyone could argue that we haven't dealt \nwith the issue that many people have been concerned about, many people \nin Tennessee, and that is we have--if this legislation passes in the \nform it is, with this amendment as we have agreed, we have secured the \nborder.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I have the Senator from North Dakota finish \nanswering this question?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I would respond to the good Senator from Arizona and say, \nlook, all of the ideas that have been brought forward to secure the \nborder we have worked to include in this package. We have tried in a \nbipartisan way to listen to everybody and say: What can we do? What can \nwe put on the border to secure the border? We have tried to bring all \nthose resources to bear.\n  To the good Senator from Arizona I would say we want to bring in our \nSenator from Florida, who has worked so hard, along with the Senator \nfrom Arizona, to provide truly the right kind of leadership for \ncomprehensive reform on a bipartisan basis. I also want to reach out to \nthe good Senator from Texas. A lot of the ideas in this bill came from \nlegislation he put forward. Look, this is about all of us putting our \nideas into securing this border. We have tried to include everybody's \nideas in this effort. That is exactly what we did.\n  I would yield for the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I honestly respect and value the work \nthe so-called Gang of 8 has done on this legislation, as well as the \ncontributions made by my colleagues from North Dakota and from \nTennessee. I think they have moved this bill in a constructive \ndirection to give people more confidence that we are actually serious \nabout dealing with border security.\n  But I want to ask them to distinguish, if they will, between the \nprovision I know they both supported in my amendment that was tabled \nearlier which makes the progress from probationary status to green card \ncontingent upon 100-percent situational awareness of the border and a \n90-percent apprehension rate which is defined as operational control. \nHow does their amendment differ from that?\n  I know it hasn't been completed yet, but my understanding is Senator \nSchumer and the Democrats would not agree to that. I know they object \nto it. Senator Schumer has been quite clear in his telling me that. But \nmy impression is this is a promise of future performance, and there is \nno contingency in the same sense that there was a trigger that \nprohibited the transition from probationary status to legal permanent \nresidence.\n  Could the Senator please clarify?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I appreciate very much the question from \nthe Senator from the great State of Texas. I thank him for the work he \ndid and the work we did together, and the fact that we absolutely tried \nhere to build on concepts the Senator put forward. It is not the same, \nbut we tried to build on those concepts.\n  In terms of the actual border security plan, the comprehensive \nsouthern\n\n[[Page S4749]]\n\nborder security strategy, the $3.2 billion plan that includes \ntechnology, helicopters, planes, all these different things I detailed, \nthat is exactly what the Senator was talking about in his legislation. \nPhysically we do deploy all the things the Senator laid out in his \nlegislation, and then we add to it 20,000 agents, and an additional 350 \nmiles of fence on top of the 350 miles of fence called for in the \nunderlying bill. We put all of the physical resources out there, and \nthen we add all of the fencing and all the manpower to make sure we \naccomplish exactly what the Senator was laying out. In terms of the \ntrigger, all those things are triggers before going to a green card.\n  It is different in that the discussion was, How do we set up \nverifiable metrics? And that is what we are doing by clearly \ndelineating all these things we are putting in, and then we actually \nadd to what the Senator had in the legislation.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I have one last question, because I know there are others \nwho want to talk and it is not my intention to interfere with their \ncolloquy here.\n  The 20,000 additional Border Patrol agents, here is an area where the \nmovement has been pretty dramatic, because we started with zero \nadditional Border Patrol agents. My amendment was disparaged by the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Arizona and the distinguished senior \nSenator from New York as being a budget amendment buster, 5,000 Border \nPatrol agents. I was told we don't need more boots, we need technology. \nNow I find, to my shock and amazement, the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Arizona saying we need 20,000 more Border Patrol agents. How much \nis it going to cost? That is the question.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. And if I may respond to that. Again, that makes my point.\n  I say to the Senator from Texas, I want to thank him for his work. \nThat is a great example of how we have built on the foundation he laid. \nThat was a great example. He asked for 5,000 Border Patrol agents and \nwe got 20,000. So this is a great example. It is all paid for, and this \nis important.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would repeat my question: How much is it going to cost?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. That is where I am going right now.\n  Remember, in the CBO score, in the first 10 years, $197 billion. We \nuse about $30 billion to make sure that border is secure. But overall, \nthis bill with this amendment creates border security and more than \npays for itself.\n  Here is the other point. Remember, in that CBO score it showed $197 \nbillion in terms of revenue creation. So we used $30 billion of that to \nadd the border agents and secure the border.\n  But here is the other thing we have to look at in that CBO score. It \nsaid without our amendment, with the underlying bill, we would have 7 \nmillion more illegal immigrants in this country in 10 years. Without \nthe bill we would have 10 million more. So what does that say? It \ndidn't get the job done on border security. That is exactly why we are \nadding this amendment, and it will get the job done.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Let me express my appreciation to the Senators for their \nanswer to the question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Texas for his engagement.\n  As usual, the Senator from South Carolina has a very busy schedule. I \nask unanimous consent that he be allowed 10 minutes and then I regain \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank all who made this better.\n  To Senator Cornyn's question about cost: I never objected to more \nBorder Patrol agents. I didn't know how we would pay for the bill. I \nhoped it would be deficit neutral. Boy, did my hopes come true. It is \nnot deficit neutral. According to the Congressional Budget Office, we \nreduce the deficit in the first 10 years by $190 billion and over a 20-\nyear period $700 billion. So the reason I didn't want to agree to 5,000 \nagents without somebody showing me how we would pay for it, we are \nborrowing enough money from our grandchildren and great-grandchildren \nto run the government. We don't need to do any more borrowing unless we \nabsolutely have to.\n  The good news is the bill we have written will create economic growth \nin the country at a time when we need economic growth. It will allow \nemployers access to labor they don't have today so they won't be \ntempted to cheat in the future. This bill helps the economy. Don't take \nmy word for it, take CBO's word for it.\n  If you had some more money to spend in this bill, how would you want \nto spend it? Let me tell you what Senator Graham would wish to do. He \nwould wish to hire 20,000 Border Patrol agents to let everybody in the \ncountry know I get it when we say we have got to secure the border.\n  You are right, we have had two waves of illegal immigration. We don't \nneed a third. And why are we doing this? Why 20,000 Border Patrol \nagents? That is three brigades of troops. That is taking the equivalent \nof three brigades of Army troops, trained law enforcement officers, to \nsupplement the 20,000 we have. We will have a Border Patrol agent every \nthousand feet on the border 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It costs \nover $20 billion, but I can tell you this: It is money well spent, \nbecause it makes the border more secure, which helps us with our \nsovereignty.\n  Why are we hiring 20,000 agents on top of the 20,000 we have? Because \nour country can't control who comes in. We cannot maintain our \nsovereignty if every 10 and 20 years 3 million to 11 million illegal \nimmigrants come into our country. If you want the border secure, as I \ndo, your ship has come in. The 20,000 are now affordable and they are \nneeded. The 700 miles of fence will be built because it is needed. The \n$3.2 billion of technology that has been proven to work in Iraq and \nAfghanistan will go to the border because it will help back up the \nBorder Patrol agents.\n  As to my good friend from Texas: How do we know all this works? The \nbill requires us to hire the agents and put them on the border before \nyou can transition to green card. It is not talking about hiring the \nagents, it is not talking about training them. You have got to hire and \ndeploy.\n  The bill also says the fence has to be built. The bill says the $3.2 \nbillion of new technology that worked in Iraq and Afghanistan has to be \npurchased, deployed, and operational.\n  Here is my belief: If you hire the Border Patrol agents and you put \nthem on the border, they are not going to read a comic book. They are \ngoing to do their job. You don't need to prove to me they are going to \ndo their job. You just need to get them on the border so they can do \ntheir job.\n  And if you have the 18 drones versus the 6, you don't need to prove \nto me somebody will fly them. They will fly them. If you have the \ntechnology deployed and operational in addition to the drones, the \nVADER radar and the sensors, people will look at the radar because they \nwant to protect our country.\n  What has been missing is capacity. This is a border surge. We have \nmilitarized our border, almost. Why? Because we have lost our \nsovereignty. We have lost the ability to control who comes into \nAmerica.\n  My belief is if you can't get a green card until all of this is \npurchased and deployed, that is enough. There will come a point to \nwhere it is enough.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, I have been working on this for almost a decade \nwith Senator McCain. I can look anybody in the eye and tell them that \nif you put 20,000 Border Patrol agents on the border in addition to the \n20,000 we have--that is one every thousand feet--that will work. If you \nbuy technology that helped us fight and create success in Iraq when we \ndid the surge, that will help the Border Patrol agents. If you build a \nfence, that all helps. So I don't need any more than getting it in \nplace.\n  Finally, to my good friend from Tennessee and my good friend from \nNorth Dakota: The bill when we wrote it I thought was good, but they \nhave made it a lot better. To anybody in America who believes border \nsecurity should be robust and it is a national security priority, we \nhave in every sense of the term ``reasonable'' met that goal. We \ncouldn't have done it without more people.\n  To the Gang of 8 Members, it has been a joy to work on this bill.\n  To our colleagues who have weighed in and tried to get the bill \nbetter and get to yes, you are doing this country a great service.\n\n[[Page S4750]]\n\n  I hope Monday night we will pass legislation that will mandate that \n20,000 additional Border Patrol agents will be on the border working \nbefore you can get a green card; that the technology that worked in \nAfghanistan and Iraq will be up and operational before you can get a \ngreen card; the fence will be built before you get a green card. And to \nme, ladies and gentlemen, that is enough. That is enough.\n  The people we are talking about deserve a hard-earned process to get \ninto America. They need to pay a fine, learn our language, get in the \nback of the line, and they need to earn their way into good standing. \nBut they are people.\n  I am very pleased to support what I think is the most dramatic \namendment in the history of our country to secure our border at a time \nwhen we need it secured.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. What is the order, if I might ask?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The order was to recognize the Senator from \nArizona after the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from South Carolina for his usual \neloquent exposition of what this situation is all about.\n  I have other colleagues who are waiting to speak, but I want to say \nagain, the Senator from North Dakota and the Senator from Tennessee \nhave shown the best of what this institution can be all about. Not only \ndid they reach agreement between the two of them, not only did they \nreach agreement with I believe a significant number of our colleagues \nbut they also reached agreement with my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle. In this day and age, that is a signal success. I thank them \nfor not only what they produced but the many compromises they had to \nmake along the way.\n  I won't try to embellish what the Senator from South Carolina said, \nexcept to say I come from a State that has probably been torn apart \nmore than any other by this issue. We passed legislation in reaction to \nour broken borders, where ranchers in the southern part of my State \nwere actually murdered; where our wildlife refuges were destroyed; \nwhere people died in the desert by the hundreds, their bodies were \nfound months later; where coyotes bring people across the border and \nthen hold them in drop houses in Phoenix for ransom under the most \nunspeakable conditions; where drugs are brought freely across the \nborder and guided by guides on mountaintops, guiding these drug cartels \nas they bring the drugs to Phoenix. The drug people will tell you that \nPhoenix, AZ, is still the major drug distribution center in the United \nStates of America.\n  So I take a backseat to no one, even from the great State of Texas, \nof the enormous challenges and controversies associated with illegal \nimmigration.\n  We tried before and we failed. I won't go into why we failed and all \nthe people who were responsible. I will take responsibility. I didn't \ndo a good enough job in selling my colleagues on the absolute need for \nimmigration reform. The fact is 11 million people live in the shadows, \nthey live here in de facto amnesty, and they are being exploited every \nsingle day.\n  Should not it be for a nation founded on Judeo-Christian principles \nto bring these people out of the shadows? Yes, punish them because they \ncommitted crimes by crossing our border illegally. But isn't it in our \nNation to come together and pass this legislation and not manufacture \nreasons for not doing that? Isn't there enough of a penalty? Isn't \nthere enough border security now, thanks to my colleagues from North \nDakota and from Tennessee--isn't there enough now?\n  All I can say is I urge my colleagues to vote overwhelmingly in favor \nof this hard-fought, well-crafted amendment and let's move on to other \nissues that face this Nation. Then I believe we can look back years \nfrom now and say to our children and our grandchildren that we did the \nright thing.\n  I yield floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Donnelly). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I understand that both my colleagues from \nNew Hampshire and Florida wish to speak. I will be happy to have each \nof them speak for 5 minutes and then me speak for 5 minutes, if that is \nOK. I ask unanimous consent: 5, 5, and 5.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and, \nthe Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New York for \ngiving us that courtesy. I rise in support of the amendment that will \nbe offered by my colleagues from Tennessee and North Dakota. I \nappreciate the hard work they have done to enhance the border security \nprovisions in the current pending immigration bill on the floor. To all \nof us, securing our border is very important to preventing another wave \nof illegal immigration in this country.\n  But what they have done is incredibly important. It is very strong, \nthe strongest measure that I think this body has considered--20,000 \nBorder Patrol agents, essentially doubling those agents that will be \nalong the southern border; in addition to that, significantly \nincreasing the fencing. In fact, at least 700 miles of fencing will \nhave to be completed along the southern border, almost doubling what \nwas already in the bill for fencing and specifying what types of \ntechnology the Department of Homeland Security will have to deploy, \nincluding the best technology, using sensors and drones, to make sure \nwe can apprehend those who are illegally trying to cross our border and \nthen making very sure we prevent a further wave of illegal immigration, \nalong with the strong reforms in this bill to our legal immigration \nsystem, making sure we can keep the best and the brightest here to help \nus grow our economy, to make sure we have the workforce we need to \nensure that we will create jobs here.\n  Let us not forget we are a country of immigrants. I daresay for most \nof my colleagues either their parents or their grandparents came from \nanother country and worked very hard in this country. We need legal \nimmigration that works for our country, that makes sure our economy \ncontinues to grow and that we have people here who want to work hard \nand live the American dream. But we also cannot ignore securing our \nsouthern border.\n  That is why I am proud to cosponsor the amendment that will be \noffered by Senator Corker and Senator Hoeven. This doubles the number \nof border agents, doubles the amount of fencing, specifies the type of \ntechnology that is required, and gives the resources to finally secure \nour border.\n  To my Republican colleagues, I think there was an op-ed in the Wall \nStreet Journal today that is worth mentioning. I share their concerns \nabout securing the border, but I hope--with the strong enhancements \nthat have been put in this amendment to double the amount of border \nsecurity, to strengthen and double, almost, the amount of fencing, to \nmake sure the right technologies are in place to secure our border, \nthis will prevent another wave of illegal immigration--they will not \nuse border security as a ruse not to vote for a bill to fix an \nimmigration system that is absolutely broken.\n  The status quo is not working for anyone. None of us wants to find \nourselves, another 5 years from now, debating this issue again and \nfinding that we have a larger population of illegal immigrants and we \nhave legal immigration that is not working for our country and is not \nmaking sure we have the right people here, people who are working hard, \nliving the American dream to grow our economy and great American jobs.\n  I think today the Wall Street Journal has said this border security \nissue cannot be used as a trick not to want to support a strong bill \nwhich is on the floor--and this amendment will make it very strong on \nthe border security provisions--and finally work in a bipartisan manner \nto fix a broken immigration system that is not working for anyone and \nnot working for our country.\n  I yield the floor for my colleague from Florida. I commend my \ncolleague from Florida who has worked--along with the other Members of \nthe group, the Senators from Arizona as well as the Senator from South \nCarolina--but the Senator from Florida, I know how focused he is on \nmaking sure our borders are secure. I appreciate his strong leadership \nin fixing this broken immigration system and making sure we do\n\n[[Page S4751]]\n\nnot have another wave of illegal immigration in this country.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his inquiry.\n  Mr. INHOFE. My inquiry is it was my understanding we were getting \nequal time back and forth. My question is, is this based on party, so \nDemocrats and then Republicans will alternate time; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no agreement for alternation.\n  Mr. INHOFE. There is no agreement? Because all I have heard in the \nlast hour is those in support of the bill. My question is, when can \nsomeone be heard who is not in support of the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is equally divided between majority \nand minority, not between proponents and opponents.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I see.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. There you go.\n  Mr. INHOFE. All right.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Inquiry. Was that by unanimous consent?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It was.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That explains it, then.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity and I will be \nbrief. My colleagues have already stated what this entails and the \ndetails of it. I think that is important.\n  I got involved in this issue earlier this year after spending the \nbetter part of my first 2 years in the Senate thinking about this issue \nbecause, frankly, not just from being from Florida but living in south \nFlorida I am surrounded by the reality of it every single day. When I \nstarted this effort, I became deeply convinced this is something that \nneeded to be fixed and needed to be dealt with, but from the very \nbeginning, the early days of my involvement, I made clear border \nsecurity was an essential component of it.\n  This is not against anybody. Border security is not an anti-anyone \neffort. That is not what it is. We understand that America is a special \ncountry. It is so special that people want to come from all over the \nworld and they do. One million people a year come here legally, every \nsingle year.\n  We also understand it is so special, unique, some people are willing \nto risk their lives to come here illegally. As compassionate people, we \nunderstand that reality and our heart breaks at the stories of what \npeople are having to go through to come. But we also understand the \nUnited States of America is a sovereign country. Every single sovereign \ncountry on the planet, every single one, tries to or does control its \nborders and who comes into the country and who leaves. Every country in \nthe world does that. The United States of America should not be any \ndifferent.\n  At the end of the day, that is what this issue is about. It is that \nwe have a sovereign right to protect our border and we have a crisis on \nthe southern border of the United States. For many different reasons, \npeople have chosen to cross that border illegally, consistently, for \nthe 20 or 30 years, and the results are obvious to all of us. That is \nwhy border security is such an important part of this bill and this \nmeasure.\n  When we introduced our bill, the bill said basically the Department \nof Homeland Security would be given some money, and they would get to \ndecide what the border security plan looked like. Many people in the \npublic and many of our colleagues were unhappy with that proposal. They \nraised valid concerns that we were turning over border security and \ndeciding what the plan would be to people who claim it is already \nsecure. What this amendment does is it takes that back and it says that \nwe, instead, we in the Senate, will decide what that plan is after we \nget input from border agents and others about what will work.\n  What this amendment reflects is what we know will work. We know that \nadding border agents, doubling the size of the U.S. Border Patrol, that \nwill work. We know that completing fence work will work. We know an \nentry-exit tracking system, since 40 percent of our illegal immigrants \nare those who overstay their visas, will work. We know E-Verify will \nwork. It is something many of my colleagues in my party have asked for, \nfor the better part of 10 years. It will work because it takes away the \nmagnet of employment.\n  We know these new technologies that were not available to us in 1986 \nor 2006 or even 5 years ago will work. What this bill says is you must \ndo all of those things, and it is linked to legal permanent residence. \nIn essence, someone who has violated our immigration laws cannot become \na legal permanent resident in the United States until all five of those \nactions happen. That is the guarantee this will happen.\n  Let me close by saying I understand the frustration. I truly do. I \nknow these promises have been made in the past. In a moment, the \nSenator from Alabama whose position on this is well stated will point \nout these promises were also made in 1986. By the way, in 1986, I was \n15 years old, and I have to tell you immigration was the last thing on \nmy mind at that time. But here is the reality of it. The choice before \nus is to try to fix this or to leave it the way it is. What we have is \na disaster of epic proportions. We have 10 or 11 million human beings \nliving among us. We don't know who they are. They are working but not \npaying taxes. There are criminals among them. That has to be solved. A \nlegal immigration system built on the 19th century? We need to fix this \nand this is our chance to fix it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, first from New \nYork and Tennessee, for the good work they have done. My Gang of 8 \ncolleagues--seven of the Gang of 8 colleagues who are my colleagues, we \nare working real hard to get a bill done and it is not easy. It is one \nof the hardest things I have ever done as a legislator. But we keep \nmaking progress and we keep improving. Today I think is a breakthrough \nday.\n  Let me go over it. First, speaking on behalf of the Democratic \nMembers of my bipartisan group, let's say this. There is still some \ndrafting of the legislative language to be completed. We are continuing \nto inform all our allies on our side about the contours of the \nproposal. But barring something unexpected, we are extremely \nenthusiastic that a bipartisan agreement is at hand.\n  I know there have been a number of news reports this morning. It is \naccurate. We are on the verge of a huge breakthrough on border \nsecurity. With this agreement, we believe we have the makings of a \nstrong bipartisan final vote in favor of this immigration reform bill.\n  From the beginning of the floor debate on this bill, we have known \nthere were a group of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle who \nwere inclined to vote for immigration reform but first wanted to see a \nstrengthening of the bill's border security section. That makes sense \nbecause most Americans will be fair and apply common sense toward the \n11 million in the shadows and future immigration if and only if they we \nwill not have future flows of illegal immigration.\n  We took those concerns seriously. Our bill is tough on this stuff. We \nwanted it tough. The amendment makes it tougher still.\n  Last week, Senators Corker and Hoeven emerged as leaders of the group \nof like-minded colleagues from the other side of the aisle seeking a \ntougher approach. My friends Senators Graham and McCain and I sat down \nwith them and we began talking, along with Senator Menendez. We began \nmeetings with them ourselves this week.\n  For us on the Democratic side, it has been an important bottom line \nthroughout this process that the path to citizenship not be put in \njeopardy. The path is tough, as it should be, but must always be fair. \nSo we could not go along with efforts, such as in the bill of my \ncolleague from Texas, that would tie the path to citizenship to \nunachievable benchmarks for the border. Senator Cornyn's amendment, \nwhich was defeated on this day, went too far in that regard, and I was \nnot sure whether the new negotiations would produce agreement either. \nAs recently as Tuesday night, Senator Hoeven and I had an extended \nphone conversation that lasted 45 minutes. It would probably best be \ndescribed as spirited. But about 24 hours ago we had a breakthrough. \nThe idea that broke the logjam is the so-called border surge plan.\n  The border surge is breathtaking in its size and scope. This deal \nwill deploy an unprecedented number of boots on\n\n[[Page S4752]]\n\nthe ground and drones in the air. It would double the size of Border \nPatrol agents from its current level to over 40,000. It will finish the \njob of completing the fence along the entire 700-mile stretch of the \nsouthwest border, and it will enumerate, on a sector-by-sector basis, \nlists of cutting-edge tools and equipment that will boost surveillance \nand apprehension efforts, including sensors, surveillance towers, and \nmore unmanned drones. In other words, the border surge plan calls for a \nbreathtaking show of force that will discourage future waves of illegal \nimmigration.\n  This compromise will inundate the southwest border with manpower and \nequipment. It not only calls for finishing a literal fence, it will \ncreate a virtual human fence of Border Patrol agents. Under the border \nsurge, the Border Patrol will have the capacity to deploy an armed \nagent 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to stand guard every 1,000 feet \nfrom San Diego, CA, to Brownsville, TX.\n  We came up with this idea of the border surge Wednesday morning after \nthe CBO report was released. My colleague from Texas asked: Why not a \nweek ago? We didn't have the CBO report. We didn't know we had the \ndollars. We have them now, and we still keep to our goal of not costing \nthe Treasury a nickel. The CBO report was the game changer. It gave us \nthe budgetary flexibility to consider massive new investments in border \nsecurity that we didn't think we could previously afford.\n  The surge shows the commitment to border security our colleagues have \nbeen asking for. I was heartened to see that our friend the junior \nSenator from Illinois already announced that based on this agreement he \nis prepared to support final passage of the bill. This is a significant \ndevelopment considering Senator Kirk initially opposed the motion to \nproceed. It is safe to say this agreement has the power to change minds \nin the Senate.\n  This agreement on border security continues the spirit of bipartisan \ncompromise that has marked this legislation from the beginning. In \nfact, in the forthcoming Corker-Hoeven amendment, it will be a vehicle \nfor accommodating some other compromises in other areas of Republican \nconcern as well.\n  With this agreement, we have now answered every criticism that has \ncome forward about the immigration bill.\n  First, critics expressed worry that the process would be closed and \nthat no amendments would be allowed. The bill was available for perusal \nweeks before we went to committee. Under Senator Leahy's leadership, \nthe committee was an open process, with 300 amendments filed, and now \nwe are spending weeks on the floor trying to move as many amendments as \npossible. Some on the other side of the aisle have blocked that from \nhappening as quickly as we would like--as well as some on our side \ntoo--but we are moving through these amendments.\n  The next criticism was that it would cost a fortune. CBO debunked \nthat one pretty well. This adds to the Treasury. It cuts the deficit \n$900 billion over the next 20 years, $175 billion over the next 10 \nyears.\n  Finally, the last argument: We have to secure the border. Securing \nthe border is vital before anyone could support the bill--or some could \nsupport the bill. We have answered that resoundingly with the Corker-\nHoeven amendment.\n  We have much more work to do, but I am more confident than ever \nbefore that the Senate will pass a strong bipartisan immigration reform \nbill and that it will ultimately reach the desk of the President for \nsignature. It is a great day for the cause of immigration reform and \nfor the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I know Senator Schumer and the Gang of \n8 have worked hard on this legislation. I respect their efforts and \ngoals. I share their goals, and I share many of the principles they \nstated. But what we learned is that the legislation came nowhere close \nto fulfilling those goals. That is why, here in the middle of the \ndebate after the bill has been exposed, after it has been hammered for \nfailure after failure, they have come up with a bill that says: Don't \nworry now. We are going to throw 20,000 agents at the border, and now \nyou all have to vote for it because we fixed it. Now you got what you \nwanted.\n  I say to my colleagues, too often the phrase ``border security'' has \nbeen used to include all legal and illegal activities that occur. What \nwe know is that not only do we have problems at the border, 40 percent \nof the people who are here illegally today are visa overstays. CBO's \nreport, which just came out, indicates that is going to grow--as I had \npredicted it would--in the future. We are going to have twice as many \npeople come to the country on visas, and they are coming to take jobs--\njobs that Americans need to be prepared to take. We need to get them \nprepared if they are not already prepared. We need to get them off of \nwelfare and into self-sufficiency so they can make good wages that \nallow them to pay for their health care and have a retirement plan with \nenough left over to take care of their families. That has not been \nhappening. Wages for average American workers have been declining since \n1999, and it is a serious problem. I thought perhaps initially with the \nRepublican agenda that this was a temporary thing and might bounce \nback, but we have seen that sustained.\n  Senator Schumer referred to the Congressional Budget Office score, \nbut he didn't refer to this: This bill will accelerate that decline. \nWages will drop more than they would have if the bill didn't pass. CBO \nfound that unemployment would go up. They found that although there \nwould be some increase in the economy, with millions of people coming, \nper capita, per person, the GDP would decrease. So this is a real \nproblem we need to be honest about.\n  How large a flow of people can we sustain and create jobs for? Do we \nwant to invite good people to come to America to take jobs and then \nthey are not here for them? Do we want to bring in so many people that \nwages for American workers decline or Americans can't get the jobs? But \nsomebody who comes from a very poor country, willing to work at the \nlowest possible wage--won't that pull down the wages of Americans who \nwere hoping to get a pay raise instead of a pay cut?\n\n  I submit that this is a serious issue, and that is why Professor \nBorjas at Harvard has said it will adversely impact the wages of \nAmerican workers, particularly low-income American workers. They will \nface the most adverse economic impact. This fact has not been disputed \nso far as I can see.\n  Now, the Senator says the bill is paid for. Know what they do? They \ncount the off-budget money. This is what happened. Under the score the \nCongressional Budget Office gave to us, they found that it would \nincrease the on-budget deficit by $14 billion. It will increase the on-\nbudget debt of America by $14 billion over a period of 10 years. But \nthey say they have a surplus over 10 years in the off-budget accounts--\nsome $200 billion. They have counted that up and said: We have a net \nsurplus. Hallelujah.\n  What is the off-budget money? What are we talking about for the off-\nbudget money? That is Social Security money. Everybody who pays into \nSocial Security, when they get ready to retire, is going to draw out \nthat money. It doesn't add to the net financial benefit of America if a \nperson who is here illegally is given a Social Security card, starts \npaying into Social Security, and will end up drawing from Social \nSecurity.\n  We cannot count the off-budget money. That is how this country has \nbeen going broke. We have been using that budget gimmick for way too \nlong, and that is not correct. We should not be doing that, and it is \nnot going to improve the deficit over 10 years. The statement of the \nCongressional Budget Office and their important report are quite clear \nabout that.\n  It says some other things. With regard to wages for American workers, \nthe Congressional Budget Office report says that if this bill passes, \nwages will go down. It says that if this bill passes, unemployment will \ngo up. That is their analysis of it. It has a chart in there that shows \nthat for over 10 or 20 years per capita GDP is below what it would be \nif the bill had not passed and that wages are going to be low for years \nto come.\n\n[[Page S4753]]\n\n  Why in the world would we as Americans want to dramatically increase \nthe legal flow of immigration above our current generous rate and \ndouble the guest worker program? In addition to legalizing the 11 \nmillion people who would be legalized under the legislation, there are \n4.5 million people who will be given speeded-up allocation under the \nchain migration system. So there will be 4.5 million accelerated under \nthe chain migration as a result of lifting limits on those individuals \nand the people who are here illegally. In addition to that, we will \nhave a large flow of other workers.\n  Now, I have an amendment. This is a number of pages of it, some 30 \npages, very similar to what the House is working on today. It deals \nwith the visa overstay issue. It deals with people who get into the \ncountry legally but don't go home and don't cross the border. It is a \ngrowing percentage of the illegality we see today, and it will soon be \nover half of the illegality, and it certainly will be if this \nlegislation is passed. Does this legislation Senator Schumer refers to \nfix that problem?\n  With the amendment, does this legislation solve the complaints of the \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement agents? They have written us \nmultiple times. They pleaded to be allowed to meet with the Gang of 8 \nand to be able to explain the realities of enforcement difficulties in \nAmerica. We are having an impossible time making enforcement work. Why \nis this administration blocking them from actual enforcement of the law \nas they are sworn to do? They voted no confidence in their supervisor, \nMr. Morton. They filed a lawsuit against Secretary Napolitano, and they \nasserted to her that she is blocking them through regulations and \npolicies from enforcing the law they are sworn to enforce. The matter \nhas been in the court, and the court is considering this lawsuit. I \nhave never heard of Federal agents suing because they are not allowed \nto enforce the law. That is going on in America today. The ICE agents \nhave written us a letter, and they said this legislation will make it \nworse. They said it will endanger national security.\n  What about the other part of the immigration process? Citizenship and \nImmigration Services is a group of officers who have to review the \namnesty applications, review applications from abroad, and do those \nsort of things. Well, what do they say about it? They say the bill will \nmake the situation worse, it will make it impossible for them to do \ntheir job. They do not have the capacity to process the 11 million \npeople who are going to be asking for amnesty. It is not going to work. \nIt will make the system worse. They have not been listened to in this \nprocess either.\n  Now, Senator Schumer said--and I hope everybody heard it--we have a \nplan. Don't worry. We are going to throw 20,000 agents at the border, \nand now you can quit complaining, you complainers, and just be happy \nand vote for our bill.\n  Well, then he said something like: Well, we don't have it written \nyet. We don't have it written yet, and we are working on it. We are \nsharing it with our allies, and we have not shown it to anybody else \nyet. But trust us, we have a bill that will work.\n  That is what they said when the bill was originally filed. They said \nthey had a sufficient fencing system at the border. We read the bill, \nand there was no requirement in the bill to build any fences at the \nborder. It was totally up to the Secretary. So now he seems quite \nhappy--not having been able to run that past the Senate, having been \ncaught on that deal--he is now willing to enhance some fencing. But \ncurrent law, the law we passed a decade ago, required 700 miles of \ndouble-layered fencing, which would actually be very effective. This \nbill now, after having had the bill endangered, they ran out and said, \nwell, we will do 700 miles of single-layer fencing, which is quite less \nsecure and not what we voted on in the Senate 10 years ago. President \nObama voted for it and Vice President Biden voted for it and former \nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton voted for it. That has never been \ndone. We promised to do that too. We passed a law, we even passed \nfunding for it, and it never got built. Only 30 miles of the 700 miles \nof double-layer fencing was ever built.\n\n  So this is a problem we have, along with the American people. So I \nsay to Senator Schumer: I want to read this Corker amendment. Who is \nwriting it, Senator Corker, Senator Hoeven, or Senator Schumer? Senator \nSchumer is telling us what is in it. He is saying he is still working \non it. He is saying he is sharing it with his allies but not with those \nwho have doubts about it. I would like to see this bill we have heard \nso much about. Also, will it deal with other issues?\n  So we know this: We know the legislation gives amnesty first. We were \ntold originally by the Gang of 8 we were going to have border security \nfirst, right? They finally had to acknowledge that isn't so. That is a \npretty big promise.\n  Border security first. Not so in the bill, not so in the Hoeven-\nCorker amendment. The toughest enforcement ever. Clearly, the bill was \nweaker than the 2007 bill. Members of the Gang of 8 have acknowledged \nthat. It is nowhere close.\n  On visas, current law requires that under the visa policy of the \nUnited States, we have entry-exit visas, biometric at land, sea, and \nairports. What does this bill say? This bill says, well, we will have \nelectronic entry-exit visas at air and seaports but not at land ports. \nAnd if we don't have the land ports in the mix, then we never know who \ncame into the country if they left by land.\n  The 9/11 Commission says the system will not work. The system will \nnot work.\n  Proponents of the bill said an individual would have to pay back \ntaxes. That is so ridiculous. That is utterly unenforceable. It is just \na talking point. It has no reality whatsoever.\n  They said a person has to learn English. Not so. A person can be in a \nEnglish course 6 months before their time comes up. They don't have to \ncomplete the course. That is all it requires.\n  They say no welfare benefits, but there are benefits as scored by the \nCongressional Budget Office, the largest of which I suppose is the \nearned-income tax credit.\n  They said it would end illegal immigration, and the Congressional \nBudget Office report, amazingly--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Amazingly, the Congressional Budget Office said the \nbill that is before us would only reduce illegal immigration by 25 \npercent. So we are going to give amnesty for the toughest bill ever, \nand all of this. Then the bill gets in trouble on the floor and they \nscurry around and they get an amendment that throws in, say, 20,000 \nagents who are going to be hired somewhere on the border in the future. \nWe promise. We are going to give amnesty first, though, and we promise \nthat these agents will all be hired and the problem will be fixed. They \npromised to build a fence in 2008. It never happened.\n  So we are going to read this Hoeven-Corker amendment. We are going to \nevaluate it fairly. It seems to me it doesn't come close to touching \nall of the issues necessary to have a lawful system of immigration that \nserves the national interests in a way that Americans can be proud of.\n  We believe in immigration. We want to be compassionate and helpful to \npeople who have been here a long time, but we have to have a system we \ncan count on in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, yesterday we received some very positive \nnews about the future potential impact of this bill that is being \ndebated on the floor today from the Congressional Budget Office \nregarding the expected economic impact of this bill. I think it is \nworth repeating. It has been discussed and debated, but I think it is \nworth repeating for the benefit of those who are watching and for the \nbenefit of those who are crafting a path forward.\n  The CBO report details how successful reforms to our immigration \nsystem called for in this bill will, in fact, boost our economy not \nonly in the next 10 years but in the 10 years to follow. Specifically, \nthe report details how immigration reform will cut the deficit by \nnearly $200 billion--I think it is $197\n\n[[Page S4754]]\n\nbillion over the next decade--and then $700 billion in the following \ndecade. CBO projects over 20 years, nearly $1 trillion in savings.\n  While economic growth and deficit reduction are both great things and \nimportant for our country, what is particularly interesting and \nvaluable about this bill is that the growth and jobs, according to CBO, \nwill be experienced by Americans all across the country and all along \nthe labor spectrum. The CBO report is consistent with a statement last \nmonth from the Social Security Administration that this bill would \ncreate over 3 million jobs in the next 10 years. Simply put, this is a \njobs bill.\n  The immigration bill before us creates jobs in a number of different \nways that I think are worth taking a minute to look at. First, the bill \ncreates jobs by making needed investments, as we have heard at great \nlength today, in border security. The brave men and women who defend \nour country's borders will get the support they need to reduce illegal \nimmigration and save lives. Many of these men and women, in fact, will \nhave served honorably and previously in our Armed Forces abroad, and \nthis bill provides a specific opportunity at which our heroes will \nexcel.\n  The bill also creates jobs by creating and enhancing immigration \nprograms that encourage investment in American companies and in \nAmerican workers.\n  The permanent authorization of such demonstrated programs such as EB-\n5 and the new INVEST visa, which build upon years of demonstrated \nsuccess and create years of jobs through targeted investment capital, \nis another benefit of this bill.\n  In the last Congress I worked with a bipartisan group, including \nSenators Warner, Rubio, and Moran, in crafting something called the \nStartup visa, and I am thrilled this includes the INVEST visa, quite \nsimilar to the Startup vise idea, that encourages foreign nationals \nwith capital who are entrepreneurs to come to the United States and \ninvest in job growth in our country.\n  New companies create new jobs, and the contributions of immigrant \nentrepreneurs are well known in every corner of this country, including \nin my own home State of Delaware. By encouraging rather than limiting \nimmigrant entrepreneurs, this bill will ensure the American dream \nremains alive and well for future generations.\n  This bill also, in my view, will create jobs in the short term and in \nthe long term by encouraging companies to invest in growth in the \nUnited States rather than abroad. It balances the need to attract and \nretain high-skilled foreign-born individuals, many of whom are \ncurrently trained at American universities at public expense, while \nalso ensuring that companies recruit Americans for open positions in \nhigh-skilled jobs--typically those who focus in the engineering and \nscience, math and technology areas.\n  The reforms in this bill to our employment-based visa system are long \noverdue. It does a wide range of things, including clears backlogs, \neliminates the per-country caps, and permits so-called dual-intent for \nstudents. I think all of these are positive for improving the quality \nand the availability of the American workforce. I think we should get \nthis done.\n  At the same time, this bill makes an important contribution to the \nhealth and welfare of American workers by cracking down on unauthorized \nillegal employment and bringing workers out of the shadows and into our \nopen economy. I am particularly happy this bill includes clear guidance \nthat immigrants authorized to work in this country are able to provide \nservices in all parts of the economy by accessing appropriate licensure \nstandards. This provision will ensure that once legally authorized to \nwork, immigrants who abide by the same laws and safety measures as \nAmericans will be able to bring their full skills and talents into our \neconomy.\n  For the long-term health of our economy, this bill also contains an \nimportant investment in training our children. I had the pleasure of \nworking with Senators Hatch, Rubio, and Klobuchar on a STEM fund \nconcept in our immigration innovation bill, and I am glad to see the \ninclusion of that STEM education fund that will improve the science, \ntechnology, engineering, and math education of U.S. national children \nin schools across this country.\n  At a time when we have to make difficult decisions about how best to \ncut the deficit and grow the economy, this bill is perhaps the best \nchance we have at making significant, bipartisan progress while also \nmaking our country more fair, more just, and more secure.\n  If I might for another few minutes, I wish to also speak about what \nit means to make our immigration system more just.\n  America has earned its place in the world in part because of the \nimmigrants who have come before us bringing their culture, their \npassion, their ideas, and their skills to our shores. When I ask \nAmericans what they expect of our immigration system as we try to fix \nthis badly broken system, they say they want one that keeps us safe \nfrom foreign threats, from terrorism, and dangerous individuals. They \nwant a system that protects the American workforce and that grows our \neconomy. They want a system that is fair and transparent and that \nreflects our most basic values.\n\n  It is clear to me, as it is, I suspect, to the Presiding Officer and \nmany of our colleagues that our current immigration system just isn't \nconsistent with our most sacred values. We are failing to resolve legal \ndisputes through a judicial process worthy of our world-renowned \njustice system, and we are failing to safeguard taxpayer dollars which \nwe are needlessly wasting with a slow and inefficient and poorly \nmanaged immigration legal system.\n  Our immigration system jeopardizes our values and mistreats those who \nwould adopt them as their own. So I think we must act.\n  Fortunately, this bill before us today better aligns our immigration \nsystem with our most basic values. It is not perfect, but it is a vital \nand needed step forward. It makes critical progress, for example, in \nthe treatment of children who are forced into our immigration courts. \nUnder our current system, children as young as 8 years old--often with \nlimited English language skills--are forced to stand in front of \nimmigration judges and argue whether they have some basis to remain in \nour country. These children aren't represented by counsel. The \nproceeding is adversarial. The judge is an employee of the same agency \nas the prosecutor. This, in my view, doesn't look anything like \nAmerica, and in some essential ways it must change.\n  By expanding access to representation for children, this bill will \nnot only seek better justice for immigrant children, but also help \nadminister cases in a more efficient manner. In our immigration courts \nwhere immigrants are regularly brought before judges without \ninformation central to their own cases, this bill will ensure \nimmigrants have access to their own case files before they appear in \ncourt. In our own civil and criminal court systems, this sort of basic \ninformation exchange is the bare minimum.\n  This is an improvement that reflects our values, by letting people \nunderstand the consequences before them when they step into a \ncourtroom. It is also a commonsense way to save money by expediting \nimmigration proceedings where dockets are currently backlogged not just \nweeks and months but years. While immigration courts deal with mounting \nbacklogs, many immigrants remain in detention at enormous cost to \ntaxpayers.\n  Finally, this bill also proposes a rational detention policy that \nkeeps immigrants who pose a real threat to society in detention while \nrecognizing the value, the capability of modern technology to provide \nalternatives to detention when the only concern is appearing for a \nhearing. Our values tell us that individuals who pose no threat to \nsociety don't belong in protracted detention, and technology has \nallowed us to exercise better alternatives.\n  By addressing the backlog of cases through improvements to the court \nsystem and by making steps toward a more rational detention policy, I \nbelieve this bill in its current form will save money while reflecting \nour shared values.\n  I wish to draw the attention of my colleagues to one amendment that \nraises concerns for me on this exact point. It is amendment No. 1203, \nand Senator Inhofe is the lead sponsor. It would, in my view, require \nessentially mandatory indefinite detention of\n\n[[Page S4755]]\n\nthose who are currently detained in the American immigration system for \nwhom we can find no country that would accept them, but with no \npathway, no alternative to discretion for an immigration judge to \nchoose to use technology to allow them out of detention while ensuring \nthat they pose no threat to security for our communities. I think this \ntakes away necessary opportunities for immigration judges to exercise \ndiscretion as to who belongs in detention for very long periods of time \nat great public expense. It is my hope my colleagues will act to defeat \nthis amendment.\n  In closing, in my view, it is critical for the future of our country \nthat we address all of these issues now. I look forward to the passage \nof this legislation. When our laws are so inconsistent with our basic \nvalues, we should act without delay. When we have right in front of us \nan opportunity to reduce the deficit and to grow jobs, to make this \ncountry safer, stronger, fairer, and more prosperous, we should act in \na bipartisan and progressive way.\n  With that, I thank the Chair, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. I would ask unanimous consent to vitiate the quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  Mr. VITTER. I would ask to go to regular order to the Leahy \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. VITTER. Great, Madam President.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1507 to Amendment No. 1183\n\n  At this point, I would send a second-degree amendment to the desk to \nmake that pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1507 to amendment No. 1183.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To ensure that aliens convicted of crimes of violence against \nwomen and children are ineligible for registered provisional immigrant \n                                status)\n\n       On page 945, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following:\n       ``(III) an offense, unless the applicant demonstrates to \n     the Secretary, by clear and convincing evidence, that he or \n     she is innocent of the offense, that he or she is the victim \n     of such offense, or that no offense occurred, that--\n       ``(aa) is classified as a misdemeanor, in the convicting \n     jurisdiction; and\n       ``(bb) involved--\n       ``(AA) domestic violence) (as defined in section 40002(a) \n     of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. \n     13925(a)); or\n       ``(BB) child abuse and neglect (as defined in section \n     40002(a) of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. \n     13925(a));\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, what is the pending amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Vitter amendment No. 1507 to the Leahy \namendment No. 1183.\n  Mr. REID. I raise a point of order against the Vitter amendment that \nit is improperly drafted to the Leahy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is well taken. The \namendment falls.\n  Mr. REID. The Vitter amendment falls; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It falls.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I now ask unanimous consent that there be \na period of debate only until 6:30 p.m., with the time equally divided \nbetween the two leaders or their designees, and that I be recognized at \n6:30 this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I don't know if there is any \nparticular order. I see other colleagues on the floor. I am not in a \nparticular rush. I would be happy for them to speak, but I wish to \nspeak for 5 minutes as in morning business.\n  I thank the Senators.\n  I know the leadership--Senator Leahy and Senator Grassley--are \nworking very hard to negotiate some very controversial and serious \namendments to the underlying bill, and there have been negotiations \ngoing on all day on the immigration bill, and actually for weeks, both \nin the Judiciary Committee, where 17 Members serve, and then here on \nthe Senate floor, where the rest of us have our only opportunity to \nengage and to be part of legislating a bill that is likely to pass. \nThere is no guarantee, but it looks as though it is moving in that \ndirection.\n  The bill has been strengthened as it has gone on, and we have had a \nvery vigorous debate. But I have come to the floor several times only \nto say this: There is a series of amendments that are completely \nuncontested. In other words, there is no opposition to them. The list \nis approximately, from what we can tell at this point, potentially \naround 30 to 35. It could be more, but there are clearly 30 to 35 \namendments that have been filed by Republicans, by Democrats, and some \nof these amendments are cosponsored by Republicans and Democrats, each \ntogether.\n  I have been talking about this for a couple of days because I think \nwe have to get back to trusting each other and working together across \nparty lines on major bills such as this and actually working to pass \namendments that nobody objects to. Wouldn't that be amazing. We used to \ndo that routinely through a practice called the managers' amendment. In \nthe last couple of months or years everybody is so angry and aggravated \nat the end of the debate there is no managers' package. So I have \ndecided to start early identifying amendments while the leadership is \nfocused on the more controversial amendments both sides are still \narguing about that are significantly meritorious. I have been focused \non amendments that are very good ideas, and to which, to my knowledge, \nthere is literally no opposition.\n  I want to adjust the list and remove from the Landrieu list Collins \namendment No. 1255. There has been some objection on our side to that. \nHeller No. 1234, there has been some objection to that. Now, this is \nnot final. I am not managing the bill. I am just saying, to be honest, \nwe have heard objections as to these two.\n  There are additional amendments that come to our attention that may \nnot have any opposition that I may want to add to this list. One is \nToomey No. 1236 which clarifies that personnel, infrastructure, and \ntechnology used in the comprehensive border security strategy is \nprocured through existing or new programs. It is a clarification to the \nunderlying bill. I don't think anyone objects to that.\n  Senator Grassley has an amendment No. 1306 that he is well aware of \nthat authorizes the Attorney General to appoint counsel to represent an \nunaccompanied alien child with serious mental disabilities. I most \ncertainly would support that. He and I have worked together on many \npieces of child welfare legislation. There is no one opposing that \namendment.\n  Johanns amendment No. 1345 requires CBO to report on revenues and \ncosts generated by the bill and requires the DHS Secretary to generally \nadjust fees under the bill to cover costs that are not fully offset. As \nthe cosponsors of this bill have said, this bill will not cost \ntaxpayers any money. It is offset by fees. This amendment is simply \nclarifying that statement. It would be a good amendment. I think that \nis an example.\n  Senator Coats' amendment No. 1372 requires, similar to Senator \nGrassley, to consult on children coming through with mental \ndisabilities to make sure they have legal counsel. No one would object \nto that.\n  Finally, Senator Flake, amendment No. 1472, requires the GAO to study \nthe use of non-Federal roads by Customs and Border Protection.\n  These amendments are not striking lightning anywhere, not upsetting\n\n[[Page S4756]]\n\nWestern civilization. These are perfecting amendments that we came here \nto legislate on behalf of our constituents because there are people or \ngroups or entities in our States that are following the big bill and \nthe big controversies of it, but some people are actually following the \nspecifics and want to make suggestions to make the bill better. So \npeople who are going to vote against the bill can still vote against \nit. People who are going to vote for it can still vote for it. But we \ncan make the bill better. That is what we are here to do.\n  I can't, under the order, have any motions, but I will just bring it \nto the attention of the Senate that I am going to submit this to the \nRecord. If there are any objections to those that I have talked about, \nplease let us know.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I rise today to talk about a couple \namendments that I hope will make it on the Landrieu list. I think they \nare entirely consistent with what she has talked about; that is, \namendments where there should not be any controversy, where we can come \ntogether as Republicans and Democrats and support them, in order to \nimprove this underlying piece of legislation on immigration reform.\n  I do think it is important for us to resolve this issue of an \nimmigration system that is broken--a legal system that fails to \nactually uphold the laws within it.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, and I talked about it yesterday, I \nstill have concerns about the legislation in a number of areas.\n  One is the internal enforcement of the legislation, particularly with \nregard to the workplace. I think the magnet of work that encourages \nillegal immigration can be addressed through a stronger and more \ncomprehensive E-Verify system, and we plan to offer an amendment to \nthat effect, and will work with both sides of the aisle.\n  I also have concerns about Federal benefits going to noncitizens. I \nknow that Senator Hatch has been working diligently on that issue as \nhave Senator Rubio and others, and I am hopeful that we will be able to \nwork something out to address that issue.\n  Border security, of course, is an issue which we have talked a lot \nabout today. It is important, but the provisions concerning it are not \nsufficient, in my view.\n  Finally, I do have concerns about the eligibility for legal status of \nconvicted criminals. That is what I want to talk about today.\n  Again, Senator Landrieu has talked about supporting a number of \nuncontested amendments that will improve the underlying bill. I think \nthese two amendments that I am going to talk about today fit well into \nthat category.\n  These amendments would apply a uniform and fair standard to anyone \nconvicted of a felony. I think that is, at a minimum, what we have to \nbe doing. If you are convicted of a felony crime, there ought to be a \nfair standard applied, and you ought not to be able to obtain a legal \nstatus. They would also ensure that dangerous criminals who prey on the \nmost vulnerable among us are not given legal status under this \nlegislation.\n  Yesterday I talked in general terms about what these amendments would \naccomplish. One problem I identified is that the underlying bill \nrequires an applicant for legal status to have served at least 1 year \nin prison in order to make that person ineligible, regardless of the \ncrime, even if the crime they committed was a felony.\n  I think it is also important to understand the kinds of criminal \nconvictions that, under the current bill before us, would not prevent \nsomeone from beginning the process of becoming a citizen, so I am going \nto give a couple examples. These are the kinds of incidents that we see \non the nightly news and that fill us with disgust and outrage. They are \nnot hypothetical:\n  A man convicted of felony child abuse for beating his children ages 6 \nand 8 with a riding crop, shooting them with BB guns and bottle \nrockets, and choking and burning them with cigarettes; a woman \nconvicted of aggravated child abuse for giving alcohol to an 8-pound, \n7-week-old infant to the point that its blood alcohol level was more \nthan four times the legal limit for an adult; a man convicted of felony \ndomestic violence when he broke into the home of his ex-girlfriend, \nchoked her, pulled out her hair, and beat her to keep her from getting \nhelp.\n  All of these criminals were convicted of felonies; none of them \nserved the full year imprisonment required to be inadmissible under S. \n744, the underlying bill. So if somebody were convicted of these \nhorrible crimes, they could still be admissible to go into legal status \nbecause they didn't serve that 1 year minimum.\n  By the way, this can result from several different factors. One is \nthe disposition of the sentencing judge. Another is the recommendation \nmade by prosecutors, possibly for reasons that were valid such as to \nget more information out of these criminals. It could also be because \nof overcrowding in our State prisons, which, unfortunately, is endemic \nin this country.\n  So I think making decisions based on time served is not the right way \nto go. It means that if two individuals are convicted of the same crime \nof violence--in this case domestic violence--but one serves 1 year in \nprison, and the other is sentenced to 6 months; the first person is \nbarred from citizenship while the second would still be eligible. It is \nunfair, it is illogical, and it is not in keeping with the spirit of \nthe legislation before us to treat all violent felons in the same \nmanner.\n\n  My very simple amendment would ensure that those convicted of \ndomestic violence, stalking, or child abuse, who could have been \nsentenced to not less than 1 year imprisonment for the crime at the \ntime of conviction, are not eligible for citizenship.\n  My second amendment ensures that crimes against children involving \nmoral turpitude--things like child abuse, child neglect, and \ncontributing to the delinquency of a minor through sexual acts--are not \nsubject to the discretionary authority of the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and the immigration judges with respect \nto removal, deportation, or admissibility of an individual. Crimes \ninvolving moral turpitude look past a conviction and the elements of a \ncrime because these acts are conclusively against our values as a \npeople.\n  This amendment would continue the standards we have always had \nenshrined in our immigration system. For that reason, just like the \nprevious amendment, I believe, in a sense, that this is just a \nclarification that is necessary to make this underlying law work.\n  A quirk in the bill before us would change that. It weakens the laws \ndesigned to protect our kids. That is the kind of reform we don't need.\n  Discretionary authority has its place, I acknowledge that, but there \nis no excuse for committing acts of violence against children, and \nthose who would do so are not worthy of citizenship. But under the \nlegislation as currently written, someone who commits a felony \nassault--for example, a man who gets in a bar fight with another man--\nwould be deported, but a father who goes home from that same bar and \nbeats his children or hits his wife would not necessarily face the same \nconsequences.\n  I can't believe that this was the intention of this legislation or \nthat anybody in this Chamber would find that acceptable.\n  We want to make sure that this immigration bill only benefits those \nwho are worthy of it. This bill is for the men and women who have come \nto this country to build a better life for themselves and their \nfamilies, not those who would abuse them. It is for those who are \nwilling to work hard, not for those who have served hard time. It seeks \nto open the door to American citizenship for those who share our values \nof respecting and protecting human life, not those who would commit \ncrimes against the most vulnerable among us.\n  The debate on immigration reform has been long and at some points it \nhas been difficult. I saw that on the Senate floor earlier today. And \nmany of the amendments that have been offered have been highly \ncontentious.\n  Again, I will be offering some amendments on ensuring that there is \nproper enforcement of the legislation later in this process. But I \nwould say that these amendments we have offered, which are before the \nSenate, amendments Nos. 1389 and 1390, are amendments that shouldn't be \ncontentious. They are intended only to protect our children and\n\n[[Page S4757]]\n\nto ensure that the creation of a path to citizenship does not leave the \nvictims of domestic violence as second-class citizens.\n  There will be hard votes in the days to come. This is not one of \nthem. I urge my colleagues to support both of these amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I appreciate the recognition, and I \nensure my colleagues I will be brief. I appreciate very much the work \nof the Senator from Ohio on this bill.\n  I wanted to come to the floor this afternoon to talk about the \nagreement that we have reached with Senators Corker and Hoeven that \nwill significantly increase security measures taken at our borders.\n  We have spent a lot of time talking about this issue over the last \nmonths with some proposals that would have simply gone too far by \nsacrificing the path to citizenship, perhaps completely, in some of \nthese proposals.\n  I thank Senator Corker, Senator Hoeven, and the other Senators who \nhave been involved in this discussion for striking the balance in a \ndifferent place and giving us a path to another bipartisan agreement \nthat has required compromise--principled compromise--on all sides \nthroughout this process.\n  A number of us have said that this bill is not the bill each of us \nwould have written left to our own devices. But the nature of this \nplace, when it is working, is that it is a place where people make \nprincipled compromises and come together.\n  I want to thank Chairman Leahy, who is on the floor today, for the \nprocess that he led in the Judiciary Committee to get us here. There \nwere over 300 amendments considered. I think there were 141 amendments \nadopted by both Democrats and Republicans.\n  This is the way Colorado expects the Senate to work--a State that is \none-third Democratic, one-third Republican, and one-third Independent, \nand doesn't care very much about what labels people put on each other \nor themselves but would like the institutions in Washington to actually \nreflect their priorities and reflect the way they do business, which is \nby coming together and figuring out how to deal with principled \ndisagreements.\n  So while we have said this bill isn't the bill that I would have \nwritten alone, it is a good bill. It is a bill that has gotten stronger \nin the committee and stronger on the Senate floor. That is the way it \nis supposed to work.\n  People at home know that doing big things means we are going to have \nto be willing to come together from time to time on compromised \nsolutions, and that is what we are doing here. We are protecting the \nprinciples the eight of us laid out when we started this process, which \nincludes ensuring a pathway to citizenship that is real and attainable, \nin addition to preventing future illegal immigration through, among \nother measures, securing our borders.\n  Our agreement had additional support for securing the border even \nafter the improvements we have seen over the last 10 years. But now \nwhat we have before us is what some have called a border surge plan \nthat will significantly expand resources at the border beyond what is \nalready in the bill.\n  It will double the number of border agents--an agent, it has been \nestimated, every 1,000 feet on the border. It will significantly expand \nfencing. It will implement new technology and resources such as fixed \ntowers, surveillance cameras, and aerial surveillance units. It will \nprovide for full monitoring of our southern border.\n  We have already dramatically increased security at the border. This \nbill will double the number of border agents on our southern border. \nAnd while these items will add more cost to the bill, we know such \ncosts are offset by fees and fines on visas throughout our bill.\n  Yesterday's news from the Congressional Budget Office that the bill \nas written would achieve nearly $900 billion in deficit savings over \nthe next 20 years--coupled with the gigantic steps we are already \ntaking at the border, along with the growing coalition of support for \nfixing our broken immigration system--is leaving opponents with less \nand less to undercut the bill. The case is simply slipping away for \nmaintaining the status quo that is holding back our economy, keeping us \nless secure, and tearing apart families.\n  At home, people actually think securing the border is a virtue. They \nsupport securing the border at home. People at home think a pathway to \ncitizenship that resolves the question for the 11 million people \nworking in this shadow economy, in this cash economy, is a virtue. \nPeople at home believe both of those things would be positive. In \nWashington, somehow it becomes a trade: border security for \ncitizenship, depending on which side you are on.\n  I want to say how grateful I am to the other Members of the Gang of \n8, particularly to Senator McCain, Senator Graham, Senator Rubio, and \nSenator Flake, my Republican colleagues, and to Senator Hoeven and \nSenator Corker for creating the opportunity for us to have a big \nbipartisan vote on this Senate floor next week; to be able to show the \nAmerican people there is hope, that we can finally resolve not just the \nissue for the 11 million, but we can also begin as a country to have \nthe talents of people from all over the world who want to contribute to \nour economy, who want to build their businesses here.\n  I thank them for legislating in such a constructive way, so as we \nmove forward, to have the chance for each of us to vote to reaffirm two \nessential principles that make our country so special: One, that we are \ncommitted to the rule of law and the other that we are a nation of \nimmigrants.\n  I yield the floor. I thank the Senator from Utah for his patience.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up an amendment, No. 1207.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I object.\n  Mr. BENNET. I object.\n  Madam President, I did not know that was the purpose of the Senator \nrising, so I will keep going on another topic.\n  Through the Chair, does the Senator from Utah want to speak?\n  Mr. LEE. Through the Chair, the Senator from Utah would like to \nspeak.\n\n\n                             The Farm Bill\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Through the Chair, two sentences, which are: Our farmers \nand ranchers in Colorado have been suffering through the worst drought \nthat we have had in a generation. This is the third year in a row of \nthat drought. We have passed a bipartisan farm bill twice on the floor \nof the Senate, I think with over 70 votes. It is not perfect. There are \nthings in it I would change. It is the only bipartisan deficit \nreduction, other than the immigration bill, that has been achieved by a \ncommittee in this Congress, either on the Senate side or House side--\nthe only one.\n  We make important reforms to our conservation title. We end direct \npayments to producers. The Senate bill is not a perfect bill, but it is \na good bill. Today the House of Representatives voted their own bill \ndown. Farmers and ranchers in Colorado who are working hard to try to \nsupport their families, to create a condition where they can leave \ntheir farms and ranches to the next generation of Coloradans, are left \nto scratch their heads once again why Washington cannot get its work \ndone.\n  I urge the House of Representatives to pass the bipartisan Senate \nfarm bill so our farmers and ranchers can get the relief they need.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, will the Senator, before he yields the \nfloor, yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. BENNET. I yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I believe the Senator is aware of this. I \nask, does he know when we passed the farm bill last year by a huge \nbipartisan margin, and again this year, that on the Senate committee \nare several former chairs of that committee in both parties as well as \na former Secretary of Agriculture, and we came together as Republicans \nand Democrats to pass a bill that saves $23 to $28 billion? I believe \nthe Senator is aware of that.\n  Mr. BENNET. Through the Chair, I am aware of that. I appreciate the \nSenator from Vermont, the former chair of the committee and now the \nchair of the Judiciary Committee, reminding the\n\n[[Page S4758]]\n\nChamber that the Senator from Vermont has been here longer than I have \nbeen, just being honest about it. But I wonder sometimes what it would \nhave been like to serve in this body when it did not have a 10-percent \napproval rating. The chairman was here when the Congress did not have a \n10-percent approval rating. I don't know why anybody in the world would \nwant to work in a place that had that level of approval.\n  I came down to the floor once with a slide that tried to find other \nenterprises that had the kind of approval rating we have in this \nCongress. It is very hard to do. The IRS had a 40-percent approval \nrating. There is an actress who had a 15-percent approval rating. \nEleven percent of the American people say they want the country to be a \nCommunist country--I don't, by the way. I think Fidel Castro had a 5- \nor 6-percent approval rating.\n  We have to start working together. That is what the American people \nwant. That is what the people in my State want. They know we are not \nalways going to agree on everything, but they expect us to actually get \nthings done. One of the matters we have in front of us, this \nimmigration bill, is an excellent example of Republicans and Democrats \ncoming together to do their work.\n  The chairman is exactly right. The Senator from Vermont is exactly \nright. We have differences on the Agriculture Committee sometimes, but \nthey are not partisan differences. They are not differences between \nRepublicans and Democrats. They are regional differences, and we find a \nway to hash those out. We were able to pass this bill on the floor with \nbroad bipartisan support. That is what we should do with this \nimmigration bill and that is what the House of Representatives should \ndo with our Senate farm bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I certainly share the concern of my friend \nand colleague from Colorado, and I thank him for his remarks. We do, as \nan institution, have an alarmingly low approval rating. I have even \nsaid we are slightly less popular in America than the Castro brothers \nand slightly more popular than the influenza virus, but the virus is \ngaining on us rapidly.\n  There are many reasons for this. One thing is we are trying to gain \ntoo much control over too may aspects of the lives of the American \npeople. There is so much of what the American people do that is \ngoverned, even micromanaged by the Federal Government and by what it \ndoes every single day. So much of their wealth has to go to pay their \ntaxes to the Federal Government. So many of their communications are \npotentially susceptible to being monitored. So much of what they do is \nin one way or another restricted by the Federal Government.\n  I would like to discuss amendment No. 1207, which would address one \nof the many implications of the fact that we have a Federal Government \nthat is simply too big. It deals specifically with the ownership of \nFederal land.\n  In my State, the State of Utah, the Federal Government owns about \ntwo-thirds of the land. That is two-thirds of the land that has to be \nmanaged by bureaucrats, bureaucrats ultimately working out of \nWashington, DC, who, for the most part, don't tend to share the same \nvalues or the same interests in land development as do people from my \nown State. That is land we cannot tax and land we therefore cannot \naccess as a resource. It is land that, because it cannot be taxed, \ncannot provide tax revenue for local governments to fund fire \ndepartments, police services, and schools.\n  It has other implications too when the Federal Government owns this \nmuch land. It is significant that about 40 percent of the land along \nour border is owned by the Federal Government. It is significant that \nin a lot of that stretch of border, Federal agents from the Bureau of \nCustoms and Border Protection, or CBP, are not allowed to do their job. \nEven our own Federal officers cannot do that which they need to do, \nthat which they have sworn an oath to do, at least not very \neffectively, for the simple reason that this is Federal land and there \nare a whole host of environmental restrictions that often accompany the \nuse of Federal land or traversing on Federal land of any kind.\n  This is foreign to many of my colleagues, many of whom come from \nStates where there is very little Federal land. It is significant that \nin every State in the Rocky Mountains or west of the Rocky Mountains \nthe Federal Government owns 15 percent or more of the land in those \nStates, and in every State east of the Rocky Mountains the Federal \nGovernment owns less than 15 percent. In many cases it is much less \nthan that--in some cases \\1/2\\ of 1 percent.\n  I don't expect all of my colleagues to sympathize with this \nimmediately, but I hope, in time, when they come to understand what we \nface in these States where there is so much Federal land ownership, \nthey would be sympathetic to this amendment.\n  The idea of this amendment is we have a problem. We have a problem \nwhen CBP agents cannot adequately enforce the law, cannot adequately \nenforce the border, protect it for national security purposes and \nimmigration purposes and the like, simply because of the fact the land \nis federally owned and environmental restrictions get in their way and \ninterfere with their ability to do that.\n  The net result of this is not environmental protection because, as we \nhave seen, in many of these areas, because coyotes and others who bring \npeople illegally across the border are well aware of these \nrestrictions, they will make sure illegal immigrants come across these \nvery same tracts of land in order to get into the United States \nillegally. They leave in their wake, in some cases, a trail of \ndestruction or at least a trail of litter as they drop things along the \nway.\n  This also, by the way, creates very dangerous conditions for many of \nthese immigrants who are trying to cross very remote sections of land. \nIt makes it difficult, not just for the agents but also for the \nimmigrants alike. It is not good for anyone.\n  This amendment tries to change that. This amendment would provide \nimmediate access to land at the border for the purpose of maintaining \nor building roads, fences, also driving patrol vehicles, and for \ninstalling surveillance equipment. It is interesting. People are dying \non the border as a result of the fact that immigrants very often will \ncross these very remote sections of land. They run out of water. They \nrun out of food. They run out of other supplies. They get lost.\n  It is scary. This would happen less if we were adequately enforcing \nour border. Again, border lands are littered with the trash left behind \nby these illegally crossing illegal aliens.\n  This has not gone completely unnoticed in the past. In fact, this has \nbeen reported in the press. Just a few years ago, the Washington Post \nreported, November 16, 2009, the following:\n\n       In a remarkably candid letter to members of Congress, \n     Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said her \n     department could have to delay pursuits of illegal immigrants \n     while waiting for horses to be brought in so agents don't \n     trample protected lands, and warns that illegal immigrants \n     will increasingly make use of remote, protected areas to \n     avoid being caught.\n       The documents also show the Interior Department has charged \n     the Homeland Security Department $10 million over the past \n     two years as a ``mitigation'' penalty to pay for damage to \n     public lands that agencies say has been caused by Border \n     Patrol agents chasing illegal immigrants.\n\n  Every one of us in this body whom I am aware of has been saying we \nneed to secure the border and that we do. I am here to reiterate that \nvery point. If we are serious about that, as we claim to be, then we \nhave a certain obligation to make sure our CBP agents, officers have \nthe ability to enforce the law; that they are not fighting this battle \nwith one hand or perhaps both hands tied behind their back; that we are \nnot ordering them to make bricks without straw. We have to give them \nthe ability to do their job and certainly not interfere with it.\n  It is not just that we are placing a minor incidental burden on their \nability to enforce the laws, we are talking about 40 percent of the \nland along the southern border that is federally owned. So we are \ndealing with an awful lot of land. Everyone knows if we enforce the \nborder in some areas but make it impossible to enforce in others, we \nare going to drive the illegal immigration traffic toward those areas \nof the border where enforcement is not ongoing.\n  That is what my amendment does. This has been debated and discussed \nin\n\n[[Page S4759]]\n\nthe House of Representatives. My understanding is that in prior \nlegislation the House of Representatives has even adopted this \nprovision.\n  I urge each and every one of my colleagues to take a close look at \namendment No. 1207, which I hope to call up in the near future, and I \nhope we will pass this measure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, first, let me thank my very good friend \nfrom Iowa who graciously allowed me to make a very short statement. I \nam concerned about this. Several of us have amendments we have been \ntrying to get up for a long period of time. Frankly, I do not know what \nthe current status of the amendments and the bill are right now, \nwhether we will be getting to some votes sooner or later. I have no way \nof knowing. But I have one amendment that is one I thought would be so \nacceptable that there would not be any opposition to it. Let me just \nbriefly tell you what it is.\n  My amendment addresses the 2001 U.S. Supreme Court decision in \nZadvydas. This is one where the Court held--we all remember this--that \nimmigrants admitted to the United States and then ordered removed could \nnot be detained for more than 6 months.\n  Four years later, the Supreme Court came along and extended the \ndecision to people here illegally as well. That is what we are talking \nabout right now. We are talking about illegals who come into this \ncountry. As a result, the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security \nhave no choice but to release thousands of criminal immigrants into our \nneighborhoods. The problem with these decisions is the criminal \nimmigrants ordered to be removed cannot be deported back to their \ncountry if that country refuses to accept them back.\n\n  Let's stop and think about that. I certainly could not criticize a \ncountry for not taking back a hardened criminal into their country, and \nthat is what happens. More importantly, these decisions have a serious \nimpact on public safety, as recent cases have illustrated.\n  Six years ago a Vietnamese immigrant was ordered to be deported after \nserving time in prison for armed robbery and assault. He was never \nremoved because the Supreme Court decision handicapped our authorities. \nOur immigration officials couldn't deport him without the cooperation \nof the Vietnamese Government, which they didn't get. The Vietnamese \nGovernment said, we don't want this guy back. As a result, his \ndeportation was never processed.\n  This same immigrant, Binh Thai Luc, is suspected of killing five \npeople in a San Francisco home in March of 2012.\n  The story of Qian Wu puts this situation in perspective. Qian Wu felt \na little safer after the man who had stalked, choked, punched her, and \npointed a knife at her was locked up and ordered to be removed from the \ncountry. She naturally felt better at that time because the guy was \nbehind lock and key and then was going to be ordered back to his \ncountry. The man, Huang Chen, was a Chinese citizen who had illegally \nentered the United States. As has been the case at least 8,000 times in \nthe last 4 years, Mr. Chen's home country refused to let its violent \ncriminal return. So here is a guy who is a violent criminal, ordered to \nbe sent back to his country, but his country didn't want him.\n  Handcuffed by the Supreme Court decision, immigration officials \nreleased Mr. Chen back into the community when they had no place else \nto send him. They released the guy. As anyone can imagine, this story \ndoes not have a happy ending. Upon his release in 2010, Huang Chen \nmurdered Qian Wu. He murdered her. She suspected this was going to \nhappen. As we can see, this is a real problem with serious \nconsequences, and there are others like these people out there.\n  According to statistics provided by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, there are many countries that are not cooperating or take \nlonger to repatriate their nationals. Countries such as Iran, Pakistan, \nChina, Somalia, and Liberia are all on that list. The Supreme Court, in \nmaking their decision, said Congress should clarify the law. I have an \namendment that clarifies the law by creating a framework that allows \nimmigration officials to detain dangerous criminals and immigrants such \nas Binh Thai Luc and Huang Chen.\n  This is specifically what this amendment does: Immigrants can be \ndetained beyond 6 months if they are under orders of removal but cannot \nbe deported due to the country's unwillingness to accept them back into \ntheir country.\n  There are several conditions that have to be made, including if the \nrelease would threaten national security--keep in mind that a \ndetermination has been made that they threaten national security, \nthreaten the safety of the community, and the alien either is an \naggravated felon or has committed a crime of violence.\n  I understand the ACLU is opposed to this, and that should make \neveryone excited about getting this passed. By the way, we are going to \nhear people say there are no conditions. There are a lot of safeties \nbuilt into this.\n  For example, in order for the Secretary to keep someone past 6 \nmonths, they will have to certify every 6 months that this is not \nindefinite and certify the threat is still there. The alien still has \naccess to our Federal courts. So this would be in effect only under the \ncondition of the person being a threat to the safety of the community \nand that person must have also committed a crime of violence or \naggravated felony.\n  I cannot imagine that anyone would object to this and as a result \npotentially put all of these people in danger. We have already had some \ndeaths. I think it is very reasonable that we go ahead and take care of \nsome of these things that would be acceptable.\n  So for that reason, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 1203 \nbe brought before us for its immediate consideration.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cowan). Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am not going to make a unanimous \nconsent request. I want to speak about a piece of legislation I hope to \nintroduce before we finish the bill on immigration.\n  This is a Grassley-Kirk amendment numbered 1299, and I am having a \ndifficult time getting it put in place so we can get it brought up. I \nbelieve there is a lack of understanding of what my amendment does. I \nwant to take this time to explain it so everyone can fully understand \nit and get it to a rollcall vote.\n  I thank Senator Kirk for joining me on this amendment as a cosponsor.\n  This amendment would address language in the bill that creates a \nconvoluted and ineffective process for determining whether a foreign \nnational in a street gang should be deemed inadmissible or deported. I \noffered a similar amendment in committee because I believe this to be \nsuch a dangerous loophole that requires closing.\n  My amendment even had the support of two Members of the Group of 8. \nSpecifically, in order to deny entry or remove a gang member, section \n3701 of the bill requires the Department of Homeland Security prove a \nforeign national: one, has a prior Federal felony conviction for drug \ntrafficking or violent crime; two, has knowledge that the gang is \ncontinuing to commit crimes; and three, has acted in furtherance of \ngang activity.\n  Even if all of these provisions could be proven under the bill, the \nSecretary could still issue a waiver. That is just one of many \nopportunities for the Secretary of Homeland Security to forget about \nwhat the legislation says. As such, the proposed process is limited \nonly to criminal gang members with prior Federal drug trafficking and \nFederal violent crime convictions and does not--can you believe this--\ninclude State convictions such as rape and murder.\n  The trick here is that while the bill wants everyone to believe there \nis a strong provision, foreign nationals who have Federal felony drug \nconvictions or violent crime convictions are already subject to \ndeportation if they are already here or denied entry as being \ninadmissible. So the gang provision written in this bill adds nothing \nto current law and obviously will not be used. It is, at best, a feel-\ngood measure to say we are being tough on criminal gangs while doing \nnothing to remove or deny entry to criminal gang members.\n\n[[Page S4760]]\n\nIt is easier to prove someone is a convicted drug trafficker than both \na drug trafficker and a gang member. So as currently written, why would \nthis provision ever be used? Simply put, it would not be used.\n  My amendment would strike this do-nothing provision and issue a new, \nclear, simple standard to address the problem of gang members. My \namendment would strike this do-nothing provision and create a process \nto address criminal gang members where the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity must prove: one, criminal street gang membership; and two, \nthat the person is a danger to the community. Once the Secretary proves \nthese two things, the burden then shifts, as it should, to the foreign \nnational to prove that either he is not dangerous, not in a street \ngang, or that he did not know the group was a street gang. It is \nstraightforward and will help remove dangerous criminal gang members.\n  My amendment also eliminates the possibility of a waiver. Under my \namendment, the vast majority of people here illegally who could be \nexcluded based upon criminal gang membership would be able to appeal \nthat determination to an immigration judge. Even if they are found to \nbe a gang member, if they can show they are not a danger to society, \nthey can gain status. This gives the Secretary--in the event they \nappeal to an immigration judge--the ability to make these two \ndeterminations before denying entry or starting deportation. It is a \nreal solution to dangerous criminal gang members who are either here in \nthe country now seeking legal status or who are attempting to enter \nfrom abroad.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at this amendment and hopefully get it \non the list of issues we can discuss and vote on before we have final \npassage.\n  To summarize, the current bill is simply a feel-good measure that has \nvery limited impact. It will rarely be used because it is written in a \nway with many loopholes. And, even if it is, the Secretary can waive \nthe deportation.\n  To a greater extent, we ought to be emphasizing how many waivers \nthere are in this bill, which give too much delegation to the \nSecretary. We ought to be legislating more in these areas and making \nmore determinations here instead of leaving it up to the Secretary. A \nvote against my amendment is a vote against commonsense legislation to \naddress criminal gang members.\n  I am sure somebody is going to argue this might be too high of a \nburden. My amendment simply requires the Secretary make the initial \ndetermination for purposes of admissibility. Under my amendment, the \nvast majority of people here illegally who could be excluded based upon \ncriminal gang membership would be able to appeal that determination to \nan immigration judge. So there is review of these decisions to deny \nstatus if the Secretary believes the individual to be a gang member.\n  Criminal street gangs, as everyone knows, are dangerous. They survive \nby robbing their community of safety. They are involved in drug \ntrafficking, human trafficking, and prostitution. The way the bill \ndeals with criminal gang members would allow gang members to simply say \nthey are no longer a gang member, with no further determination, and \nthey would be able to gain admission.\n  In reality, it is hard to walk away from a gang, and some will claim \nthey did gain status. The only way to prevent gang members from gaming \nthe system is through my amendment. It provides the Secretary and \nimmigration judges the discretion they need. Even if they are a gang \nmember, if they can show they are not a danger to society, they can \ngain status. This is a reasonable standard that allows the alien to \nargue they are not a gang member and/or dangerous.\n  There is a precedent in the immigration code related to group \nmembership as a bar: namely, membership or association with a terrorist \norganization. Criminal gangs--although not legally terrorist \norganizations--can be just as dangerous as terrorists. Why would we not \nwant to give the Secretary this authority?\n  This bill provides sweeping waiver authority and discretion to the \nSecretary to make all sorts of decisions. I don't know why the sponsors \nwould oppose discretion to the Secretary to deny gang member admission. \nA vote against this amendment--if it is brought up--is a vote to allow \ndangerous gang members a path into our country.\n  Some may argue that it should be tied to some sort of criminal \nconviction. Well, criminal gang members are not often convicted of a \ncrime of gang membership. In fact, the Federal crime of being a gang \nmember is almost never used. To only limit gang member restrictions to \nthose convicted would be a huge loophole given the difficulty of \nprosecuting someone for simply gang membership. The underlying bill \ndoesn't even consider State-level convictions for gang membership as my \namendment would.\n  Simply put, my amendment will help prevent gang members from getting \ninto this country, and the bill will not. I hope we can get this \namendment on the list to be voted upon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from \nHawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise to speak on my amendment No. 1504, \ncosponsored by Senators Murray, Murkowski, Boxer, Gillibrand, Cantwell, \nStabenow, Klobuchar, Warren, Baldwin, Mikulski, Landrieu, Shaheen, and \nLeahy. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I object.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, the immigration bill clearly and \ninadvertently disadvantages women who are trying to immigrate to the \nUnited States. The bill, S. 744, reduces the opportunities for \nimmigrants to come under the family-based green cards system.\n  The new merit-based point system for employment green cards will \nsignificantly disadvantage women who want to come to this country, \nparticularly unmarried women.\n  Many women overseas do not have the same educational or career-\nadvancement opportunities available to men in those countries. This new \nmerit-based system will prioritize green cards for immigrants with high \nlevels of education or experience. By favoring these immigrants, the \nbill in effect cements into U.S. immigration law unfairness against \nwomen. That is not the way to go.\n  The bill inadvertently restricts the opportunities available to women \nacross the globe. Currently, approximately 70 percent of immigrant \nwomen come to this country through the family-based system. Employment-\nbased visas favor men over women by nearly a 4-to-1 margin as they \nplace a premium on male-dominated fields such as engineering and \ncomputer science. But across the globe women do not have the same \neducational or career opportunities as men.\n  Immigrant women make many contributions and positive impacts to \ncommunities. Economically, women are increasingly the primary \nbreadwinners in immigrant families. They often bring additional income, \nmaking it more likely for the family to open small businesses and \npurchase homes. In addition, women provide stability and permanent \nroots, as they are more likely to follow through on the citizenship \napplication process for themselves and their families.\n  Ensuring that women have an equal opportunity to come here is not an \nabstract policy cause to me. When I was a young girl, my mother brought \nmy brothers and me to this country in order to escape an abusive \nmarriage. My life would be completely different if my mother wasn't \nable to take on that courageous journey. I want women like her--women \nlike my mother--who don't have the opportunities to succeed in their \nown countries to be able to build a better life for themselves here.\n  The Hirono-Murray-Murkowski amendment evens the playing field for \nwomen. This amendment would establish a tier 3 merit-based point system\n\n[[Page S4761]]\n\nthat would provide a fair opportunity for women to compete for merit-\nbased green cards. Complementary to the high-skilled tier 1 and lower \nskilled tier 2, the new tier 3 would include professions commonly held \nby women so as not to limit women's opportunities for economic-focused \nimmigration to this country. This system would provide 30,000 tier 3 \nvisas and would not reduce the visas available in the other two merit-\nbased tiers, while maintaining the overall cap on merit-based visas.\n  This amendment is supported by We Belong Together: Women for Common-\nSense Immigration Reform; the Asian-American Justice Center; the \nNational Domestic Workers Association; the Leadership Conference on \nCivil and Human Rights; Church World Service; Family Values at Work; \nNational Asian Pacific American Women's Forum; MomsRising; National \nImmigration Law Center; American Immigration Lawyers Association; \nNational Organization for Women; Center for Community Change; Lutheran \nImmigration and Refugee Services; the Episcopal Church; Unitarian \nUniversalist Association; United States Conference of Catholic Bishops; \nCatholic Charities USA; Caring Across Generations; Coalition for Humane \nImmigrant Rights of Los Angeles; American Federation of State, County, \nand Municipal Employees; Sisters of Mercy; Asian Pacific American Labor \nAlliance; AFL-CIO; the International Union, United Automobile, \nAerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America; the National \nCouncil of La Raza; the United Methodist Church; National Queer Asian \nPacific Islander Alliance; Hispanic Federation; Service Employees \nInternational Union; Immigration Equality Action Fund; Out4Immigration; \nSojourners; and Communications Workers of America, AFL-CIO.\n  I believe our amendment would address the disparities for women in \nthe new merit-based system, and the dozens of organizations I mentioned \nbelieve likewise.\n  Let's work together to improve the new merit-based immigration system \nand make this bill better for women.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Would the Senator withhold, please.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the immigration bill \nas we approach the end of this week because we are obviously hearing \nfrom many people outside of the building who are concerned about this \nissue, and I think it is important to make a few things clear as we \nhead into next week and what I hope will be final passage of this \nmeasure.\n  First, let me describe how this program works because immigration is \ncomplicated. It can sometimes even be confusing. We throw around these \nterms here, and we assume everybody understands what they mean, so I \nwant to explain. The way I will explain it is how this bill will work \nif we pass the amendment filed by Senators Hoeven and Corker, which I \nbelieve will pass and should pass with significant bipartisan support.\n  First, let's describe the problem we have today. No. 1, we have a \nbroken legal immigration system. We have a system of legal immigration. \nAbout 1 million people a year come here legally. But the system is \nbroken because it is designed, for example, solely based on primarily \nfamily reunification, which, by the way, is how my parents came in \n1956. The problem is that the world has changed, and as a result, \nbecause we live in a global economy where we are competing for talent \nand not just workforce, we need to have more of a merit-based and \ncareer-based immigration system, and this bill would move us in that \ndirection.\n  We have a broken legal immigration system, by the way, because it is \ncumbersome and complicated and bureaucratic. One really has to lawyer \nup to legally immigrate to the United States, especially in certain \ncategories.\n  If we look at the agriculture sector, there is no reliable, \nsustainable way for agriculture to get foreign labor. By and large, \nwhile there are Americans who will do labor in the agriculture \nindustry, there is a significant shortage of Americans who will work in \nthe agriculture industry. And we don't have a program for agriculture \nthat works for people to come legally here, but the jobs are there, so \npeople are coming illegally.\n  So we have a broken legal immigration system, and that has to be \nfixed and modernized, and this bill does that. That is why we haven't \nheard a lot of discussion about it.\n  The second problem we have is that our immigration laws are only as \ngood as our ability to enforce those laws. If we want to get to the \nheart of the problem we are facing in terms of opposition to the bill, \nit is because in the past, both Republicans and Democrats have promised \nto enforce the immigration laws and then have refused or have been \nunable to do it. Part of it has just been an unwillingness, to be \nfrank.\n  We have talked about 1986 and 2006 and other efforts. In the past, \npeople have been told we are going to enforce the immigration laws, and \nthen we don't do it. As time goes on, the problem gets bigger and \npeople say: We have been told this before, and we are not going to do \nit again. That really is standing in the way of more support for this \nmeasure.\n  Another problem we have is the systems we use to enforce the law are \nbroken. For example, on the border there are sectors that have \ndramatically improved, and so from that experience we have learned what \nworks, but there are sectors that have actually gotten worse or have \nnot improved significantly. So to say the entire southern border has \nbeen secured is not true, and we really shouldn't say that to \nAmericans, especially those living near that border who understand that \nis not true.\n  We also have a problem with visa overstays. What that means is people \ncome into the United States legally on a tourist visa, and then when it \nexpires they don't leave. So they came in legally--they didn't jump a \nfence or cross the border--but then they get here and they stay. That \nis a visa overstay. That is 40 percent of our problem. We don't have a \nsystem to track that. Even though it is mandated by law, we do not have \na system to track that. We track people when they come in, but we don't \ntrack them when they leave in real-time, so we don't have a running \ntally of who has overstayed their visas, leading to 40 percent of our \nillegal immigration problem.\n  The third problem we have is the magnet that brings people here. I am \nnot saying every single person who comes here illegally is coming \nlooking for jobs and opportunity, but I am saying the enormous majority \nof people who come here are coming because they believe there is a job \nin the United States for them so they can feed their families. That is \na magnet. We have jobs and we have people willing to do those jobs, and \nthose two things are going to meet. They are going to come. The choice \nwe have is, do they come through a legal process that is organized and \nsecure or do they come in a chaotic way that contributes to illegal \nimmigration? And that is how they are coming now.\n  So that is why in this bill we have an entry-exit tracking system but \nalso have something called E-Verify, which simply means that \nemployers--any business, any company, anyone who hires someone, when \nthey hire them, they have to ask their name. The employee has to \nproduce their identification. The employer runs that name through the \nInternet on a system called E-Verify, and it will confirm whether that \nperson is legally here. If they are hired after that person says they \nare illegally here, we double and sometimes even triple the penalties \nfor employers who do that.\n  So those are important measures this bill takes. And that is the \nsecond problem we face.\n  The third problem we face is even more fundamental. As we speak, as I \nstand here before my colleagues today, estimates are there are upwards \nof 11 million human beings living in these United States who are here \nillegally. They have overstayed visas, they were brought as children, \nthey crossed the border, they are here. They don't qualify for welfare, \nthey don't qualify for any Federal benefits, but they are here. They \nare here and they are working. They are working for cash. They are \nworking under someone else's identification, but they are here. The \nvast majority of them have been here for longer than a decade. They are \nhere.\n\n[[Page S4762]]\n\n  Let me tell my colleagues, that is not good for them because when a \nperson doesn't have documents, they are unprotected. When a person is \nhere illegally, that person can be exploited, and that happens. But it \nis also not good for the country. It is not good for this country to \nhave that many people. We don't know who they are. They are not paying \ntaxes. They are working, but they are not paying taxes. We have no \nidea--the vast majority of them are not criminals, but a handful of \nthem are, and we don't know where they live, who they are, how long \nthey have been here. We know very little about them. That is not good \nfor our country either. We have to deal with that.\n  That is my point. If we don't do anything--let's say this bill fails \nor let's say we pass it and the House doesn't do it or let's say we \ndecide not to do anything at all on immigration. All of those things I \njust described stay in place. If we don't do anything, the border stays \nthe way it is, we still don't have E-Verify, we still don't have an \nentry-exit tracking system, and we don't have any idea who the 11 \nmillion people are, and we still don't have an immigration system that \nworks. That is what happens if we do nothing.\n  That is why I got involved in this issue. It isn't politics, and I \ndisagree with my colleagues who have said this is about politics. This \nis not about saving the Republican Party or anybody else. This is about \ncorrecting something that is hurting the United States of America.\n  I can certainly say it is not about my personal politics because this \nis an issue that makes a lot of people unhappy, a lot of people who \nhave supported me and support me now, people whom I agree with on every \nother issue. If you pull out a list of issues facing this country, I \nagree with them on every other issue, but they disagree with me on this \nissue, and I respect and understand why. They are frustrated because \nthey have been told in the past that this is going to get fixed, and it \nhasn't, because they feel and see and know that this is the most \ngenerous country in the world on immigration, and it has been taken \nadvantage of and they are frustrated by it.\n  I have seen some describe opponents of immigration reform as haters \nand anti-Hispanic and anti-immigration. That is just not true. It is \nnot true.\n\n  These are people who are just frustrated that the laws have not been \nfollowed and they do not want to reward it. I honestly do understand \nthat. What I would say to them is, look, I get it. I do. I do not like \nthis either.\n  I do not like the fact that we have 11 million people here illegally. \nI do not like the fact that people have ignored our laws and crossed \nour borders or overstayed visas. I do not like it either. But that is \nwhat we are going to get stuck with if we do not do anything about it. \nThat is what this bill tries to do. Let me explain how it does it.\n  First we outlined--because when we filed this bill, what was said \nwas, Department of Homeland Security, here is $6.5 billion. Go out and \ndesign a border fence plan and a border plan. Submit it to Congress. \nIssue a letter of commencement. And then you can begin the process of \nidentifying these people who are here illegally. That was our bill.\n  Then I went around my State, sometimes the country--and my colleagues \ndid as well--and people told us: Look, we don't trust the Department of \nHomeland Security. These people say the border is already secure, and \nyou are going to tell them to design a plan?\n  I thought that was a good point. So now we have an amendment before \nus by Senator Hoeven and Senator Corker that actually defines the plan. \nLet me describe this new plan because I think it is the most \nsubstantial border security plan we have ever had before any body of \nCongress.\n  No. 1, it does not say you can, it does not say you should, it says \nyou must have universal E-Verify for every business in America, and you \nhave to wrap that up within 4 years. It starts with the big businesses, \nuntil it gets to ag and the small businesses. The reason why you need 3 \nto 4 years is because for a really small business, it is going to take \nthem time to buy the technology to do this. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, it says you have to finish the entry-exit tracking system. \nAfter this bill was amended in committee, it says that eventually the \n30 major international airports in this country will have it \nbiometrically--this entry-exit tracking system.\n  The third thing it says is that you have to deploy upwards of $3 \nbillion in technology. This is technology that was not around in 1986. \nThis is technology that was not around in 2006.\n  Let me describe that technology: radar, sensors on the ground, night \nvision goggles, motion detectors, even unarmed drones--things that \nallow you to see people, and even if they get past you at the first \nstop on the border, you can follow them and then apprehend them a few \nmiles down the road. This technology did not used to exist.\n  We go further than that in the amendment. We do not just say you have \nto deploy this technology, we tell you where you have to deploy it. We \ndo not even leave that to DHS. And those ideas did not come from \nSenators, they came from members of the Border Patrol on the \nfrontlines. They have told us: Here is where we need this stuff. So in \na level of detail unprecedented in the history of this body, we \nactually say: 50 goggles in this sector, 100 radar in this sector. That \nis the third thing this bill requires you to do.\n  The fourth thing it requires you to do is to double the size of the \nBorder Patrol, adding 20,000 new border agents. This is a dramatic \nincrease in the number of people because cameras and sensors are great, \nbut if you do not have people to actually do the apprehension, it does \nnot work.\n  The last thing it says is that you have to complete this fencing. \nThat includes, where it is practical, where it is possible, getting rid \nof these vehicle barriers because one of the things they did with the \nfencing is they would put up some barrier on the road and say that is a \nfence. The problem is that may keep a vehicle out, but it does not keep \nsomebody from climbing over it. We actually say that, where it is \npossible, where the terrain allows it--there are places where the \nterrain does not let you build a fence, but where the terrain allows \nit, you have to put a fence there. In some places the fence is doubled, \nespecially in urban areas. It has been very successful in San Diego.\n  These are five things we require. We do not say you can, you might--\nyou must. You must do these five things before anyone who has violated \nour immigration laws can even apply for permanent legal residency in \nthe United States of America--10 years from now, by the way.\n  One of the criticisms people have said is that this bill is \nlegalization first. It is not that simple. Real legalization is \npermanent legalization; it is what we call a green card. You have to \nhave a green card before you can apply to become a citizen of the \nUnited States.\n  Under this bill, illegal immigrants cannot get a green card, cannot \neven apply for a green card until 10 years have passed and these five \nthings I have just described--E-Verify, entry-exist tracking system, \nfull technology implementation, 20,000 new border agents, finishing the \nfence--all five of those things have to happen.\n  People say: Well, why are you linking the two things?\n  Here is the answer: Because of the problems we had in the past. The \nonly way we can make sure that a future President or a future Congress \ndoes not go back on these promises is if we tie it to something we know \npeople want. That is why they are linked.\n  So no one who is here illegally--they cannot apply for that permanent \nresidency until these five things happen, and that is the trigger that \nis going to guarantee that this happens.\n  Their argument is, though, legalization first because you are \nallowing the people who are here illegally now to stay in the meantime.\n  Let me tell you the problem with that issue. The problem with that \nissue--first of all, we are talking about 11 million people who are \nalready here. They are already here. We are not talking about 11 \nmillion new people. We are not talking about people who are outside the \ncountry who might come in in the meantime. We are talking about people \nwho are already here. More than half of them have been here longer than \na decade, so that means the chances are they have children who are U.S. \ncitizens. They are definitely working because somehow they are eating. \nThey do not qualify for Federal benefits because--we do not even know \nwho they are. OK. They are already here. You have to do something about \nthem in the meantime.\n\n[[Page S4763]]\n\n  You cannot build a fence and you cannot hire 20,000 border agents in \n6 weeks. It takes a little bit of time. It does not take 10 years, but \nit takes some time to do that. So here is what we do. We say: If you \nare illegally here and you have been here for--you could not have come \nlast week or even last year--if you have been here for a while and you \nare illegally here, you have to come forward. You are going to have to \npass a national security background check. You are going to have to \npass a criminal background check. You are going to have to pay a fine \nbecause you broke the law. You are going to have to start paying taxes \nand working. And the only thing you get--to the extent you get \nsomething, the only thing you get is you get a work permit that allows \nyou to do three things: work, travel, and pay taxes. When you get this \nwork permit, you do not qualify for food stamps, you do not qualify for \nwelfare, you do not qualify for ObamaCare subsidies, you do not qualify \nfor any of these things.\n\n  People may say: Well, we are rewarding them. But I want people to \nthink about this for a second. They are already here. They are already \nworking. We are not going to round up and deport 11 million people, so \nit is basically de facto amnesty. The only thing that is going to \nchange in their lives is they are going to start paying taxes, they are \ngoing to have to pay a fine, and we are going to know who they are.\n  By the way, this work permit is not permanent. It expires every 6 \nyears. So if you come forward and get this work permit, which is \ntemporary, in 6 years you have to go back and apply for it again. If it \nis not renewed because you have broken a condition, you are illegally \nhere, but now we know who you are, and you will not be able to find a \njob because of E-Verify. And when you go back and renew it after 6 \nyears, you are going to have to pass another background check, pay \nanother fine, pay another application fee, and you are going to have to \nprove that in the previous 6 years you have been here working and \npaying taxes. You are going to have to prove that, that you are self-\nsustaining, that you are not dependent. This whole time, you do not \nqualify to apply for permanent status, not to mention citizenship.\n  After 10 years have gone by in this status--not 10 years after the \npassage of the bill, 10 years after you, the applicant, have been in \nthis status--then--and only if those five things I talked about--E-\nVerify, entry-exit tracking system, the technology plan, the border \nfence, and the 20,000 new agents--only if those five things have \nhappened, then you can apply for a green card through the green card \nprocess.\n  That is another mistake people are making. They think, all right, 10 \nyears is here, you made the five conditions, they are going to hand you \na green card. Not true. You can apply for it. It is not awarded to you.\n  Now, is this perfect? I do not think this problem has a perfect \nsolution. But I can tell you, if we do not do anything--let's suppose \nimmigration reform fails. Suppose we do nothing. We are still going to \nhave the 11 million people here. We are still not going to know who \nthey are. They are still not going to be paying taxes. They still will \nnot have undergone a background check. And you will not have E-Verify. \nYou will not have border security. You will not have the agents. You \nwill not have the technology. You will not have the entry-exit tracking \nsystem. You will not have any of that.\n  Life is about choices. Legislating is about choices. And the choice \ncannot be between what you wish things were like and this bill. The \nchoice is between the way things are and this bill--or some alternative \nto it. Again, if we defeat it, then we are stuck with what we have. And \nwhat we have is a disaster. It is a disaster.\n  I want to make clear another point. People have said: Boy, all this \nborder security is overkill and so much stuff. Look, the United States \nis a special country. That is why people want to come here. A million \npeople a year come here legally--1 million people a year. There is no \nother country in the world that comes close to that. Do you understand \nwhat that means? Other countries do not want people coming or people do \nnot want to go. When is the last time you heard of a boatload of \nAmerican refugees arriving on the shores of another country? People \nwant to come here. We understand that. In fact, this country is so \nspecial that there are people who are willing to risk their lives to \ncome here and willing to come illegally to come here. We are \ncompassionate. Our heart breaks when we hear stories about that.\n  But I also have to remind people that we are also a sovereign \ncountry. Every country in the world secures their border or tries to. \nMany of the countries that people come here from secure their border--\nsometimes viciously. We are not advocating that. We have a right as a \nsovereign country to secure our border. We have a right to do that. \nWhile we are compassionate, no one has a right to come here illegally.\n  So I will close by saying that I know this is a tough issue. I do. I \nreally do. I understand that on the one side there are the human \nstories of people you have met. And this issue really changes when you \nmeet somebody. It is one thing to read about 11 million people who are \nhere illegally; it is another thing to meet one of them: a father, a \nmother, a son, or a daughter, someone whom you know as a human being \nand you know about their hopes and dreams and how much they are \nstruggling. It is one thing to know about that. It changes your \nperspective.\n  But I also understand the frustration people have--that they have \nheard all these promises before, that people have violated our laws, \nthey have ignored them, and that is wrong, and we should not reward \nthat. I do understand that. But ultimately I ran for the Senate because \nI wanted to make a difference. I know I could have just stayed back on \nthis issue and come to the floor and--I am not making any criticism of \nanybody else, but that I could have just come to the floor and offered \nup what I would have done instead and be critical of efforts that \nothers were making. That was an option for me, but I could not stand \nit. I could not stand to see how this problem is hurting our country \nand leaving it the way it is. How is this good for us?\n  We have to do something about this. That is what we are trying to do. \nWith this new amendment, we will do more for border security than \nanyone has ever tried to do before. All I would ask my colleagues and \nmembers of the public to do is to think about that. Think about it. \nWhat do you want? Do you want things to stay the way they are or do you \nwant to try to fix it? I will just say to you, our country desperately \nneeds to fix it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Tax Reform\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, just outside this Chamber is a bust of \nPresident Theodore Roosevelt. When I walk past it, I am often reminded \nof one of my favorite T.R. quotes, which is, ``Far and away the best \nprize that life has to offer is the chance to work hard at work worth \ndoing.''\n  For the past 3 years, I have been working with my colleagues on the \nSenate Finance Committee on comprehensive tax reform. It has been hard \nwork, but it has certainly been work worth doing. We have had more than \n30 hearings. We have heard from hundreds of experts about how tax \nreform can simplify the system for families, help businesses innovate, \nand make the U.S. more competitive.\n  Our efforts have been ramping up over the past several weeks, and we \nare starting to build momentum. Senator Hatch and I have been working \nvery closely with members of the Finance Committee on a series of 10 \ndiscussion papers, examining key aspects of the Tax Code--each of the \ndiscussion papers on a different aspect of the Code. We began back in \nMarch, with a discussion on simplifying the system for families and \nbusinesses.\n  There have been nine others. We then met as a full committee every \nweek the Senate has been in session to go through different topics, \npresenting a range of options, and sitting around a table asking \nquestions of staff, what about this and that, and asking questions of \neach other. It is a very informative process that is bringing us even \ncloser together, establishing trust and confidence in what we are doing \nand learning a lot more about what the code is and is not.\n\n[[Page S4764]]\n\n  We concluded these meetings this morning with a discussion on non-\nincome tax issues; for example, payroll taxes and excise taxes. That is \nnot income taxes. The meetings have been very beneficial. We are \nbuilding trust and getting everyone's buy-in. I also speak weekly with \nthe Treasury Secretary about tax reform, getting his ideas and what \nseems to make sense for him and for the administration.\n  I have been working for quite some time with my counterpart in the \nHouse, Chairman David Camp. In fact, we have been meeting weekly, \nChairman Camp and I, face to face for more than a year now discussing \nmatters that apply to the Finance Committee, as well as Ways and Means, \nbut especially tax reform. He is working just as hard on his side in \nthe other body.\n  Our shared goal is to make the code more simple, to make it more fair \nfor families to spark a more prosperous economy. I believe very \nstrongly if we can simplify the code, as well as other measures that \nneed to be taken, people will feel better about it. They will not think \nthe other guy has a big loophole that he cannot take advantage of. It \nwill help people feel better about themselves. It will certainly help \nsmall businesses because the code is so complex for small business. I \nthink that in and of itself will help create some innovation, some \nentrepreneurship and energy for more jobs.\n  Together, Chairman Camp and I have also recently launched a Web site. \nIt is called taxreform.gov. The site will enable us to get even more \nideas and to hear directly from the American people, not people in \nWashington, DC, but from around the country. People all around can tell \nus what they think. We want to know what people think, what they think \nthe Nation's tax system should look like, how we can make families' \nlives easier, and how we can ensure a less burdensome Tax Code.\n  We have received a lot of hits, if you will, to the Web site. Over \n30,000 so far, 10,000 submissions. That is ideas people have from every \nState in the Nation. People are overwhelmingly--I must tell you, if you \nwere to categorize the character of the submissions, overwhelmingly \nthey are calling for a much more simple code. People want the code a \nlot more simple. It is too complex.\n  For example, a fellow named David from Redmond, WA, wrote:\n\n       I'm a retired lawyer and I cannot prepare my own tax \n     returns--\n\n  Why--\n\n     because of the technical and incomprehensible language of the \n     code. I commend you and hope you are successful.\n\n  That is just an example. Richard, from my hometown of Helena, MT, \nnoted that the current Tax Code is outdated and does not work \neffectively or efficiently. He said, ``It needs to be simple, \neffective, and fair.''\n  Again, another representative submission. I think Richard and David \nhit the nail on the head. Over and over, that is what we are hearing: \nsimple, effective, and fair.\n  Chairman Camp and I are going to be making a big push in the coming \nweeks to further engage our colleagues in Washington, as well as people \nall across America. How are we going to do that? Well, we are going to \ntravel. We are going to travel to other cities, Chairman Camp and I \ntogether. We are going to travel outside of Washington, DC, where the \nreal Americans reside. We are going to talk to individuals, we are \ngoing to talk to families, business owners, big and small, to hear \ndirectly what the people have in mind.\n  Again, we are doing this because we want to hear directly from the \nAmerican people, not just people in Washington, DC. We will be \nannouncing our first visit outside of Washington, DC, next week. We \nwant to hear what people think.\n  Momentum is building. Now is the time to do reform. I might say, in \nmy view, if we cannot get tax reform passed in the Congress, I do not \nthink we will ever be able to address the issue for maybe 3 years. I \ndoubt we will do it next Congress because that will be a Presidential \nelection year. We will have to wait for the new President. It is going \nto take a long time. That is critically dangerous because the last time \nthe code was significantly reformed was 1986.\n  The world has changed dramatically since 1986. The code is too dated. \nI might say this: Since 1986, the last time the Tax Code was reformed, \nthere have been 15,000 changes to the code--15,000. No wonder it is \ncomplex. No wonder people want it more simple and more fair. I think \nworking together we in Congress can improve the code and update it to \nthe 21st century.\n  This comes down to working together. It comes down to building trust \non both sides of the aisle, both bodies. It is going to help the \nAmerican people when we do reform the code in this Congress. I do not \nknow how many months it is going to take, but we are going to do all we \ncan. As Teddy Roosevelt said: Hard work is worth doing if it is for a \ngood cause. This is clearly hard work, I can tell you that, but it is \nalso for a good cause.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I know things seem like they are speeding \nby us at the speed of light on this bill. We received an announcement \nof a breakthrough on the part of some of our colleagues that is going \nto give this bill the momentum to pass and come out of here with a \nbunch of votes. But I think there are some questions we need to ask.\n  First of all, I see the distinguished chairman of the Finance \nCommittee. I know he has probably looked at this. The underlying bill \nprovides that $8.3 billion is immediately appropriated as emergency \nspending to fund the trust fund that will fund at least some of the \noperations in this immigration reform bill. But when I started to look \nat it a little more closely and consider the fact that even though the \nunderlying bill had zero funds for new Border Patrol personnel, this \nnew bill--this new proposal, I should say, that we have yet to see--\nsupposedly it is going to come around 6 o'clock--has an additional \n20,000 Border Patrol. That is doubling the size of the Border Patrol.\n  Senator Hoeven, the distinguished Senator from North Dakota, said \nearlier in response to a question I asked him, that would cost an \nadditional $30 billion. So we have $8.3 billion, if my arithmetic is \ncorrect, and $30 billion. That is $38 billion.\n  I noticed on page 48 of the Congressional Budget Office cost \nestimate, the CBO estimates that implementing this bill, the underlying \nbill, would result in net discretionary costs of about $22 billion \nmore. That is starting to be real money, it seems to me, $60 billion. I \nknow we have been having some spirited debates about whether the 85 or \nso billion dollars that was sequestered under the Budget Control Act \nwas something we could live without or not, or whether it had to be \nmade up through additional revenue. But this strikes me as very \nsignificant that we are talking about $60 billion of additional deficit \nspending--or additional spending, adding to the deficit, which has not \nbeen paid for, if my numbers are correct.\n  I would welcome anyone else to come help me figure that out.\n  Now, one of the rationale, as I was talking to our colleagues--they \nlooked at the original score and said this actually generates \nadditional revenue because people who come out of the shadows and are \nworking will begin to pay Social Security taxes. But the $211 billion \nin the score is Social Security trust fund money, which, of course, \nmust someday be paid in terms of benefits to these very same people.\n  So it appears that there is double counting going on here. Our \ncolleagues are saying: Hey, we have additional revenue because of the \nnegative score. But that is money that is going to require an IOU to \nthe Social Security trust fund and will have to be paid back at some \npoint in the future.\n  So, as Senator Sessions, the ranking member of the Senate Budget \nCommittee pointed out, the on-budget deficit will increase by $14.2 \nbillion. That is before you add the additional $30 billion for 20,000 \nBorder Patrol and $22 billion in additional spending to fund this \nunderlying bill.\n  So my only point is I think we need to take a deep breath. First, we \nneed to read the proposal that is coming out supposedly at 6 o'clock. \nBut already\n\n[[Page S4765]]\n\nthere is talk about what the end game in the Senate is. Potentially, \nthe majority leader will file cloture on this Corker-Hoeven amendment. \nThen we will have a vote on Monday or maybe Tuesday. I think it is \nextraordinarily important when you are talking about numbers like this, \nand a bill this big, that we take our time and are careful and we know \nexactly what the impact of this bill is because if, in fact, what is \nhappening is double counting, which is my suspicion based on my review \nof this CBO documentation, that is a serious matter, indeed, because \nthat money is going to need to be paid back.\n  On another but related note, I would say we have been told this surge \nthat is going to be funded under the Corker-Hoeven amendment, and the \nadditional 20,000 Border Patrol agents and a whole bunch of new \ntechnology and other assets, that this will be sufficient to secure our \nborders and make illegal immigration a thing of the past. We have been \ntold that supporters of the bill welcome a robust and extensive debate \nover its provisions. Yet when we look at the way this is happening, \nwhere people are announcing breakthroughs, people are saying, well, I \nam going to cosponsor that, only to find out the bill itself has not \neven been written or released, it seems to me we have the cart ahead of \nthe horse. We better be careful about what we are doing.\n  We have Members of the Chamber calling for a vote this weekend on an \nas yet unreleased amendment. I know, I, for one, and others, I suspect, \nwould like to read it and know what is in it.\n  I commend our colleagues--I mean this in all sincerity--for trying to \ndo their best to improve this bill. But I worry their solution amounts \nto throwing more money at the problem without any real system of \naccountability. We have talked about how important it is to have inputs \ninto the bill. But really what we all want are results or outputs. And \nwhat we have under this amendment, as I understand it and as I asked \nthe distinguished Senators from Tennessee and North Dakota, they \nconceded that because our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nobject to any sort of contingency between the probationary status and \nlegal permanent residency based on accomplishing the situational \nawareness requirements in the underlying bill or operational control, \nbecause they object to that, then all we have are more promises about \nfuture performance.\n  I must say our record of keeping our promises when it comes to \nimmigration reform are beyond pathetic, starting back in 1986 with the \namnesty and promise of enforcement, then in 1996 where, as I mentioned \nearlier, President Clinton signed a requirement of a biometric entry-\nexit system which has still not been deployed at the exits, at airports \nand seaports even though the 9/11 Commission noted that some of the \nterrorists who killed 3,000 Americans on September 11, 2001, included \npeople who came into the country legally but simply overstayed their \nvisas, and we lost track of them because we had no effective entry-exit \nsystem. The 9/11 Commission said this is something we need to fix. That \nwas 2001. Still it has not been done.\n  Until today, our colleagues on the so-called Gang of 8 argued that it \nwas too expensive and too impractical to add even 5,000 Border Patrol \nagents, to say nothing of 20,000 agents. As I pointed out earlier in \nasking some questions of our distinguished colleagues, Senator McCain \nfrom Arizona, and Senator Schumer, the senior Senator from New York, it \nis amazing how quickly their tune changed.\n  Their underlying bill had zero Border Patrol agents. When my \namendment had 5,000 Border Patrol agents, they said that was a budget \nbuster. Imagine my surprise when their amendment comes out with 20,000 \nBorder Patrol agents, doubling the Border Patrol, $30 billion.\n  I wish to know whether the proposals that have been made here are \nbeing sufficiently vetted. I don't know exactly what all the new border \npatrol is going to be doing. While I think it is important we get the \nadvice of the experts in terms of what sorts of new technology can be \ndeployed here, I worry that by being overly prescriptive about both the \nnumber of the boots on the ground and the technology they are going to \nuse that we are going to freeze in place legislatively a solution that \nwill quickly become antiquated and become inefficient.\n  That is why I prefer, and why I think it is much better, an output \nfor a result metric we could look at. Let the experts--let the Border \nPatrol, let the Department of Homeland Security, let the technology \nexperts who developed great technology we have already paid for and \ndeployed in places such as Iraq and Afghanistan through the Department \nof Defense--advise us and the Border Patrol what they need in order to \naccomplish the goals in order to meet the mark. Let's not let a bunch \nof generalists such as ourselves, who are not expert in this field, \nprescribe this solution for a 10-year period of time when it will \nbecome quickly outdated.\n  From everything I have heard and everything I have read--and I think \nit was confirmed by the Senators this afternoon--the Hoeven-Corker \namendment creates a border security trigger based on inputs rather than \noutputs. It is, I think it is accurate to say, aspirational. In other \nwords, they promise to try to meet those goals.\n  Ten years from now, I daresay half the Members of this Chamber will \nnot even be here. Since 2007 we have had 43 new Senators. The promises \nwe make today in exchange for the extraordinary generosity toward the \n11 million people--to provide them an opportunity to gain probationary \nstatus and then potentially earn legal permanent residency and \ncitizenship--that extraordinary offer made in the underlying bill--we \nhave no idea whether the border security, whether the entry-exit system \nor the E-Verify will actually work and accomplish the goals we all hope \nthey will accomplish.\n  Once again, Washington is saying trust me, trust us. We mean well. We \nare going to try.\n  Do you know what. We have no means to compel the bureaucracy and the \nexecutive branch to actually do what we say they should do here. This \nis why we need a trigger, a hard trigger, to realign the incentives so \nthat all of us, from the left to the right, Republicans and Democrats, \njoin together in putting the focus on the problem like a laser and \nmaking the bureaucracy hit those objectives.\n  We have promised a lot of things. We have had 27 years of inputs into \nour immigration system since the 1986 amnesty, and we still don't have \nsecure borders. There were 350,000-plus people detained at the \nsouthwestern border last year.\n  GAO says we have about 45-percent operational control of the border. \nWho knows how many people actually made their way across--although we \ndo know that among those who made it across who were detained, they \ncame from 100 different countries, including state sponsors of \ninternational terrorism.\n  I am not suggesting there are massive incursions of terrorists coming \nfrom other countries, although I am saying the same porous borders that \nwill allow people to come into this country from other countries around \nthe world can be exploited by our enemies. It is a national security \nissue.\n  When I go home to Texas, people tell me they simply don't trust the \nFederal Government when it comes to securing our borders. Why would \nthey? Based on the historical experience, there is no reason for them \nto do so. Three decades of broken promises have destroyed Washington's \ncredibility. The only way to regain that credibility is to demand real \nresults on border security and create a mechanism that incentivizes all \nof us to make sure it happens.\n  I am afraid this amendment, the Corker-Hoeven amendment, no matter \nhow well-intentioned--and I do believe it is well-intentioned; everyone \nis eager to find a solution to the broken immigration system, including \nme. The status quo is unacceptable, and it benefits no one.\n  In the rush to try to come up with something that seems good at the \nmoment, in failing to take the care to look at the detail, whether it \nis financial or whether it will actually produce results, and based on \ntext we haven't even seen yet, I think we are rushing to judgment here. \nI think it is something we ought to reconsider.\n  Looking beyond border security, I am eager to know whether the \nproposed amendment includes other issues that were contained in my \namendment that was tabled earlier today.\n  I know, speaking to Senator Hoeven and Senator Corker, they did \ninclude a border security component. As I understand it, there are \nother Senators who\n\n[[Page S4766]]\n\nare coming to them and saying we want to be included in your amendment, \nso we don't know what subjects are also included in that amendment.\n  I wish to know whether it includes things such as does it prohibit \nillegal immigrants with multiple drunk driving convictions from \nreceiving legal status? What about people who have been guilty of \nmultiple instances of domestic violence? What about immigrants who fall \ninto one of those categories and have already been deported?\n  Believe it or not, under the underlying bill, people could have \nactually been deported for committing a misdemeanor and be eligible to \nreenter the country and register for RPI status. I think that would be \nshocking to most people if they think about it, if they knew about it. \nUnder the Gang of 8 bill, all of the people I have just described are \navailable for immediate registered provisional immigrant status.\n  Earlier this year, I mentioned a remarkable statistic, at least it is \nto me. In fiscal year 2011, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, \ndeported nearly 6,000 people with DUI convictions, driving under the \ninfluence. I challenge any Member of this Chamber to come down to the \nfloor and explain why drunk drivers and people who committed domestic \nviolence should be eligible for immediate probationary status. I doubt \nanyone will take me up on that challenge, because who would want to \ndefend the indefensible?\n  As I have said before--and I will conclude my comments with this \nbecause I see other Senators on the floor who want to speak. As I said \nbefore, the American people are generous, they are compassionate, but \nthey don't want to--it is the old adage: Fool me once, shame on you. \nFool me twice, shame on me. They don't want to be fooled again when it \ncomes to unkept promises in fixing our broken immigration system.\n  I know we are committed to finding a reasonable, responsible, and \nhumane way to solve the problem of illegal immigration, but we should \nnever ever grant legal status to people with multiple drunk driving or \ndomestic violence convictions. I don't know, but I will certainly be \ncareful to read and learn whether the proposed alternative to the \namendment that was tabled earlier today contains some of these \nprovisions that were in the tabled amendment. If they don't, we will be \nfiling--we have filed separate amendments, on which we will urge an up-\nor-down vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think the Senator was very wise in raising the \nquestion of the budget score. Our colleagues have been blithely \nasserting that this bill is going to pay for itself. The CBO produced a \nreport. They have cited that report that says it will pay for itself. \nThat is not exactly what the report says, it seems to me. This is the \nline in the report the CBO prepared: Net increases or decreases in the \ndeficit resulting from changes in direct spending and revenue from the \nbill. How will it impact increasing the deficit or not? The on-budget \ndeficit, even before the 20,000 new agents, adds billions of dollars in \ncosts. Netted out, it would add $14 billion to the on-budget debt. That \nis negative. It makes more debt.\n  Then there is the other one, the off-budget. What is the off-budget? \nThe off-budget is Social Security and Medicare. This is the trust fund \nmoney that comes out of your payroll taxes. People pay payroll taxes. \nThe average age of the legalized group is about 35, so most of them \naren't going to be drawing Social Security right away. They pay into \nthis and the government gets some extra money. They are counting that \nmoney as the money to show the bill is paid for.\n  Let me ask the Senator one simple thing. If the individuals who are \nnow given legal status are immediately given a Social Security number, \nimmediately eligible to compete for any job in America, isn't the money \nthey will be paying for Social Security and Medicare going to be used \nby them when they start drawing it? Aren't they going to be eligible \nnow for Social Security and Medicare? Won't this money be available for \nthem? Isn't it double counting to say it is going to be available for \ntheir Social Security and then available to pay for all the spending in \ntheir bill?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would say to the Senator from Alabama \nthat he reads it the same way I read it. You can't do both. You can't \nraise the money to pay for the bill and say you don't have to pay \nSocial Security benefits. These very same people are going to expect \nsome day that they will get those benefits. What happens, as I \nunderstand it--and the distinguished ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee can correct me if I am wrong--when we borrow money, in \nessence, from the Social Security trust fund, there is an IOU there \nthat is going to have to be paid back.\n  It does appear to me there is double counting here. I would say the \n$14.2 billion on-budget deficit, that is before you add in the $30 \nbillion of additional cost for 20,000 Border Patrol agents.\n  As I read page 48 of the CBO, they estimate that implementing the \nunderlying bill would result in net discretionary costs of about $22 \nbillion over the 2014-to-2023 period. It sounds to me as if the costs \nkeep mounting and there is double counting going on. I think we have to \nget to the bottom of it. Given our rush, we need to slow down, \nunderstand the numbers, and understand the financial impact, because \nthat is not going to go away if we get it wrong.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I couldn't agree more. The truth is, that is how this \ncountry is going broke. There are two ways the counting is done in our \nbudget. One is a unified accounting process, and the other one shows \nthese numbers in the fashion you and I put forward. They assume the \nmoney that comes in for the newly legalized people, Medicare and Social \nSecurity, is going to be available for their Social Security and \nMedicare. They can't then assume it is available to spend on something \nelse. The weakness in our system has been manipulated before. We need \nto stop it.\n  I thank the Senator for raising that.\n  Of course, I remember well how many good years you spent on the \nBudget Committee, and the Senator understands it very well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The Senator from \nMaine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the United States has always been a \ncountry of refuge for the persecuted, a protector of life and \nindividual freedoms. This is evident in the entire purpose of our \nNation's asylum program under which foreign nationals who can show a \ncredible fear of persecution in their home country may apply for and \nreceive shelter here. But flaws in the asylum program leave it \nvulnerable and open to exploitation by those who mean us harm. I have, \ntherefore, proposed two amendments to the immigration reform bill, \namendments No. 1391 and 1393, that are designed to lessen those flaws \nby giving asylum officers the tools they need to dismiss frivolous \nclaims and, more important, to ensure that derogatory information about \napplicants who may wish to harm us is reviewed during the application \nprocess.\n\n  Before I outline those amendments in detail, I would like to discuss \nthe circumstances under which the suspects in the Boston Marathon \nterrorist attack came to be in the United States and how that terrible \nattack underscores the need for reform of our asylum process.\n  According to media reports, the younger of the two Tsarnaev brothers \ncame to the United States on a tourist visa in 2002 and was granted \nasylum on his father's petition shortly thereafter.\n  As I mentioned before, asylum is supposed to be only available to \nthose who can show a credible fear of persecution in their home \ncountry.\n  Curiously, and notwithstanding his supposed fear of persecution back \nhome, the father came to the United States with only one of his four \nchildren, leaving his wife and three other children behind in the land \nhe claimed to fear.\n  I can't help but wonder whether the asylum officer who reviewed Mr. \nTsarnaev's application was aware of that fact and to what extent this \nwas considered in determining whether he met the burden of proving a \ncredible fear of persecution by his country, since, after all, he had \nleft his wife and three of his four children behind.\n  Whatever the circumstances that caused Mr. Tsarnaev to seek asylum in \n2002, after the Boston Marathon bombing, the international media caught \nup\n\n[[Page S4767]]\n\nwith him back in the land where he came from and now lives.\n  Even more curious are the questions surrounding the grant of asylum \nto another Chechen immigrant, the individual who was shot dead while \nbeing questioned by the FBI agents and local law enforcement regarding \nhis association with the Tsarnaevs and a 2011 triple homicide. After \nhis death, reports indicated this individual came to the United States \nin 2008 on a J-1 visa, the type of visa intended to promote cultural \nunderstanding that allows foreign students to work and study in our \ncountry, and that individual was granted asylum sometime later that \nyear in 2008.\n  The way in this particular case the visa operated is he was supposed \nto work for 4 months and then travel for 1 month in our country, but \nthat is not what happened. Last month, I was contacted by the Council \non International Educational Exchange, or CIEE, a J-1 visa sponsor \norganization located in my home State of Maine. CIEE told me they had \nlearned this individual had come to the United States through their \nprogram, arriving in June of 2008. From the start, it appears he had no \nintention of complying with CIEE's J-1 visa rules and, thus, on July 29 \nof 2008, CIEE withdrew its sponsorship of him because he failed to \nprovide the required documentation with respect to his employment.\n  That very day, CIEE, which is a very responsible organization, \ninstructed him to make immediate plans to leave the country because \nthey could not verify his employment, a key condition of the J-1 visa \nrules. CIEE then recorded this information in the Student and Exchange \nVisitor Information System, or SEVIS, the database used by the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and the Department of State to keep \ntrack of foreign visitors who travel to the United States on exchange \nvisas.\n  As I understand the facts, CIEE did everything right. It followed the \nrules. When this individual was clearly out of compliance with the \nconditions of his visa, it alerted DHS and the State Department he was \nout of compliance. I have spoken to the President of CIEE, who told me \nhis organization was shocked to learn this individual had been granted \nasylum and later given a green card.\n  I find this very curious. How is it that a young man from Chechnya \ncomes to the United States to participate in a cultural exchange \nprogram, immediately violates the conditions of that program, is told \nto leave our country but then is able to be granted asylum? The fact \nthat he was out of compliance with his visa was correctly recorded in \nthe SEVIS database. Did the asylum officer who approved his application \nreview that information? Did he check the database for derogatory \ninformation? Were any other databases, such as that maintained by the \nNational Counterterrorism Center, consulted during the review of this \nasylum applicant? When and where was his asylum application reviewed \nand approved and by whom?\n\n  More than 2 weeks ago, I asked these fundamental questions of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security through staff and by letters I \npersonally sent to the Office of Legislative Affairs and to Secretary \nJanet Napolitano. Despite repeated phone calls and e-mails from my \nstaff, the Department has still not provided me with the answers. \nInstead, what I have received are excuses, despite the fact the subject \nof my inquiry is dead and my questions are directly relevant to the \nasylum provisions in the immigration bill before us.\n  Think about the failure of the DHS to provide the basic information I \nhave requested. I have not asked about the individual's relationship to \nthe terrorist attack in Boston, nor have I asked about his alleged \nconnection to the triple homicide. The questions I have asked relate \nonly to when he applied for and received asylum, whether the \ninformation related to his violation of his visa requirements was \navailable and reviewed by the officer who granted him asylum, and I \nhave asked who made the decision to grant him asylum.\n  We know from media reports his asylum application was acted on in \n2008, 5 years ago. Is the Department saying, through its silence, that \ninformation related to this individual's asylum application did, in \nfact, foreshadow the terrorist attack in Boston in April and his \nultimate death last month? Why was his application approved? Why didn't \nthe Department deport him from our country when it was clear he was no \nlonger in compliance with his J-1 visa?\n  The basic question is: Why wasn't this individual deported from our \ncountry when it was clear he was no longer in compliance with the \nrequirements of his J-1 visa? Instead, what happens? He is granted \nasylum and then later given a green card.\n  I can only take the Department's refusal to provide answers as a \ntacit admission that a flawed asylum process allowed a dangerous man to \nget into our country on false pretenses and to stay. That possibility, \nthat likelihood, underscores the importance of the two amendments I am \noffering.\n  The first of my amendments, No. 1391, would require that before an \nindividual can be granted asylum, biographic and biometric information \nabout that individual must be checked against the appropriate records \nand databases of the Federal Government, including those maintained by \nthe National Counterterrorism Center. In addition, this amendment \nrequires the asylum officer find that the information in those records \nand databases supports the applicant's claim of asylum or, if \nderogatory information is uncovered, that the applicant is still able \nto meet the burden of proof required by law.\n  The second of my two amendments, No. 1393, would provide asylum \nofficers with the authority to dismiss what are clearly frivolous \nclaims, without prejudice to the applicant, and requires asylum \nofficers and immigration judges to obtain more detailed information \nfrom the State Department on the conditions in the country from which \nasylum is sought.\n  In other words, what we have discovered is this is another example of \none department not talking to another department. It is very difficult \nfor an asylum officer to make a correct decision if he or she lacks \ninformation about conditions in the originating country.\n  This amendment also calls for increased staffing for the Fraud \nDetection and National Security Directorate at asylum offices funded \nthrough fees in this bill.\n  We can never know for sure whether the reforms I am calling for in \nthese two amendments would have kept these dangerous individuals out of \nthis country and perhaps even prevented the terrorist attack in Boston \nand the triple murder in another town in Massachusetts.\n  But the way in which they use the asylum process clearly demonstrates \nthat it can be and will be abused. My amendments will give asylum \nofficers the tools they need to help prevent that kind of fraudulent \nuse of a very important and worthwhile system, and it will help to \nprotect the American public from those who would do us harm.\n  With these modest reforms, America's asylum process will continue to \nshelter those who legitimately fear persecution in their home \ncountries, but it will be less easily taken advantage of by those who \nseek to harm us.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these commonsense amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the period for \ndebate only be extended for 1 hour, until 7:30, with the time equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am happy to report that there has been \na lot of progress made in the last few hours on the package of \namendments that are completely uncontested and there is no objection on \nany side.\n  I wish to thank the Members who have been attentive and supportive of \ntrying to get back to a more normal way of operating, which is, simply, \nwe can argue about the big controversial issues. There are always going \nto be those on every bill we debate. But there will be some amendments \nthat absolutely have no opposition because they are very well-thought-\nout ideas that do not generate any heartburn on either side, that \npeople can reason and say it helps the bill; it does something that \nimproves the bill.\n\n[[Page S4768]]\n\n  We used to do that all the time around here. We have gotten away from \nit, and it is hurtful. It is not just hurtful to the individual \nMembers, it is hurtful to our constituents who would like their ideas \nbrought up for consideration.\n  As I said earlier in the day--and before the Senator from Maine \nleaves the floor, I wish to make this perfectly clear. I am not holding \nup the debate on any controversial amendments. I am not objecting to \nany controversial amendments. Anybody who wants to debate an amendment, \nwhether it is 60 votes or 50 votes, that is the leadership's job, and \nthey are managing this bill very well. I have no complaints or \ncriticism about it at all.\n  But as they are managing these very controversial amendments that are \npart of any debate, what I am simply saying is that of the hundreds of \namendments that have been filed--and we have been spending a lot of \ntime on this with Republican and Democratic staff--there are \npotentially about 25 to 30 amendments that have absolutely no \nobjection.\n  The list has changed a little bit, and I am not going to go over all \nthe details. I have put it in the Record. There could potentially be 7 \nDemocratic amendments, 5 Republican amendments, and 10 bipartisan \namendments that have no known opposition. All I am asking is sometime \nbetween now and when the leadership managing this bill calls cloture, \nwe have these votes en bloc, by voice. There would be no reason to have \nany more debate on them. No one is objecting to them. So we could take \nthem en bloc, by voice. It will improve the bill. Then people can vote \non the bill.\n  Many people already know they are going to vote against the bill. \nSome people are going to vote for the bill. That is the process. I \nthink it would be very healthy for the Senate to get back to this kind \nof negotiation. But for these amendments that are noncontroversial, \nthat simply have been worked on across the aisle in good faith, to be \nheld hostage until somebody can get a vote on an amendment that causes \none side or the other lots of political difficulties is not right.\n  There are 350 amendments filed on this bill. I am only talking about \n35 or less. All the other amendments have pros and cons; people are for \nthem, people are against them. I don't know how the leadership is going \nto decide on how we vote or dispense of those, but I am not managing \nthe bill. Senator Leahy is doing a very good job of that with Senator \nGrassley, Leader McConnell, and Leader Reid. But there are \napproximately 35 amendments, maybe a little more, that have bipartisan \nsupport that people have really worked on--people such as myself--who \nare not on the Judiciary Committee. The Senator had his hands full with \nthe 17 Members he has on the committee. There were 228 amendments filed \non the Judiciary Committee. Senator Grassley himself filed 34, and he \nhad 13 that passed and 21 that failed. That is a lot of amendments.\n  Some of us who are not on the Judiciary Committee have been very \nfortunate. At least I have had one of my eight, which the Senator from \nVermont helped with adopting.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Would the Senator yield?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I would love to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator has several excellent \namendments which I support and agreed to.\n  We have given the other side over and over again a list of amendments \nthat under normal circumstances would be agreed to in about 5 minutes \nby voice vote, including a number of the amendments of the \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana. I keep hoping we might do that.\n  We had more than 200 amendments in the Judiciary Committee that were \nvoted on. Of those that were adopted, all but three passed with \nbipartisan votes. We demonstrated we were willing to do this on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  To assure the Senator from Louisiana--who is a wonderful Senator and \ndear friend--that I support these, I keep trying to get them accepted. \nI hope, after 2 weeks on this bill--and realizing we did the very \nextensive and open markup in the Judiciary Committee--that we can get \nto the point where we could start accepting a number of amendments--\nboth Democratic and Republican--that we all agree on, including those \nfrom the Senator from Louisiana.\n  I am sorry to interrupt her. But she has worked so hard on this. She \nhas gotten bipartisan support. She has talked to all of us. At some \npoint, she should be allowed to have her amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from Vermont, and I appreciate his \nsupport.\n  But actually, having started out wanting to get a vote on my \namendments--and I still do--I am now more focused on this principle of \ngetting uncontested amendments adopted because I am not the only one in \nthis vote. I have friends such as Senator Begich, Senator Carper, \nSenator Hagan, Senator Heinrich, Senator Coons, Senator Kirk, Senator \nCoats--from both sides of the aisle--Senator Hatch, Senator Shaheen--I \ncould go on and on--who are in the same boat I am.\n  We fashioned amendments with bipartisan support. We have done our due \ndiligence with the leaders of the committee of jurisdiction, which is \nwhat you are supposed to do, which is normal. We have gotten their \nblessing, if you will. We have published the details of our amendments. \nWe have circulated the amendments. There is no opposition.\n  So to the Senator from Vermont, I wish to be very clear. I have four \namendments on this list. I am not here just arguing for the four \nLandrieu amendments. I am here arguing for all amendments by anybody, \nRepublican or Democrat, that are noncontroversial, uncontested, germane \nto this bill. They should go on the bill.\n  We need to get back to legislating in the Senate. This is not a \ntheater. It is a legislative body, and I came to legislate. It will be \n18 years that I have been here at the end of this term, a long time. \nThere are Members who have been here longer than I have. But it has \nbeen a while now, 2 or 3 years, that we just sort of stopped \nlegislating. We give speeches. We do headlines. We posture. We \nposition. That has always been a part of the Senate. I have no problem \nwith it. What I do have a problem with is doing that and nothing else. \nThat is where I have a serious problem. Those of us who did not come \nhere to be on the stage have had to sit on the sidelines and watch this \ntheater for a long time. The people I represent are tired of it.\n  We should know that, since the rating for Congress is now at 10 \npercent, I think the lowest level ever or at least in the last 50 \nyears, ten percent--this could have something to do with it.\n  Contrary to popular opinion on the floor, many people in America are \nvery interested in this bill and are actually sending suggestions in \nthrough e-mail, through telephone, through all sorts of communications \nsaying, look, I read the bill. You all should think about this. This \ncould be improved. Some of us actually take those suggestions, work \nwith Members on the other side of the aisle, and fashion them into \namendments. The people we represent deserve respect.\n  If anyone thinks my amendments are controversial and you cannot vote \nfor them because they upset the balance of power in the world or upset \nWestern civilization, then come tell me. I will work with you on it. I \nwill take the amendments off the list. I will put my amendments on a \nlist to be debated.\n  But the days of us coming to the floor and absolutely not accepting \nbipartisan amendments so we can spend all of our time talking about \npartisan amendments that have no chance of passing are over with \nbecause I have enough power--just as Senators on the other side have \nenough power to push us the other way, I have enough power to push back \nand I plan to use it. Those days are over.\n  When we come to the floor, you can have all of your controversial \namendments. We can set aside as many hours of the day to vote on \ncontroversial amendments, an equal number on both sides or none. But \nthe uncontroversial amendments, the ones Members actually do the work \nof the Senate--research, writing, talking, debating privately, and \ncoming up with good ideas--no longer are those going to be swept under \nthe rug. It is not respectful to our constituents, it dishonors the \nSenate, and it causes the public to\n\n[[Page S4769]]\n\nhave serious doubts as to whether anybody around here is actually \nworking in a bipartisan way to improve the bill.\n  These are minor amendments. None of these amendments undermine the \nbargains, the tough negotiations by Republicans and Democrats, on this \nbill. I wish to give a lot of respect to the Gang of 8. They have taken \non the tough big issues, very controversial. Those are not these. These \nare amendments that would help parents who are trying to adopt \nchildren. Now I have to wait for a bill to come to the floor to help \nthese parents. They may be waiting 10 years. They are American \ncitizens. They have a right for Senators to represent their interests \nand I intend to do it. There are amendments here that would make sure \nchildren with mental illness or who are mentally disabled--this is not \nmy amendment but it is a good one--make sure they have a lawyer. Why \ncan't we do that? Because we are so angry with each other that we will \nnot help a child? That is cruel and it is not correct.\n\n  I am going to end here. There are other Members who want to speak. I \nhave no idea when the cloture vote will be. I am not sure. But if these \nnoncontroversial amendments are not adopted by voice vote or by \nrollcall vote, en bloc or separately, before cloture, all of them will \nfall away, which means we will not be able to consider any of them. \nThat is because after cloture they are no longer germane because we \ncannot get them pending. OK?\n  So this is the problem. I thank my colleagues for being \nunderstanding. I actually think it might help us move forward.\n  I yield the floor and I will be back when the cloture motion is \npropounded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to make a few points in response \nto the Senator from Louisiana who has been pushing to get a number of \nso-called noncontroversial amendments adopted. There have been a number \nof misrepresentations. A major incorrect point made is that our side \nresponded with only a list of controversial amendments. The fact is we \nsent over, for consideration by the other side, a number of amendments \non our list but we did not hear that we could just get a vote. But in \naddition to sending back a list of noncontroversial amendments we did \nask if we could have a vote on a number of our amendments. So talk \nabout breakdowns, we cannot even get a vote on our amendments.\n  In regard to some of the amendments the Senator from Louisiana has \nsuggested, they are not as easy as appears. Some are badly drafted, so \nwe tried to fix them and send them back. We have not heard yet. The \nlist we sent over does not say we will not agree to more amendments \nlater, but we have to work through these and fix those that are messed \nup, frankly.\n  The latest problem is that the Democrats want to pick which \nRepublican amendments we can vote on. I have, for instance, an anti-\ngang amendment the Democrats do not want to vote on. Their bill allows \ngang members to become citizens. We should get votes on our amendments \nin addition to this whole process of approving a list of \nnoncontroversial amendments that can be adopted en bloc.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, may I respond?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as I said many times, I have the deepest \nrespect for the Senator from Iowa. He and I hardly ever disagree so \nthis is quite unusual. We cosponsor so many amendments together for \nfoster care, adoption--his work is legendary. But I do want to say \nthis. I have tried to be extremely constructive here. Again, this is \nnot about our list or their list. I am not even in charge of our list \nor their list. I literally am not a floor manager of this bill. I am \nnot even a member of the committee. I do not even have access to our \nlist or their list. I don't want it. I do not want to review the 200 \namendments that are pro-gay, anti-gay, pro-fence, anti-fence. I am not \ninterested--I am interested, but it is not in my lane. I have issues \nthat I have to focus on as chair of Homeland Security. I am not a Gang \nof 8 Member, I am not on the Judiciary Committee, but I am a Senator \nand I came here to legislate.\n  There are amendments. I am not sure this list is perfect but I \npromise you, out of 350 amendments filed, just by the nature of \naverages, at least 10 percent of them have to be noncontroversial. Not \nevery amendment that is filed is going to arouse suspicion or concern \nor violate any principles we hold. Just by nature you are going to have \n10 percent or 15 or 20 percent of all amendments that actually, with a \nlittle bit of work, should be adopted.\n  What Senator Leahy said is absolutely correct. We used to do that \nwhen we trusted each other, when we respected our constituents.\n  I intend to push this body back to that place. I may be unsuccessful \nbecause I am only one Senator, but Senators have a lot of power, if you \nhaven't noticed. We have been held up for weeks over one Senator \nbecause they did not get everything they wanted every day.\n  Again, I want to say to my colleagues, I am not fighting for Landrieu \namendments. I am fighting for a principle and a process that is vital \nto the functioning of this body. I am going to continue to fight and \nhope we get a breakthrough.\n  Please, the other side, do not send me your list or the Democratic \nlist. I am not interested. I am interested in a list of amendments that \nI believe, based on conversations with Senators, are not controversial \nand would improve the bill. We were sent here to do that. I intend to \ndo it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I take the floor today to speak in support \nof the Hoeven-Corker amendment that will soon be filed. Let me say the \ngoal of the so-called Gang of 8 has always been to bring forward from \nCongress a solution to our broken immigration system. We introduced our \nbill knowing full well it was to be a starting point for this \nlegislative process.\n  We had, under Senator Leahy and Senator Grassley's purview, a great \nmarkup in the Judiciary Committee. It went on for days. There were more \nthan 300 amendments filed, more than 100 adopted. We had a full-\nthroated debate in this Chamber already on this bill.\n  Out of this vetting and this debate we have had, we have had several \nconsistent messages on things that need to be improved in the \nlegislation. What we are doing right now is going a long way to deal \nwith these concerns.\n  We have heard that we have allowed too much discretion to write the \nstrategy for the border security plan. We have given too much to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, that they will simply spend the \nbillions of dollars that will be appropriated eventually. This \namendment includes a detailed list of technologies that will have to be \nput in place by the Department. We will set a minimum floor of what \nthey have to do. Then they can go beyond that.\n  In the underlying legislation, we require that a strategy is deployed \nin the underlying legislation, that an entry-exit system for all \nairports and seaports be in place, and that E-Verify be up and running \nfor all businesses in the United States before anyone is granted legal \npermanent residency.\n  There are persistent concerns that that still will not be sufficient \nto ensure a secure border, that we need more incentive there. This \namendment filed by Senators Hoeven and Corker will require 700 miles of \nfence be completed and that we have double the number of border agents \nthat we currently have. These things have to be done before anybody in \nprovisional status adjusts to get a green card.\n  This is important. This amendment dramatically increases the trigger \nthat will have to be met in order for anyone, as I said, who is in \nprovisional status to adjust to get a green card.\n  This is a product of the ongoing scrutiny this bill has received, \nscrutiny it deserves. We said from the very beginning this bill \ndeserves debate, due process through committee and on the floor in this \nChamber, and it is receiving that today and it is a better bill for it. \nIt is going to be considerably improved, particularly after the Hoeven-\nCorker amendment is introduced and hopefully adopted.\n  I hope in the coming days we will also have as much scrutiny on the \npositive aspects of this bill. State and local\n\n[[Page S4770]]\n\ngovernments currently deal with a sizable undocumented population; all \nof them, particularly in Arizona. Businesses are looking for a legal \nworkforce they simply do not have access to right now. Right now the \nbest and the brightest come here, we educate them in our universities, \nand then we send them home to compete against us because we will not \nallow them to stay on a visa.\n  The U.S. economy overall could use the boost that will come if we can \npass meaningful immigration reform.\n  Again, I support this amendment. I commend my colleagues from \nTennessee and North Dakota and all those who are working in the Gang of \n8 and elsewhere. There are some who say many people are trying to kill \nthis bill and bring poison pill amendments. For the most part what I \nhave seen is people who want to improve this legislation, to make it \nbetter, to deal with this problem in a way that will solve it for good \nso we do not have to return to this a couple of years from now.\n  Again, I appreciate my colleagues offering the amendments. I look \nforward to discussing it either this weekend or next week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, several Senators have mentioned this \nlegislation has been pending on the Senate floor since the beginning of \nlast week. Now we are here at the end of this week. If everybody here \nhad been in favor of at least getting a vote one way or the other on \nthe immigration bill, we would have started disposing of amendments \nduring the first week the bill was on the Senate floor.\n  Unfortunately, there are some who do not want any bill, no matter \nwhat we write. They will have every objection to every amendment; they \nwill use every delaying tactic possible. But they are a tiny minority. \nWhat we ought to do is show the majority--Republicans and Democrats--\nwho is for and who is against the bill. The people who object to it, \nthey objected to proceeding to comprehensive immigration reform--that \ncost us several days. Then when we proceeded, we got 84 Senators who \nvoted in favor of proceeding. That should tell the American people \nsomething.\n  This week I have been working closely with the majority leader and \nthe ranking member, Senator Grassley, and others to make progress. But \nevery time we try to bring matters up and get them passed we face \nobjection. So far, there about 350 amendments that have been filed. In \na week and a half we have gotten to 12. That is not progress. That is \nnot. No wonder the American people wonder what is going on. If we \ncontinue at this rate, we are going to be singing Christmas carols as \nwe come to the end of this legislation and we will have done nothing \nelse. Some would like that. They would like to have this take up all \nthe time. We do not do judges, we do not do the budget. The other side \nobjects even going to a conference on the budget, which would have more \nRepublicans on it than Democrats. What is this? If people are that \nopposed to government at all, to any form of democratic government, let \nthem set up an alternative government. But this is ridiculous.\n  We have a system. The people who claim ``we are for the \nConstitution''--let the Constitution work. Let people vote up or down. \nThis is important. It is long overdue legislation to repair our \nimmigration system. Let's vote on it.\n  Senator Landrieu came to the floor last night. She came again today \nto talk about the delays we have had. I agree with her. Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle worked hard on the amendments that were filed \non this legislation. Senators who are not on the Judiciary Committee \nhave been waiting for their opportunity to contribute to this bill.\n\n  Many of the amendments are bipartisan and ought to be heard. Many of \nthe amendments are noncontroversial and have widespread support. Some \nof the amendments are controversial, but the amendments that have been \nproposed to me as noncontroversial all are intended to improve and \nstrengthen this legislation.\n  In the past we would take them up quickly and vote them all through. \nExcept we have some who give great speeches about worrying about people \ncoming into this country, but they are determined not to let anybody \ninto this country. The Presiding Officer and I--and virtually everybody \nin this body--would not be here if these had been the rules when our \nparents or our grandparents or our great grandparents came to this \ncountry.\n  Let's vote. The Judiciary Committee considered a total of 212 \namendments over an extensive markup that involved more than 35 hours of \ndebate, and we made sure it was public. We streamed it live. People all \nover the Nation watched it. About half of the amendments considered \nwere offered by the Republican members of the committee. I went back \nand forth, one Democrat, one Republican, one Democrat, one Republican. \nWe adopted over 135 amendments to this legislation all but three were \nbipartisan votes.\n  We set a gold standard. This body should do the same thing the 18 of \nus did.\n  I filed a managers' amendment that combines a number of the \nnoncontroversial amendments that have been offered to this legislation. \nI hope the Republicans and Senator Grassley, the Judiciary Committee's \nranking member, will join with me in disposing of these \nnoncontroversial amendments. We did it in the committee. Incidentally, \nwhen the bill finally came out of the committee, it was by a bipartisan \nvote.\n  Look at what the managers' amendments includes. They are \nnoncontroversial and have widespread support. They have been filed by \nSenators on both sides of the aisle over the last 2 weeks. Many have \nbeen discussed at length on the Senate floor. We improve oversight of \ncertain immigration programs.\n  There is an amendment from the chair and ranking member of the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs, Senators Carper \nand Coburn, to establish an office of statistics within the Department \nof Homeland Security. There is an amendment by Senator Cochran and \nSenator Landrieu, chairwoman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nHomeland Security, that requires increased reporting on the EB-5 \nprogram. There is an amendment by Senator Heller requiring DHS to \nreport to Congress about an implementation of the biometric exit \nprogram that was added to the bill in committee by Senator Hatch.\n  There are bipartisan amendments offered by Senators Kirk and Coons to \nsupport the naturalization process for Active-Duty members in the Armed \nForces who receive military awards. Who could possibly disagree with \nthat? It contains a trio of amendments championed by Senators Coats, \nLandrieu, and Klobuchar to ease the process for international \nadoptions. There is an amendment by Senator Hagan to reauthorize the \nBulletproof Vest Program.\n  Incidentally, that program had begun as a bipartisan program. There \nis an amendment by Senator Nelson to provide additional research for \nmaritime security. Chairman Carper has an amendment that requires DHS \nto submit a strategy to prevent unauthorized immigration transiting \nthrough Mexico.\n  These are sensible, noncontroversial amendments. If we had a rollcall \nvote of these amendments, they would get 90 or 95 votes, or even 100 \nvotes. Well, let's vote on them. Let's adopt them. Let's show the \nAmerican people we actually care about having immigration reform.\n  The Senator from Louisiana and others are right. We ought to take up \nthose amendments where we share common ground. We so often get bogged \ndown by divisive amendments. Why not join together and pass those that \nwe agree on--Republicans and Democrats? If we do that, we might \nactually fix our immigration system.\n  The one thing everybody agrees on is that the system does not work \ntoday. We are trying to fix it. Let's at least bring up, vote on, and \npass those provisions that both Republicans and Democrats support--more \nimportantly, the American people support--and get them passed.\n\n[[Page S4771]]\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time for \ndebate only be extended until 8:30 and that I be recognized at that \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. And that we would have the time equally divided between the \nmajority and the minority for the next hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I would also say this: The amendment we have been waiting \nfor I think is done. We finally got the last signoff just a few minutes \nago.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, could I inquire as to what UC just got \nagreed to?\n  Mr. REID. To extend the time for debate only until 8:30 with the time \nequally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Nevada \ngetting this unanimous consent agreement and that it was agreed to. I \ncommend the majority leader for the work he is doing. It is a slow \nprocess. It would be an awful lot slower if it wasn't for the very \naccomplished hand of our majority leader.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the distinguished chairman of \nthe committee for saying some nice things about me, but my involvement \nin this is minimal compared to many other people.\n  Mr. President, if we have someone suggest the absence of a quorum \nover the next 2 minutes, I ask unanimous consent that the time be \nequally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Are there any other questions anyone has?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I appreciate the majority leader. He speaks softly, and \nI don't hear as well as I should, so I am not sure what we agreed to or \nwhat he propounded.\n  Mr. REID. Has the Senator from Alabama heard now? It is that we \nextend the time for debate only equally divided between the majority \nand minority until 8:30 tonight.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time be \nequally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, here we are with an intent to have an \namendment that is supposed to solve all the problems of this \nlegislation, and we had it announced earlier this morning, and we have \nnot seen it yet. So we are now here.\n  Earlier today we thought we had an agreement to have as many as half-\na-dozen votes tonight. So we had some today, and we were going to have \nsome more tonight. We have only had nine votes on this legislation as \nof today. This is really odd.\n  So we have not seen this bill. We do not know what is in it. \nEverything has been stopped, waiting on some agreement, as Senator \nSchumer said, among the allies. He said they are showing the bill to \nallies. Apparently, they have not shown it to Senator Lee, they have \nnot shown it to me. So the allies of the Gang of 8 are going through \nthe bill. I do not know if they are going to have Nebraska kickbacks in \nit or ``Cornhusker kickbacks'' or whatever else they are going to put \nin it to get somebody's vote on it. I hope that is not where we are \ngoing.\n  But what I am concerned about, having been around here a few years \nnow, is that we will have a vote on cloture on this amendment--they are \ngoing to file the amendment, immediately file cloture, apparently, and \nthen have that vote early next week--and then have a couple more votes, \nand the next thing you know, we are at final passage and no amendments \nof significance have been allowed to occur.\n  I have a number of amendments. The House has done a really good job \non working on the interior enforcement weaknesses of our current law. \nThey put together some good language. I have taken a lot of it and put \nit into an amendment. I would like to have a vote on that. We ought to \ntalk about it because there is some feeling around here that the only \nthing that matters is the border, but that is not so. Forty percent of \nthe illegal entries into America today come by visa overstays, and that \nis not dealt with at all or in any significant way that I am aware of \nin this new amendment which we have not seen.\n  So I am worried about this whole process. The American people deserve \nan open process. It was promised. I do not know how many amendments we \nhad in committee, I say to Senator Lee. Lots of them. But we have only \nhad nine now, and we lost a group that we were going to have today. And \nwe cannot tell from our discussions with Senator Reid and others if \nthere will be any more amendments next week because, I guess, the \npowers that be, the masters of the universe, have all gotten together \nand they have decided this: They have decided that everything is fixed \nby Hoeven-Corker, and we will just pass that amendment and nobody else \nwill be heard. But that amendment, from what I read in the papers about \nit, in general, does not fix anything like the loopholes and weaknesses \nof the legislation.\n  I say to Senator Lee, I appreciate his elegance on this issue, but I \ndid want to share that I feel as if something is going awry in the \nopen, debatable process we thought we were going to have for a day or \ntwo. It seems to have jumped off the tracks completely.\n  Mr. LEE. It does indeed. I was disappointed by the fact that in the \nJudiciary Committee, on which the Senator and I both serve, we had a \nlot of amendments. I do not remember exactly how many votes we had in \nthe committee, but it was in the dozens, if not scores, and we had \nextensive discussion. Now, not all the votes turned out the way the \nSenator and I wanted them to, but the important thing is we had a lot \nof discussion, we had on-the-record debate, we had amendments proposed \nand discussed and debated, and that is not how it has happened this \ntime.\n  To my understanding--I was not here, unlike my friend from Alabama, \nin 2007, the last time we had a comparable discussion of a bill like \nthis one, but my understanding is that there were 50-something, perhaps \n53 amendments that were debated, discussed, and received votes in 2007. \nTo my understanding, this time around we have had nine votes and maybe \ntwo or three that were taken by voice vote. That is not enough, and it \ncertainly is not enough when we are talking about a bill that is more \nthan 1,000 pages long, a bill that is going to affect many millions of \nAmericans, and it is going to do so for many generations to come.\n  The American people deserve more. They deserve more than just debate \nand discussion, rollcall votes that can be measured in the single \ndigits. They call this the greatest deliberative legislative body in \nthe world, and yet we make a mockery of that description when we do \nthings like this, when we allow a 1,000-page bill to be rammed through \nin a matter of days with only a small handful of amendments debated, \ndiscussed, and amended.\n  So through the Chair I would like to ask my friend and my \ndistinguished colleague from Alabama whether he has seen anything like \nthis in his career, whether this is something I should anticipate \nmoving forward. As I look forward to my years in the Senate, is this \nsomething I should expect on a regular basis with legislation such as \nthis, of this complexity, of this level of importance? Is this \nsomething that is just par for the course?\n\n[[Page S4772]]\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am afraid it is becoming par for the course. I \nremember we had a bill, a bankruptcy bill, a fourth of this in size. I \nthink it was on the floor 3 weeks, and we had maybe nearly 100 \namendments. Everybody had their chance to speak, and we ended up \npassing the bill with well over 80 votes.\n\n  But the point is that in this new mood in the Senate we have a \nsituation in which the majority leader too often fills the tree and \ncontrols even the amendments that are brought up.\n  Does the Senator think it odd, as a new Member of the Senate and as a \nstudent of law and Washington governmental processes, that a Senator \ncannot come to the floor and offer an amendment without seeking \npermission of the majority leader? And he says: No, I will not take \nyour amendment; I will only take this amendment. Does that strike the \nSenator as contrary to what his understanding is historically as to how \nthe Senate should operate?\n  Mr. LEE. Yes. In fact, I find it appalling. I find it repugnant to \nthe system of government under which we are supposed to be operating. I \nfind it even repugnant to article VI in the Constitution, which makes \nclear that there is one kind of constitutional amendment that is never \nappropriate. You cannot amend the Constitution to deny any State its \nequal representation in the Senate. If at any moment we end up with a \nsituation in which we have second-class Senators, Senators who may \nsubmit and propose for debate and discussion and a vote an amendment--\nif we have to go to the majority leader and say: Mother may I, then \nperhaps we have lost something, perhaps we have lost the environment in \nwhich each of the States was supposed to receive equal representation.\n  It also seems to me to take on a certain character, a certain banana \nrepublic quality that we are asked to vote on legislation in many \ncircumstances just hours or even minutes after we have received it. We \ntake on a certain rubberstamp quality when we do that.\n  I remember a few months ago, in connection with the fiscal cliff \ndebate--as we approached the fiscal cliff on New Year's Eve, we were \ntold by our respective leaders: Just wait. Something is coming. Go back \nto your offices. Watch your televisions. Play with your toys. Do \nwhatever it is you do, but, you know, be good Senators, run along and \nstay out of trouble. We are taking care of this. We will send you \nlegislation as soon as we are ready.\n  Well, at 1:36 a.m. we received an e-mail, and attached to that e-mail \nwas a 153-page document. That was the bill on which we would be voting. \nThat bill was one we would be called to vote on exactly 6 minutes \nlater, at 1:42 a.m. So to my utter astonishment and dismay, Senators \nflocked into this room and with very, very little objection ended up \npassing that legislation overwhelmingly.\n  This is just one of many examples I can point to in the 2\\1/2\\ years \nsince I have been here when Members have been asked to vote and did, in \nfact, vote enthusiastically, willingly, and hardly without a whimper of \nobjection to legislation that they had never seen, to legislation that \nthey were familiar with only to the extent it had been summarized for \nthem.\n  That brings us back to this legislation. We have had this in front of \nus in one form or another for the last couple of months, but for a long \ntime before we even had it, what we had was a summary of this. We had a \nseries of bullet points. Those bullet points were very favorable, and \nfor a long time the bullet points were all we had. The bullet points--I \nexaggerate slightly to prove a point, but they read something like \nthis: Is this bill outstanding? Yes. Will this bill solve all of our \nimmigration problems? Absolutely. Is there anything wrong with the \nbill? Heavens no. That is how the bullet points read.\n  It was on that basis that groups around the country supported and \nsome Members even of our own body decided they would vote for S. 744, \neven before S. 744 even existed. We had groups across the country, some \neven in my home State, that came out strongly in favor of the yet-to-\nbe-released Gang of 8 bill, saying: We are going to support it, and \nanyone who does not vote for it in the U.S. Senate is a backward fool. \nWell, they had not read it. They could not have read it because the \nbill did not yet exist.\n  Now, in some respects, what happened with this is very similar to \nwhat we are now facing with the yet-to-be-released Corker amendment. I \nhave not seen it. But I will tell you what I have seen. I have seen a \nset of very brief bullet points about the Corker amendment.\n  The bullet point reads something like this. Is this amendment \noutstanding?\n  Yes.\n  Will this amendment solve our border security problems?\n  Absolutely.\n  Is there any problem presented by this amendment?\n  Absolutely not.\n  So I say to my friend from Alabama, if this is what I can expect in \nmy career in the Senate, I am a little bit troubled. But I would ask my \nfriend from Alabama if there is anything we can do about this, if there \nis any way we can right this ship, if there is any way we can turn this \naround, this disturbing trend? Separate and apart from the policies \nunderlying this bill, is there anything we can do to make this a real \nlegislative body and not a rubber stamp, the kind of legislative body \nthat actually does debate and discuss things?\n  We do not really have a true deliberative legislative body unless \nhave we enough time to debate things before we vote on them, to where \nthe Members can actually read them before they come up?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes, we can do that if we just follow the traditional \nrules of the Senate. The Senator is exactly right. Here we are being \ntold this legislation, this 1,000 pages, is all decided because \nsomebody has an amendment somewhere that nobody has seen--at least \nnobody who has any skepticism about it has seen. That is going to solve \nall of the problems. It is just rather remarkable.\n  On the fundamental question the Senator raised about the Senate, I do \nbelieve that we need to begin to appeal across party lines and think \nmore clearly about what has happened. I talked with one of the great \nhistorians of the Senate, someone I have known and has been here, \nworked on the floor, and has written a book about it. He said he hated \nto say it, but it is kind of getting like the old Russian Soviet Duma \nwhere a group of people met in secret and put out the word, then they \nall went in and voted 990 to 10 for whatever it was their little group \ndecided.\n  I am worried that has too much relevance to what has been happening \nhere. I really do. A Senator, as the Senator said, is equal to any \nother Senator. The majority leader has the power of first recognition, \nbut it was never intended that the majority leader should say: You \ncannot get your amendment, Senator from Alabama; only the one from \nMaine can get their amendment, and actually be able to execute that.\n  It is rather stunning. That was not the way it was when I came. This \nfilling-the-tree process started maybe not long after I came. Both \nparties have used it. But it has now gone to an extent which we have \nnever seen before, and it adversely impacts the whole Senate. I think \nthe Senator is right about that.\n  I just saw Senator Portman from Ohio. He had worked extremely hard on \na very significant amendment dealing with E-Verify in the workplace. He \nis not sure he is going to get a vote on it. He thought he was going to \nget a vote on it. It is very frustrating for him that will not be the \ncase.\n  What is this? We are not going to be in session tomorrow, apparently. \nNobody gets their amendments. Maybe, virtually, no more amendments get \nbrought up of significance.\n  So I am concerned about it. I have a couple of key amendments. I know \nSenator Cruz has an amendment too. The Senator may have amendments. \nAmendments are valuable in that they point out weaknesses in \nlegislation. They provide a fix for that weakness. Why would we want to \ndeny people the right to make a piece of legislation better?\n  Mr. LEE. One of the distinguishing characteristics of a democracy is \nthat you have choices, you have options. I am not intimately familiar \nwith the inner workings of the Soviet government. But I have it on good \nauthority that they had elections in the Soviet Union. But the big \ndifference was the government decided who was on the ballot. They \ndecided that very carefully. Only those candidates who had\n\n[[Page S4773]]\n\nbeen very carefully screened by the Communist Party officials could \nappear on the ballot.\n  So people had choices. It was just the choices were very limited. \nThey were limited so as to guarantee a certain foreordained outcome.\n  Now, if you will forgive the analogy, what we have here makes sense. \nIt makes sense that all of the 50 States are represented but only if, \nin fact, we are presented with actual legitimate choices, with actual \nlegitimate options.\n  One of the reasons we have seen legislation pushed through at the \nvery last minute, and our colleagues in this body vote for that \nlegislation overwhelmingly, is they are told at the moment they have no \nother option: You have a binary choice. You can vote yes or you can \nvote no, but you do not really have the option of making any changes. \nSo a lot of times people vote for something, even if it is a bill they \notherwise did not like, or if it had a lot of problems with it, they \nwill vote for it because they conclude that on balance, voting yes is \nbetter than voting no. The problem is, we are supposed to have more \noptions than that. In this body, we are supposed to have the \nopportunity to propose amendments and in theory to have unlimited \ndebate and discussion.\n  Unlimited debate and discussion necessarily entails more or less \nunlimited opportunities to amend, to make it better. That is what real \ncompromise is. Real compromise involves allowing all of the \nstakeholders to come together and explain what is important to each \nmember of the group, to each stakeholder. We do not have that here. We \nare supposed to have that in the Senate. Historically, it has existed.\n  I know that not from my service here, but I know it from reading \nbooks and from talking to colleagues who have been here a little bit \nlonger than I have. But it is time to restore that. It is time we \nrestore what once existed but has since been lost so that our \ndemocratic system of government actually functions as it was designed.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator led a press conference this afternoon with \na group of tea party patriots. Jenny Beth Martin and a number of other \npeople were there. They came to Washington and had a number of people \nwho had immigrated to America. They spoke from their hearts about laws \nand rules and proper procedure. Maybe the Senator could share with our \ncolleagues and those who might be listening the gist of that.\n  I thought it was very moving to have people who came to America, some \nfrom countries where they had been persecuted and were so proud of the \nrule of law, who felt deeply that we need to be careful about what we \ndo in the Senate to preserve the rule of law here.\n  I thank the Senator for leading that press conference today and \nletting those individuals, those Americans, speak their minds. Just in \ngeneral, I would say that whole tea party movement, which many have \ntried to demean, came right from the heart of America. It represented a \ndeep concern that people in Washington were out of touch, were not \nconnected with the real world, were not following the constitutional \nprocesses, were meeting in secret with special interests and trying to \nwin elections and not serving the people in effective ways.\n  I thought it was good to have them speak out today as they did in \nopposition to this monstrosity.\n  Mr. LEE. That is exactly right. The movement described is a \nspontaneous grass roots movement that started in 2009 in response to an \nobservation that swept across the country that the Federal Government \nhas become too big and too expensive, in part because it is doing too \nmany things it was never designed to do, in part because it has lost \nsight of the fact that it was always created at the outset to be a \nlimited-purpose government, one in charge of just a few basic things: \nnational defense, establishing a uniform system of weights and \nmeasures, declaring war; otherwise providing for our national defense, \nprotecting trademarks, copyrights, and patents granting letters of mark \nand reprisal, which are fascinating instruments. Basically, you get a \nhall pass issued by Congress in the name of the United States that \nentitles the bearer to engage in state-sponsored acts of piracy on the \nhigh seas.\n  So regardless of how long I might serve in the Senate, I do want to \nget a letter of mark and reprisal someday. I am going to be a pirate. I \nhope my friend from Alabama and my friend from Colorado will join me.\n  Among those other powers was a power to establish uniform laws \ngoverning naturalization, what today we would perhaps more broadly call \nimmigration. That is one of our jobs. So it was appropriate at this \ngathering today, where we were joined by a lot of supporters of this \ngrass roots movement--we had some immigrants to this country, people \nwho came here legally, people who sacrificed much, put a lot at risk in \norder to come to this country.\n  They explained that one of the things that attracted them to this \ncountry, one of the unifying reasons all of them came to the United \nStates, despite the sacrifices they had to make to get here and the \nrisks they undertook in coming here, was the fact that they loved the \nrule of law. They see the difference, as all of us do anytime we travel \nto a country where the rule of law is absent, that the rule of law \nmakes all the difference. You can tell almost immediately after you \nstep off the plane whether you are in a country where the rule of law \nis respected, where it is honored. There are relatively few countries \nin the world where it is. Fortunately, this is one of them. It is our \njob to make sure it continues to be that way.\n  Many of these immigrants commented on the fact that they find it \ndistressing that while they expended the time and effort and resources \nto make sure they immigrated legally, they are disturbed about the fact \nthat under this legislation, well-intentioned as it may have been, \nunder this legislation 11 million people who came here illegally, for \nwhatever reason, will eventually find themselves in a position of not \nonly being able to stay here, not only being able to keep their current \njobs, maintain their current circle of friends, they will actually \nbecome citizens.\n  This reminds me of a letter that I received not too long ago from a \nschoolteacher in Utah, a schoolteacher who explained that she had come \nhere on a visa, a visa that will expire in 2017. She explained to me \nthat she has every expectation that she will be unable to renew and \nextend that visa. So, she said: I expect effectively to be deported in \n2017 because I do not intend to break the law of the country whose laws \nI promised to uphold if they would grant me this visa. She said: It is \nvery distressing to me that meanwhile people who broke your laws, \npeople who did not respect the rule of law, as I did, people who did \nnot expend a lot of time and money and resources and took a lot of risk \nin applying for and obtaining the necessary visa to come here, a lot of \npeople who broke all of those same laws will get to stay here, they \nwill get to become citizens. That is not fair.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thought that group reflected those concerns very \nwell. I think the whole grass roots movement did. As I recall, Senator \nLee was involved in the election in many ways. It was a ramming through \nof the massive health care bill that nobody had read. We were told: \nWell, you have to pass it to find out what is in it. That generated \nthat whole movement. Is this not in many ways similar? In the Senator's \nview, does it feel the same that we are moving rapidly through a bill, \na massive consequence of over 1,000 pages, and there is a lack of \nunderstanding fully of what is in it?\n  Mr. LEE. There certainly are some similarities. I will point out at \nthe outset there are some differences, one of them being we have, \nfortunately, actually had the text of this for a little bit longer than \nI think Congress had the text of the Affordable Care Act when it \npassed. We have had some opportunity to amend it in committee. That has \nbeen nice. But, yes, there are a lot of similarities.\n  Both bills are very lengthy. Both bills involve excessive--remarkably \nexcessive--delegation of authority to decisionmakers in another branch \nof government, within the executive branch.\n  There are, by one count, something like 490 instances of delegated \ndiscretionary decisionmaking authority. You know, this is a problem \nbecause for centuries, great thinkers, including our Founding Fathers \nbut really going\n\n[[Page S4774]]\n\nback even before them, have warned that legislative power involves the \npower to make laws, not the power to make lawmakers.\n  To a very significant degree, the lawmaking power is not subject to \ndelegation. It should not be delegated to someone else. Obviously, we \nhave to delegate a lot of tasks to the executive branch. It is the \nexecutive branch's job to implement, to enforce, to apply the laws that \nwe pass. But on some level there is a difference that we can tell \nbetween giving someone the task of implementing and enforcing a law and \ngiving someone else the task of coming up with policy, either policy as \nembodied in the Code of Federal Regulations or policy as embodied in \nthe exercise of pure discretion that will evolve and over time become \nits own form of laws.\n  This law, much like the Affordable Care Act, involves hundreds and \nhundreds of instances of delegated policymaking authority.\n  One of the problems with that is when you delegate the policymaking \nauthority to the executive branch, to the executive branch regulatory \nstate, so to speak, you give it to people, however well-intentioned, \nhowever well-educated, however wise, who are not themselves elected by \nthe people. They themselves don't stand accountable to the people at \nregular intervals. They themselves can act in much the same way as \ndespots might have centuries ago.\n  Sure, their actions could be subject to challenge in court under the \nAdministrative Procedures Act, challenge them in court under a standard \nthat is very deferential and not to the challenger, to the government. \nOne thing that is certain, we can't go to them and say: Look, if you \ndon't change this law, I am not going to vote for you again. They will \nlaugh at us if you tell them that because they don't work for us. They \ndon't ever have to stand for election. That is one of the problems I \nhave with it.\n  One of the problems it shares in common with ObamaCare is this \nexcessive delegation of authority. It also shares in common with \nObamaCare the fact that it is long. It is not quite as long as \nObamaCare, but it is still long. Very often we find that long bills go \nhand in hand with bills that have an excessive delegation of power to \nthe executive branch of government. This is what we have here.\n  I find it significant that James Madison warned us in Federalist No. \n62, it will be of little benefit to the American people that their laws \nmay be written by men and women of their own choosing if those laws are \nso voluminous and complex that they can't be easily read and understood \nby those governed by the same laws.\n  Madison was right to point that out. It is true it is difficult to \npick up a law like that, or twice its size, in the case of ObamaCare. \nIt is difficult for the American people to pick that up, read through \nit and say: Yes, I get it, I understand what my obligations are. I \nunderstand what the obligations of government officials are. I can \nunderstand it.\n  It is 10 times worse than that when this is just the tip of the \niceberg, when this will be a tiny fraction of the paperwork that will \nbe entailed and the laws that actually implement laws such as this one \nand laws such as ObamaCare. To put it in Madison's words, it is bad \nenough when the laws are so voluminous and complex they can't \nreasonably be read and understood and read by those governed by them. \nIt is that much worse when most of the actual law isn't even made or \nchosen by the voters.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator for sharing those insights. It is \nimportant, because we are getting to a situation where we are \ndelegating extraordinary power to unelected bureaucrats. What we have \nseen with regard to the current administration and their enforcement \nlaws is one of the most dramatic, willful, deliberate failures to \nenforce the law I have ever seen.\n  It has resulted in a most amazing circumstance. The ICE agents, the \nImmigration, Customs, and Enforcement agents, who are out there trying \nto enforce the law every day, who took an oath to enforce the law, have \nbeen so directed by their unelected supervisors to not enforce the law. \nThey have reached the point where they have filed a lawsuit in Federal \ncourt against their supervisors. They sued Secretary Napolitano, and \nthey said she is issuing directives and orders that contradict with our \nsworn duty as law officers to enforce the law and follow what Congress \ndirected. Some of this simply came down to the fact that they are \nrequired to deport certain people if they are apprehended doing certain \nthings. They just issue guidelines that say don't deport people.\n  Think about it. Secretary Napolitano and John Morton, her ICE \nDirector, who has now resigned, were directing these agents to do \nthings that undermined their ability to do the most basic part of law. \nThey filed a lawsuit in Federal court. The judge has heard the lawsuit \nand heard the complaints. The Department of Justice sought to dismiss \nthe complaint initially, and it has not been dismissed. The judge has \nlet it proceed. He, in effect, as I read the news article about it, \nbasically said the Secretary is not above the law. I thought we learned \nthat from Richard Nixon. No President is above the law. Nobody is above \nthe law in America. This lawsuit is still ongoing.\n  It is one of the most amazing things I have seen, and how little it \nhas been commented on and how significant that is.\n  We have the Citizenship and Immigration Services officers. Like the \nICE officers, they have written Congress and told us they cannot do \nwhat the law requires them to do in this bill. They can't do what the \nlaw is requiring them to do now. They are overwhelmed by the \nrequirements that have been placed upon them. They said the law that is \nbeing considered today, S. 744, makes the situation worse. Both of \nthose agencies have written to Congress and said it would weaken our \nnational security and place our safety at risk in America. It wouldn't \nmake things better, it would make them worse.\n  I think we need to say how did we get here? I believe we got here \nfundamentally because well-meaning Senators decided if you are going to \npass a bill--we had to have La Raza happy, we had to have the unions \nhappy, we had to have the business groups happy, and we had to have the \nchicken processors happy, and they all met with them. They met with \ntheir pollsters, their political consultants, and the politicians.\n  Chris Crane, the head of the ICE officers association, wrote them \nrepeatedly, saying: Let me come tell you what it is really like out \nthere. They refused to hear from him. They refused to hear from him and \nhis ideas. He tried everything he could. He wrote them and asked if \nthey would meet with him, and they wouldn't do that.\n  The legislation was written by people not connected to how the \nimmigration system actually operates. The people tried their best every \nday to make this system lawful, make it effective, and make it \nsomething we can be proud of.\n  Even under the legislation, it does not require people who want to be \ncitizens and want to be given legal status in America to have a face-\nto-face meeting with a single person.\n  In fact, the DREAM Act, the DACA cases that are out there, they are \nnot meeting with them face to face. They just give papers, read those \npapers, and process them in a way that they have no capability of \nascertaining whether those claims of legality are legitimate.\n  It is very clear from experts in the 9/11 Commission that face-to-\nface interviews make a huge difference. One of the hijackers who was \nsupposed to be the terrorist, who was supposed to be on the plane that \nmay have hit the Capitol of the United States or the White House, the \none that went down in Pennsylvania, one of those was identified in a \nface-to-face meeting by an alert officer. He held him up, and he was \nnot on that plane. Who knows, one more terrorist on that plane might \nhave enabled them to control that plane and succeed in wreaking \ndevastation on Washington, DC. Maybe those patriots who brought that \nplane down, giving their lives to save this Capitol, may not have been \nable to do so had there been one more terrorist on that plane. I have \nto say this is important material. I don't know what the language is \nabout the border and how many agents they have there.\n\n  I know this, we have had testimony from witnesses and the 9/11 \nCommission that we need an entry-exit visa system. We already have most \nof it. When you come into the country, they\n\n[[Page S4775]]\n\ntake your fingerprints, and you are clocked into the country. We are \nnot clocking people out of the country.\n  The 9/11 Commission, in a followup meeting of that commission to \nreview how America had complied with their original suggestions, \nrepeated their concern that we need this entry-exit visa system. The \ncurrent law that has been passed, about six times, and is current law \ntoday, says we should have a biometric entry-exit visa system at all \nair, land, and sea ports.\n  This legislation guts that requirement. It eliminates the biometric, \nwhich means you don't use something like a fingerprint, which would be \nthe most common thing to use. It would be some sort of an electronic \nsystem that is recognized to be weaker, and it doesn't require it to be \nin place at the land ports. The 9/11 Commission explicitly reviewed \nthat, and they said the system won't work because people can fly in to \nHouston, fly in to Los Angeles, go back across the border, fly in to \nNew York and exit through New Mexico. They can do these things and, \ntherefore, the system won't work. We don't know who overstayed and who \ndidn't overstay.\n  What we learned was it is not too expensive. They claimed it was \ngoing to be $25 billion. Where did this figure come from? It was raised \nin committee, you may remember. Senator Schumer said it will be $25 \nbillion. What we found was they did a pilot project in Atlanta and I \nbelieve Philadelphia. People came through to get on a plane to depart \nAmerica. They put their fingerprints on a machine. They go right on by, \nand those who are in violation have warrants out for their arrest or \nare on a terrorist watch list, are picked up.\n  Amazingly, amazingly, in Atlanta they did 20,000 people as a pilot \nproject. They failed 134, I believe, who had warrants for their arrest \nand got hits on the watch list. Some of these could be serious \noffenders.\n  I think that is one more example of weaknesses in the legislation \nthat apparently are not being addressed. This is one more proof that \nthe bill before us today weakens current law, directly weakening our \nentry-exit visa system that the 9/11 Commission has said we must \ncomplete.\n  There are a lot of things I am concerned about in the legislation. \nThis is one of them. It has to be fixed. I am afraid we are not on the \npath to do that. Special interests have opposed that over the years. It \nhas been debated, debated, and debated. Finally a decision has been \nmade. Multiple times Congress has directed this to occur, but it still \nhas not occurred.\n  I wanted to share that. Maybe the Senator has other thoughts he \nwishes to share.\n  Mr. LEE. The Senator mentioned a few moments ago that in some \ncircumstances there has been some indication that perhaps the Secretary \nof Homeland Security believes she is above the law. In some respects, \nwhen reading through this bill, we can conclude that if it passes she \nwill become the law. She will be the law. With hundreds and hundreds of \ninstances in which she will be given vast discretion to make all kinds \nof determinations about who stays and who doesn't, what happens under \nwhat circumstance and what program, she actually sort of becomes the \nlaw. This becomes an active administrative discretion, rather than an \nact that helps bolster the rule of law. That certainly is a concern we \nhave over time.\n  We do wonder at times also why it is we have legislation that remains \nsecret for so long. In other words, we have commented on the fact that \nwe have been waiting for this mysterious amendment. We have wondered \nwhy we haven't seen it. I wonder if the reason why we haven't seen it \nis because they are still negotiating in secret trying to sweeten the \npot so they can ram it through. It makes me wonder whether we can \nanticipate another ``cornhusker kickback,'' another ``Louisiana \npurchase,'' yet another parallel between the Affordable Care Act and \nthis legislation we have before us today. It is another concern I have.\n  I am also concerned about the same talking points to which I alluded \nearlier, the same talking points we have had since before we even had \nthis bill--the talking points I alluded to earlier that I described as \nbeing to the effect of saying: Is there anything wrong with this bill? \nNo. Is this bill excellent? Yes, absolutely it is. Those are the same \ntalking points that convinced a lot of people to come out and support \nthe bill before the bill even existed.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If the Senator will remember, in committee my able \ncolleague Senator Schumer said this was the toughest bill ever, as I \nrecall. And it was tough as nails. But it looks like now we are being \ntold it wasn't so tough because we have added an amendment that is \ngoing to make it tough.\n  So is that kind of what the Senator is saying when he refers to the \ntalking points, that we have to go beyond the bill? If it was so tough \nto begin with, why did they have to pass another amendment now to make \nit a lot tougher now?\n  Mr. LEE. I guess it wasn't tough enough and they are trying to make \nit even tougher. Yes, that is an interesting point. A lot of people got \ncaught up in that kind of mindset even before the bill was released.\n  The Salt Lake Chamber of Commerce, an institution in my own home \nState, came out overwhelmingly in support of this bill. But the problem \nwas the bill didn't even exist. They were going off the talking points. \nAnd here is the problem: The talking points were wrong. The talking \npoints proved to be grossly misleading.\n  The talking points told us--and the proponents of the bill have \ncontinued to tell us for months, even after the bill text came out and \neven after we had reason to know better--quite a few things. They told \nus, No. 1, illegal aliens who would be legalized and who would be put \non the path to citizenship under this bill would have to pay back taxes \nas a condition of their legalization. Did that turn out to be true? \nAbsolutely not.\n  When we read the fine print, one thing is very clear. They have to \npay only those back taxes that have previously been assessed by the \nInternal Revenue Service. What does that mean? Well, they have to be \nfound due and owing. They have to have been assessed by the IRS. An \nindividual doesn't have taxes assessed by the IRS if, as is often the \ncase for someone who has been working here illegally, they are working \noff the books.\n  This is what we call an illusory promise. They offered us the sleeves \noff their vest. They offered us something that didn't exist in the \nfirst place.\n  We were also told a number of other things about this bill. We were \ntold there would be a lot of people who would be excluded. Yet we \ndiscovered there are a lot of people who, even after having committed \ncrimes in this country, even after having illegally reentered the \ncountry following a previous deportation, which, by the way, is a \nfelony, many of those people will still be able to get legalized and \nnot just remain in this country and continue working but also continue \non the path to citizenship and eventually become voting citizens of \nthis country.\n  We were told those people who are illegal aliens currently, who would \nbe eligible for legalization and eventual citizenship, would not be \neligible during their provisional status, during their interim status, \nor RPI status, as we call it under the bill, wouldn't be eligible for \nmeans-tested welfare benefits.\n  Did that turn out to be true? No. They are still eligible, for \nexample, for the earned-income tax credit, which some have described as \nthe most generous and largest, in some respects, means-tested program \nwe have.\n  So these things turned out not to be true. Yet a lot of people are \nstill asking their Members of Congress to support this very same \nlegislation, and not because they have read it, not because any of \nthose promises are true, but because they are still believing the \npromises contained in the original set of talking points, which most \npeople think are the bill. That is disturbing.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It is. I think it is like smelling the sizzling steak \nthat turns out to be shoe leather. It sounds good when they talk about \nit. I said: Wow, that sounds good. And if it accomplished all the \nthings they promised, I would be intrigued by that legislation. It \nwould have a chance to get my vote.\n  Well, we made a list, just as Senator Lee did, of some of the things \nwe were told repeatedly about this legislation. We were told it was \nborder security\n\n[[Page S4776]]\n\nfirst. Now, I don't think anybody denies that amnesty is the one thing \nthat will happen. Everything else is going to be promised to occur in \nthe future. So that was not an honest and correct promise.\n  Then it was said it was going to be the toughest enforcement ever. \nWell, I would just say to my colleague, this legislation is not as \ntough as the 2007 bill. As an example, it weakened the standard of \nenforcement at the border from current law that they are still debating \nand can't reach an agreement over. It weakens the current law's \nstandard.\n  As I just established earlier, it weakened the entry-exit visa system \nabsolutely on a key and fundamental point, making the entry-exit visa \nsystem not workable; whereas today, if the administration did it \nproperly, it would work.\n  The Senator just mentioned back taxes. That is a flimflam if there \never was one. We hear that over and over--people are going to pay their \nback taxes. The IRS is not going to go out and try to run down 11 \nmillion people who have been here illegally and have been working and \ntry to find out how much they owe and then collect taxes from them. It \nis not physically practical. It will never happen. It is a talking \npoint, just as the Senator said, and not reality.\n  They are going to learn English. That sounds good. We are for making \npeople learn English. But if a person is going to get legal status, a \nSocial Security number, the ability to go to work almost immediately, \nand 10 years later, if they haven't learned English, under the language \nof the bill all they have to do is to enroll in a course. They do not \nhave to complete the course or anything. It only occurs when they are \nat the point of becoming a legal permanent resident. That is 10 years \nlater.\n  Then no welfare benefits. The Senator just mentioned the biggest is \nthe earned-income tax credit. I offered an amendment to validate the \nsponsors' promise in the Judiciary Committee, if the Senator will \nrecall, and it was voted down. So they said we are not going to have \nany welfare, but the Congressional Budget Office--well, it is obvious. \nThe earned-income tax credit is not a tax deduction, it is a direct \npayment from the U.S. Treasury to people who qualify for this subsidy. \nSo that is one of the biggest ones we have, and it is still protected. \nThey can still obtain it.\n  Then they say: We will end illegal immigration. That was a firm \npromise--to end illegal immigration. The toughest bill ever. The \nCongressional Budget Office report that came out yesterday said it \nwould only reduce illegal immigration by 25 percent. I think it was a \ndifference of we would have 7.5 million people enter the country \nillegally instead of 10 million people entering the country illegally \nover the next 10 years. How pathetic is that?\n  So we are going to give amnesty, benefits, and all of this, and we \nare going to promise the American people we are going to fix the broken \nborder, but it is not there. The promises aren't there.\n  We haven't even seen this new amendment. Now we are going to have all \nthese agents, we are going to fix the border, everything is going to be \ntaken care of, and we say: Well, we would like to read your bill. The \nlast time you weren't so accurate, were you? Last time the promises \nweren't fulfilled in your bill. Now you are scrambling around, your \nbill is in big trouble, people are asking some real tough questions, \nyou don't have answers for them, and so a group comes together. They \nare secretly meeting over here today, and now they have the toughest \namendment ever, I guess. But when do we read it? When do we see it? We \nwere told we were going to have it at 6 o'clock. It is now 8:30.\n  So I agree with the Senator from Utah. I don't think talking points \nare going to cut it. Doesn't the Senator agree the power is in the \nlegislation and not in talking points?\n  Mr. LEE. Yes. Yes.\n  One of the most galling aspects of this entire debate and what has \noccurred today, as this amendment is being crafted behind closed doors \nin secret, we have had dozens and dozens of amendments that are \nwritten, that have been filed, that have been prepared, some of which \nare now pending before the Senate. Have we had a chance to have a vote \non those? No. We are told we have to wait for the Corker amendment, \nwhich isn't even written.\n  So those who have been working on this for months and months and \nmonths, who have written our own amendments and have aired them \npublicly, allowed our constituents and people throughout the country to \nview our amendments, we are shut out. We are shut out and we are shut \ndown and we are told we don't get a vote on them because we have to \nwait for the Corker amendment. That doesn't seem fair or just to me.\n  Now, let's look around the room. It is not as though this place is \njam-packed with people. It looks like we have kind of been abandoned. A \nfew hours ago we had all of us here and we were ready to vote on those \namendments. We could have had a lot of votes. We were told to expect \nvotes. I was hoping to have votes. I had a very important amendment on \nwhich I wanted to get a vote. It was a vote on an amendment to make \nsure the 40 percent of the border owned by the Federal Government could \nbe accessed by our own Border Patrol agents so they can do their jobs.\n  The Senator referred earlier to a problem we have had with our law \nenforcement personnel being told they can't do their jobs. This is one \nof those many instances where they can't. Forty percent of our border \nis owned by the Federal Government. I am sympathetic to this because \ntwo-thirds of the land in my State is owned by the Federal Government, \nand it is terrible because we can't access most of that land. We can't \neven walk on that land without saying ``Mother, may I.'' And most of \nthe time, to walk on it, it is like a sand trap on a golf course. You \nhave to walk in with a rake behind you. You rake your way in, rake your \nway out, and ask permission for everything you do. The border is kind \nof the same way. There are federally owned areas of the border. We have \nhuge stretches of border--40 percent of it--where they can't enforce \nthe law because it is owned by the Federal Government and there are \nenvironmental laws that prohibit these agents from doing their jobs.\n  It would be one thing if that actually protected the environment, but \nit doesn't because what happens is those same areas--those same \nenvironmentally sensitive, federally owned areas--are the ones illegal \nimmigrants most prefer when they choose to cross into this country. So \nwhat do we have? We have a long trail of litter and environmental \ndestruction in the areas where they cross through illegally.\n  This is just one of many amendments that have been filed, that are \nalready written, that we could have and should have been voting on and \nwe haven't been.\n  I have a dire prediction to make. I suspect when we come back next \nweek, we might be told, even though the place doesn't seem to be in any \nhurry right now, all of a sudden we will be in a hurry next week. So \nmuch so I fear we will be told we have to pass this bill now. It all \nhas to be passed now. We don't have time for any more of these pesky \namendments from these pesky Senators from all over this great country \nof the United States of America. We have to pass this now.\n  Well, we have had time to vote on other amendments, and we have \nsquandered that opportunity or we have had it squandered for us. The \nSenator from Alabama and I, and a number of others, have been ready to \nvote on our amendments--amendments that have been prepared for a long \ntime, that have been aired for the public to view for a long time--and \nwe haven't been allowed a vote. I have a problem with that.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, it is going to be that way, it does look like. We \nhave been talking about trying to find out what the plan is and what \nkind of process we can use to go forward, but the ability to get \namendments does seem to be slipping away. And there are a lot of \nexcuses and reasons, but all I would say is we are getting ready to \nvote on a huge important bill that will change immigration law in \nAmerica, and the American people deserve to have their Representatives \nfix it and make it better, if they can.\n  I truly think there will be no excuse if we get into a rush, as the \nSenator correctly predicts, I am afraid, next week. That will just \nslide by if we have\n\n[[Page S4777]]\n\nto pass the bill essentially as is, after the experts tell us it has \nall been fixed now.\n  So I just would ask the Senator about this border situation. Just as \na normal citizen, I would think if the U.S. Government wanted to have \nthe ability to work on the border and do things on the border, it would \nbe easier if the government already owned the land than if it were in \nthe hands of someone else. At a very minimum we ought to be able to \nprotect the border of the United States, our national sovereignty, in \nthat fashion. Not to even be able to use land the government already \nowns is pretty baffling to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  There is an order to recognize the majority leader at 8:30 p.m.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the previous \norder be extended; that is, that there be 1 additional hour for debate \nonly equally divided between the two parties; and that any quorum calls \nduring this period of time be charged to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the previous order said I would be \nrecognized when the time ran out. So I ask that it be the case that I \nbe recognized at 9:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, again, I thank the majority leader.\n  I have heard some talk tonight from some saying they wished there \nwould be votes.\n  I finally have given up handing long lists of amendments we are \nprepared to vote on to the Republican side, both Republican and \nDemocratic amendments. Each time, that was rejected. Most of them were \namendments with no controversy, Republican and Democratic alike, and \nwould have been accepted.\n  I think back to the debate we had in the Senate Judiciary Committee \nwhere we actually voted on amendments. We brought up 140 or so. All but \ntwo or three passed with bipartisan votes. About 40 Republican \namendments passed on bipartisan votes. Yet when it came onto the floor \nof the Senate, my friends on the other side, time and time again, \nobjected to bringing up amendments that would pass unanimously, both \nRepublican and Democratic.\n  I suppose in one case we have some who don't want any immigration \nbill, and others are probably waiting for a cloture vote.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask the time be equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the order.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we have another hour waiting now to get \nthis magic amendment we have been waiting for that is going to cause us \nall to be able to sleep well tonight, and everything is going to be \ntaken care of if the Hoeven-Corker amendment is blessed. Apparently, \nthey are running people into a secret room trying to get them to sign \nup to vote for it and vote for final passage and promising them some \ncorn, I guess, a Louisiana Purchase or something to try to line them up \nand get the system done.\n  But I would indicate that this side had agreed to about as many as 16 \namendments earlier. As this exciting new ``superamendment'' came along, \nit does seem what has happened is the train jumped the track. The \namendments we thought we would be voting on even later in the afternoon \ngot jumped off the track. Now we are all waiting on the favored \namendment, the amendment that everyone seems to think has to get \npreference over everybody else; whereas, we could be voting right this \nminute on many of the amendments. If we started voting on the ones that \nhad been agreed to and cleared on this side, I think we would even be \nfinished long before now.\n  I would look to Senator Lee.\n  Mr. LEE. It certainly would have been the case that had we started \nvoting earlier today, I think we could have gotten through the list.\n  I was surprised by what our friend from Vermont said a few minutes \nago, suggesting that Republicans have held up all this.\n  My understanding is that last night we were close to a unanimous \nconsent on a proposal to bring some 16 amendments to the floor for a \nvote. We were getting closer and closer to that.\n  It was at that point when the senior Senator from Louisiana came to \nthe floor and demanded that all of this cease, unless or until such \ntime as 27 amendments that she was pushing for not only would be \nbrought to the floor for a vote but be passed by unanimous consent.\n  It was a rather unusual request, from what I can tell. I am still a \nnew Senator. I have only been here 2\\1/2\\ years, but it seems to me to \nbe something that doesn't happen very often. But it certainly was a \ndifferent sequence of events than what was described by our friend from \nVermont a few minutes ago.\n  Look, we wanted amendments. Some of us have been working on this bill \nfor many months, and we have prepared amendments. We have had those \namendments. We have made them available to members of the public for a \nlong time so they can be reviewed. We just want to debate them, discuss \nthem, vote on them, and move on.\n  I suppose it is important that we proceed, with a matter of \nlegislation as important as this one--this very significant bill that \nwill affect many millions of Americans and will do so for many \ngenerations to come. It is important that we proceed with all \ndeliberate speed, meaning we proceed just quickly enough but not so \nquickly as to blow past important opportunities to consider every \noption, every possible amendment that needs to be brought forward.\n  So perhaps it is with that in mind that we have suspended things a \nlittle bit, we have slowed things down a little to wait for this one \namendment. I still don't understand why we couldn't have been voting on \nother amendments--amendments that are already written.\n  But still, just the same, if this is what we need to do--and the \nplace doesn't appear to be in any hurry--we can do it that way. I hope \nI can take that with some encouragement, as an encouraging indication \nthat this is how we are going to proceed on this bill because it is so \nimportant and that is perhaps some indication that next week we will \nstill be able to vote on other amendments, amendments that preceded the \nCorker amendment in time and in preparation--that we will still get \nvotes on those. Because if we are willing to wait this long for one \namendment that is just being written now, we ought to have those other \nvotes on other amendments that are ahead of it in time, that were filed \npreviously, that were made public much earlier.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think the Senator is making a valuable point. I don't \nbelieve there is any justification for the process stopping today.\n  I would say it is convenient to say to the press and the American \npeople: A big development has occurred. Everything is on hold. We are \ngoing to move this amendment. It is going to fix everything that you \nare concerned about.\n  That is part of the drive, the vision, the message being put out \nhere.\n  I suspect a number of Senators--maybe in the majority party \nparticularly--felt like they didn't want to vote on these 16 \namendments. Some of them would actually make the bill work better. Some \nof them have some tough law enforcement provisions in them, tough in \nthe sense they are fair and will work and actually tighten this system \nthat is so out of control, and they didn't want to vote on those \namendments. So I am sure maybe they complained to the distinguished \nmajority leader and others.\n  But all I know is that we were moving along. People were saying from \nthe other side let's get some votes. I said I am ready to vote. Let's \nvote. So agreements were being reached, and all of a sudden it \nstopped--on one favored amendment. That is what we are all focused on \ntoday.\n  I agree with Senator Lee that somehow all of us are supposed to be \nequal in this spot, that one Senator is not\n\n[[Page S4778]]\n\nsupposed to be better than the others, and we all ought to be able to \ncome to the floor and offer a legitimate amendment, debate it, and get \na vote.\n  Mr. LEE. I suppose in that respect all Senators are equal, but some \nare simply more equal than others. It is disturbing that happens from \ntime to time, when we discover that the equality that is supposed to \nserve as the hallmark of this institution, that is supposed to separate \nit from the House just down the hall from us and from other legislative \nbodies throughout the country and throughout the world is, perhaps, \nfaded a little bit in our public consciousness. Perhaps that is faded a \nlittle bit in the way it operates, but it should not be and we ought to \nbe able to restore it. We ought to be able to focus on the real, \npressing needs of this country.\n\n  Immigration reform is something I think every one of us can agree \nneeds to happen. There is not one Member of this body--at least not one \nof whom I am aware--who does not want real, robust immigration reform, \nnor do I believe there is one Member of this body who would dispute \nthat there is a real opportunity for broad-based bipartisan consensus \nwhen it comes to immigration reform. I think the best way we could \nachieve that is to start in those areas in which there is the most \nbroad-based bipartisan consensus.\n  I have yet to meet a single Senator or single Representative from \neither political party who is willing to say, for example, that we \ndon't need to bolster border security. Maybe such a Senator or maybe \nsuch a Representative exists. If that is the case, I have yet to meet \nthat Senator or that Representative. I have yet to meet a single \nSenator or Representative from either political party, by the same \ntoken, who has said we don't need to update and modernize our legal \nimmigration system, we don't need to review our visa programs--which, \nas I have said before, are sort of stuck in the Buddy Holly era. These \nare things we need to do, and I think we could pass bills dealing with \neach of those. I think we could pass both of them with overwhelming \nbipartisan consensus.\n  So that begs the question: Why, then, would you want to wrap those up \nand tie them up with the single most controversial element of \nimmigration reform, which deals with the pathway to legalization and \ncitizenship? Why do you suppose it is so important that we move \ndirectly to that?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It does raise a question. It has really not been \nproperly discussed. I believe my colleague makes a reference to the \ncitizenship path? Is that what the Senator said?\n  I have given a lot of thought to it over the years. In 2007 it was \ndiscussed. I reached a serious conclusion. Other people might disagree. \nThis is what I concluded. I concluded that after 1986, when every \nbenefit the Nation could give was given to people who came here \nillegally and it did not work and we had even more people come and \nenforcement never occurred, then really a great nation such as the \nUnited States, which is in a position to allow somebody legal status in \ntheir country, is not required to give every single benefit to somebody \nwho comes illegally as somebody who comes legally.\n  In fact, I believe it is very important, as a matter of principle, \nthat the United States say, based on our experience in 1986: You come \nto the United States lawfully, we will allow you to have a path to \ncitizenship; your children born here, they will be citizens. But if you \ndo not come lawfully, we might agree out of compassion, out of concern \nto allow you to live here the rest of your life and work and give you a \nSocial Security card and allow you to benefit in America, but you don't \nget everything. You don't get every honor this Nation can give if you \ndid not follow the law when you came here.\n  I think that is legitimate as a matter of principle, as a matter of \nfairness, as a matter of the Constitution and law. That is where I am \non that subject.\n  Mr. LEE. Perhaps it is for that reason that for many people the \npathway to citizenship component of this bill is perhaps the single \nmost contentious issue. I don't think there is any issue that even \ncomes close to the pathway to citizenship in terms of its ability to \ndivide Americans along partisan lines or along other ideological lines. \nIt makes me wonder why it is so important for us to pack this all in \none bill. Why do we need a single thousand-page bill? Why can't we pass \nthis in steps, especially when we come to an understanding of the fact \nthat if we do it in the proper sequence, much of the problem will be \neasier to resolve? Much of the problem will be more amenable to a more \nclear solution.\n  Many of those among us who are undocumented are here in an \nundocumented state not necessarily because they want to become \ncitizens, not necessarily because they want to live here in perpetuity. \nIn many instances I am told a lot of these people are here year in and \nyear out because they are afraid that if they leave and go home, they \nwill not be able to get back in.\n  But if we had updated and modernized our legal immigration system--if \nwe could do that, if we could get those laws implemented, I suspect a \nlot of those people would choose to be able to go back home to their \nhome countries, be with families and loved ones, knowing that the next \ntime they wanted to come back to the United States to work, they would \nhave a fair shot at doing it, that there would be a clear pathway for \nthem to apply for some kind of legal status coming into this country to \nwork for a time. If they had greater certainty that they would actually \nbe able to get back in, perhaps they would not choose to remain here \nyear in and year out. At that point, we might have a different \ncircumstance on our hands. Rather than 11 million people, perhaps the \nnumber would be different than that. I am not sure.\n  But one thing I do know is that if there is one way to make it more \ndifficult to enact immigration reform, if there is one way to make it \nless likely that we will have broad-based bipartisan consensus for \nimmigration reform, the one way to do that, the one way to ensure that \nit is going to be as contentious, as partisan, as difficult as possible \nis to fold it all into one, put it in a thousand-page bill and say: You \nhave to take all of it. You have to take every bit of it, all of it, or \nyou get none of it.\n  We are told in this town all the time that we have to compromise. It \nis interesting. I get a lot of phone calls in my office from \nconstituents. Some of those phone calls say: You need to compromise; \nmake sure you compromise. Other phone calls say: Never, ever, ever \ncompromise. Those in the first group are inclined to say: Compromise in \na box with a fox in the rain on a train--all kinds of things. Anytime \nyou get a chance to compromise, do it. But both sets of callers making \none point or the other are sort of missing the point. Compromise is not \nan end destination, it is not a substantive end in itself, it is a \nprocess.\n  In the case of a legislative body consisting of more than one person, \nit is an inevitability. The question is not where to compromise or \nwhether; the point of compromise is under what circumstance are you \nwilling to and, more importantly, under what circumstance are you not \nwilling to compromise.\n  If the objective is to find those areas where there is the greatest \npossibility of compromise, what we ought to be doing is passing a \nseries of bills in a proper sequence: one bill dealing with border \nsecurity; another perhaps dealing with an entry-exit system; another \ndealing with an update to our existing visa programs. In time, once \nthose things are passed and they have been implemented, I think we will \nbe in a much better position to achieve broad-based bipartisan \nconsensus.\n  On the vexing, difficult question of how best to treat the 11 million \nundocumented workers in this country in a manner that is both \ncompassionate and just, I think we can get there. I know we can. And I \nam equally certain that this bill--this bill that tries to lump \neverything into one, tries to ram the entire issue right through this \nbody--is not the answer. This is not how we are going to get \nimmigration reform.\n  If what you want to do is to stall out true immigration reform, then \nby all means put all your eggs in this basket right here. But if you \nwant real immigration reform, proceed with the step-by-step path. That \nis where you are going to get bipartisanship. That is where you are \ngoing to get compromise. In fact, that is where compromise is to be \nfound because that is where more people will get more of what they want \nout of government.\n  Would the Senator tend to agree with that analysis, that we would be \nbetter off with a step-by-step approach?\n\n[[Page S4779]]\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I really do. I think the American people would feel \nbetter about it. I remember after the immigration bill last time, and \nthe ObamaCare, Senator Lamar Alexander, one of our more respected \nMembers, said: We don't do comprehensive very well in the Senate. I \nthink that is right because these matters are so complex. For example, \nI have offered a very detailed amendment dealing with simply how the \nICE agents will have to identify and deport people they apprehend who \ncame in violation of the law. That is very difficult. We talked earlier \nabout the entry-exit visa system. We have been working on it for years. \nThe law requires it now. We simply need to go the last distance and get \nit done. But this bill backs away from it. It would take some time. It \nreally should be a separate piece of legislation to deal with the \nentire visa system.\n  Then you have how many people come and what skills they should bring \nand should they not be more merit-based. The bill claims to make \nprogress in that regard, but it is very--it is really not because the \nnonskilled percentage goes up even though we do have more skilled \nworkers. But the percentage still is out of whack because most people \nwill be coming without reference to their skills. That really needs a \nlot of time, thought, and effort.\n  Then the border itself is a complex issue.\n  Then, how should we best create a seasonal worker, guest worker \nprogram for our agricultural industry, which does need seasonal \nworkers? And we can create something that will work for them, but, boy, \nthat takes a lot of care too.\n  This bill says people come--many of them in these guest worker \nprograms--for 3 years with their family, and they get to stay another 3 \nyears and maybe another 3 years. Presumably, if they do not have a job, \nthey are supposed to go home. Do you think we are going to try to round \nup people and deport people who have been here for 6, 9 years, deport \nthem and send them home if they are out of work for a while? It just \ndoesn't sound like a practical solution. So a real temporary guest \nworker program, it seems to me, should be drafted with great care, and \nto the extent possible a person would come without family to do a \nspecific job and then return.\n  There are lots of other examples in the bill that should have \nfundamentally separate pieces of legislation, thoughtfully considered, \nwith law enforcement officers participating, economists being \nconsidered, and studies being conducted to see the best way to serve \nthe American interests. That should be our goal--serving the legitimate \nnational interests of America, including security. That could be the \nsubject of another bit of it, how to enhance our national security from \nterrorists and other dangerous people who would enter the country.\n  Mr. LEE. It is interesting. When I have individuals and groups come \nthrough my office telling me they would like me to support this bill, I \nask them, of course, why. Inevitably they will point to usually just \none or two of the countless provisions in this thousand-page bill. It \nis almost always because of one very discrete component within the bill \nthat they like. Perhaps they like the high-skilled visa reform. Perhaps \nthey like the low-skilled visa reform. Perhaps they like some piece \nhere or there. But it is always one or two very discrete provisions. \nThat is what caused them to say: I want you to vote for this thousand-\npage bill.\n  Inevitably I will ask them: Have you read the whole bill? If you \nhaven't read the whole bill, have you at least studied the whole bill? \nHave you studied each of the constituent parts? Have you studied the \nimplications of all the other provisions for which you would be asking \nme to vote?\n  Inevitably the answer is no. It is an unqualified, unapologetic no, \nand in many cases it is a no that is uttered in a way that makes me \nrealize they have not considered the question. I don't fault them for \nthat. Their job is not to legislate, their job is to advocate. In many \ninstances, they are advocates. In other instances, they are citizen \ngroups who are just expressing their opinions, and they have every \nright to do so. But my job is to legislate. Before I am asked to vote \nfor a bill, before I am going to vote yes on something to make it law, \nI have to read it. I have to understand it. And I have to like not just \none or two provisions, I have to be convinced that on balance this bill \nmakes sense for the American people and it will do considerably more \ngood than harm. At a minimum, it won't do more harm than good. I can't \nanswer that question that way with this bill. I just cannot get there.\n  So I invite all of the American people, anyone who might be hearing \nmy voice, to join me in this dialog, to join in this discussion. If you \nwant to be part of the immigration solution, read the bill. If you \ndon't want to read the whole bill, just study the whole bill. At least \nread a robust summary--not the cheerleading talking points put out by \nthe bill's principal advocates, but read a really robust synopsis that \ntells you how all the pieces connect together, and then tell me whether \nyou think I should vote for it.\n  Most of the time, if people do it that way, they are going to come at \nthis with a very different conclusion.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I had the pleasure to talk a little with Congressman \nGoodlatte, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and have \nfollowed some of the work they are doing over there. I think they are \ndoing exactly what the Senator has referred to.\n\n  The first piece of legislation they are working on--and they have a \nlarge number of experienced House Members who signed on to it: former \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, Lamar Smith of Texas, Jim \nSensenbrenner, and others such as Trey Gowdy, who was a Federal \nprosecutor for many years, so he understands the law. They have written \na bill that deals with the internal interior enforcement.\n  They heard from ICE officers, they heard from Border Patrol officers, \nand they studied the reality of the situation. They carefully worked \nthrough it, and they produced a piece of legislation that I believe \nwould be a tremendous asset to the effective enforcement of law in \nAmerica on the internal side--one of the aspects of reform that ought \nto be done right if we do reform at all. If we do a comprehensive \nreform, every part has to be done right.\n  They can't have a bucket, fix two holes, and leave three more or the \nwater will run out. I think that is where we go off base. If you bite \noff more than you can chew, it becomes a political thing.\n  So I am selling a vision. My vision is that my bill is going to end \nillegality, make everybody happy, make money for America, reduce our \ndeficit, and everybody should thank me. But the bill, as the Senator \nand I have studied it, doesn't do that. There are too many flaws in it \nbecause it is too big.\n  The Members who worked on this bill are busy Senators. They are \ninvolved in tax reform, they are involved in Libya and Syria, they have \ndefense issues, and all kinds of issues. They don't have time to \nrewrite the entire immigration law of America in a detailed, effective \nway all at one time. So that is what we have. We have a document that \nseeks to justify talking points, visions, images, and feel-good \napproaches.\n  The Senator from Utah is a good lawyer and the Senator knows that \nwhat is in the bill is what counts. Will the words actually and \neffectively accomplish what has been promised for it?\n  I was a Federal prosecutor for almost 15 years. My judgment tells me \nit will not work. It is not what has been promised, and we ought not to \nhave the American people saddled with a bill that promises good, but in \nreality is not good. So that is my fundamental concern about this.\n  Mr. LEE. That is one of the reasons why I think if we were to break \nit up into its constituent parts and debate and vote on each one as a \nseparate bill, I think the American people would be better served. I \nthink more of the American people would get more of what they want out \nof immigration reform if we were to do it that way.\n  So in many ways the people who come into my office and tell me: I \nwant you to support this bill, and I want you to support it because I \nlike section 345, or whatever section they are talking about, in a lot \nof ways they are making my point for me. We ought to address this one \npiece at a time, just as they are addressing it with me.\n  They are not really saying: I want you to vote for S. 744. I mean, \ntechnically, they are saying that; but in reality what they are saying \nis, I want you to vote for the section I like. That\n\n[[Page S4780]]\n\nis exactly what we ought to be doing. We ought to vote for the section \nthey like, and we ought to vote for it one section at a time, one piece \nat a time. We will be in a much better position if we do it that way.\n  I want to commend our chairman who is with us in the Chamber right \nnow. I commend him for the manner in which he conducted the markup \nwithin the Judiciary Committee.\n  After being in the Senate now for just 2\\1/2\\ years, I have been \ndisappointed at the number of instances in which we have debated, \ndiscussed, and ultimately voted on the bills on the floor without a lot \nof opportunities for amendments. Our chairman did a good job in the way \nhe ran the markup. We had countless opportunities to introduce \namendments, which our chairman allowed, and I appreciated that. I think \nhe did the right thing by opening that up and saying: Look, if you have \nan amendment, I, as the chairman of this committee, want to be sure you \nhave the chance to air your amendment. I think that is the way we ought \nto work here.\n  It is not the way things have been working here. Perhaps we can take \nsome hope in the fact that since things have slowed down for about 12 \nhours now with this one single amendment--perhaps that is an indication \nthat our friends in the majority are willing to slow down and give this \nthe time it needs to make sure we all have adequate time for our \namendments. Perhaps not to give this much time to all other amendments \nsomeone wants to write on the fly, but at a minimum it ought to mean we \nget enough time to vote on all of those amendments that were prepared \nbefore the Corker amendment came to be an issue.\n  Yet I fear and I worry a little bit that it might not mean that. I \nworry a little bit, based on what I have seen over the last 2\\1/2\\ \nyears, that come next week, we might all of a sudden transform from a \nvery sleepy Chamber, which we are now--practically vacant and moving \nvery slowly, if at all--to a Chamber that is being told we have to run \nas fast as we possibly can, that we have to pass this 1,000-page bill \nin haste, that there simply is not time to consider amendments that \nhave been prepared and aired publicly for weeks because we have to pass \nit right now.\n  We will not be given specific reasons as to why we have to pass it \nright now, but I fear we could be told we have to pass it this week, \nand it cannot wait a single additional week, it cannot wait a single \nadditional day. At that moment I hope we will remind our friends in the \nmajority--particularly our friend the majority leader--that on days \nlike today, the Senate was moving really slowly, and most of the time \nthe Senate was moving not at all.\n  I hope he will give us time to air the amendments that the American \npeople deserve to have considered fully.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, it is now 10 minutes after 9. We were told that \nthis special amendment that is going to fix everything in the bill \nwould be produced at 6 p.m. Apparently, Senators have been going out of \nthe secret room somewhere and being hot-boxed or had their arms twisted \nor given promises to get them to sign on to this new train that will \nmove rapidly forward. At least that is what it looks like to me.\n  What we are hearing is--and I don't doubt it--as soon as that \namendment is brought forth and filed tonight, some may ask: Why do you \nwant to file it tonight? Well, they want to file it tonight so they can \nfile cloture immediately. They want to file cloture so they can shut \noff debate immediately so they would be able to move the bill forward \nearly next week. So that is the process, and it is favoring one \namendment above everything else.\n  I am willing to look at it, and I look forward to receiving it, but \nit is almost past my bedtime. I normally would like to think I was \nheading to slumberland at this time, if not in the bed, and try to \nstart earlier around here in the mornings.\n  So here we are, waiting for the bill to be filed. Senators have gone \nhome for the most part. They have already gone home for the weekend. \nThere is no real business or votes going to occur, but they could have \nif we had started earlier today like the plans were, as I understood \nit.\n  I am uneasy, as is my colleague, that this place is not going to be \nrelaxed next week. I think the speed is going to pick up, and we are \ngoing to be told: We have to move, move, move, so there is not enough \ntime for your amendment. Sorry.\n  That is the pattern too often here, and we end up with just a piddly \nfew amendments that are not worthy of the great subject of this debate, \nand I am just sad about it. I thought for a while there we were going \nto really get into some amendments this week, and I thought it would be \nthe right thing. We will see what happens.\n  Mr. LEE. We will see, indeed. There have been just a couple of \noccasions when I have seen the Senate work as I think it should work \nand casting a lot of votes. That is how it is supposed to function. \nThat is the kind of body we all thought we were joining when we were \nelected to the Senate--a body that debates, discusses, and most \nimportantly, votes.\n  The legislative process doesn't mean a whole heck of a lot if all \nthat happens is we wait for just a few people to emerge from a back \nroom with a document that no one has read, and people are told to vote \nup or down on this, and this is the only vote we are going to get on \nthis issue, or this is one of only a small handful of votes we are \ngoing to get on this issue. It doesn't mean a whole lot.\n  When it means a whole lot is when we have an opportunity to cast a \nlot of votes and every Senator is given an opportunity to have an input \non a piece of legislation, every Senator is given an opportunity to \nexpress his or her mind, and to express the views, the concerns, the \nneeds, of his or her respective constituents from around the country.\n  Remember a few weeks ago when we were discussing the budget \nresolution, we stayed here all night. We stayed here until about 5:30 \nin the morning, as I recall, casting vote after vote after vote. It was \nexhilarating. It was refreshing. It was necessary. I thought: This is \nhow a republic is supposed to operate.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Constituents have a right to hold us accountable. It \nhas become the mood of the leadership--really of both parties--to \nprotect Members from tough votes. Members say: Of those 16 amendments, \nthere are 2 that I don't want to vote on because I will make somebody \nmad back home. But we are paid to vote. We are paid to be \nrepresentatives. We are paid to be accountable.\n  The American people ought to be able to hold us accountable, and if \nwe don't vote, they have a difficult time knowing what we are actually \ndoing up here. They have a difficult time of holding us accountable--as \nthey have a right to do in a democratic republic where elections \ncount--and they need to be able to judge us before they reelect us or \nvote us out of office. I think this is a big part of this trend to \navoid voting to protect Members.\n  Now Senator McConnell--a very experienced Senator who loves the \nSenate--used to always say that the burden of the majority was they \nhave to move legislation. They have to actually move bills, and that \nmeans they have to subject the bill to amendments on the floor and \nMembers have to vote. They have to be held accountable. There is no \navoiding it. That is what they have to do.\n  The majority has the responsibility--if they are going to be a leader \nand actually change the country and advance their agenda--they have to \nbring legislation to the floor, and traditionally then the Senator \nwould be subject to debate, criticism, and amendment. We have curtailed \nthat in a way that I don't think is healthy for the Republic, as well \nas making the legislation better, which can occur with votes and \namendments.\n  So I think the Senator has raised some valid points there.\n  Mr. LEE. I think that is an important observation my friend has made. \nIn so many ways, this practice that the Senator has described--a \npractice that results in minimizing rather than maximizing the number \nof votes we cast--has as its ultimate objective, not the enhancement of \nthe finished legislative product, but instead the perpetual protection \nof incumbency.\n  We were not chosen by our constituents just to come here and stay \nhere for as long as we possibly could. We were chosen by our \nconstituents to come here and to make law, and to make the law as good \nas we could possibly make it. We were brought here to\n\n[[Page S4781]]\n\nimprove it to the greatest extent of our ability regardless of the \nconsequences to us personally.\n  It is interesting what the Senator said just a few minutes ago. We \nare paid to vote. In a very real sense I think that is right. Wouldn't \nit be interesting if we were literally paid according to how many votes \nwe cast?\n  As a lawyer, the Senator is probably familiar with what may well be \nanecdotal, but some have suggested that one of the reasons why certain \ntypes of contracts in olden times were so long is that sometimes \nlawyers were paid not by the hour but by the word in a \ncontract. Sometimes, as a result, the vestigial remains persist to this \nvery day. They were so long because lawyers were trying to maximize \ntheir fee for the contract they were writing up. I am sure that wasn't \nhelpful to clients back then and it wasn't necessarily good for the \npractice of law, but it did result in a lot of words. I am sure if we \nwere paid according to each vote, if we got paid more for each vote we \ncast, we would be casting thousands and thousands of votes every single \nyear.\n\n  Don't get me wrong, I am not necessarily suggesting that is how it \nought to work. I am not necessarily suggesting that is a good way to \nrun things here. But at least in that circumstance, we would have an \nincentive to do what we were sent here to do, which is to vote. At \nleast in that respect, there would be something to offset what has \napparently become an instinct that is inherent in serving in this \nplace, an instinct which at least perhaps the majority shares or the \nmajority leader believes in, which is we should in some cases cast as \nfew votes as possible.\n  Look, we have known this was a problem for a long time. We have known \nwe have needed to fix our immigration system for a long time. We could \nhave been casting votes this entire week. We haven't. We could have \nbeen casting votes throughout much or all of last week and we didn't. \nSo I hope in the coming week we will cast a lot of votes and we will \nmore closely resemble the productive markup we had in the Judiciary \nCommittee thanks to our chairman who has now joined us on the floor.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for debate goes until 9:30. The \nSenator from Vermont has 13 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer and my \nneighbor.\n  I thank the Senator from Utah for his kind words about the markup in \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee. As he knows, we had some 300 amendments \nbefore the committee and I brought them up and had them all filed \nonline a week and a half prior to our committee meeting. I called them \nall up one by one, Republicans and Democrats. We debated them and voted \non them. But the difference between what we were able to do in the \ncommittee--incidentally, we voted on something like 140 or so \namendments. About 40 of them were Republican amendments that were \naccepted. Of the 140 amendments accepted, all but 2 or 3 were accepted \nwith both Democratic and Republican votes. Then we passed the \nimmigration bill by a bipartisan majority. The difference is people \ncooperated when we would bring them up.\n  I have given the Republicans a list of 20 or 30 amendments, both \nRepublican and Democratic amendments, most of which could be accepted \nby voice vote, if they would allow us to bring them up. There are \nactually 29 of them. They won't let us bring them up. Talk about \nregular order in voting.\n  We have Begich amendment No. 1285 regarding the Social Security \nAdministration. We have Cardin-Kirk No. 1286, providing social service \nagencies the resources to help holocaust survivors. We have Carper-\nHoeven-Pryor No. 1408, preventing unauthorized immigration transiting \nthrough Mexico. We have Carper-Coburn No. 1344, establishing a DHS \noffice of statistics; amendment No. 1255, as modified; a Coats \namendment No. 1288, changing alternatives to detention programs. We \nhave Feinstein-Kirk No. 1250, authorization for the use of the CIR \ntrust fund; Hagan No. 1386, reauthorizing the bulletproof vest \nprogram--something that began as a bipartisan bill, Ben Nighthorse \nCampbell, a Republican from Colorado and myself. We have Heinrich No. \n1342, extending hours of operation at port of entry in Santa Teresa, \nNM; another requiring DHS to submit a report to Congress on how the 10 \nairport biometric exit pilots impact wait times. We have Kirk-Coons No. \n1239, allows certain naturalization requirements be waived for U.S. Air \nForce active-duty members to receive military awards; Klobuchar-Coats, \nadoption amendment; a Landrieu No. 1338 about E-Verify; Landrieu-\nMurkowski No. 1302, public-private partnerships expanding land ports of \nentry; Landrieu-Cochran No. 1383, requires reports on EB-5 programs. We \nhave Landrieu No. 1341, requiring DHS to attempt to reduce detention \ndaily bed rate; Leahy-Hatch No. 1183, and I mention that one only \nbecause it is cosponsored by the senior Democrat and the senior \nRepublican. Leahy No. 1454, a technical amendment; Leahy No. 1455, EB-5 \nclarification; Murray-Crapo No. 1368, prohibiting the shackling of \npregnant women absent extraordinary circumstance in all DHS detention \nfacilities. Gosh, there is one we can pass unanimously. We have Nelson \nNo. 1253, providing additional resources for maritime security; Reed \n1223, increasing the role of public libraries in the integration of \nimmigrants; Schatz-Kirk No. 1416, GAO report on visa processing; \nShaheen-Ayotte No. 1272, expands the INVEST visa program; Stabenow-\nCollins No. 1405, requiring a number of administrative changes; Tom \nUdall No. 1241, expanding the Border Enforcement Security Task Force; \nTom Udall No. 1242, $5 million available to strengthen border \ninfectious disease surveillance.\n\n  We have a few others. These are all totally noncontroversial, both \nRepublican and Democrat. Normally--and I hate to sound like here is the \nway we did it in the old days, but normally on a bill of this \ncomplexity, we take all the noncontroversial Republican and Democratic \namendments, lump them together, voice vote them, and then start voting \non the controversial ones.\n  There is the list we gave the other side. We said they are all \nnoncontroversial, can't we accept them? It takes 10 minutes, 20 \nminutes, to do a unanimous consent request and accept them all. They \nsaid no. They said, We have to have controversial amendments. Well, why \nnot do the noncontroversial ones and then set up a time for boom, boom, \nboom, controversial ones. We did it in the committee and it worked.\n  I see my colleague from Utah. I will yield to him without losing my \nright to the floor.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, if I may ask my friend from Vermont, we would \nlove to see us move forward. Why don't we both propose three of our \nrespective side's top amendments, come up with a unanimous consent \nagreement right now, and there would be six amendments we could take up \nfor a vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would say to the distinguished Senator from Utah, I made \nsuch suggestions to the Republican side. They were unable to accept it, \nor unwilling. That was not objected to by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Utah but by some on his side who have said they won't accept any \nagreement, and that is why we are here.\n  It makes me think when the distinguished Republican came to the floor \nand asked the majority leader: What is holding up the judge from my \nState?\n  The leader said: Every single Democrat is prepared to vote for your \njudge.\n  And we said, Let's have a unanimous consent and let's bring up the \njudge that the Republican Senator asked for and we will have a vote on \nit right now. Now, to his credit, that Republican Senator was perfectly \nwilling to, but he was told no by his leadership. And weeks and months \nand a long time later we finally voted on that judge. I think it was a \nunanimous vote.\n  But we have cleared every one of the amendments I have talked about, \nRepublicans and Democrats. There are 28 or 29 amendments. If we are \nreally serious, let's pass them all and then take whatever is left that \nis controversial and take them up one by one. I am happy to vote all \nnight long, all day tomorrow, an hour equally divided on each vote. But \nthe fact is, with the distinguished majority leader's concurrence, we \nproposed 29 or more amendments that could be done in 2 minutes and we \nwere told by the other side they\n\n[[Page S4782]]\n\ndon't want to bring up any of these amendments.\n  We have to understand, a majority of Senators in both parties--we had \n84 who voted for cloture--want to finish this bill. The fact is there \nare a small number on the other side who want no immigration law and \nthey will try to stall it forever.\n  I talked about us all being here in December singing Christmas \ncarols. I hope we can avoid that for two reasons. One, it would be a \nterrible way to legislate. Secondly, now that we have TV coverage in \nthe Senate--something that wasn't here when I came here--for the \nAmerican people to be subjected to my singing voice, it would be cruel \nand unusual punishment. I believe it is something that is prohibited by \nthe Constitution. And as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I \nwould hate to be the one to violate the Constitution by inflicting such \ncruel and unusual punishment.\n  So I would suggest as an alternative we listen to the distinguished \nmajority leader, the senior Senator from Nevada: Get an agreement, go \nforward, vote on all of these things, avoid my friend from Utah and \nothers having to hear me sing Christmas carols as we wrap this thing \nup, and do as we did in the Judiciary Committee.\n  I think it was about this time, the Senator from Utah may remember, \nor maybe it was a little bit earlier than this, the last evening we \nwere voting and we finished. I had provided so-so pizza in the back \nroom. I think some liked it, some didn't, but it encouraged everybody \nto finish and we finished. We passed out a bill to the floor.\n  I see the distinguished majority leader has arrived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. The hour of 9:30 being momentarily here, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the prior agreement that was in effect the last hour be \ncontinued for another hour until 10:30. It means I will be recognized \nat 10:30, that we will--this will be for debate only, the time will be \ndivided between the two sides, and that any quorums called during the \nhour will be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, before we wrap up, we were told that \nthis special amendment--the one with the highest priority that the \nleadership all seems to think is so valuable--would be filed at 6 \no'clock. Now it is 9:40 p.m. and we still have not seen it. Perhaps \nthey are adding special clauses in to get special Senators' votes \nbefore they file it. But I suspect it will be done tonight because the \nplan, obviously, is to file cloture on it immediately and try to move \nit to a vote as soon as possible.\n  I want to conclude my remarks tonight on one subject. The American \npeople are good and decent people. They believe in immigration. They \nhave always supported immigration in this country. But they have been \ndemanding, pleading, praying for this government to develop a good and \ndecent system of immigration that serves our national interests and \nmakes them proud. And for 30, 40 years we have had a situation in which \npeople have been coming in massive numbers illegally, and it is not \nright. The American people are not happy about it. They are angry with \ntheir politicians.\n  I remember saying in 2007 that the people were not mad at immigrants. \nThey were mad at those of us in Congress and in the White House and in \nthe departments and agencies of government for not doing our jobs.\n  That is what they are angry about. I saw a poll not long ago that \nsaid 88 percent of the people said they were angry at Congress and only \n12 percent said they were angry at people who entered the country \nillegally. I think that is where the American people are. So we \npromised and promised and promised that we would pass legislation that \nwould end the illegality and that we would make the American people \nproud of the system we have. It has not happened.\n  So this amendment claims it has 700 miles of fencing in it, according \nto the newspapers, although we have not seen the amendment that is \nabout to be here. It was not in the original bill. But now, after it \nran into tough sledding--people started reading it, and it began to \nsink in popularity with the people and with Members of the Senate--they \ncame up with, they say, a bill that adds fencing in it. Not long ago \nthey were saying it was stupid to have a fence. Now we have an \namendment that says 700 miles of fencing. Well, let share a thought or \ntwo about that.\n  In 2007, 2008, we passed bills to build fences--700 miles. I was one \nof the main sponsors. I think I was the sponsor of 700 miles of double-\nwide fencing. Eventually, it came out of the House, I believe. We did \nnot have money in our appropriations bill to pay for it. We had voted \nfor having a fence, but they did not put up the money. We complained \nabout that and complained about that, so they got embarrassed, and I \nremember saying: Boy, isn't this clever? You go home and say you voted \nto authorize a fence, and when it came time to put money up, you did \nnot vote for it. So we put up the money, actually agreed to fund it.\n  Oh, then they decided: Well, we did not really want to build a fence. \nWe would have a virtual fence. I believe Senator McCain said the other \nnight that we spent $800-and-something million on a virtual fence that \nnever worked. Every bit of it had to be abandoned--some high-tech \nscheme--and the fence never got built. This was in 2008.\n  Now, the first bill comes forward, they claim they had fencing in it. \nBut when you read the bill, do you know what it said? Secretary \nNapolitano was supposed to send forward a plan for fencing--a plan for \nfencing. But the truth is that Secretary Napolitano is on record \npublicly--more than once--saying she did not think we needed any \nfencing. So what kind of plan was she going to submit under this bill?\n  So we mocked that, made fun of it. But that was their goal. The goal \nwas to pass an immigration bill that pretended to say we are going to \nbuild barriers and fencing at the border and not have it in there. That \nis what the plan was when they offered the bill. But after it hit tough \nsledding, now we have 700 miles. But it is single fencing, not double, \nand that is not nearly as good because a person can penetrate a single \nfence and get by pretty quickly, but if they have to do double-fencing, \nthey have a real problem, and you can run a government vehicle on a \nroadway between them, and it is very effective.\n  That was done fundamentally in San Diego a number of years ago. San \nDiego's area at the border was lawless--drugs, crime, degradation of \nreal estate values, and it was just awful.\n  They built a good, solid double fence. All of a sudden property \nvalues went up, crime dropped, and the area is doing so much better \ntoday. So the fences in these kinds of areas are not damaging. Fences \ncan make things better. As they say sometimes, good fences make good \nneighbors.\n  I am not impressed with that so much. I do think it is important for \nus to ask ourselves will it actually get built this time if we pass it. \nI have my doubts because they do not have the trigger on it, as I \nunderstand from the reports; the trigger being you do not get the \namnesty until you get the fence built. Then you might get some fencing.\n  Senator Thune offered a good amendment. Senator Thune's amendment \nsaid, before we give the first bit of amnesty, we should build at least \n350 miles of the double fencing. Then the other 300 has to be built \nafter that. That was voted down. But after the bill got in trouble, now \nthey have 700 miles in there of at least a single fence.\n  So that is the why this process has worked. I believe the American \npeople are absolutely right to be unhappy with their government because \nwe have not served them well. They have asked us and pleaded with us to \nproduce a legal system of immigration to end the illegality, and we \nhave failed time and time again to do that which they have asked us to \ndo. That is the truth. I have been here. I have seen the amendments.\n  What happens time and again is amendments that do not make much\n\n[[Page S4783]]\n\ndifference but sound good, do not work. They pass. But you put up an \namendment that would actually have a substantial impact, such as \nactually building substantial fencing, and it goes down. It gets voted \ndown. It is almost unbelievable. But I have seen it. My first \nexperience of that was when I learned that people who come for visa \noverstays--it is not same kind of crime that crossing a border is. It \nis a civil penalty of some kind.\n  Some people have contended--I do not think correctly because I did a \nlaw review article on it--they have concluded, I don't think correctly, \nthat the local police who apprehend somebody for drunk driving or \nspeeding, they find they are here illegally as a result of a visa \noverstay, and they cannot hold them. They have to let them go, and they \ncannot turn them over to Federal law enforcement officers.\n  So I offered an amendment to make it a misdemeanor to overstay your \nvisa. It does not have to be long. But we need to clarify any confusion \nthat arises from that subject. I thought everybody was going to pass \nit, until, lo, they figured it out. Someone who was watching the \nlegislation said: Wait a minute. If you pass that, it will help them \napprehend and deport people. You cannot pass that. All of a sudden the \nopposition arose and it went down. That would have worked. It would not \nhave cost us any money. It would have given greater power to do the \nright thing to the law enforcement community. Boom, it went down.\n  So under President Bush, he reluctantly came along and got more \nfavorable to a lawful system of immigration. After his bill failed, he \nagreed to establish a 287(g) program. Governor King may be familiar \nwith that. It was a situation in which local law enforcement officers, \npeople who work in prisons, people at the State trooper headquarters \nand other officers could go to a Federal training for up to 2 weeks, or \nmaybe more than that, and they would then be trained to properly help \nthe Federal officers do their duty with regard to people who entered \nthe country illegally.\n  President Bush signed off on it. The program was growing. It was very \npopular. Alabama was one of the States that sent people to be trained \nbecause we did not want to violate anyone's rights. President Obama has \nbasically killed it. They basically ended the program. I will just say \nto my colleagues, if we do--and at some point I think we will provide \nlegal status for millions of people who are in our country illegally in \na compassionate way and try to do what we can--be generous to them, \neven though they violated the law. If we do that, are we not going to \nhave the ability to enforce the law for somebody in the future who \ncomes illegally?\n  Is that where we are heading? Because if we do not fix interior \nenforcement, we are not ever going to be able to do that. We have a \nlarger and larger number each year coming legally by visa and \noverstaying. Some 40 percent now of the immigrants illegally in our \ncountry are here by virtue of overstaying their visa after coming \nlegally. So what do you do about that?\n  We have to have a system in which we welcome the assistance of State \nand local law officers. They are not entitled to prosecute people. They \nare not entitled to deport people. That can only be done by Federal \njudges and Federal officers. But they have always been able to take \nsomebody who came in across the border illegally, detain them, and then \nturn them over to the Federal officers for deportation. They do not \nwant that to happen.\n  This has been blocked systematically. Groups such as La Raza have \nmade this a high priority. Members of the Senate have responded every \ntime they have asked for help and blocked all legislation that would in \nany way advance the ability of good State law officers to assist the \nFederal Government in enforcing the law. A State law officer can arrest \na bank robber and turn him over so they can be prosecuted in Federal \ncourt for bank robbery. They can arrest them on any misdemeanor and \nturn them over to the Federal Government. They can arrest them on \nillegal immigration charges and turn them over to the Federal \nGovernment. There is no doubt about that.\n  But the government will not take them, will not come and get them. \nAsk your local officers what happens if they arrest somebody they know \nis in the country illegally. They will tell you nothing happens. ICE \nofficers are undermanned. They have policies and rules that do not even \nallow them to come out and participate. Nobody is participating in the \njoint Federal-State 287(g) training program anymore. This is over.\n  In fact, what we have is the Attorney General of the United States \nsuing States that want to be helpful to the Federal Government and try \nto enforce Federal law. So this is the area to which we have sunk. This \nis how far we have gotten away from having integrity in the legal \nprocess of immigration. The American people are not happy. I hope they \nare watching this debate because I have spent a lot of time looking at \nthis, this legislation, 1,000 pages.\n  Who knows what this amendment will be tonight, how many more pages \nwill be added. It will not accomplish what the American people have \npleaded with Congress to do. It is focused overwhelmingly, totally has \nbeen focused on getting the amnesty first, even though they told us it \nwould be enforcement first. They have to admit it is amnesty first. \nThat is what it is and then a promise of enforcement in the future.\n  So that is where we are. I wish we could do better. I know we can do \nbetter. We can make the border lawful. We can make the entry-exit visa \nsystem lawful. We can make the workplace E-Verify system serve the \nnational interests and make it much harder for illegal workers to get \njobs.\n  Remember, under the bill, we will legalize the people who are here \nillegally. We are talking about people coming here in the future. Are \nwe going to allow them to get jobs? Are we not going to allow ICE to do \ntheir job in the future? Are we not going to empower them? Oddly, all \nof the resources are going to the border but none to deal effectively \nwith the visa overstays.\n  The Congressional Budget Office that analyzed the bill and gave us a \nreport 2 days ago, the CBO report says this legislation that we have \nheard is so marvelous will only reduce the number of people entering \nthe country illegally by 25 percent. Can you believe that? Just 25 \npercent. That is unthinkable, especially after we have been hearing the \ngreat promises of how effective it is.\n  I wonder about that. One of the concerns CBO expresses, the experts \nwhom they have who do the best they can, one of the concerns they \nexpress is one I have been talking about since this legislation has hit \nthe floor: We are going to see a great increase in visa overstays if, \nfor no other reason, there are going to be twice as many people coming \nto America on visas to work under this bill for temporary periods of \ntime than there are today.\n  Many of them are not going home when they are supposed to go home. \nThat is what the numbers show. Many of them in these programs will come \nwith their families, be able to stay several years, and then they are \nasked to go home. Fewer of them are going home. They may have children \nin junior high school. They are not going to go home when the law says, \nunfortunately. That is the experience we have been seeing. They could \ngo home. They should have every moral obligation to go home, every \nlegal obligation to go home.\n  A very fine lawyer here wrote a piece I was pleased to read recently. \nIt was the editor of the Yale Law Review, a marine. He said: We tell \nour soldiers to go and they go. We tell them, go to Iraq in harm's way, \n1 year, 15 months, 18 months, and they go. What do you mean, someone \ncomes to America for 1 year should not be made to follow the commitment \nand the contract we signed? We make our soldiers do it. We are in some \nsort of deal here. We cannot expect anybody to follow the law. But my \nexperience, and the experience I have seen over the years with \nimmigration is a large number of people are not complying with the law. \nWe can expect that to happen.\n  So we are going to see a large increase in visa overstays. It is \ngoing to be more than the border--over illegal entries at the border. \nThat is going to be a larger and larger part of the problem. CBO \nbasically found that in their recent report. I think that is truly \naccurate.\n  This legislation comes nowhere close to fixing it. The key to it is \nan entry-\n\n[[Page S4784]]\n\nexit visa. Current law requires that there be an entry-exit biometric \nvisa that covers air, sea, and land ports. This bill eliminates the \nbiometric fingerprint requirement--eliminates that and says it only has \nto be effective at air and seaports and not land ports.\n  This bill is dramatically weaker than current law. We passed six \npieces of legislation calling for entry-exit visa systems over the last \ndecade. Never been done. So why should we have enforcement first? That \nis the reason. We pass a law to build a fence, it does not get built. \nWe pass a law repeatedly that says, let's have an entry-exit visa \nsystem. It does not get built. It does not occur.\n  So we need to put the heat on the people who run this government, \nincluding us, to make sure that if we pass something it is going to \nactually occur. That is why there has been a broad consensus. There \nneeds to be a requirement that enforcement occur before legality \noccurs. That is why the sponsors were originally saying their bill was \nenforcement first. There is every reason for the American people to \ndoubt that this Nation will follow through on those commitments.\n  I am concerned about where we are. I am pleased with the way the \nHouse is proceeding. They are moving step by step taking individual \nparts of our immigration problem and fixing them.\n  The first one they are dealing with is interior enforcement. I have \ntaken a good bit from their bill, and I have an amendment pending. It \nwill be hugely beneficial to the ability of our ICE officers to enforce \nlaw in the United States and help bring this whole system under \ncontrol. It is a very large part of what we do. I am not sure we will \never get a vote on it. I think I was in the 16 amendments that were \ngoing to be approved for a vote.\n  What is happening? Everything was put on hold today waiting for the \nfavorite amendment. It was supposed to be here at 6 o'clock. Now it is \n10 p.m. We still haven't seen it. When are we going to get it? Well, \nhow long will it be? What all will they have in it? We don't know, but \nit is not going to be a pristine document, I can tell you that.\n  My staff and I intend to look at it. We are going to evaluate it, and \nwe are going to see if it solves all the immigration problems. We are \ngoing to find out if it is great, and we can go home and go to bed at \nnight and know this problem has been fixed. That is what we are being \ntold, but I don't think it is going to show that. Why? Because this \nbill doesn't, and they said it did. They said it fixed all the \nproblems, but it does not.\n  They said they didn't believe in a fence. They said the Senator said \nit was stupid to have a fence. Now all of a sudden we have 700 miles of \nfence.\n  They said Senator Cornyn was overreaching. He wanted 5,000 new border \nagents. Now the bill gets in trouble and they come in with 20,000 \nborder agents and say it is paid for. There is plenty of money to pay \nfor all of this, $30 billion, this article says it is going to go for \nthat. If it was actually needed and it would work out, I would help \ndeal with that.\n  I have my doubts that this is the best way to spend our money. I \nthink this is a political response to a failing piece of legislation, a \ndramatic, desperate attempt to pass a dramatic piece of amendment so \nthey can say it does everything you want and more.\n  We will see. Hopefully it does improve the border. Again, the border \nis just one part of the overall failure of our immigration system.\n  The right thing for America to do is to continue to welcome \nimmigrants, to have a legal system that is based on the national \ninterests of America, very much like Canada, where they give points. If \nyou are younger, you get points. If you have more education, you get \npoints. If you speak the language, you get points. If you have special \nskills, you get points. You get points for that.\n  I think a majority, maybe 60 percent of Canadian immigration, is \nbased on a merit-based competitive system. People apply, and the ones \nwho are most qualified, the ones who are going to be likely to be the \nmost successful in Canada, are the ones who get admitted--not the ones \nthat aren't able to speak the language, who don't have skills that \nCanada needs, and who are going to struggle in Canada.\n  Why shouldn't you choose the ones who have the best opportunity to be \nsuccessful? This is so basic. We were told this is a move to merit-\nbased immigration.\n  We have done an analysis of that. I did a speech on it. They said \nthey were moving away from brothers and family connections, and they \nwere going to have a merit-based system. We have looked at it. About 10 \nto 15 percent of the total flow is based on this merit-based system.\n  Then we looked at the details of it in this long 1,000 pages. Clever \npeople had written it. If you are two children, two young people in \nHonduras or Argentina who wish to come to America, one of them has a \nbrother in America, one of them has dropped out of high school, does \nnot speak English, has not held a job before, and has no real skills, \nthe other one was valedictorian of his high school class, he has 2 \nyears of college, speaks English well, studied hard, and is preparing \nhimself to come to America. Let's say he has 4 years, a college degree. \nUnder this merit-based point system, the brother gets 10 points and the \nyoung man with the college degree gets 5. It is chain migration by \nanother name. It takes a master's degree to get as many points as \nhaving a brother in the United States. We were told we were going to \nmove away from that and more to an honest and competitive system. Even \nthat small part of the bill that focuses on a merit-based, point-based \nsystem has huge advantages for people with family connections, and very \nlarge advantages for people who come from countries that do not have \nmany people come to America. They get points and things of that nature \nthat don't make much sense, frankly.\n  I am hopeful the legislation that we are going to have filed tonight, \nat least we have been promised it will be filed tonight, will enhance \nenforcement at our border. I am going to read it carefully to make sure \nit does. Then I am going to be looking very carefully to see if it \nimproves all the other flaws in this system. If it doesn't, I am not \nimpressed. If it doesn't make this system one that is likely to work, I \nam not impressed. That is not enough, to fix one part of the system.\n  Finally, let me close by saying what the Congressional Budget Office, \nour own best advisers on economic matters, told us 2 days ago in their \nreport. This is what they said. They said this legislation that is \nbefore us today will reduce the amount of illegal immigration by only \n25 percent, not what we were promised, only 25 percent.\n  They said this legislation that is before us today will reduce the \naverage wage of Americans in this country, reduce wages at a time when \nwages have been declining regularly. They have said if passed, this \nbill before us today, and unlikely to be changed by the Corker-Hoeven \namendment, would increase unemployment. It would make more people out \nof work, make more people go on unemployment compensation, go on food \nstamps, go on SSI, and maybe go on disability if they can get it, \nbecause they can't find a job. We will have this very large flow of \nworkers into our country, beyond I think what the country can absorb at \na time of high unemployment. Wages will go down. Unemployment will go \nup. Illegality in this system is only marginally reduced.\n  I don't think that is a bargain. I don't see how we can go to our \nconstituents and say that is what we are going to pass. I really don't \nthink so.\n  Let's don't do this, colleagues. Let's stop and push back here. Let's \nlet the House proceed, as they seem to be doing. Let's send our bill \nback to committee and consider some of these issues such as will it \nhelp people get jobs or will it hurt people's ability to get jobs. Will \nit help their wages go up or will their wages go down. If it is pulling \nwages down, why are we doing it? This is where I think we are. I \nbelieve it ought to be reviewed, reviewed carefully. The American \npeople need to know what is happening here. They are going to have to \nwatch what happens because there is a politically correct movement in \nthis body to move this bill out for all kinds of reasons unrelated to \nthe substance of the legislation.\n  We are here to pass legislative substance, not some political vision, \nnot some scheme to get votes. That is what we need to be doing. We are \nnot doing that effectively, in my opinion.\n\n[[Page S4785]]\n\n  This legislation is defective. It should not be passed, and I am \nconfident tonight, if we get an amendment that deals with the border, \nit still will leave huge parts of this legislation defective and \nunworthy of support.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I urge all Senators who say that deficit \nreduction is important to them to join us and support the Border \nSecurity, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Act as \nreported by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Our bill will help us \nachieve nearly $1 trillion in deficit reduction according to the \nestimation of the Congressional Budget Office, CBO.\n  To those Senators who are interested in growing our economy, I say \njoin us and support this bill that CBO expects will lead to hundreds of \nbillions of dollars of economic activity, and help increase our gross \ndomestic product by 5.4 percent when its full impact is reached over \nthe next 20 years. If we are able to pass and implement a fair program \nreflective of American values, the beneficial economic impact should be \neven better. I think passing comprehensive immigration reform is the \nright thing to do and will be good for the economy and the country.\n  One of the themes of the Senator from Alabama throughout committee \nconsideration of the bill and now before the Senate is his contention \nthat bringing undocumented people out of the shadows and into the \neconomy as full participants will hurt the wages of American workers at \nthe lowest end of the pay scale. I disagree because I believe that \nwages are already being depressed by the reality that undocumented \nworkers are often forced to work for subminimum pay and that already \ndepresses wages and job opportunities for other American workers.\n  The recent CBO report uses conservative assumptions to estimate that \nonce immigration reform is implemented, average wages would actually \nincrease and be one-half of 1 percent higher than they would be if we \ndid not pass it. That is their estimate of the longer term impact of \nthe legislation.\n  It is also notable, if not surprising, that opponents of \ncomprehensive immigration reform focus on isolated numbers without \nacknowledging the overall impact of the bill. Senators need to remember \nthat CBO has estimated that the bill will decrease Federal deficits by \nnearly $1 trillion when implemented.\n  Moreover, the CBO report explains that the limited period in which \naverage wages are estimated to be slightly lower is ``primarily because \nthe amount of capital available to workers would not increase as \nrapidly as the number of workers.'' It concludes, however, that ``the \nrate of return on capital would be higher under the legislation . . . \nthroughout the next two decades.''\n  Further, CBO expressly notes that it does not mean to imply what \nopponents contend; namely, that current U.S. residents would be worse \noff, on average, under the legislation. Finally, CBO concludes that the \nlegislation would result in raising the productivity of both labor and \ncapital and boost the amount of capital investment in this country.\n  That is not what the Senator from Alabama said on Wednesday \nafternoon. Instead, he incorrectly asserted a number of points. In \nparticular, he said that the CBO report indicates that the \ncomprehensive immigration reform legislation ``will reduce the wages of \nAmerican citizens.'' That is not true. The CBO report does not say \nthat. I wish the Senator from Alabama were more precise in his analysis \nand his statements.\n  The CBO cost estimate and report go out of their way to note that the \ninitial estimate is on ``average wages'' and ``do[es] not imply that \ncurrent U.S. residents would be worse off, on average, under the \nlegislation.'' The estimate is a ``difference between the averages of \nall U.S. residents under the legislation.''\n  The report continues to clarify that ``the additional people who \nwould become residents under the legislation would earn lower wages, on \naverage, than other residents, which would pull down the average \nwage.'' That does not mean that current U.S. citizens will be paid any \nless than they are currently making or be worse off, which is what the \nSenator from Alabama was implying.\n  Here is what I think this all means. Those coming out of the shadows, \nwho had been exploited and working for less than even minimum wage, \nwould as registered provisional immigrants be expected to make more \nthan they had been making.\n  Adding them to the work force would nonetheless mean that ``average \nwages'' for the working population would be slightly lower at the \noutset of the implementation period. Average wages do not mean that any \nAmerican citizen's wages will be ``reduce[d],'' which is what the \nSenator from Alabama said. He made it sound like passing the bill will \nmean a pay cut for citizens. That is not true.\n  Moreover, the Senator from Alabama either stopped reading or stopped \ncaring when the report went on to say that average wages would increase \nthereafter. The report goes on to say that ``over time, as capital \ninvestment increased,'' ``average wages would be higher than under \ncurrent law.'' Opponents of the bill should stop trying to use scare \ntactics and misleading statements to stir up emotional reactions \nagainst the bill and against the undocumented immigrants we should be \nencouraging to come out of the shadows and fully join American life.\n  America protects the most vulnerable among us, which include \nsurvivors of domestic violence and human trafficking, as well as \npregnant women, and children. I am proud to report that there are \nstrong protections in this bill for the treatment of kids caught in the \nbroken immigration enforcement system.\n  I know that some may want to punish the 11 million undocumented \npeople currently living here in the shadows, and the bill specifically \ncontains a steep financial penalty for that purpose. The undocumented \nalso need to go to the back of the line and take classes to learn \nEnglish, but those tough steps are not enough for those who oppose the \nbipartisan bill.\n  While some may want to look like they are being even tougher on the \nundocumented population, we all need to consider how further punitive \nmeasures may deter people from coming out of the shadows. When kids and \npregnant women are put at risk by an urge to punish millions of people \nwho are trying to make a better life for their families, we do not live \nup to our American values and we do not make this a safer country.\n  I oppose amendments to deny or delay protections for the millions of \npeople who will apply for Registered Provisional Immigrant status. If \nwe are talking about programs that literally feed the hungry or provide \nvaccinations to children, we hear lectures about how we cannot afford \nthose programs in the current fiscal environment. It is a cruel irony \nthat when some on the other side of the aisle consider programs that \nhelp kids who live near the poverty line, they raise fiscal concerns, \nbut they have no problems with massive Government expenditures on \nfencing and expensive visa exit technology and programs.\n  The bill we are considering prohibits immigrants in Registered \nProvisional Immigrant status from access to any Federal means-tested \npublic benefit programs throughout their time in provisional status.\n  In addition, as a result of the Personal Responsibility and Work \nOpportunity Reconciliation Act, even qualified Legal Permanent Resident \nimmigrants must wait an additional 5 years after they are legalized to \nreceive any safety net protections. Most immigrants who are working \ntheir way through the path to legalization will have to wait anywhere \nfrom 13 to 15 years before having any access to safety net programs. \nGiven the penalties and fines they have to pay, it is wrong to further \ndeny these low-income families protections that some may desperately \nneed.\n  I have seen similarly harmful amendments on the issues of the Earned \nIncome Tax Credit, EITC, and the Child Tax Credit, CTC, which were \ndesigned to help hardworking families who pay taxes. The Earned Income \nTax Credit is available only to families that are working and paying \npayroll taxes. The EITC is a core part of the tax code--like any other \ntax credit that adjusts Federal tax liability based on families' \ncircumstances. It is not, and has never been considered a ``public \nbenefit.''\n\n[[Page S4786]]\n\n  Yet, amendments have been filed seeking to deny the EITC for all \nregistered immigrants for eternity, even after the individual has \nobtained legal status. One of these amendments was offered during the \ncommittee process, and was rightly rejected. I will strongly oppose any \namendment to deny hard working families from participating in these tax \ncredits when they are paying payroll taxes.\n  While CBO estimates refundable tax credits may total $127 million \nduring the first 10 years after passage of comprehensive immigration \nreform, those tax credits are more than fully offset by the payment of \ntaxes. Remember that revenues increase and the deficit decreases under \nour legislation. So when those tax credits are seen in the context of \nthe increased taxes being paid, they are offset by increased revenues \nevery year.\n  Some who oppose comprehensive immigration reform had raised the false \nalarm that this immigration bill would drain our Social Security Trust \nFund and bankrupt our Medicare system. Nothing could be further from \nthe truth. In an editorial dated June 2, 2013, entitled ``A 4.6 \nTrillion Dollar Opportunity,'' The Wall Street Journal stated \nunequivocally that ``Immigration reform will improve Social Security's \nfinances.'' That has now been substantiated by the CBO report, which \nestimates decreases in the off-budget deficit every year beginning in \n2014 following enactment this year.\n  The goal of this bill is to encourage undocumented immigrants to come \nout of the shadows so we can bring them into our legal system and so \neveryone will play by the same rules. If we create a reason for people \nnot to come out and register, then it will defeat the purpose of this \nbill. Amendments that seek to further penalize the undocumented will \nencourage them to stay in the shadows. These steps will not make us \nsafer and will not spur our economy.\n  One of the many reasons we need immigration reform is to ensure that \nthere is not a permanent underclass in this great Nation. As part of \nthis effort, we need to continue the vital safety net programs that \nprotect children, pregnant women, and other vulnerable populations. Too \noften, immigrants have been unfairly blamed and demonized as a drain on \nour resources. The facts are--as substantiated by the CBO report--just \nthe opposite. Immigrants reinvigorate and grow our economy.\n  The bottom line is that enacting our judiciary committee reported \nbill will significantly reduce our budget deficit and grow the economy. \nIt is the smart thing to do and the right thing to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/20/senate-section/article/S4786-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I was unable to cast a vote on \nthe motion to table the Cornyn amendment No. 1251 to S. 744, the Border \nSecurity, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act. I \nmissed the vote today because I joined my family at my daughter's high \nschool graduation ceremony. Had I been present, I would have voted to \ntable the Cornyn amendment.\n  We all agree that we need to do what is necessary to secure our \nborder, but I would have voted to table the amendment for several \nreasons. One of the cornerstones of this legislation is bringing the \nroughly 11 million undocumented immigrants out of the shadows by \ncreating a fair, tough and accountable path to citizenship. Delaying \nthis pathway by several years would be a disservice to our economy, our \nsafety, and our identity as a Nation of immigrants.\n  This amendment could delay or even prevent undocumented immigrants \nfrom starting on the path to citizenship, and cost taxpayers up to $25 \nbillion. It is important to commit more resources and build on the \nprogress we have already made on the border, and that is exactly what \nthe bill already does. In the underlying bill, the Department of \nHomeland Security must submit two border security strategies to \nCongress within 180 days after enactment, one for achieving effective \ncontrol of the entire southern border and another plan specifically for \nimproving fencing on the border. The bill will immediately appropriate \na total of $4.5 billion for these two plans to be implemented.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/20/senate-section/article/S4786-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

LAUTENBERG\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, with the passing of Senator Frank \nLautenberg this month, the Senate lost one of its most respected and \naccomplished members--a great progressive driven by a passion for \njustice and a deep love for this country.\n  Indeed, Frank Lautenberg's remarkable life is the American dream \npersonified. He was the son of poor, hard-working immigrant parents who \nentered America through Ellis Island. He served in the U.S. Army in \nWorld War II, attended Columbia University thanks to the GI bill, \nfounded an enormously successful company, and was elected five times to \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  Senator Lautenberg will be remembered here in the Senate for his \ntenacity and fearlessness in pursuit of his ambitious legislative \ngoals. Frank was a fighter. Time and again, he took on powerful \ninterests to improve the health and safety of the American people, and \ncountless individuals have led longer, healthier lives as a result of \nhis tireless advocacy.\n  One of Senator Lautenberg's great early accomplishments came in 1984, \njust 2 years into his first term. As a freshman Senator in the minority \nparty, he successfully passed legislation establishing a national \ndrinking age of 21. That law alone is estimated to have saved more than \n25,000 lives. Sixteen years later, he championed legislation \neffectively creating a nationwide ban on driving by anyone with a \nblood-alcohol content of .08 or higher, a change that also dramatically \nreduced alcohol-related traffic fatalities.\n  I was proud to work closely with Senator Lautenberg in the fight to \ncombat the public health threat posed by tobacco usage. He will forever \nbe remembered as the author of the landmark 1989 law that banned \nsmoking on all domestic airlines flights--and that law was just the \nbeginning of his efforts to curb smoking in a broad range of public \nplaces. In the current Congress, I was proud to join him in an effort \nto stop tobacco smuggling and to increase and equalize tobacco taxes.\n  Throughout his career, Senator Lautenberg championed women's health \nissues. He worked to ensure that students have access to comprehensive \nsex education; that woman who go to their neighborhood pharmacy to fill \na prescription for birth control cannot be turned away because of the \nobjections of the pharmacist; and that Peace Corps volunteers have \naccess to insurance coverage for abortion services in cases of rape, \nincest, and life endangerment. He also fought for women's reproductive \nrights internationally and was a long-time advocate for repealing the \n``global gag rule'' on federally funded family planning organizations.\n  Even in his final months as he battled cancer, Frank was unstoppable. \nHe continued the fight to secure relief for victims of Superstorm \nSandy. In April, using a wheelchair, he insisted on coming to the \nSenate floor to cast votes in favor of tougher gun safety legislation. \nAnd, to the end, he continued to lead the fight for long overdue \nlegislation to keep Americans safe from thousands of toxic chemicals we \nencounter in our daily lives, including in furniture, fabrics and \ncleaning products. I can think of no better way for Senators to honor \nour late colleague than by passing chemical safety legislation for the \nfirst time in nearly four decades.\n  Frank Lautenberg began his career in public service as a citizen \nsoldier in Europe in World War II. It must be noted that Frank was the \nlast veteran of World War II to serve in the Senate. In January, we \nlost another distinguished veteran of World War II, Senator Dan Inouye. \nThe fact is, for nearly six decades, this institution has been enriched \nand ennobled by members of the ``greatest generation''--people like \nPhilip Hart, Bob Dole, George McGovern, Fritz Hollings, Dan Inouye, and \nFrank Lautenberg--who began their public service in uniform in wartime, \nand who brought a special dimension to\n\n[[Page S4787]]\n\nthe Senate. They had a unique perspective on matters of war and peace. \nThey were motivated by a patriotism not of words, but of deeds and \nsacrifice. And they were determined advocates for veterans, including \nveterans of our most recent wars.\n  Here in the Senate and across the Nation, there have been many \ntributes to our friend Frank Lautenberg. As I said, he was a passionate \nprogressive. He was a tenacious fighter. He was a Senator of many \nlandmark legislative accomplishments. But knowing Frank as a true \ngentleman and great family man, I can think of no greater tribute than \nto note that Senator Frank Lautenberg was a man of enormous honor, \ndecency, and graciousness. He was a wonderful friend. May he rest in \npeace.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would like to offer some brief reflections \non the distinguished service and accomplishments of Senator Frank \nLautenberg.\n  He possessed an unwavering commitment to our country and its highest \nideals of duty and fairness.\n  His achievements over a lifetime well lived are impressive. He came \nfrom very humble beginnings but showed tremendous determination and \ntenacity as he achieved success in business and politics.\n  Senator Lautenberg was a World War II veteran--serving honorably in \nthe U.S. Army Signal Corps from 1942 to 1946, posted in Europe with so \nmany other young Americans to fight in a war that had to be fought. In \nfact, he was the last World War II veteran to serve in the U.S. Senate.\n  After the war, he like so many benefited from the GI bill and \ngraduated from Columbia University. He had seen the hard work of his \nparents and began a career in business where he recognized the \nimportance of computer technology well before the advent of many \ninnovations we take for granted today. His success in helping create \nthe Nation's first payroll services company, Automatic Data Processing, \ncould have led Senator Lautenberg anywhere, but it was his desire to \ngive back to his community and to his country that had given him an \neducation and a promising future that led him to the Senate.\n  When he set his eye on doing something, being on the other side of \nhim meant you were in for a battle. That resolve may be a reason why he \nhad so many legislative achievements. Indeed, he knew how important \ninfrastructure is to the economy, and his work to preserve and improve \nAmtrak has helped millions of Americans who rely on rail for commuting, \ntravel, and commerce every day. Growing up in an industrial area, he \nknew how important it was to respect the environment, so he fought, \neven when the odds were against him, for cleaning up Superfund sites, \nimproving air quality, and ensuring better oversight of toxic \nchemicals. And when he saw the health damage that smoking can cause, he \nled the way to ban smoking on airplanes.\n  The issue of gun safety is where I worked most closely with him. \nThose efforts to stem the flow of guns to criminals, terrorists, and \nothers who shouldn't have access to firearms gave me a deeper \nappreciation for the strength of his principles and beliefs. There was \nno one more engaged in this issue, and I know that as the effort \ncontinues to close the gun show loophole, his commitment to reducing \ngun violence in our country will serve as a true guidepost.\n  As so many pointed out in the wonderful service remembering Senator \nLautenberg, he was tenacious as well as humorous. Indeed, he fought for \nNew Jersey and for what he believed was right each and every single \nday.\n  The Senate and our country have lost an important voice on so many \nissues, but his work will carry on and not be forgotten. Indeed, the \nbenefits to our Nation of all his efforts and dedication will last for \nyears to come.\n  I extend my deepest condolences to Bonnie; his children, Ellen \nLautenberg, Nan Morgart, Lisa Birer, and Joshua Lautenberg; his \nstepchildren, Danielle Englebardt and Lara Englebardt Metz; and his 13 \ngrandchildren, on behalf of myself, my constituents, and the State of \nRhode Island. Their loss is greater than ours because they have lost a \nhusband, father, and grandfather. He will be missed.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, earlier this month, we lost one \nof our Nation's most beloved public servants. Senator Frank Lautenberg \nwas a World War II hero, a successful businessman, a statesman--and \nabove all else, a kind and generous man, one that I am honored to have \ncalled a friend. Frank will be greatly missed by New Jerseyans, his \ncolleagues in Washington and his family and friends across the Nation.\n  Much can be said about Frank and the priorities he championed. But \nwhat struck me most is that Frank fought for the little guy. His public \ncareer was built on the foundation of being a champion for a safe, \nclean, healthy and economically stable America. In the U.S. Senate, he \nchampioned efforts to preserve America's landscape and natural beauty. \nLike me, he believed that America's precious land and resources should \nbe protected and conserved for future generations to honor and enjoy. \nFrank knew that we don't inherit the land from our ancestors, we borrow \nit from our children. And Frank believed in a sustainable American \nenergy system--one that increases energy independence and prioritizes \nrenewable energy efforts such as wind, solar and geothermal. As a \nleading voice in Congress on climate change, Frank was acutely aware of \nthe harmful effects global warming has on our planet, and he led the \ncharge to ensure Americans--and his colleagues--were aware that the \noverwhelming science should spur us to reverse this dangerous trend.\n  Frank's contribution to his State and our Nation extends far beyond \nhis environmental accomplishments. He led policy reforms that are too \nnumerous to catalogue here. For example, Frank fought hard to establish \nhealth and safety standards and ensured that public health in America \nwas a priority for legislators. A key player behind landmark \nlegislation establishing a federal blood-alcohol level limit and \nbanning smoking on airplanes, Frank's public health initiatives have \nimproved the lives of millions of Americans. Generations to come will \nbenefit and live longer and healthier lives because of this great \nAmerican statesman.\n  Frank was a real champion for the people of New Jersey, but what many \npeople may not know is that he is also a true friend to the state of \nColorado, my home State. From the initial planning stages to the final \nproduct, the existence of Denver International Airport can be largely \nattributed to Frank Lautenberg. DIA received an unprecedented amount of \nFederal financial help, largely in part to Frank's unwavering support \nof the project. He also publically supported the construction of C-470, \nmaintaining that the major highway was an essential addition to \nColorado commerce and industry. Throughout the country, he supported \nthe development of urban public transportation and pushed to strengthen \nAmtrak. Without Frank's dedication, our national transportation system \nwould have not kept pace with our growing population.\n  After casting his 9000th vote in 2011, Majority Leader Harry Reid \nrecognized Senator Lautenberg as one of the most productive Senators in \nthe history of this country. Frank's wisdom and tenacity made him an \ninfluential figure in the U.S. Senate for nearly 30 years. I am \ngrateful to have served alongside him. His enduring spirit and strong \ncharacter will not be forgotten within the halls of Congress.\n  My sincerest condolences go out to Frank's family, including his \nwife, Bonnie Englebardt; six children and their spouses, Ellen \nLautenberg and Doug Hendel, Nan and Joe Morgart, Josh and Christina \nLautenberg, Lisa and Doug Birer, Danielle Englebardt and Stuart \nKatzoff, Lara Englebardt Metz and Corey Metz; and 13 grandchildren.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, it is a great privilege to rise and \nhonor the late Senator Frank Lautenberg. I think I speak for many of my \ncolleagues when I say he was a true hero to New Jersey and in the \nSenate, a self-made man, and an inspiration to us all.\n  I was proud to count Frank as a good friend and mentor. We shared \nsimilar backgrounds--children of Eastern European immigrations--and \nsimilar convictions. I will never forget Senator Lautenberg's courage \nwhen he cast important votes on gun violence prevention just a few \nmonths before his death. He had a renewed hope that we could save many \nlives and prevent more Americans from facing the senseless violence \nthat we all experienced\n\n[[Page S4788]]\n\nwith the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School. In tribute to Frank, \nand to the Newtown families, I will continue to fight for gun violence \nlegislation. I am sure that Frank would agree that this battle will be \na marathon, not a sprint, and we need to keep pushing forward.\n  Many have risen over the last few weeks to pay tribute to Frank. I am \nsimilarly humbled by his many years of service and the number of \naccomplishments that we can attribute to his leadership. As the last \nserving World War II veteran, his bravery in battle will never be \nforgotten. He was a relentless and unremitting fighter for public \nhealth causes, such as controlling the harmful effects of public \ntobacco use, raising the drinking age to 21, and banning toxic \nhousehold chemicals. He was determined to witness the effects of his \nlegislative efforts, and many times he did live to see his tremendous \nwork.\n  Frank was a champion of the rail community for many years, leading \ntransportation safety issues. Throughout his tenure he improved \npassenger rail systems, protected Amtrak, and pushed for improvements \nto high-speed rail. Frank was certainly in my thoughts as I chaired a \nhearing of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation \nyesterday on rail safety. I am grateful for his tenacity and \nproactivity on these issues.\n  We have lost Frank Lautenberg's stirring presence on the floor, but \nnever in our hearts. For 28 years, he pushed for important changes as a \nforce for good, refusing to give up the public fight for his steadfast \nconvictions. Cynthia and I send our love to Bonnie and the Lautenberg \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/20/senate-section/article/S4788-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WORLD REFUGEE DAY 2013\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to mark the 12th World \nRefugee Day, a day we honor the courage, strength, and determination of \nthose who are forced to flee their homes under threat of persecution, \nconflict, and violence. Our nation's role as a safe haven for the \npersecuted is an integral part of our history. The United States was \nfounded as a beacon of freedom and tolerance--freedom of speech and \nreligion, and tolerance of all creeds and cultures. And throughout the \nyears, Americans have fought to ensure that those rights are upheld for \nall of us.\n  Too often, we take these bedrocks of our society for granted. We \nforget that most of the freedoms we now enjoy are still being fought \nfor in too many places around the world.\n  Today, there are over 43.7 million refugees and internally displaced \npeople around the world. The protracted conflict in Syria has only \nexacerbated this problem.\n  To date, UNHCR estimates that 1.6 million Syrians have fled into \nneighboring Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and Egypt. With the vast \nmajority of refugees--1 million--fleeing within the first 5 months of \nthis year.\n  This past February I visited the Kilis refugee camp in Turkey, which \nis currently sheltering over 15,000 Syrian refugees. I was able to \nwitness first- hand the remarkable bravery of the Syrian refugee \npopulation. Many of these families relocated several times within Syria \nbefore ultimately making the heart wrenching decision to leave their \nhomes and their country, to seek food, medical attention and safety \noutside of Syria.\n  But I also recognize the enormous economic strain this influx has \ncaused on host countries. In Jordan, for example, the Syrian refugee \ncrisis has increased the country's overall population by 10 percent, \nand the crisis has had profound social, economic, and political \nimplications. We know that this is not easy, but we applaud Jordan and \nother refugee host nations for their actions and we have pledged \nhumanitarian support for these communities.\n  The Syrian crisis is just one example of a troubling global problem. \nThere are millions of refugees around the world--many of whom have been \nliving in camps and settlements for decades. Whether from Iraq, \nAfghanistan, Mali or South Sudan, this diverse group, scattered across \nthe globe, has one overarching commonality: they once lived in a place \nthey called home, but by ill-fated circumstances were forced to flee, \noften with no hope of returning.\n  I know many of you agree with me when I say that addressing the \nrefugee crisis is not a luxury, it is a necessity. As history has shown \nus, unstable and poverty stricken countries are very vulnerable to \ndictators and other extreme forms of government. Therefore it is \nimperative that our development and foreign assistance programs \ncontinue to have the resources necessary to ensure that the United \nStates remains the nation that preserves and protects freedoms around \nthe world, and the nation that supports our friends and allies when \nthey do the same.\n  As United States citizens we enjoy so much that is rare in other \nparts of the world. Apart from reminding ourselves of all that we are \nthankful for, today should also spur us to action. As a global leader, \nthe United States should lead the charge in aiding refugees around the \nworld, and by our example inspire others to do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/20/senate-section/article/S4788-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      OBSERVING WORLD REFUGEE DAY\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise today in observance of \nWorld Refugee Day. Established by the United Nations on June 20, 2001, \nWorld Refugee Day honors the courage, strength, and perseverance of \nthose forced to leave their homes under threat of persecution and \nconflict, as well as those escaping extreme poverty or environmental \ndegradation. This annual commemoration recognizes the tremendous \nchallenges faced by millions of displaced persons throughout the world \nand pays tribute to their invaluable contributions to the communities \nthat have provided them shelter.\n  Ongoing violence and the harmful effects of climate change have \nforced millions of people across the globe to make the impossible \ndecision between risking their lives at home and leaving behind \neverything in search of safety. Refugees are individuals and families \nwhose lives have been uprooted, whose communities have been destroyed, \nand whose future remains unclear. While these displaced people struggle \nfor the most basic services, they are also looking for an opportunity \nto lay down new roots and provide for themselves and their families.\n  For over 30 years, Coloradans have welcomed refugees into their \ncommunities, offering safety, security, and a place to call home. Our \ngreat State has provided them with an opportunity to use their diverse \nskills and expertise to make meaningful contributions to our way of \nlife in the West. Today, we have over 48,000 refugees who have settled \nin Colorado from countries all across the globe. I would like to \nacknowledge this population for adding to our rich cultural heritage, \nfor expanding our understanding of the world, and for strengthening our \neconomy.\n  While we will never be able to fully understand the sacrifices made \nby these vulnerable individuals and families, it should be a top \npriority to remember their struggles and recognize their strength. As a \nU.S. Senator, I reaffirm the commitment of Colorado and our Nation to \nthe refugees, and I pledge to continue to work to address the \nunderlying causes of refugee flows.\n  On behalf of a grateful nation and State, I commend those who have \nrisked their lives working individually, or with the multitude of \ndedicated nongovernmental organizations, to provide life-saving \nassistance and shelter to those displaced around the world. Let today \nserve as a reminder of our international responsibility to help our \nneighbors and of the importance of our shared humanity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/20/senate-section/article/S4788-3", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4788-S4789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ALPINE LAKES WILDERNESS\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about my bill, S. \n112, the Alpine Lakes Wilderness Additions and Pratt and Middle Fork \nSnoqualmie Rivers Protection Act. I have introduced similar legislation \nin previous Congresses; in fact, this is the third time I have made a \nlegislative push to protect these treasured spaces. It passed the \nSenate by unanimous consent on Wednesday, June 19, 2013, for the first \ntime, and I wish to thank my colleague from Oregon for all his \ntremendous work to get a package of public lands bills through the \nSenate for the first time in over 4 years.\n  Passage of this bill is a tremendous step forward and is the result \nof over 5 years of work by me, my staff, and Congressman Reichert, who \nhas introduced companion legislation in the\n\n[[Page S4789]]\n\nHouse of Representatives several times, and Congresswoman DelBene, who \nnow represents the lands this bill would protect. We are fortunate to \nhave bipartisan support for this effort, and we are fortunate as \nWashingtonians to have unique and beautiful natural landscapes that \ndeserve protection from unrequited development and pressure.\n  This legislation would protect, in perpetuity, over 22,000 acres and \nprovide the protections of the Wilderness Act to a richer diversity of \necosystems and lower elevation lands. These protections will ensure \ndiverse recreational opportunities and protect one of the closest \nblocks of wild forests to an urban center in the country.\n  As I mentioned, Congressional action on public lands have been \nstymied in recent years. I was pleasantly surprised we were able to \nfind a path forward, and today I wish to confirm my support for tribal \ntreaty rights and for access to these spaces to be designated as \nwilderness for traditional uses by tribal members. I firmly believe the \nFederal government has a responsibility to uphold the treaties signed \nby our predecessors with Native American tribes--a fact that has been \nupheld by the Federal courts. As the author of this legislation I want \nto reaffirm that regarding lands defined within the bill located in the \nMount Baker Snoqualmie National Forest, nothing in this act alters, \nmodifies, diminishes, or extinguishes the treaty rights of an Indian \ntribe with respect to hunting, fishing, and gathering rights as \nprotected by a treaty.\n  Again, I wish to thank Chairman Wyden and ranking member Murkowski \nfor working together to find a path forward to protect public spaces. \nAnd I wish to thank Senator Cantwell for her steadfast support of this \nproposal. I look forward to working with my House colleagues to protect \nthis important landscape.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/20/senate-section/article/S4789-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO COLONEL HAROLD R. VAN OPDORP\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a true patriot, and \nfellow U.S. Marine, Col. Harold R. Van Opdorp. While some know him as \n``Odie'' and others as Colonel V, we all know him as Marine. After more \nthan 3 years of service leading the Marine Corps' Office of Legislative \nAffairs in the U.S. Senate, Colonel Van Opdorp has assumed the \nresponsibilities as commanding officer of the Marine Corps' Officer \nCandidate School. I would like to recognize Colonel Van Opdorp's \ndistinguished service and dedication to fostering a relationship of \nmutual benefit between the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Senate.\n  With more than 2 decades of dedicated service to his country, Colonel \nVan Opdorp has selflessly given to the cause of freedom across the \nglobe, from Somalia to Iran, from Norway to the South Pacific. His \nservice leading young Marines as a platoon, company, and battalion \ncommander, in garrison and in combat, is emblematic of the caliber of \nhis character. His diverse service reflects the traditions of the \nEagle, Globe, and Anchor that he wears and the nature of the Corps.\n  Over the course of the last 3 years, Colonel Van Opdorp has been \ninstrumental to facilitating the oversight responsibilities of the \nSenate. Known for his in-depth knowledge of legislative issues and the \noperational requirements of the Marine Corps, he ensured that Members \nof the U.S. Senate with an interest in national security were armed \nwith timely information on Operation Enduring Freedom, humanitarian \nassistance in Haiti, flood relief operations in Pakistan, Marine \nSecurity Guards at our diplomatic missions around the globe, and other \nforward-deployed Marine forces. Colonel Van Opdorp worked hard to \nensure all Senators were fully briefed of the programs which make our \nCorps special, programs such as the Joint Strike Fighter, the \nAmphibious Combat Vehicle, and the MV-22 Osprey. In 2011, I had the \npleasure of working closely with Colonel Van Opdorp during our efforts \nto recognize the significant contributions of the Montford Point \nMarines, our Nation's first African American Marines, with the \nCongressional Gold Medal.\n  Colonel Van Opdorp's absence will be felt in the Senate. I join many \npast and present Senators in my gratitude and appreciation for his \noutstanding leadership and unwavering support of the missions of the \nU.S. Marine Corps. I know my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee wholeheartedly join me in this tribute. I wish Colonel Van \nOpdorp and his wife, Rebecca, fair winds and following seas as he \ncontinues to serve his Nation, charged with the great responsibility of \nmolding our future Marine Officers. ``Ooh-rah'' and Semper Fi, Marine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/20/senate-section/article/S4789-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RECOGNIZING PRINCE HALL GRAND LODGE AND THE LOUISIANA ORDER OF THE \n                              EASTERN STAR\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Louisiana \nand the State of Louisiana Order of the Eastern Star, who have \ncollectively provided 225 years of continuous service and devotion to \nthe State of Louisiana.\n  For 150 years and 75 years respectively, the Prince Hall Grand Lodge, \nformed in 1863, and the Order of the Eastern Star, formed in 1938, have \nserved the State of Louisiana through their tireless leadership and \ndedication. During this tenure, members of the grand lodge have served \nin community and elected leadership positions both in the State and \nthroughout the Nation. During the Civil Rights movement, members \nprovided invaluable management, direction, and guidance to countless \norganizations that contributed to the effort. Throughout their \nillustrious years of service, the grand lodge has worked with local \npartners to invest in and improve communities, strengthen \nopportunities, and expand the impact of public service. The passing of \neach year brings a greater appreciation for the values of community, \neducation, and civic activism that the grand lodge and order provide to \nthe State of Louisiana.\n  The Prince Hall Grand Lodge and Order of the Eastern Star inspire \nnoble principles, moral values, and profound convictions in the lives \nof each individual they touch. Through commitment they teach the \nprinciples of family; through charity and volunteerism they teach the \nvalues of community and philanthropy; and through honor, integrity, and \nrespect, they teach the convictions of acceptance and compassion. Their \nteachings and work have provided outstanding support and service to the \ncitizens of Louisiana and will continue to benefit generations to come.\n  The M.W. Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Louisiana and the State of \nLouisiana Order of the Eastern Star have been and continues to be an \ninspiration to all those who have been impacted by their tireless \nefforts. It is with my heartfelt and greatest sincerity that I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in recognizing the service, heritage, and \ntradition of the Prince Hall Grand Lodge and the Louisiana Order of the \nEastern Star.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/20/senate-section/article/S4789-3", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4789-S4790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 RECOGNIZING JHPIEGO'S 40TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate \nJhpiego, a nonprofit global health affiliate of Johns Hopkins \nUniversity, on the occasion of its 40th anniversary and recognize the \norganization for its tireless service in preventing the needless deaths \nof women and children throughout the developing world.\n  Dr. Theodore M. King, the former chairman of the Johns Hopkins \nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology, founded Jhpiego in 1973. The \noriginal intention was to share the latest technology, skills, and \nknowledge of women's health with health professionals from Latin \nAmerica, Africa, and Asia by bringing them to Baltimore for training. \nBut Jhpiego officials realized that they could have a greater impact by \neducating health care providers in the providers' own countries, so \nJhpiego changed its focus to sustainability, to developing the capacity \nof countries to create a well-prepared network of health care \nprofessionals and a strong health system that they can build upon to \ncare for themselves. As a result, Jhpiego and its more than 1,500 \nemployees have brought the resources\n\n[[Page S4790]]\n\nand technical expertise of Johns Hopkins to over 150 countries around \nthe globe, creating tens of thousands of health champions who will \ndeliver skilled care for generations to come.\n  Jhpiego has proudly participated in the U.S. Government's flagship \nmaternal and child health efforts for the past 15 years. The program, \nnow known as the Maternal and Child Health Integrated Program, MCHIP, \nhas made incredible progress in reducing maternal and child mortality, \nincreasing access to reproductive health services and HIV testing and \nimproving immunization and nutrition education in vulnerable countries \nsuch as Afghanistan, South Africa, and Rwanda.\n  For 40 years, Jhpiego has worked in some of the most remote areas of \nthe world--places without hospitals, electricity, or running water. \nJhpiego officials and staff know the challenges of working and living \nin such conditions and use that insight to develop the next generation \nof extremely low-cost solutions that address many of the leading causes \nof death, such as cervical cancer, for women in low-resource settings. \nWith regard to cervical cancer, Jhpiego has developed the ``single \nvisit approach,'' SVA, which combines screening and, if abnormal cells \nare detected, treatment. The screening costs $5, and screening with \ntreatment is $30.\n  When Jhpiego began its work in Afghanistan in 2002 after the fall of \nthe Taliban, the country's maternal death rate was the second highest \nin the world. There were only 467 midwives in a country with a \npopulation of 22 million and one functioning midwifery school. Today, \nmore than 3,000 new midwives have graduated from 29 accredited, \ncommunity, and hospital midwifery schools located throughout \nAfghanistan. This development has helped dramatically improve maternal \nmortality rates in Afghanistan and bring women into the workforce.\n  In Mozambique, fewer than 25 percent of Mozambique's 22 million \npeople currently know their HIV status. To address this problem, \nJhpiego has helped over 900,000 people to be tested for HIV and \ncounseled on their status by members of local health groups and faith-\nbased organizations in their homes.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in recognizing the \nincredible accomplishments of Jhpiego, currently under the outstanding \nleadership of Dr. Leslie Mancuso, and congratulating the organization \non its 40th anniversary. I am proud that Jhpiego is based in Maryland \nbut has a truly global reach with regard to the lifesaving work it \ndoes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/20/senate-section/article/S4790-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO CHUCK CLARKE\n\n Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a \ndistinguished and outstanding citizen of the State of Connecticut, \nCharles J. ``Chuck'' Clarke, on the eve of his retirement from \nTravelers. In 1958, Chuck joined Travelers as a property casualty \nunderwriter. He has lived and raised a family in the Hartford area \nsince 1963, currently residing in Glastonbury. Chuck's responsibilities \ngrew steadily during his long tenure with the company, as he moved up \nfrom the position of underwriter, to vice president, to senior vice \npresident, to president of the Travelers Property Casualty Corp., and \nmost recently to vice chairman of The Travelers Companies, Inc. Chuck \nis a leader in the insurance industry and a legend among his co-workers \nat Travelers. For 55 years, he has provided leadership, sound judgment, \nand a passion for the business of insurance that has benefited \nTravelers and the State of Connecticut.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to this outstanding \nman. A leader in action and by the example he set for others. A humble \nman who always referred to himself as ``just an underwriter,'' when \nthose who worked with him knew that he was much more. The State of \nConnecticut has been enriched by his service, and I truly wish him \nhappiness and enjoyment after his long tenure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/20/senate-section/article/S4790-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING WESTERN IDAHO CABINETS\n\n Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, some of the most successful small \nbusinesses in America originate with an entrepreneur who takes a leap \nof faith to try something new. Dale Wilson and Brett Hatfield, the \nowners of Western Idaho Cabinets, had no prior experience working in a \ncabinet shop. Brett has a degree in production, while Dale has a degree \nin information studies. Despite their initial inexperience, Western \nIdaho Cabinets, since its founding in 1993, has grown to be the largest \ncabinet manufacturer in Idaho. This remarkable story is why I wish to \nhonor Western Idaho Cabinets in Boise, ID as the Idaho Small Business \nof the Day as part of National Small Business Week.\n  Western Idaho Cabinets is a great example of job creation and \nexpansion, starting as a two-man shop in Dale's garage to a company \nwhose annual sales will reach nearly $15 million this year. This is the \nAmerican dream. Currently, Western Idaho Cabinets is the premier \nkitchen cabinet supplier in the State, housed in a state of the art \nfacility and boasting 170 employees. Last year, the company took first \nplace in four out of seven categories at the 2012 Parade of Homes.\n  In addition to delivering quality products, Western Idaho Cabinets \nworks hard to streamline the process of manufacturing, optimize usage, \nand eliminate waste--perhaps Western Idaho Cabinets should teach the \nFederal Government a thing or two about this. Co-owners Dale and Brett \ntraveled internationally to learn from different countries' \nmanufacturing processes in order to develop the most efficient methods. \nIn doing so, the company was able to cut waste by 60 percent, meaning \nthey could make twice the amount of product with the same amount of \nlabor. They continue to invest in equipment that will automate the \nproduction process and help to save money and allow them to meet their \ncustomers' demands. This lean production model has led to Western Idaho \nCabinets' reputation as the local expert on the manufacturing process \nand the company is frequently approached by others who want to learn \ntheir methods. Western Idaho Cabinets enjoys great success that seemed \nan improbable feat from the early days of constructing cabinets out of \na two-car garage.\n  With the willpower to achieve success and the commitment to \nperfecting their business model, Western Idaho Cabinets proves that a \nsmall business can start from a basic idea and evolve to be at the top \nof their industry. Small businesses around the country and globally \ncould stand to learn much from Western Idaho Cabinets and I am proud to \nhonor them today as a part of National Small Business Week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/20/senate-section/article/S4790-3", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/20/senate-section/article/S4790-4", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/20/senate-section/article/S4790-5", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4790-S4791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS \n  ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13617 OF JUNE 25, 2012, WITH \n  RESPECT TO THE DISPOSITION OF RUSSIAN HIGHLY ENRICHED URANIUM--PM 14\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date.

A bill to amend the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration \nAct to facilitate the establishment of additional or expanded public \ntarget ranges in certain States; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise today to re-introduce \nthe bipartisan Target Practice and Marksmanship Training Support Act \nwith my friend Senator Risch of the great state of Idaho. We are proud \nto be joined by a long list of original co-sponsors including Senators \nBennet, Hagan, Klobuchar, Tester, Barrasso, Crapo, Thune, Begich, \nPryor, Enzi, and Heller. I thank my colleagues for joining me in this \nbipartisan effort.\n  This bill would amend the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act \nto adjust certain funding limitations and provide states with greater \nflexibility over the use of funds available for the creation and \nmaintenance of public shooting ranges--designated public lands where \npeople can both safely engage in sport shooting and responsibly sharpen \ntheir marksmanship skills.\n  The Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act established an excise \ntax on sporting equipment and ammunition, which provides each state \nwith funds for a variety of wildlife restoration and hunter education \nand safety programs. Pittman-Robertson funds can also be used for the \ndevelopment and maintenance of shooting ranges. Unfortunately, however, \ncurrent restrictions in the Pittman-Robertson Act disproportionately \nunderfund the creation and maintenance of shooting range opportunities \nin comparison with other programs funded by the Act. In addition, \nopportunities for American sportsmen and women to safely engage in \nrecreational shooting on public lands have significantly declined in \nrecent years.\n  In an effort to reverse this trend and establish, maintain and \npromote safe spaces for target practice and sport shooting, this \nlegislation would allow states to allocate a greater proportion of \ntheir federal wildlife funds for these purposes.\n  To be clear, the bill would not allocate any new funding, it would \nnot raise any fees or taxes, nor would it require states to apply their \nallocated Pittman-Robertson funds to shooting ranges. Rather, this bill \ngives states the flexibility to allocate their existing Pittman-\nRobertson funds in the manner they deem most beneficial by reducing the \namount of other matching dollars States would have to raise and permits \nstates to ``bank'' Pittman-Robertson funds for 5 years so that they can \nsave enough money to build new shooting ranges.\n  Hunting and recreational shooting are an integral part of the \nColorado way of life. The Target Practice and Marksmanship Training \nSupport Act is designed to promote our western way of life, \nacknowledging not only the need for safe places for hunters and \nsportsmen to responsibly practice their sport, but also the jobs and \neconomic growth supported by sport shooters in Colorado and throughout \nthe nation. Hunting and outdoor sports generate billions of dollars \neach year and support countless American jobs. In addition to the \nimprovements this bill contains, it is my hope that the public land \nmanagement agencies will continue to work with the states, sportsmen \nand women, recreational shooting interests, local communities, and \nothers so that these opportunities are safe and available.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/20/senate-section/article/S4796-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4796-S4797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 178--HONORING THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE DRUG \n ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION ON THE OCCASION OF THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF \n                               THE AGENCY\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Grassley) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

The amendment is ready but we have to make \nsure it is truly ready. I have been to a few of these rodeos, and we \nwant to make sure the amendment that has been worked on all day is \ngoing to be one that is the final one. We don't want to have an \namendment and then have to deal with it in some other way.\n  So what we are going to do tomorrow is we are going to come in at \n10:30 and, hopefully, at that time we will be in a position to move \nforward on this legislation. Right now, it seems it would be senseless \nfor us to stay any longer tonight because it is simply not going to be \nready before midnight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/20/senate-section/article/S4846-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      CONSTITUTING MAJORITY PARTY MEMBERSHIP ON CERTAIN COMMITTEES\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      MAKING MINORITY APPOINTMENTS\n\n  Mr. REID.
