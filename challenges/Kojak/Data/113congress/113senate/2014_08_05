Mr. President, I previously filed budgetary aggregates \nand committee allocations for budget years 2014 and 2015 pursuant to \nsection 116 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. Today, I am adjusting \nthose levels.\n  Section 251 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act \nof 1985 establishes statutory limits on discretionary spending and \nallows for various adjustments to those limits, while sections 302 and \n314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act allows the Chairman of the \nBudget Committee to establish and make revisions to allocations, \naggregates, and levels consistent with those adjustments. On August 1, \n2014, the Senate passed one bill that is eligible for an adjustment \nunder the Congressional Budget Act: H.J. Res 76, Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations Resolution, 2014, which includes $225 million in budget \nauthority and $150 million in outlays in 2014 and $75 million in \noutlays in 2015 that is designated as emergency funding pursuant to \nsection 251(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \nControl Act of 1985.\n  Consequently, I am revising the budgetary aggregates for 2014 by a \ntotal of $225 million in budget authority and $150 million in outlays. \nFor 2015 I am revising the budgetary aggregates by $75 million in \noutlays. I am also revising the budget authority and outlay\n\n[[Page S5332]]\n\nallocations to the Appropriations Committee by $225 million in revised \nsecurity budget authority and $150 million in outlays in 2014 and by \n$75 million in outlays in 2015.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following tables detailing the \nchanges to the allocation to the Committee on Appropriations and the \nbudgetary

Mr. President, this summer marks the 40th year since the \nTurkish invasion of Cyprus and the division of the island into Greek \nand Turkish zones. That division has led to great hardships on both \nsides of the divide and been a source of some instability in a part of \nthe world--the eastern Mediterranean--that already is far too unstable. \nIt is profoundly in the interests of the United States, our friends and \nallies in the region, and the Cypriot people, both Greek and Turkish, \nto resolve this dispute and achieve the goal of a unified Cyprus.\n  The division of Cyprus has had profoundly negative consequences for \nits people and the region. Cyprus has been a source of ongoing tension \nbetween two important NATO allies, Greece and Turkey. The division has \nstunted Cyprus economically and politically. Tragically, the line has \ndivided families for four decades. None of this is in the interests of \nGreece, Turkey, the United States, our allies, or the world. That is \nwhy the United States supports the creation of a bizonal, bicommunal \nfederation as envisioned by numerous United Nations Security Council \nresolutions.\n  It is unfortunate that, four decades after the island's division, we \nhave yet to achieve that goal. It is long overdue that Cyprus be \nunified. And there are reasons today to believe that goal is closer. In \nFebruary, U.N.-sponsored talks between Greek and Turkish leaders \nrestarted after a 2-year halt. They agreed to a roadmap for further \nnegotiations and, importantly, committed to build a positive atmosphere \nsurrounding the talks, including important confidence-building measures \ndesigned to help ease 40 years of mistrust. Little over a week ago \nnegotiators met and committed to progress on outstanding issues in \nadvance of their next meeting on September 2.\n  It is vitally important that negotiators continue to build momentum \ntoward peace and unity on the island because so much is at stake. The \ndiscovery of large natural gas reserves off the island's coast promises \na newly prosperous future for Cyprus and its people, but it will be far \nmore difficult, if not impossible, to fully capitalize on\n\n[[Page S5333]]\n\nthat opportunity in the absence of peace and unity.\n  The United States should continue to work closely with all sides in \npursuit of the peaceful reunification of Cyprus that is so long \noverdue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/08/05/senate-section/article/S5333-1", "month": "08", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO ROBERT PERCIASEPE\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I want to take a moment today to \nhonor Robert ``Bob'' Perciasepe, the Deputy Administrator of the U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency EPA. Bob is a true public servant and \ndear friend who will be departing government service shortly. He has \nspent the past several decades protecting our environment and his work \nin this regard has been exemplary. The air we and our children and \ngrandchildren breathe and the water we drink are cleaner because of Bob \nPerciasepe.\n  Bob graduated in 1974 from Cornell University with a bachelor of \nscience degree in natural resources and then received his master's \ndegree in planning and public administration from the Maxwell School of \nCitizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University. After Bob \ngraduated from Syracuse, he began his career in public service with the \nBaltimore City Planning Department in 1976, eventually becoming the \ncity's assistant director for planning in 1986. Later, he served as the \nMaryland secretary of the environment. It was during his service in my \nhome State of Maryland that I first had the opportunity to know and \nwork with Bob, particularly as he worked on an issue near and dear to \nme--protecting the Chesapeake Bay.\n  Following Bob's service in Maryland, he served President Bill Clinton \nin two different capacities at the EPA, first as the Assistant \nAdministrator for Water and then as the Assistant Administrator for the \nOffice of Air and Radiation. In these positions, he continued his \ntireless work to improve the air we breathe and protect our drinking \nand recreational waters.\n  Bob was instrumental in working with us in Congress to pass the 1996 \nSafe Drinking Water Act--a law that provided critical protection \nstandards for drinking water. When he led the Office of Air and \nRadiation, he signed the first official finding that mercury pollution \nfrom our Nation's power plants should be controlled.\n  Bob left government service but he didn't stop working to protect \nhuman health and the environment. He went to work for the National \nAudubon Society, where he continued to champion conservation and \nenvironmental progress. When Barack Obama became President in 2009, Bob \nreturned to Federal service as the EPA's Deputy Administrator and \nserved as Acting Administrator between the tenures of Lisa Jackson and \nGina McCarthy.\n  Bob's dedication to public service and his practical approach to \nproblemsolving were evident from my first interactions with him. His \nfun-loving nature, intellectual capacity, and devotion to duty make him \nan exemplary public servant. We all breathe easier--literally--because \nof Bob Perciasepe, so I wanted to take this opportunity to express my \nappreciation for his service and congratulate him on his countless \ncontributions to protecting our Nation's environment during his long \ntenure at EPA. I have no doubt that Bob will maintain his untiring \ncommitment to the betterment of the environment in his next venture, \nand I wish him all the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/08/05/senate-section/article/S5333-2", "month": "08", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/08/05/senate-section/article/S5333-3", "month": "08", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The message received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/08/05/senate-section/article/S5333-4", "month": "08", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING RECESS\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 3, 2013, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on August 4, 2014, during the recess of \nthe Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the House has agreed to the following concurrent \nresolution, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

Thank you, Mr. President. The facts are plain, \ncolleagues. The immigration policies of President Obama are having a \ndevastating effect on the classical American goal of a fair and lawful \nsystem of immigration, one that serves our national interest. He has \ndirected the Federal immigration officers not to enforce plain law. He \nmeets privately with pro-amnesty, open borders, and special interest \nbusiness groups and promises to take even more actions in the future to \nerase plain law. Unfortunately, our fine law enforcement officers are \nexcluded from the discussion. I have asked that they be involved for \nyears now, and the President has flatly refused.\n  The President's actions evidence no policy or guiding principle that \nis sustainable. Now the heretofore largely covert actions by the \nPresident are open and blatant, and he has announced them. He has told \nthe world that with the stroke of his pen he will, by Presidential \ndirective, by Executive order, provide legal status to 5 to 6 million \npeople unlawfully in the country today--all this contrary to long \nestablished law. But there is more. He has said he will issue, in \neffect, legal identification cards and work authorization.\n  Surely we know the President cannot make law. Congress makes law. As \nChief Executive, the President executes, carries out, and enforces law. \nThis we learned in grade school. This constitutional construct is not a \nsmall matter; it is the mechanism by which this Nation conducts its \ngovernmental business. Through this method, the people control their \ngovernment.\n  Allowing any President to nullify law is a threat to the future of \nour Republic and to the ultimate power of the people to control it. \nThat is why I have urged the President to reconsider this point and to \nadhere to his plain statements, where he has expressly stated he did \nnot have the power to do what he now--in a complete reversal--states he \nwill do.\n  On November 25, 2013, less than a year ago, he stated: ``If, in fact, \nI could solve all these problems without passing them through Congress, \nI would do so. But we're also a nation of laws.''\n  On March 28, 2011, President Obama said:\n\n       With respect to the notion that I can just suspend \n     deportations through executive order, that's just not the \n     case. There are enough laws on the books by Congress that are \n     very clear in terms of how we have to enforce our immigration \n     system that for me to simply through executive order ignore \n     those congressional mandates would not conform with my \n     appropriate role as President.\n\n  Again, on September 28, 2011, he said:\n\n       I just have to continue to say this notion that somehow I \n     can just change the laws unilaterally is just not true. We \n     are doing everything we can administratively. But the fact of \n     the matter is there are laws on the books that I have to \n     enforce. And I think there's been a great disservice done to \n     the cause of getting the DREAM Act passed and getting \n     comprehensive immigration passed by perpetrating the notion \n     that somehow, by myself, I can go and do these things. It's \n     just not true. But we live in a democracy. You have to pass \n     bills through the legislature, and then I can sign it.\n\n  That is true. Every schoolchild knows that. But what is happening \ntoday? The President is saying something quite different.\n  It is important for Congress to stand and resist the complete erosion \nof its powers--and even more significantly, the powers of the American \npeople--and see that our laws are carried out effectively.\n  I know this is a somewhat postmodern time where many believe words \nhave no meaning except as they advance one's agenda of the day, but \nsuch approaches are wholly inconsistent with the founding concepts of \nAmerica. We were founded on the belief that words do have meaning, that \nsound principles must be adhered to, and that truth is real and must be \nsought.\n  While we debate many issues, and good people can disagree, surely we \ncan all agree that at this moment we are in the Senate Chamber and that \nthere is daylight outside. Those are not matters for debate or else we \nare, indeed, through the ``looking glass.'' Likewise, it is surely not \na matter of debate--among Democrat or Republican--that the President \ncannot make or nullify law. He cannot do that. Thus, we must in unity \ncall on President Obama not to go through with his stated desire which \nwould eviscerate long and clearly established American immigration law. \nWhat law might the next President ignore, bend, or nullify?\n  It is said that he has ordered his lawyers and officials to tell him \nhow he may carry out such actions before the end of the summer. \nApparently he did not ask them whether he had such power; he just \nordered them to develop a plan to do that which the law does not allow.\n  Mr. President, frustration and pique can result in hasty and unwise \ndecisions. Please do not do this.\n  To the officials and lawyers who have received this directive from \nthe President, you must always remember that your first duty is to the \nConstitution and the Nation and its laws. There will be times when you \nhave the duty to say no.\n  Lawyers at the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security are going \nto be asked how they can carry out the President's plan that he \npreviously said he had no authority to do. They are also challenged. \nTheir duty is to say no. And sometimes you have to resign your office.\n  Just imagine, this past Sunday--2 days ago--White House adviser Dan \nPfieffer repeated the Obama administration's warning of an impending \nExecutive action on immigration. Mr.\n\n[[Page S5336]]\n\nPfieffer said this action would come at ``the end of the summer.'' \nAccording to repeated and multiple news reports, these Executive \nactions could provide administrative legal papers and work permits for \nup to 5 to 6 million immigrants in clear contravention of Federal law. \nIf these actions are taken, we will have effectively opened the borders \nof America. We are nearly there already.\n  Consider that millions of people come every year to America on visas. \nCurrently, if you overstay a visa, there is no legal consequence today. \nNo one is going to come and get you. No one even clocks if you come in \nor if you leave. If you get a student visa and drop out of school, or \nif you come to work on a visa and it expires, or if you just come on a \ntourist visa and never leave, nobody checks, nobody asks these \nindividuals to leave.\n  The Congressional Budget Office said, in analyzing the Gang of 8 bill \nthat came through the Senate, that as much as 40 percent of the \nillegality in America today is a result of visa overstays. They also \nprojected that was going to increase in the years to come.\n  If you get past the Border Patrol at the border and somehow get to \nthe interior of this country, you are also allowed to stay under \nPresident Obama's policies, which are not to deport anybody unless they \nhave been arrested for a serious crime, maybe even limited to a serious \nfelony.\n  As the President's former ICE Director John Sandweg explained, ``If \nyou are a run-of-the-mill immigrant here illegally, your odds of \ngetting deported are close to zero.'' In order to be deported from the \ninterior, you basically have to commit a serious criminal offense. \nOtherwise, you are mostly free to enter illegally, work illegally, and \neven collect benefits like the additional child tax credit. The \nTreasury Department inspector general said that loophole should be \neliminated, and we could do so, but Congress and the majority in this \nSenate have refused to allow us to do so.\n  Chris Crane, the head of the ICE officers association--that is \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement officers who do all the work on the \ninterior of the country and help in other areas too--testified before \nCongress:\n\n       Most Americans would be surprised to know that immigration \n     agents are regularly prohibited from enforcing the two most \n     fundamental sections of the United States immigration law. \n     According to ICE policy, in most cases immigration agents can \n     no longer arrest persons solely for entering the United \n     States illegally. Additionally, in most cases immigration \n     agents cannot arrest people solely because they have entered \n     the United States with a visa and then overstayed that visa \n     and failed to return to their country. Essentially, only \n     individuals charged or convicted of very serious criminal \n     offenses by other law enforcement agencies may be arrested or \n     charged by ICE agents and officers for illegal entry or \n     overstay.\n\n  This is a very serious matter. This has not been the policy of \nAmerica; it is the policy President Obama has directed through his top \nadministrative officials down to the very officers on the street.\n  Furthermore, if you show up at the border and simply turn yourself \nin, you are often released into the interior of the country.\n  A recent newspaper in New Jersey interviewed a 27-year-old illegal \nimmigrant from Honduras. The newspaper wrote that he had ``arrived in \nFreehold Borough 15 days ago from Honduras.'' The article says he \n``left behind his parents and 10 brothers and sisters,'' but ``he is \nhoping his family will join him at some point in the future.''\n  Once illegal immigrants have been released into the interior, they \nfrequently do not show up for court hearings. The National Review \nreports that ``in one day at a Los Angeles immigration court last week, \nJudge Ashley Tabaddor heard the cases of nearly 40 illegal immigrant \nminors, but none of the children appeared in court, according to the \nLos Angeles Times.'' None of them came to appear in court.\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       In each case, the illegal immigrant was thought to have \n     settled elsewhere, and the judge reportedly decided not to \n     deport the children in absentia. Instead, the judge--who \n     declined to speak with National Review Online, citing Justice \n     Department policy--reportedly issued change-of-venue orders \n     in each case.\n\n  That basically means nothing. If you fail to show up in court for a \nDUI or for a speeding ticket or for a reckless driving ticket, a \nwarrant is issued for your arrest. That is what happens in America \nthroughout this Nation, and that is what should happen. But when a \nperson who enters the country unlawfully is released and asked to show \nup at a hearing at some date in the future, and then doesn't show up, \nthe judge apparently transfers it to some other district on the \nassumption the individual has moved to some other place. How do they \nknow where they are? And nobody will go out and look for them. There is \nnobody looking for these individuals. They are not even able to put a \nwarrant in the National Crime Information Center because they probably \ndon't even have their true name or any ability to identify them. It is \na complete capitulation to lawlessness.\n  But there are more ways, unfortunately, to get into the country \nillicitly. Our asylum system is plagued by fraud. The House Judiciary \nCommittee reported this:\n\n       Asylum approval rates overall have increased dramatically \n     in recent years. Approval rates by asylum officers have \n     increased from 28 percent in 2007 to 46 percent in 2013 and \n     approval rates by immigration judges in affirmative cases \n     have increased from 51 percent in 2007 to 74 percent in 2013. \n     Combining both of these approval rates, the vast majority of \n     aliens who affirmatively seek asylum are now successful in \n     their claims.\n\n  The report goes on:\n\n       This does not even take into account appeals to the Board \n     of Immigration Appeals or federal courts. At the same time, \n     an internal Department of Homeland Security report shows that \n     at least 70 percent of asylum cases contain proven or \n     possible fraud.\n\n  Our system as it is being run today is not lawful, it is not \nprincipled, it does not have integrity, and it has no ability to carry \nout the wishes of the American people--which has always been to have a \nsystem that is effective and lawful and serves the national interests.\n  And remember, all of these entries are in addition to the huge flow \nof annual permanent immigration into the United States as well as work \nauthorization. That is all in addition to the lawful flow that we have. \nBetween 2000 and today, the U.S. Government issued nearly 30 million \nlawful visas for individuals and their relatives to either live \npermanently in the United States or to come to take a job. We are a \ngenerous Nation. We have a very generous immigration policy--more than \nany nation in the world. And the American people have the right to \nexpect that our laws are enforced, that we don't have open \nborders. They have never believed in that, and no official, to my \nknowledge, will stand up publicly and advocate for that, although many \nof the policies being promoted would result in just that.\n\n  Now consider what will happen to our system if the President goes \nthrough with his plan to provide work authorizations for another 5 \nmillion people living illegally in the United States. What immigration \nlaw will be left, colleagues? The government is not enforcing visa \noverstays, illegal entries, illegal work, or asylum fraud. And now the \nPresident is just going to start printing millions of work permits for \npeople illegally in the country--after Congress has loudly declared \n``no.''\n  Congress has refused to pass his plan. What is the President's excuse \nfor wanting to do this unlawful act? He says Congress won't act. But \nCongress acts when it refuses to do something the President decides. \nThat is an act of Congress, and Congress has declined to provide \namnesty in the method the President asked for and has been advocating \nfor. Therefore, he is not given any power to ignore current law that he \nwishes to change and Congress didn't change.\n  This is very serious. I say to my colleagues--Republicans, \nDemocrats--this is more than a dispute over who should enter and what \nkind of amnesty we should have, if any; it is a challenge to the \nintegrity of our constitutional order and a challenge to this Senate.\n\n       If the President persists in his plan, anyone ICE officers \n     come into contact with will simply assert protections and \n     eligibility under this new Executive action. Now, get this. \n     So we are going to give amnesty to 5 million or 6 million \n     people. Well, if there are 11 million, 12 million people here \n     today, what happens to the other 5 million to 6 million? If \n     any ICE officer comes into contact with them, those \n     individuals will assert they are entitled to protections and \n     eligibility under the new Executive action. New illegal \n     immigrants will flood across, as they did after the\n\n[[Page S5337]]\n\n     President's Executive amnesty for people under the age of 30 \n     because they will believe--correctly, it appears to me--that \n     if they can get into the country unlawfully, they will never \n     be deported. They will wait until the President--this \n     President or the next President or some other President--\n     gives them work privileges in the United States to take jobs \n     that Americans need to be doing at a time of extraordinarily \n     high unemployment, at a time when we have the lowest \n     workplace participation rate since the 1970s. Illegal \n     immigrants won't even have to wait for Congress to pass \n     amnesty if this goes through.\n\n  So I ask: What immigration law will be left? The President has simply \ndecided--on his own, without Congress or legal authority--that the \nimmigration laws protecting the jobs and wages of U.S. workers won't \nexist anymore. The President has taken it upon himself to decide who \ncan enter the United States and who can work in the United States--by \nthe millions--regardless of what laws have been passed. The President \noften talks of justice, but one of the gravest injustices that has been \ndone is to deny the American people the protections of their laws. The \nlaws on the books in America today are the laws of the people of the \nUnited States, and they protect working people from job competition at \na time of high unemployment.\n  My message to the American people today is this. You can stop it. We \ncan stop it, together. We will not let this lawlessness stand, and that \nfight begins with a vote on the House-passed bill just last Friday to \nblock this new Executive action the President would undertake. The \nSenate cannot be allowed to surrender to the President's lawlessness. \nIt cannot. So I am calling today on every Senator to support this bill \nfrom the House and to demand that Majority Leader Reid call it up, and \nlet's have a vote. Every American needs to know where their leaders \nstand on this issue.\n  Let me share a message with my friends on the other side of the \naisle. Each of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will have \nto decide whether they work for Majority Leader Reid, whether they work \nfor the President of the United States, or whether they work for their \nconstituents.\n  I remember in 2007 when President Bush got it in his head that we had \nto have amnesty, without being able to present any compelling reason \nfor us to believe the lawlessness would end in the future--and that \neffort failed. Three-fourths, I believe, or at least well more than \nhalf of the Republicans, opposed their President on this. Why shouldn't \nDemocrats now stand up and oppose President Obama if he is overreaching \nin his policies?\n  So I will ask this. Will my Democratic colleagues protect the jobs of \nthe American people? Will they protect the borders of this Nation and, \nin essence, the sovereignty of this Nation? Will my colleagues demand \nthe Senate leader bring this House bill up for a vote? If my colleagues \noppose these Executive actions, as some on the other side of the aisle \nhave indicated they do, there is only one way to demonstrate it with \nintegrity: Support the House bill and demand it receive a vote in the \nSenate.\n  There is nothing in that bill that is wrong or unprincipled or \nimproper. There are two bills coming over from the House--a good bill \nthat improves the technical enforcement issues that are at the border \ntoday that are making it hard to enforce the law. They improve that in \none piece, and they provide almost $700 million in funding to help \nimprove that situation and take care of the humanitarian need there. \nBut they passed a second bill that simply uses a traditional \ncongressional power to bar the President of the United States and any \nof his officers from spending moneys of the United States to execute \nsome amnesty or work permit program.\n  Every member of the public--whether in a red State or a blue State or \na purple State--ought to call their Member of Congress and Senators and \nask them where they stand on this issue. Ask them if they support the \nHouse bill to block this executive amnesty that would be contrary to \nlaw, contrary to heritage, contrary to the President's own words on \nmore than one occasion. Will your elected representatives demand that \nwe at least have a vote in the Senate? You are a citizen of this \ncountry. You are entitled to a clear answer to the question.\n  We work for the people, and I believe the people are not happy with \nus. I believe the people rightly believe this Nation should have a \nprincipled immigration policy, one that is enforced and carried out \nfairly and objectively, that serves the national interest, an \nimmigration policy where a person in another country who wants to come \nto the United States can read the requirements and submit an \napplication, and if they meet those requirements and meet the limits of \nour law can be admitted to America, and those who do not, are not.\n  That is what nations all over the world have. There is not anything \nwrong with that. No nation, particularly any developed nation, can just \nopen its borders to every individual who would like to come here. It \njust cannot be done. The American people have a right to expect that. \nThat is what they have wanted, that is what they have demanded of their \nPresidents and their Congresses for 40 years, and that is what the \npowers that be, the masters of the universe, surreptitiously and openly \nand otherwise have blocked, refused to give them. They are entitled to \nthat. I believe it truly, and I believe they will get it.\n  This issue is not going away. We are going to confront it here in the \nSenate. I believe in the end the American people will be able to hold \nto account those who do not support a lawful system of immigration.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/08/05/senate-section/article/S5337-1", "month": "08", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ADJOURNMENT UNTIL FRIDAY, AUGUST 8, 2014, AT 9:15 A.M.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.
