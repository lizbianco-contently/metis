Every respectable economist has said that the shortsighted \narbitrary cuts known as sequester will cost American jobs. Medical \nresearchers say these painful cuts will set medical research in this \ncountry back decades, potentially costing the world a cure for cancer, \nflu, AIDS, and many other diseases against which we are on the cusp of \nmaking great headway. The sequester we know will cost us investments in \neducation that give children a shot at success and keep American \nworkers competitive. We also know the sequester will slash the safety \nnet that keeps millions of senior citizens, children and veterans and \nlow-income families from descending into poverty.\n  I know the sequester is as bad for national security as it is for the \neconomy. These cuts have grounded one-third of U.S. combat aircraft, \nslashed troop training budgets, and kept an aircraft carrier that \nshould have been headed to the Persian Gulf and other places stranded \nin port instead. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of civilian employees \nof the Department of Defense, employees who support military missions \ncarried out by servicemembers overseas, have been furloughed.\n  It is not too late to reverse these hard-hearted cuts, cuts that were \nnever supposed to take effect in the first place. The sequester was \ndesigned to be so painful it would force Democrats and Republicans to \ncompromise and find a smart, responsible way to reduce the deficit. \nThere was compromise on one side with the Democrats and, of course, \nnone, as usual, with Republicans on the other side.\n  But we have not given up on reversing these cuts and choosing that \nresponsible path. We have cut the deficit in half over the last 3 \nyears, by more than $2.6 trillion. While there is more work to be done, \nwe should be making targeted cuts while investing in that which makes \nAmerica grow.\n  It is clear we have reduced the debt by $2.6 trillion and the yearly \ndeficit has been cut in half over the last 3 years.\n  The way to pursue this type of sound fiscal policy is through regular \norder--regular order of the budget process. While there is more work to \nbe done in the cuts I have talked about, we should be making targeted \ncuts while investing in what makes America grow. The American economy \nis poised to grow. It is growing now--not strong enough, not fast \nenough, but it is growing. All we have to do is get out of the way.\n  According to a report released last week by the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office, reversing the sequester would create an \nadditional 900,000 jobs. It would increase gross domestic product by \none percentage point. That is 1\n\n[[Page S5990]]\n\nmillion jobs right there. The United States just dug its way out of the \ngreat recession. We have seen 40 straight months of job growth, with \nprivate sector employers adding more than 7.2 million jobs. But we \ncannot afford to reject almost 1 million new jobs. Congress must \nreverse the sequester and stop manufacturing crises.\n  If Republicans force us to the brink of another shutdown for \nideological reasons, the economy will suffer. I suggest to any of my \nRepublican colleagues who have this idea, give a call to Newt Gingrich. \nHe will return your phone calls. Ask him how it worked. It was \ndisastrous for Newt Gingrich, the Republicans, and the country. It \ndidn't work then and it will not work now. If Republicans threaten \ncatastrophic default on the Nation's bills, the economy will suffer, \nand that is an understatement.\n  If Republicans refuse to work with Democrats to negotiate a \nreasonable budget to reverse these deep cuts, the economy will suffer. \nIt is time to remove the stumbling blocks that are preventing the \nAmerican economy from recovering and expanding.\n  It has been 129 days since the Senate passed its reasonable, \nprogrowth budget.\n  Remember, the Republicans said: We want regular order. We want a \nbudget.\n  We passed the budget. Now they will not follow regular order. They \nwill not let us even go to conference. We have asked consent to go to \nconference with the House 17 different times. As long as Senate \nRepublicans refuse to allow Budget Committee chairwoman Patty Murray to \nnegotiate a budget compromise with her House Republican counterparts, \nthe economy is at risk. It is time to set aside partisan differences \nand work to find common ground.\n  Passing the Senate Transportation appropriations bill that is on the \nfloor now would be a good step toward restoring regular order. This \nmeasure, the Transportation bill, would create jobs rebuilding \nAmerica's deficient infrastructure and renew the Nation's commitment to \nmake affordable housing available to low-income families.\n  I commend the appropriations committee, led by Barbara Mikulski. The \nsubcommittee, whose work is now before the Senate, is led by Patty \nMurray. They have done wonderful work. I believe some of my Republican \ncolleagues are as eager to return to regular order, passing an \nappropriations bill, as I am. I do believe that. They have to break \naway from the pack. I hope these reasonable Republicans will continue \nto work with us to advance this important bipartisan measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/29/senate-section/article/S5990-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, Sunday brought the sad news that my dear \nfriend Col. George E. ``Bud'' Day passed away. He was 88 years old. To \nsay he lived a full life would be quite an understatement. His was \nfilled with so many extraordinary experiences, adventures, challenges, \naccomplishments, and with such love, compassion, and courage that it \ncould have supplied enough experiences, excitement, and satisfaction \nfor 10 lifetimes.\n  Bud knew defeats and triumphs on a scale few will ever know. He lived \nin moments filled with every conceivable emotion. He knew terror and \nsuffering. He knew joy and deliverance. He knew solidarity, self-\nrespect, and dignity.\n  Knowing him as well as I did, I am certain he faced his end satisfied \nthat he had made the most of his time on Earth. He will have faced it \nwith courage as he faced all adversity. He will have faced it with \ngratitude for the love and companionship for his beloved wife and best \nfriend Dorie, his sons Steve and George, and his twin girls, Sandra and \nSonya. He will have faced it with humility for having had the honor to \nserve his country with distinction in three wars: World War II, the \nKorean war, and the Vietnam war.\n\n  I had the honor of being Bud's friend for almost five decades of his \n88 years. We met in 1967 when the Vietnamese left me to die in the \nprison cell Bud shared with Maj. Norris Overly. Bud and Norris wouldn't \nlet me die. They bathed me, fed me, nursed me, encouraged me, and \nordered me back to life. Norris did much of the work, but Bud did all \nhe could considering he too had recently been near death--shot, bombed, \nbeaten savagely by his captors, and his arm broken in three places. He \nwas a hard man to kill, and he expected the same from his subordinates. \nThey saved my life--a big debt to repay, obviously. But more than that, \nBud showed me how to save my self-respect and my honor, and that is a \ndebt I can never repay.\n  Bud was a fierce--and I mean really fierce--resister. He could not be \nbroken in spirit no matter how broken he was in body. Those who knew \nBud after the war could see how tough he was, but, my God, to have \nknown him in prison--confronting our enemies day in and day out, never, \never yielding. He defied men who had the power of life and death over \nus. To witness him sing the national anthem in response to having a \nrifle pointed at his face--well, that was something to behold. \nUnforgettable. No one had more guts than Bud or greater determination \nto do his duty and then some, to keep faith with his country and his \ncomrades whatever the cost. Bud was my commanding officer but more, he \nwas my inspiration, as he was for all the men who were privileged to \nserve under him.\n  Nothing offers more compelling testimony to Bud's guts and \ndetermination and his patriotism than the account of his escape from \ncaptivity. In the entire war he was the only American who managed to \nescape from North Vietnam.\n  In 1967 then-major Bud Day commanded a squadron of F-100s that served \nas forward air controllers over North Vietnam and Laos. They were \ncalled the Mistys, named for Bud's favorite song. Theirs was probably \nthe most dangerous combat duty in the Air Force, and they suffered high \ncasualties.\n  On August 26 Bud Day was one of those casualties. Bud was shot down \nby a surface-to-air missile 20 miles inside of North Vietnam. He hit \nthe fuselage of his F-100 when he ejected, breaking his arm, damaging \nhis eye, and injuring his back. Bud was immediately captured by North \nVietnamese militia. He was interrogated by his captors in an \nunderground prison camp. When he refused to answer their questions, \nthey staged a mock execution. Then they hung him by his feet for hours \nand beat him. Believing he was too badly injured to escape, they tied \nhim up loosely and left him guarded by two green teenage soldiers. They \nmisjudged him. On his fifth day of captivity he untied his ropes and \nescaped.\n  Bud stayed on the run for about 2 weeks. He wasn't certain how long \nhe was free. He lost track of time. He made it across the DMZ and into \nSouth Vietnam. A bomb, however, had fallen near him his second night on \nthe run, striking him with shrapnel, concussing him and rupturing his \neardrums. Limping, bleeding, starving, and in great pain, Bud kept \nheading south across rivers, through dense jungles, over hills, \ncrawling sometimes on his hands and knees, evading enemy patrols and \nsurviving on berries, frogs, and rainwater.\n  On the last night of Bud's escape he arrived within 2 kilometers of a \nforward marine. Sensibly judging it more dangerous to approach the \nguarded base at night than to wait until morning when the marine guards \ncould see he was an American, Bud slept one more night in the jungle.\n  Early the next morning he encountered a Viet Cong patrol. He was shot\n\n[[Page S5991]]\n\ntrying to hobble to the base, recaptured, and returned to the camp he \nhad escaped, where he was tortured some more.\n  A few days later Bud's captors took him to the prison we called the \nPlantation, where I would meet him 2 months later. He was one of the \nmost grievously injured pilots to arrive in Hanoi. Norris helped nurse \nhim back to some semblance of health, although he would never fully \nrecover from his wounds. Then Bud helped Norris nurse me.\n  Whenever I felt my spirits and resistance flag, I looked to Bud for \nthe courage to continue and for the example of how to serve my country \nin difficult circumstances. Bud was the bravest man I ever knew, and I \nhave known more than a few. He was great company too and made it \npossible to actually have fun in prison once in a while. He received \nthe Medal of Honor when he came home--the highest of his many \ndecorations for valor. Despite his injuries, he managed to regain \nflying status and commanded a flight wing at Eglin Air Force Base.\n  When Bud ultimately retired from the Air Force, he practiced law. \nAfter his service in World War II but before he deployed to the Korean \nwar, he graduated from college and law school. He devoted his practice \nto defending the interests of his fellow veterans.\n  Bud and I stayed close through all the years that have passed since \nour war. We talked often. We saw each other regularly. He campaigned \nwith me in all my campaigns and advised me always. We argued sometimes, \nagreed more often, laughed a lot, and always enjoyed each other's \ncompany. I am going to miss him terribly.\n  Even though Bud had reached advanced years, for some reason I could \nnever imagine Bud yielding to anything--even, I thought, to the laws of \nnature. Tough old bird that he was, I always thought he would outlive \nus all. But he is gone now to a heaven I expect he imagined would look \nlike an Iowa cornfield in early winter, filled with pheasants.\n  I will miss Bud every day for the rest of my life, but I will see him \nagain. I know I will. I will hunt the field with him, and I look \nforward to it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I rise to eulogize a great American about \nwhom Senator McCain has just spoken. It has been said it is the soldier \nwho has given us our most important freedoms over the course of our \nhistory. That is certainly a true statement in the case of Air Force \nCol. George ``Bud'' Day.\n  Colonel Day was a good friend of Senator McCain's. He was a resident \nof Florida, living in the Fort Walton Beach area. Sadly, he passed \naway, but at the very extended life's age of 88.\n  I want to--in addition to Senator McCain's comments--take a moment to \nhonor and remember this American hero, who was one of the most highly \ndecorated service members this country has ever seen. He was a Medal of \nHonor recipient. He was a veteran of three wars--World War II, the \nKorean war, and the war in Vietnam.\n  Because his F-100 fighter jet was shot down, he ended up being a \nprisoner of war in Vietnam for nearly 6 years, and there in Hanoi he \nand Senator McCain became cellmates.\n  When asked about their experience together, Senator McCain said:\n\n       I owe my life to Bud, and much of what I know about \n     character and patriotism. He was the bravest man I ever knew.\n\n  Senator McCain has just recounted a number of those things. I do not \nknow, but I have heard it said, either from Colonel Day or Senator \nMcCain, that it was John McCain who was put into that cell nearly \ndead--after his arm was broken when he ejected from his aircraft, and \nafter he had been beaten--and Bud Day nursed him back to health.\n  After the POWs were released from Vietnam, interestingly, Colonel Day \nreturned to active duty, and he returned to active flying status. He \nretired in 1977 as the Air Force's most decorated officer.\n  It has also been said that a nation can be judged by how it treats \nthose who have borne its battles. After he left the Air Force, Colonel \nDay--listen to this--continued public service. He went to law school. \nHe practiced law and he championed veterans' issues.\n  So I wanted to take a moment, after an emotional speech by Senator \nMcCain, to say that I say, and many are saying, a little prayer of \nthanks that Colonel Bud Day helped preserve the freedoms of this \ncountry with his service to this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Tuttle\n\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I wish to pay my respect to an American \nhero, LCpl Benjamin Tuttle, who sacrificed his life for this country in \nsupport of Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  Lance Corporal Tuttle graduated from Gentry High School in Gentry, \nAR, in 2012. His appreciation for athletics kept him active after \nschool as a football player, wrestler, and track runner. As a student, \nhe made his interest in serving in the Marines well known. He shared \nhis love for his country and the corps during a trip back to his alma \nmater last fall.\n  His love of country was coupled with love for his family. In a \nFacebook post, he wrote he would be back home in October and was \nanxious to fish, go to dinner, and just hang out with family and \nfriends.\n  Lance Corporal Tuttle was serving aboard the USS Nimitz. He was \nassigned to the Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 323, Marine Aircraft \nGroup 11, 3rd Aircraft Wing, I Marine Expeditionary Force, Marine Corps \nAir Station Miramar in California.\n  Lance Corporal Tuttle was only 19 when he gave his life for his \ncountry. Lance Corporal Tuttle is a true American hero who made the \nultimate sacrifice. I ask my colleagues to keep his family and friends \nin their thoughts and prayers.\n  On behalf of a grateful nation, I humbly offer my sincerest gratitude \nfor his patriotism and selfless service.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the need for economic growth remains one of \nthe most pressing and challenging issues we face today in our country. \nUnfortunately, over the past decade economic growth has been stagnant, \ncreating difficulties for small businesses, for working families, for \nrecent college graduates, and for entrepreneurs.\n  If I have a goal here, it is to make certain every American has the \nopportunity to pursue what we all know is the American dream. For that \nto be possible, we need a growing economy that accomplishes many \nthings, including creating the opportunity for people to go to work, to \npay off their loans, to feed their families, to put food on their \nfamilie's table, and to save for their future.\n  Last month the Senate had an opportunity to do something positive \nabout our economy. We spent a significant amount of time addressing \nthis issue of immigration, trying to fix our Nation's broken \nimmigration system.\n  Sensible and overdue improvements to our Nation's immigration laws \nwill spur economic growth and create American jobs. This is why I have \nbeen so interested to see how highly skilled and entrepreneurial \nimmigrants create jobs and contribute to the U.S. economy. It is that \naspect of our Nation's broken immigration system I wish to talk about \ntoday.\n\n[[Page S5992]]\n\n  There is an economic imperative to improve our Nation's immigration \nlaws. Many of our Nation's leading businesses struggle to find the \ntalent they need to grow and compete in global markets. According to \nthe Partnership for a New American Economy, American businesses are \nprojected to need an estimated 800,000 workers with advanced STEM \ndegrees by 2018 but will only find 550,000 American graduates with an \nadvanced STEM education.\n  First and foremost, we must do more to prepare Americans for careers \nin science, technology, and engineering. I have been encouraged that \nseveral immigration proposals before Congress aim to improve STEM \neducation for Americans so that one day we will no longer be required \nto seek outside labor to meet our country's needs.\n  In the short term, we must work to equip Americans with the skills of \nthe 21st century. We also need to create a path for highly skilled \nforeign students to stay in the United States, where their ideas, \ntalents, and intellect can fuel American economic growth.\n\n  Legislation I introduced with Senator Warner of Virginia called \nStartup Act 3.0 creates visas for foreign students who graduate from an \nAmerican university with a master's or Ph.D. in science, technology, \nengineering, or mathematics. These skilled workers would be granted \nconditional status contingent on them filling a needed gap in the U.S. \nworkforce. This will help growing American companies secure the talent \nthey need now for current job openings. Without this help companies \nwill have to look elsewhere, will find it difficult to find the \nqualified workers they need, and will likely open locations overseas, \ntaking the jobs with them.\n  When I was in Silicon Valley last year, I met with executives at \nFacebook. They told me they were ready to hire close to 80 foreign-born \nbut U.S.-educated individuals in California, but their H-1B visas were \nnot granted. Rather than forgo these skilled workers, the company hired \nthem anyway. That caught my attention, but the story is that they \nplaced them in Dublin, Ireland, not in the United States. Facebook was \nultimately able to get visas for these workers after training them in \nIreland, but all too often companies end up housing the jobs \npermanently overseas. When this happens, it is not only those specific \njobs that are lost. In this case we didn't just lose 80 jobs but also \nthe many supporting jobs and economic activity associated with those \njobs.\n  Even more damaging, more damning, more frustrating to me is that many \nof these highly skilled workers who are now employed in some other \ncountry will become entrepreneurs that will start successful businesses \nthere, not in the United States. Of the 80 engineers working in Dublin, \nIreland, for Facebook, I have no doubt but that one or more of them \nwill be the next originator, the next innovator for companies such as \nFacebook. We want them in the United States creating that opportunity \nhere for Americans.\n  Immigrants to the United States have a long history of creating \nbusinesses in our country. Today, 1 in every 10 Americans employed at a \nprivately owned U.S. company works at an immigrant-owned firm. \nImmigrants are more than twice as likely as native-born Americans to \nstart a business. Of the current Fortune 500 companies, more than 40 \npercent were founded by a first- or second-generation American. Ranked \nNo. 73 on that list is Google, which was cofounded in 1998 by Sergey \nBrin, an immigrant from Russia. Sergey and his cofounder Larry Page \ndeveloped Google as Ph.D. students while at Stanford University. Google \nis now the world's top search engine, generates more than $50 billion \nin revenue annually, and employs tens of thousands. We need to create \nan immigration system that welcomes more immigrants like Sergey Brin.\n  Our bill, Startup Act 3.0, creates an entrepreneur's visa for \nforeign-born entrepreneurs currently in the United States. Those \nindividuals with a good idea, capital, and a willingness to hire \nAmericans would be able to stay in the United States and grow their \nbusinesses here. Each immigrant entrepreneur would be required to \ncreate jobs for Americans. Providing a way for an immigrant \nentrepreneur to stay in the United States and create American jobs \nmakes economic sense.\n  Earlier this year the Kauffman Foundation, headquartered in Kansas \nCity, studied the economic impact of the entrepreneur's visa in Startup \nAct 3.0. Using conservative estimates, the Kauffman Foundation predicts \nthat the entrepreneur's visa alone could generate 500,000 to 1.6 \nmillion new jobs during the next 10 years. These are real jobs with \nreal economic impact that could boost GDP, by their estimate, by 1.5 \npercent or more. When we talk about economic growth and creating \nopportunity, a boost in GDP by 1.5 percent is a major accomplishment.\n  Recognizing this potential, several bills create visas for immigrant \nentrepreneurs. It is important that these visas be structured in a way \nto facilitate job creation. Unnecessarily high investment and revenue \nrequirements and burdensome mandates, such as having to submit a \nbusiness plan to Washington, DC, bureaucrats, threaten to diminish the \nimpact these entrepreneurial visas could have.\n  Although well-intentioned, the INVEST visa created in the Senate \nimmigration bill fell prey to some of these traps. To improve that \nidea, I developed an amendment with the help of entrepreneurs, \ninvestors, and startup policy experts. This amendment would reduce \npaperwork and reporting requirements so that entrepreneurs could spend \nmore time building their businesses, allow entrepreneurs to secure \ninitial investment from those closest to them, add flexibility to the \nway in which startup employees are compensated to account for \ngeographic and industry differences, and clarify that the jobs created \nby immigrant entrepreneurs must be held by Americans. A list of more \nthan 30 startup companies, investors, and business leaders and \nimmigration attorneys supported this amendment.\n\n  Sadly, like many other amendments, it was blocked from even receiving \nconsideration. But in the end, that may not matter. The Speaker of the \nHouse has said the Senate immigration bill is ``dead on arrival.'' \nInstead of taking up Senate legislation, the House is pursuing, \nperhaps, a more thoughtful, methodical approach to immigration--writing \nseveral targeted bills that address aspects of our broken immigration \nsystem.\n  Congress crafts better policy when it is done in manageable bite \nsizes. In my view we do not have to look far in the past to see what \nhappens when Congress bites off more than it can chew. Implementation \nof the Affordable Care Act and Dodd-Frank offer two examples of the \nunintended consequences of passing giant bills with multi-thousand \npages that are poorly understood. In fact, it was the 1986 \ncomprehensive immigration bill that left us with the many problems we \nare attempting to fix today. Passing a series of smaller more targeted \nimmigration bills will result in better policy and achieve better \nresults for the American people.\n  Moreover, there is broad agreement within Congress on many aspects of \nimmigration policy. Last year the House of Representatives passed two \nimmigration bills. One would have repurposed visas from the diversity \nlottery to STEM visas for some of our most talented foreign-born U.S. \ngraduates. Another would have eliminated the employment-based, green \ncard per-country cap allowing American employers to have access to the \nbest talent regardless of where a potential employee was born.\n  This bill passed 389 to 15 in the House. Yet neither received a vote \nin the Senate because of adherence to the approach that says we can't \ndo anything unless we do everything. This line of thinking has \nprevented progress on important challenges facing our country for a \nlong time.\n  Republicans and Democrats agree that creating opportunities for \nhighly skilled and entrepreneurial immigrants to contribute to our \neconomy is beneficial to America. I strongly hope Congress will finally \ncome together and pass what we can agree upon now while continuing to \nwork on the issues that divide us. In my view, we can no longer allow \nourselves to be hostage to the all-or-nothing strategy or wait until \nafter the next election.\n  Right now other countries are taking advantage of our inability to \nsolve problems and are exploiting our broken immigration system. Since \nI arrived in the Senate in 2011, at least seven countries have changed \ntheir policies and\n\n[[Page S5993]]\n\nlaws to better attract highly skilled and entrepreneurial immigrants. \nOne of those countries, Canada, even went so far as to buy a billboard \nin Silicon Valley in an attempt to poach the best and brightest.\n  We must address this problem, and the best way to do so is in a \nmeasured and incremental way. The benefits to our Nation's economy will \nbe great and the goodwill produced by working in a bipartisan manner on \ntargeted solutions will sow the seeds of trust necessary to solve the \nproblems where disagreement remains.\n  So we will see what happens now in the immigration debate, but my \nhope is that if we are unable to pass so-called broad-based immigration \nreform, if we are unable to come up with sensible solutions in an \nunderstandable legislative package, let's at least work to accomplish \nthose things on which there is broad agreement and continue to solve \nthose problems where there remains disagreement today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue that \nis vital for the future health and well-being of citizens in our \ncountry; that is, funding for medical research for the National \nInstitutes of Health. Unfortunately, NIH funding, like many other \nimportant Federal priorities, is being impacted by the across-the-board \nspending cuts. As we all know, we want to see that budget go down, we \nwant to see the debt reduced, but we have to do it in a sensible way, \nnot with a hammer.\n  Sequestration was never intended to be implemented and was supposed \nto bring Democrats and Republicans together to focus on smart solutions \nto reducing our debt.\n  I am a supporter of the work of the debt commission. I believe there \nis a way we can bring down our debt in a significant way. But I do not \nthink we meant to have sequestration implemented in the way it is being \nimplemented and seeing the kind of cuts we are seeing. These cuts are \ncreating headwinds against short-term economic growth, reducing access \nto important services, and threatening our Nation's leadership in areas \nsuch as medical research. Congress needs to take a broader, long-term \nview toward our debt and deficit. That is why I support the Senate \nbudget which would replace the sequester with targeted spending cuts \nand additional revenue, reducing the deficit in a balanced way.\n  I know Senator Murray, who heads up the Budget Committee, has been \ntrying valiantly to get this budget to a conference committee, which is \nsupported by the Democrats in the Senate and supported by Republicans \nsuch as Senator McCain and Senator Collins. We have been stopped every \nstep of the way, but this should go through regular order, into a \nconference committee so we can work out these differences with the \nHouse and replace sequester with something that makes sense.\n  Today I want to focus on the impact of sequestration on this \nparticular area of the Federal budget; that is, medical research. It \nmay not be the first thing you think of when you think about these cuts \nand what they mean, but I hope when you listen to my stories it brings \nout a whole new significance.\n  In the last century we have made enormous strides through medical and \nscientific research to understand the world around us. This research \nhas led to a greater understanding of the nature and cause of disease \nand spurred a new generation of therapies and intervention to treat \ndiseases.\n  Our country has been a leader in this era of scientific discovery, \nand we are responsible for developing many of the innovative therapies \nand scientific advances that have changed the face of science and given \nhope to millions of patients across the world. These advancements have \nbeen made possible by our commitment to funding research through the \nNational Institutes of Health.\n  Currently, the NIH is the largest source of medical research funding \nin the world. Through its 27 Institutes, NIH funds research to prevent, \ndetect, better treat, and even cure fatal and debilitating diseases \nsuch as cancer, heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer's, arthritis, \ndiabetes, and mental health issues. The Institutes also fund basic \nscience which provides the foundation for future breakthroughs in all \nfields of scientific discovery.\n  Researchers in my State tell me they cannot think of anything they do \nclinically that was not influenced by basic research made possible by \nNIH funding. Think of the advancements we have made. These clinical \nadvancements are critical to improving health and saving the lives of \nmillions of Americans.\n  To truly understand the importance of NIH, I think it is important to \nunderstand the impact on our own people, so I want to share some of the \nways NIH funding has had influence in my State on people, on people \nsuch as Jim from Edina, MN.\n  Jim was 36 when he was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor in \n1998. He was a professional engineer. He had an MBA from Northwestern \nKellogg School of Management and worked in the family's 56-year-old \nair-conditioning and heating business, Owens Companies, Inc. He had \neverything to live for. But when Jim was diagnosed, there were almost \nno treatment options beyond radical surgery and radiation, so Jim \nlooked for other options.\n  Over the course of the next 10 years he participated in multiple \nclinical trials and some seven treatments--all made possible by \nresearch grant funding. Jim passed away at age 46. But thanks to the \nclinical trials, he lived over 10 years, allowing his young son Max the \nchance to get to know his dad. He also was able to continue his \nlifelong athletic endeavors with a ride across the country with \nLivestrong in 2004 as part of the Tour of Hope, spreading the message \nof hope and survivorship.\n  The clinical trials, however, did not just help Jim. This is the key \npart, Mr. President, whether you are from Connecticut or from \nMinnesota. One of the trials in which Jim participated proved so \neffective that it is now the standard treatment regimen for people who \nare diagnosed with the same cancer as Jim. That would not have been \npossible if Jim had not been willing to go through those treatments and \nif they had not been funded by NIH.\n  Then there is Karen, a 48-year-old wife, mother of two teenagers, and \na teacher. She was diagnosed with leukemia in August of 2005. With her \ntype of leukemia, the prognosis is relatively good, and using the \ncurrent treatments available she remained in remission until 2009. Then \nin the summer of 2009 she started feeling sick again and received news \nthat the cancer had returned. Her only treatment option was a bone \nmarrow transplant which had a 25-percent mortality rate. She and her \nhusband visited with specialists and discovered that she had a mutation \nthat did not respond to the current--at that time--frontline \nmedication.\n  That is when she learned about clinical trials. In January 2010 she \nbegan her clinical trial journey and has now been involved in two \nclinical trials. She responded well to the second clinical trial and \nhas been in remission for over 2 years. Her kids are now 17 and 13, and \nshe and her husband are preparing to send their oldest daughter off to \ncollege in the fall of 2014.\n  NIH funding supports the research centers that make these stories \nlike Jim's and Karen's possible. In Minnesota we have the Paul and \nSheila Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy Center, which is supported by NIH \nfunding. This center has 46 faculty members in 7 University of \nMinnesota colleges and schools and receives $6 million in annual \nfunding from NIH.\n  Together, these scientists are conducting over 10 active clinical \nresearch studies that are giving hope to parents and patients with \nmuscular dystrophy. This facility believes science is more than just \nabout the research. The researchers here have volunteered hundreds of \nthousands of hours helping to educate the people they serve and \nensuring these families have access to support networks. All of this is \nmade possible in part because of Federal investment in the NIH.\n\n[[Page S5994]]\n\n  These are inspiring stories, but supporting NIH is important for \nanother reason--meeting the skyrocketing cost of treating chronic \ndiseases. In total, today more than half of Americans are suffering \nfrom one or more chronic diseases. According to the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention, taken together these chronic diseases cause 7 \nin 10 deaths and account for about 75 percent of the $2 trillion we \nspend on medical care. This year it is estimated that almost 1.7 \nmillion people will be diagnosed with cancer, and almost 600,000 are \nprojected to die from this devastating disease. That is approximately \n1,600 people a day.\n  Everyone in this room knows someone who had cancer or has cancer now, \nand 26 million Americans are living with diabetes, with a new case \ndiagnosed every 30 seconds. An estimated 5.2 million Americans are \nliving with Alzheimer's disease, and we know this number will escalate \nrapidly in the coming years as the baby boom generation ages.\n  The growing prevalence of chronic disease is having an impact not \njust on Americans' physical health but on our economy as well. In 2008 \ncancer cost our country over $200 billion. A recent report on diabetes \ncosts shows that the money spent on diabetes care has risen 41 percent, \nfrom $174 billion to $245 billion in the last 5 years, and Alzheimer's \nalone is expected to cost our country over $1 trillion by 2050.\n  All of us as taxpayers help pay that bill because public programs \nsuch as Medicare and Medicaid cover a significant amount of the cost of \ncare and treatment.\n  If we had earlier interventions and treatments that delayed the onset \nof these diseases, we would be able to reduce spending significantly. \nTake Alzheimer's as an example.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It is \nincredibly important in my State. It is the home of the Mayo Clinic, \nthe home of the University of Minnesota where they are now undertaking \nthe simple task of mapping the brain. And talk about what these cuts \nmean--I focused before\n\n[[Page S5995]]\n\non the stories of individual Minnesotans, but I also spoke about the \ncost if we do not do anything, the cost of inaction, the cost of not \ndoing the research, looking at Alzheimer's as an example. If we were \nable to delay the onset of Alzheimer's by just 5 years--this is not \ncuring it; this is simply delaying the onset by 5 years--if we were \nable to delay the onset of Alzheimer's by 5 years, similar to the \neffect that anticholesterol drugs have on preventing heart disease, we \nwould be able to cut the government spending on Alzheimer's care by \nalmost half in 2050. We are talking about billions of dollars.\n\n  The answer, of course, to delay the onset of Alzheimer's by 5 years \nwill not just drop from the sky. It needs dedicated scientists and \ndoctors with the resources to conduct the experimentation and to move \nforward. I have seen what they are doing with mapping the brain. I met \nwith those scientists afterward, and I asked them about the \ngroundbreaking work.\n  They talked about the effect this is having on young scientists who \nare afraid to go into these fields. They don't know if their research \nwill be funded because there is only enough money to fund the research \nthat has been going on for years. So many innovative ideas can be lost \nif this continues.\n  At lunch last week we all heard from Francis Collins, who heads up \nthe NIH. He talked about the hope and exciting developments that are \ngoing on in combating diseases. Yet our country--what a time to step \nback. This is not the time to step back when we are on the verge of \ndelaying the onset of Alzheimer's, of helping so many people, and \nsaving so much money. What we are spending on research is literally a \ndrop in the bucket compared to the cost of the disease.\n  Investment in NIH is not just right to do from a public health \nperspective, it also makes good economic sense. NIH generates tens of \nbillions of dollars in new economic activity across the country each \nyear and supports hundreds of thousands of good jobs.\n  In 2012, NIH funding supported 8,800 jobs in my State alone. \nUnfortunately, Federal investment in medical research has stagnated in \nthe last decade. As a result of sequestration, funding for NIH was \nslashed $1.55 billion this year alone. This cut means 700 fewer \ncompetitive research grants will be funded and 750 fewer patients will \nbe admitted to the NIH clinical center. This reduction comes at a time \nwhen we are funding only 18 percent of potential projects. That is a \nrecord low for the second year in a row.\n  In Minnesota, the University of Minnesota could lose $50 million of \nits $700 million Federal research budget in the next couple of years. \nThis drop in support not only threatens research in the short term but \ncould have devastating effects on innovation in the United States for \nmany years to come.\n  I hear from countless students and researchers who are considering \nleaving the field or even the country because funding is not available \nhere. If we are not going to have the funding, they are going to do \ntheir research in Canada or some other country. We can't allow the \npipeline of future researchers to dry up or move overseas. Investing in \nmedical research is the right thing to do. It is also the smart thing \ndo, and that is why support for this research is not a partisan issue \nin the Senate.\n  I thank Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Mikulski and Ranking \nMember Shelby and the Labor and Health and Human Services Subcommittee \nchairman, Senator Harkin, and Ranking Member Moran for their strong \nleadership on this issue. I applaud the work they have done \nprioritizing NIH funding by providing $31 billion in 2014. This figure \ncould again be cut by billions if we do not replace the sequester with \nsensible, targeted spending cuts similar to what we included in the \nSenate budget.\n  Why put the money aside if we are going to then slash it because of \nsequester, when we all know it should be replaced with more targeted \nspending cuts, something that makes more sense, is a mix of revenue and \nspending cuts as suggested by the Simpson-Bowles Commission and every \nother economic commission that looked at this matter. It is time to \nreplace sequestration with something that makes sense. Cutting research \nthat saves and lengthens people's lives who have Alzheimer's, diabetes, \nand helps people who have autism is the wrong way to go.\n  We all agree about the importance of reining in wasteful spending and \nreducing the deficit and the need for the government to improve its \nfiscal discipline, but we cannot do this in a way that is penny wise \nand pound foolish. Fiscal responsibility is about values and priorities \njust as much as it is about dollars and cents. It is about spending \nsmart as well as spending cuts.\n  I strongly support NIH and the hope it brings to people in my State \nand across the country. I look forward to working with my colleagues in \na bipartisan fashion to replace the cuts imposed by the sequester and \nensure our country maintains its leadership in medical innovation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I wish to thank and join my friend \nand colleague from Minnesota Senator Klobuchar in her remarks about \nTodd Jones. He is one of two very distinguished law enforcement \nnominees who will come before this body for confirmation in the coming \ndays.\n  I wish to join my friend in enthusiastically praising Acting Director \nJones for his perseverance and courage in the past months, indeed \nyears, he has served in this critical position.\n  When we recently went through the debate on sensible commonsense gun \nviolence measures--which, unfortunately, did not pass this body--we \noften heard about the need for more prosecutions, more effective \ninvestigation and pursuit of cases against lawbreakers involving guns. \nTodd Jones is committed to that task. I believe--with many others--that \nthere needs to be more prosecutions and more effective enforcement of \nthese laws.\n  ATF needs more resources to do those prosecutions and it needs more \nleadership, which Todd Jones can provide if he is confirmed and given \nthe mandate from the Senate that he needs and the agency deserves to do \nits work more effectively.\n  In just a few minutes, we will hear from my great friend and \ncolleague from Connecticut about the continuing scourge of gun violence \nand how it continues to take a toll in the absence of effective \nmeasures from the Congress.\n  I join my colleague in urging that this body fulfill its obligation, \nmandate, and responsibility from the American people to do more and do \nit more effectively. We need to adopt sensible measures, such as \nnational background checks, a ban on illegal trafficking and straw \npurchases, a more effective mental health initiative, and school safety \nmeasures, which Todd Jones will bring to this office. He will address \ngun violence and all of the responsibilities within the important \npurview of the ATF.\n  The Alcohol, Traffic, and Firearms Bureau has a long, storied, and \ndistinguished history, and Todd Jones will make it more so through his \nleadership.\n  Equally important, this afternoon we will vote on James Comey--I am \nproud to say he is a resident of Fairfield, CT--as the next Director of \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation. I know this agency well because I \nworked with agents of the FBI day in and day out when I was U.S. \nattorney in Connecticut for 4\\1/2\\ years. I know it well because I have \nseen his work as attorney general of Connecticut. I know it well \nbecause over the years I have come to know the extraordinary men and \nwomen of the FBI.\n  They are extraordinary in their bravery, perseverance, and skill. \nThey are extraordinary in their expertise, experience, and their \nrespect for the law, which is so critical. They have a sense of balance \nand mission along with their dedication to making America safer. Their \nmandate and purview has expanded over the years from the days when car \nthefts and kidnapping comprised a major part of their caseload to now \ncybersecurity, terrorism, and computer hacking.\n  Jim Comey is a man for the modern FBI, an agency with a long and \ndistinguished history that now faces new threats and new \nresponsibilities. He is\n\n[[Page S5996]]\n\ntruly a prosecutor's prosecutor. His life's work has been about law \nenforcement.\n  He began in the U.S. Department of Justice as an assistant U.S. \nattorney in the Southern District of New York. He rose to become Deputy \nChief of the Criminal Division. He soon moved to the job of managing \nassistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, where his \nsuperiors recognized his exceptional ability, his remarkable \ncombination of scholarship, and practical sense of investigation.\n  When they assigned to him responsibility for the terrorist attack on \nthe Khobar barracks in Saudi Arabia, he quickly delivered 14 \nindictments and earned another promotion. This time he was promoted to \nbecome the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. His \nservice there was recognized as remarkably distinguished and \nsuccessful, especially in overseeing that office's terrorism \ninvestigations and prosecutions. He made a priority of corporate \ncrime--white-collar crime.\n  He never feared to take on the toughest of challenges. He prosecuted \nbig businesses but also terrorism. He received the Director's Award for \nsuperior performance and the Henry L. Stimson Medal from the New York \nCity Bar Association.\n  He became Deputy Attorney General, the second highest ranking \nofficial at the Department of Justice. In that job--and much has been \nwritten about this incident in his professional life--he demonstrated \nunbelievable and passionate dedication to the rule of law by standing \nup to his own superiors and in speaking truth to power on a variety of \nissues but most especially when he stood up to some of the President's \nmen, and his own superiors, in saying he would stand for personal \nconstitutional rights at a time when they were threatened. He has been \na person of integrity and dedication to the rule of law--bigger than \nany single person throughout his career--even in the face of that kind \nof tremendous pressure.\n  In my conversations with him, he has also committed himself to the \nvigorous and zealous pursuit of gun violence. I have spoken to him \npublicly and privately about this issue. He testified in response to my \nquestions, and others, and clearly demonstrated his commitment to \neffective enforcement of existing and improved laws, such as background \nchecks and a ban on straw purchases and illegal trafficking.\n  He has also committed himself publicly, and in his conversation with \nme, to a continued crackdown on human trafficking. I wish to thank and \ncommend the FBI for its stunningly successful arrests of 150 pimps. \nThey rescued 105 children in a nationwide crackdown--literally within \nthe past 24 to 48 hours--including 6 children in New Haven, CT.\n\n  This stunning success shows dramatically--including the rescue of six \nchildren in Connecticut--how this invisible, pernicious scourge can hit \nclose to home. It has hit home in Connecticut. I saw it, as attorney \ngeneral of our State, as a crime, a predatory scourge that hits men and \nwomen and children--most searingly and heartbreakingly, children who \nare forced into labor or into sexual exploitation.\n  The FBI's crackdown shows that an effective partnership involving \nlocal police--like law enforcement in New Haven, CT, where six children \nwere rescued--along with State and Federal law enforcement can \neffectively crack down on this scourge. The FBI is to be commended and \nso is Mr. Comey for his commitment to combat this problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is expired.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 \nadditional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. As I said, I commend the FBI and I thank them for \nthis effective action and Mr. Comey for his commitment to continuing \nthat crackdown on human trafficking.\n  I also thank his wife and his family, his five children, for their \ngenerosity in becoming an adoption family; that is, adopting children, \nthrough the licensed foster parents program in Connecticut. I thank \nthem for becoming foster parents, I should say more accurately, and \ncaring for infants and toddlers. They have also donated money to create \na foundation to support children who age out of foster care.\n  He is truly a man dedicated to public service. We will be proud of \nhim as an effective and able leader of the FBI in a challenging time.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/29/senate-section/article/S5996-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5996]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Gun Violence\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, let me associate myself with the remarks \nof my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Blumenthal, as well as the \nmajority leader, who was here earlier today, and Senator Klobuchar--all \nspeaking on behalf of our nominee to head the ATF, as well as Senator \nBlumenthal's remarks on behalf of Fairfield, CT, resident James Comey \nto be the head of the FBI. Very few agencies, other than the ATF and \nthe FBI, are more intricately involved in the preservation of the \nhealth and safety of the American public, and we deserve to have votes \non those nominees tonight and this week.\n  But I also want to associate myself with the other remarks Senator \nKlobuchar made. She talked about our obligation as a body to reverse \nthese very damaging sequester cuts to NIH funding for medical research, \nand she listed some very compelling stories about men and women who \nhave had their lives saved, preserved, lengthened because of \ndiscoveries made through medical research.\n  It is a reminder to the Senate and to the House--to anyone who treads \nupon these two floors--that we hold life and death in our hands with \nthe decisions we make. We decide when we choose to fund or not fund the \nNIH as to whether we are going to give life to people who are waiting \non those kinds of cures and treatments.\n  But, similarly, we make decisions about life and death when we choose \nnot to act, when we choose to do nothing, to sit pat. In this case we \nmake a decision to allow people to die in this country--specifically \n6,633 people since December 14--when we make a choice to do nothing \nabout the scourge of gun violence that continues to plague this Nation.\n  I have tried to come down here every single week--as Senator \nKlobuchar did in speaking about the effects of funding medical research \nin very personal terms--to talk about the implications of doing nothing \nwhen it comes to the increasing levels of gun violence in this country, \nin similarly personal terms.\n  December 14, of course, for most people is easily recognized as the \ndate\n\n[[Page S5997]]\n\nwhen 20 6- and 7-year-olds were killed in Sandy Hook, CT, along with 6 \nadults who cared for them, as well as the gunman and his mother. Since \nthat day, 6,633 people have been killed by guns at a rate of about 30 a \nday--the highest of any civilized nation in the world, and we do \nnothing.\n  One of those, on July 14, was Horsley Shorter, Jr. Horsley managed a \nFamily Dollar store in Tampa, FL. Junior, as he was known, had some \nkids come in occasionally who would try to take things out of the store \nor try to steal. When he had to report them to the police, he would. \nBut this was a very gentle man, and more often than not he would pull \nthe kids aside and try to talk through things with them to try to help \nthem understand what they were doing and what the implications were.\n  He would never do anything to instigate a fight, his friend said. In \nfact, his last words to one of his coworkers was ``the pen is mightier \nthan the sword.''\n  What happened that day was an armed robber came into the store and \ndemanded money from the clerk. According to police, Shorter was inside \nthe office, and he was shot when he ran out to try to help his coworker \nwho was at the counter. The robber then forced the clerk at gunpoint \ninto the parking lot, where he stole the clerk's car and used it to \nescape. According to one friend, Shorter was very close to that \ncoworker, took him under his wing, which was the reason he ran out into \nharm's way to try to save him.\n  This friend said:\n\n       I believe that's why that young guy is alive [today]. \n     Junior wasn't going to watch nobody die. He gave his life for \n     him.\n\n  About 2 weeks earlier, on July 2, Chanice Reed, 22, and Annette Reed, \nher mother, as well as Eddie McCuin, a 10-year-old, were shot in a \ntriple murder in Fort Worth, TX.\n  An hour after the shooter killed his pregnant girlfriend, her mother, \nand her little brother, he walked into the Forest Hill Police \nDepartment, telling officers to arrest him because he ``did something \nbad.'' He was 22 years old. He had a history of domestic violence. He \nwas sentenced to 1 year of deferred adjudication probation because of \nassault.\n  Because of a domestic dispute, and because of his easy access to \nguns, in order to resolve this disagreement, he shot his pregnant \ngirlfriend, her mother, and her 10-year-old little brother.\n  Just a couple days ago, in Bridgeport, CT, Pablo Aquino died. He was \n27 years old. He was described as a ``humble man.'' He was always down \nat the baseball field helping kids because he had a son playing \nbaseball there.\n  He spent his days at the Fairfield County Hunting Club in Westport, \nwhere he tended to horses.\n  He got into an argument--a simple argument--when the suspect decided \nthat the best way to solve this argument was to turn a gun on Pablo, \nkilling him.\n  The next day, the community had a vigil for him. The vigil was to \nremember him but also because they did not have enough money for a \nfuneral. So as the vigil was going on, one of his friends stood out on \nthe corner with an empty tin can of iced-tea mix, asking passersby to \ncontribute a couple cents for a funeral that was expected to cost \n$2,000.\n  Over the July 4 period, there were three shootings in New Haven, CT.\n  At around 10:30 on Wednesday night, police said somebody shot and \nkilled 19-year-old Errol Marshal. His body was discovered on the front \nporch of a home, pronounced dead at the scene.\n  At the same time, investigators found Courtney Jackson, a 26-year-\nold, suffering from a gunshot wound to the stomach.\n  Brian Gibson, 23, of New Haven, was shot outside of a public housing \ncomplex shortly thereafter.\n  All three shootings were connected. All three shootings are due to \nthe fact that too many kids and too many young adults today do not know \nhow to resolve their disputes any other way than getting a gun, and \nalso because in a city such as New Haven guns are like water; they are \nall over the place. They are all over the place because this body does \nnot pass legislation to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. We \nrefuse to pass a bill making it a Federal crime to illegally traffic \nguns.\n  All those seem very dissimilar from Newtown. But then there are ones \nyou hear about that strike you as so similar to the reason why I am \nhere today talking about this, because of the 26 people who died at the \nSandy Hook Elementary School.\n  Not much more than a month after Newtown, the Griego family was \nkilled, all in one fell swoop, in Albuquerque, NM--Greg, 51; Sarah, 40; \nZephania, 9; Jael, 5; and Angelina, 2. The parents were killed by their \nson, the little girls and boy killed by their brother. Nehemiah was 15 \nyears old when he took a semiautomatic weapon to kill his family. Like \nAdam Lanza, the shooter in Newtown, Nehemiah was a troubled teen--more \ntroubled than anyone around could have realized. Like Adam Lanza, he \ntook out his rage on his family, first killing his mother while she lay \nsleeping in her bed. Like Adam Lanza, he had plans to continue his \nkilling spree. He was going to go to the local Wal-Mart before he was \nstopped. He was anticipating getting into a firefight with the police. \nAnd like Adam Lanza, he used an assault weapon that was readily \navailable to him in his own home.\n  Greg, 51; Sarah, 40; Zephania, 9; Jael, 5; Angelina, 2--5 of the \n6,633 people--30 or so a day--who have been killed by guns since \nDecember 14. We are not going to stop them all by passing a piece of \nlegislation on the Senate floor. Background checks will not bring 6,600 \npeople back, nor will a ban on human trafficking, nor will a ban on the \nsale of 30-round magazines or assault weapons. But they will absolutely \nbring some of those people back. They will absolutely lessen the rate \nbelow 30 a day.\n  I am going to continue to come down to the floor week after week to \ntell the stories of victims of gun violence, to give them a voice on \nthe floor of the Senate, so that someday, some time, hopefully soon, \nthis place will wake up to the fact that we do have responsibility over \nlife and death on the floor of the Senate, and it is about time, when \nit comes to the rising incidents of gun violence across this country, \nwe do something about it.\n  I yield back the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Transportation and Housing Appropriations\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I want to notify all of our colleagues \nthat Senator Collins and I have been working together with many of our \ncolleagues on amendments to the transportation and housing bill over \nthe past week. I want to be very clear--that work is continuing. The \nmajority leader has made clear that we are going to keep working on \namendments\n\n[[Page S5998]]\n\non that bill, so everybody should be prepared for more votes.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to continue talking to me and to Senator \nCollins, and we will keep working to get as many amendments as \npossible.\n  Many of you have approached us already with your plans and thoughts. \nI urge the rest of you not to wait until the last minute. Senator \nCollins and I are working with the floor staff to line up votes.\n  I know everyone is anxious to have the August recess occur. We are as \nwell. The sooner we can get the amendments and get this bill completed, \nthe sooner all of us will be able to accomplish that.\n  I know a number of our colleagues on the floor have noted that this \nhas been an open process. That is what Senator Collins and I set out to \ndo, and we are going to make sure that continues.\n  This is a bipartisan bill. I will remind all of us that it got 6 \nRepublican votes in committee and 73 votes to proceed to the open \ndebate we have had this past week. That debate, again, is going to \ncontinue. I am hopeful we can move to a bipartisan finish on a good \nbill that reflects great ideas from both sides of the aisle.\n  I again want to thank Senator Collins for her work on this, and we \nare ready to move forward.\n  I yield the floor to her at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Colleagues, as the chairman of our subcommittee, Senator Murray, has \npointed out, we are continuing to work through the amendments that have \nbeen filed on this bill.\n  I do not think I need to remind any of our colleagues on either side \nof the aisle that the August recess is fast approaching and the Senate \nwill have to wrap up its work on this bill before we adjourn.\n  So I would say to my colleagues, if you have good ideas or even not \nso good ideas about this bill, we urge you to come to the floor and \nfile your amendment and do so as soon as possible.\n  As Chairman Murray has pointed out, there has been an open amendment \nprocess. We have disposed of some amendments; a couple through rollcall \nvotes, a few others through unanimous consent. But we could have done a \nlot more last week had people been willing to come to the floor and \nallow us to proceed to amendments that were filed.\n  I also want to highlight a letter the Appropriations Committee has \nreceived from more than 2,420 national, State, and local organizations, \nand State and local government officials in support of the funding that \nis in the programs that are included in this important bill. This is an \nimportant bill. It is a bill that will help us rebuild our crumbling \ninfrastructure. It is a bill that helps us meet the housing needs of \nhomeless veterans, of disabled senior citizens, of very low-income \nfamilies. It is a bill that will help the private sector create \nthousands of new jobs at a time when our economy needs them--in fact, \nhundreds of thousands of new jobs.\n  It is not surprising to me that so many organizations are lending \ntheir voices in support of this bill. I want to read one quote from the \nletter from these organizations. The letter notes that:\n\n       Through these investments, Congress supports small business \n     job creation, expands our nation's infrastructure capacity, \n     supports economic recovery and growth, reduces homelessness \n     and housing hardships, and promotes lasting community and \n     family economic success.\n\n  I think that is a very good description of the purpose and the \nprograms in this bill.\n  One of the programs in this bill that is extremely popular and has \nbeen used very well to promote economic development and community \nreinvestment in my State is the funding for the Community Development \nBlock Grant Program. That is an area where our bill differs greatly \nfrom the House bill.\n  I want to point out that tomorrow the House of Representatives is \nexpected to consider its version of the fiscal year 2014 Transportation \nand Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill. Think about \nthis. If we pass our bill, they pass their bill, we could actually \nproceed to a conference committee and work out the differences between \nour respective bills. The differences are marked. I do not minimize the \ndifferences in terms of priorities and funding, but that is what \nCongress is all about.\n  If we do pass our bill and the House proceeds to pass its version of \nthe T-HUD appropriations bill, we will be the first but I hope not the \nonly fiscal year 2014 spending bill that is ready for conference, goes \nto conference, and I hope becomes law.\n  Finally, let me say, I recognize the Senate bill is not perfect, \ndespite the heroic efforts Senator Murray and I made in committee and \nthe input and insight from our colleagues that are incorporated into \nthis bill. But it is a good-faith bipartisan effort that attempts to \nstrike the right balance between fiscal responsibility and our Nation's \ninfrastructure and housing needs.\n  I am confident the bill that would come back from conference would \nbe, frankly, at a lower spending level, which I and many on my side of \nthe aisle want to see. But I was encouraged by the Senate's vote last \nweek of 73 to 26 to allow the Senate to proceed to this bill. I know we \ncan make improvements. That is what the amendment process is all about.\n  Again, I want to second what our chairman has said and encourage our \ncolleagues to get their amendments filed and to work with both of us so \nwe can proceed to wrap up this work session on a high note of passing, \non time, an individual appropriations bill. I am willing to work hard \nover the recess to conference the two bills, to get going on that. I \nknow the chairman is as well.\n  I want to thank the chairman and my staff and her staff also for \nworking so hard.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The nomination of Mr. Comey to be the FBI \nDirector.\n\n\n                            Comey Nomination\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I wish to speak about the Comey \nnomination.\n  James Comey, Jr., should be confirmed to be our next Director of the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation. I feel it should be done without \ndelay. Director Mueller has served very well, but his term expires \nearly September. It is imperative the Senate work quickly to confirm \nhis successor.\n  I worked with Ranking Member Grassley to schedule James Comey's \nconfirmation hearing as soon as we returned from the Fourth of July \nrecess. Earlier this month, with Senator Grassley's cooperation, we in \nthe Judiciary Committee unanimously reported the nomination of James \nComey to the floor. However, in contrast with the treatment of previous \nFBI Director nominees--the FBI Director nominees of all preceding \nPresidents--who were all confirmed by the full Senate within a day or \ntwo of being reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee, James Comey is \nthe first FBI Director nominee to be filibustered in Senate history by \neither Republicans or Democrats.\n  In this case, of course, it is the Republicans who are filibustering \na law enforcement position such as this, somebody who was voted out of \nthe committee by every single Republican and Democratic Senator--and \nthen to be filibustered by Republicans on his nomination?\n  We should be voting to confirm James Comey tonight. It has already \ntaken twice as long to bring up this nomination for a vote in the full \nSenate as for any previous FBI Director. President Obama officially \nnominated James Comey on June 21, 38 days ago. No other FBI Director \nhas waited longer than 20 days from nomination to confirmation. The FBI \nDirector plays a very vital role in our national security, and the \nSenate must put an end to these routine delays.\n  Nearly 12 years ago, when the Senate considered President Bush's \nnomination of Robert Mueller to be Director of\n\n[[Page S5999]]\n\nthe FBI on the same day he had been reported by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, I spoke about how the rights of all Americans were at stake \nin the selection of a new FBI Director and how the FBI has \nextraordinary power to affect the lives of ordinary Americans.\n  Contrast that with President Bush, Democrats were in the majority, \nand we Democrats worked to get President Bush's nominee confirmed the \nsame day he came out of committee.\n  We Democrats made sure politics were not in play in the confirmation \nof the FBI Director. Republicans shouldn't allow politics to play in \nthe confirmation of an FBI Director. I said at the time, with Robert \nMueller, I noted the FBI's sweeping investigatory powers, when used \nproperly, can protect all of us by combating crime, espionage, and \nterrorism. But I also warned that unchecked, these same powers could \nundermine our civil liberties and our right to privacy.\n  When I spoke those words, I didn't know that just 40 days later the \nworld--and the FBI -would change dramatically in the wake of the \nterrorist attacks on September 11. It shook this area, including even \nthe Senate because of the anthrax attack, which killed a number of \nindividuals. One of the anthrax letters was addressed to me. As the \nfull Senate considers the President's nomination of James Comey to be \nthe seventh Director of the FBI, what I said in 2001 holds true today. \nWith the increased counterterrorism role of the FBI and the expansion \nof the FBI's surveillance activities, it is even more imperative that \nthe next FBI Director possesses an unflagging commitment to the \nConstitution and the rule of law.\n  James Comey is the right man to lead the FBI. He has had a long and \noutstanding career in law enforcement. He worked for years as a front-\nline prosecutor on a range of cases fighting violent crime, terrorism, \nand white-collar fraud, all of which are at the core of the FBI's \nmission. He also served as the U.S. attorney for the Southern District \nof New York. He served as the Deputy Attorney General under President \nGeorge W. Bush.\n  In fact, Madam President, many of us remember, when he was Deputy \nAttorney General, the dramatic hospital bedside confrontation James \nComey had with senior White House officials who tried to prod an ailing \nJohn Ashcroft to reauthorize an NSA surveillance program--a program \nthat the Justice Department had concluded was illegal. Yet White House \nstaff was over there trying, at his hospital bed, to get the Attorney \nGeneral to agree to it. But the Deputy Attorney General stepped in, in \nhis role as Acting Attorney General, and stood firm against this \nattempt to circumvent the rule of law, and I believe he will continue \nto show the same strength of character and principled leadership if \nconfirmed as Director.\n  During his confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee, James \nComey proved that his reputation for unwavering integrity and \nprofessionalism is well-deserved. One area of great concern for me was \nhis approval of a 2005 legal memo to authorize the use of various \nmethods of torture, including waterboarding. I wanted to make sure that \nas FBI Director, James Comey would never condone or resort to \nwaterboarding a prisoner--something for which we have prosecuted people \nin other countries. He answered my questions and stated directly, \nunequivocally, that waterboarding is not only personally abhorrent but \nthat it is torture and illegal. He also testified that if confirmed he \nwould continue the FBI's policy of not permitting the use of abusive \ninterrogation techniques against prisoners, including sleep deprivation \nand cramped confinement.\n  Mr. Comey and I do not agree on all matters. I do not agree with him \nthat the Authorization for the Use of Military Force permits the \ngovernment to detain indefinitely an American citizen captured on \nAmerican soil in military custody without charge or trial, and I will \ncontinue to oppose efforts to codify such an interpretation of the law. \nI was glad James Comey committed to adhering to the current \nadministration policy of not indefinitely detaining Americans in such \ncircumstances.\n  When he testified before us, I saw a man of integrity and honesty, \ncompetent in background, and so once he is confirmed--and I trust he \nwill be confirmed once this filibuster has ended--I will continue to \npress him on the scope and legality of surveillance conducted by the \ngovernment pursuant to the PATRIOT Act and other authorities under the \nForeign Surveillance Intelligence Act. As I noted during his \nconfirmation hearing, just because the FBI has the ability to collect \nhuge amounts of data does not mean it should be collecting huge amounts \nof data. As the head of our premier law enforcement agency, the FBI \nDirector bears a special responsibility to ensure that domestic \ngovernment surveillance does not unduly infringe upon our freedoms. I \nhave long said that protecting our national security and protecting \nAmericans' fundamental rights are not mutually exclusive. We can and \nmust do both. I fully expect that James Comey will work to achieve both \ngoals.\n  After Director Mueller's distinguished tenure at the Bureau, James \nComey has big shoes to fill. The next Director must face the growing \nchallenge of how to sustain the FBI's increased focus on \ncounterterrorism while at the same time upholding the FBI's commitment \nto its historic law enforcement functions. It is going to be \nparticularly difficult to protect this country and protect our law \nenforcement functions because of sequestration and other fiscal \nconstraints, but I think the FBI has to continue to play a key role in \ncombating the crimes that affect everyday Americans--from violent \ncrimes, to bank robberies, to fraud and corruption cases.\n  If we learned nothing else since the September 11 attacks, we learned \nthat it matters who leads our Nation at all levels of government. We \nneed strong, principled, ethical leaders who steadfastly adhere to the \nlaw. I am confident that James Comey is such a leader. I am urging \nSenators on both sides of the aisle to join me in voting to overcome \nthis filibuster in a vote to confirm him to be the next Director of the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation.\n  As I said before--and I will put into the Record how long it has \ntaken from nomination to confirmation--twice as long as President \nBush's FBI nomination, more than twice as long as President Reagan's \nFBI nomination, and twice as long as President Nixon's FBI nomination. \nIn every one of those cases, no Democrat filibustered President Bush, \nPresident Reagan, and President Nixon. We all worked to get the FBI \nDirector in there. This filibuster by my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle is unprecedented. I wish they would treat President Obama the \nsame way we treated President Bush, President Reagan, and President \nNixon and not make President Obama seem to be somehow different and \ninterfere with law enforcement the way they have.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a chart showing how long it took previous Presidents.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                            Total # days from nomination\n           FBI Director Nominee                    to confirmation\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJAMES B.

Madam President, I see my friend from Iowa on the floor, \nbut I want to express for the record my concern about this kind of \nunprecedented obstruction. And it is unprecedented. I have been here 38 \nyears, and this has never happened before, this unprecedented \nobstruction of the FBI nominee.\n  In addition to the unprecedented obstruction on the FBI nominee, I \nwant to mention another topic that my friends on the other side of the \naisle are blocking. A small minority of Senators are objecting to \nmoving forward with a budget conference. We have all heard a lot of \ntalk in the last few years about getting our fiscal house in order--it \nmakes for a great campaign slogan. But I am afraid that too many in \nthis body are not following through on their responsibility to govern.\n  It has been over four months since the Senate passed its version of a \nbudget resolution. We all remember being here overnight voting on \namendment after amendment. In the intervening months Senate Democrats \nhave tried 17 times to move to a bipartisan budget conference with the \nHouse to work out\n\n[[Page S6000]]\n\na final budget agreement. Yet each time the perfunctory request is \nmade--a request that normally is agreed to shortly after we finish our \nversion of the budget--someone from the other side of the aisle, with \nthe full support of their leadership, objects.\n  After years of crocodile tears from the other side of aisle about the \nlack of a budget from the Senate, we finally pass one and they object \nto moving forward.\n  After years of hearing how we need to get our fiscal house in order \nbecause the national debt is the single most pressing issue facing the \ncountry, we pass a responsible budget plan to pay down the debt and \nthey object to moving forward.\n  When it comes time to turn all the politicking into governing, they \nget cold feet and object.\n  As the distinguished chairwoman of the Budget Committee has lamented \nover and over again, I am sorry to say that for some factions in the \nRepublican Party today ``compromise'' is a dirty word and ``distrust'' \nis a political tactic. That may explain why Senate Republicans have \noffered up excuse after excuse for blocking the regular budget order \nthey so desperately pled for just a short time ago. Republicans are \ndenying the opportunity for members of this body to work with members \nof the other body on hammering out a final budget agreement.\n  I have been fortunate to serve in this chamber for 38 years. I was \nelected to the Senate in 1974, the same year the Congressional Budget \nAct passed into law. And I served here with Senator Edmund Muskie of \nMaine, the first chairman of the Budget Committee. In all those years--\nwith all those budgets--I cannot recall one, single instance where \npolitical obstruction like this blocked the Senate from going to \nconference on a budget resolution. And just to be sure, I checked with \nthe Congressional Research Service and they could not find another \ninstance of obstruction like this on a budget conference either. Not \nfrom Democrats; not from the old GOP; not from anyone until now.\n  Some in this body have objected to the Senate considering any \nappropriations bills until a final budget agreement is reached. Let me \nsee if I get this straight. The very same people who have been begging \nfor a new budget plan are blocking the Senate from going to conference \non the budget resolution and then saying we cannot possibly deal with \nany bills to fund the government next year until we have a final budget \nagreement, inching us even closer to a government shutdown or a \ngovernment default that would devastate our economy and ruin the very \nfiscal house they claim they are trying to get in order. Oh, the sweet \nirony here.\n  It is time for reason and sanity to return to the Senate--on this \nbudget resolution, on nominations, and on a whole host of other issues. \nI think returning to regular order on the budget conference--and \nletting conference members from the House and the Senate work out a \nfinal agreement--would be a good first step to bringing some comity and \norder back to this body so we can serve the American people.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I rise today to speak regarding the \nnomination of James B. Comey, Jr., to serve as Director of the Federal \nBureau of Investigation.\n  Mr. Comey has a long record of service to the Department of Justice. \nColleagues doubtless are familiar with Mr. Comey's role in the infamous \nscene at the side of Attorney General Ashcroft's hospital bed over the \nreauthorization of part of President Bush's warrantless wiretapping \nprogram. Mr. Comey, to his great credit, stood firm for the rule of law \nand for the Department he served.\n  Nonetheless, I believe Mr. Comey's role in the issuance of Justice \nDepartment legal opinions on torture deserves close examination by this \nbody.\n  In August 2002, Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee and John Yoo of \nthe Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel used what are now \nacknowledged to be radical--some would say outlandish--legal arguments \nto authorize the use of torture. Jack Goldsmith, the subsequent head of \nthe office, withdrew those opinions. His successor, Daniel Levin, \nissued a new opinion, dated December 30, 2004, that provided a new \nanalysis of the Federal statute outlawing torture. The Office of Legal \nCounsel, under the leadership of Steven Bradbury, applied that analysis \nto a series of abusive interrogation techniques, as used individually \nand in combination. The resulting two opinions--the Individual \nTechniques Opinion and the Combined Techniques Opinion--were issued on \nMay 10, 2005. Then-Deputy Attorney General Comey concurred in the \nformer and vigorously objected to the latter on both legal and policy \ngrounds.\n  I strongly disagree with Mr. Comey's conclusion that the Individual \nTechniques Opinion was, as he put it at his confirmation hearing before \nthe Judiciary Committee, a ``serious and responsible interpretation'' \nof the torture statute. Its legal analysis is inadequate in numerous \nways, but for today I will focus on one of the most significant \nshortcomings.\n  As I have observed on other occasions, this opinion omits the 1984 \nFifth Circuit case of United States v. Lee, which involved the \nprosecution by the Reagan Justice Department of a local sheriff and \ndeputies who had engaged in waterboarding. The Justice Department's \nbrief on appeal described the technique in detail and described it as \n``water torture.'' The opinion by the Fifth Circuit likewise repeatedly \nreferred to ``water torture'' and ``torture.'' As Professor David Luban \nof Georgetown Law School explained at a hearing I chaired in May 2009, \nLee is ``perhaps the single most relevant case in American law on the \nlegality of waterboarding.''\n  To give you an idea of how widely the Individual Techniques Opinion \nranged, it evaluated the meaning of the terms ``severe physical or \nmental pain or suffering;'' it evaluated ``[t]he common understanding \nof the term `torture' and the context in which the statute was \nenacted'' and it discussed ``the historical understanding of torture.'' \nYet nowhere in this discussion of the ``historical understanding of \ntorture'' and the ``common understanding of the term `torture''' does \nthis opinion mention that it was the view of the Department of Justice \nitself, confirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in \n1984, that waterboarding is torture. The opinion likewise fails to \nconsider the American prosecutions of Japanese soldiers for \nwaterboarding our troops during the Second World War or the court-\nmartials of American soldiers for using the technique in the \nPhilippines after the Spanish-American war.\n  The shortcomings of the Individual Techniques Opinion go beyond the \nfailings of its legal analysis. Lawyers cannot analyze the law without \nknowing the facts, and the record demonstrates that the CIA repeatedly \ngave the Office of Legal Counsel bad information about the use and \neffectiveness of the techniques. How willingly Yoo and Bybee accepted \nfalse representations by the CIA about their use of the techniques is a \nquestion for another day--and their consciences.\n  In 2004, however, the CIA's Inspector General explained that the CIA \nhad used the techniques differently than they were described in the Yoo \nand Bybee opinions. Significant misrepresentations also made their way \ninto Office of Legal Counsel opinions in 2005. As former FBI \ninterrogator Ali Soufan testified at a hearing I held in 2009, a May \n30, 2005, opinion claim about the effectiveness of waterboarding \nagainst Khalid Sheik Muhammad and the so-called Dirty Bomber, Jose \nPadilla, was demonstrably false. And although I cannot discuss the \nreport of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which remains classified, \nit is my firm belief that when all the facts are finally made public, \nthe judgment about the candor of the CIA will be harsh and the \nIndividual Techniques Opinion will be further discredited.\n  As I pointed out at Mr. Comey's confirmation hearing, it is not \nenough to say that letting the Individual Techniques Opinion go was ok \nbecause the techniques would likely only be used in combination. If Mr. \nComey's view had prevailed and the Combined Techniques Opinion had not \nbeen issued, an interrogator could have waterboarded a detainee as long \nas that technique was used in isolation.\n  It also concerns me that Mr. Comey did not press for an analysis of \nlegal prohibitions other than the torture statute. The Individual \nTechniques Opinion and the Combined Techniques Opinion did not \nconsider, for example,\n\n[[Page S6001]]\n\nthe legality of abusive techniques under American treaty obligations, \nsuch as those imposed by the Convention Against Torture or even under \nthe Constitution. It may be the practice of the Office of Legal Counsel \nto divide relevant legal questions among multiple opinions, but that \ndoes not justify failing to address all obvious and relevant legal \nquestions. As a result, I believe that concurrence in the Individual \nTechniques Opinion should have been withheld until it was clear that \nthe Office was evaluating all relevant treaty and constitutional \nquestions.\n  Because I do not believe the Individual Techniques Opinion is \nreasonable or responsible, and because I believe the process for \nreviewing that opinion was flawed, I cannot hold Mr. Comey blameless \nfor concurring it. He should have done better.\n  This evaluation has the benefit of hindsight and is free from the \npressurized atmosphere of early 2005, when Mr. Comey was forced to \ncontend with a White House pulling the Justice Department in the wrong \ndirection on a number of fronts.\n  I accept that it was not Mr. Comey's responsibility as the Deputy \nAttorney General to do his own research on the questions addressed by \nthe Individual Techniques Opinion. I do think that the opinion had a \nbad enough odor to put a responsible, well-trained lawyer on alert.\n  Mr. Comey did take significant, affirmative steps to satisfy himself \nthat the Individual Techniques Opinion was issued in good faith, seeing \nto it that the opinion was pressure-tested by exposing it to broad \nreview within the Department of Justice and the executive branch. This \nfact distinguishes the Individual Techniques Opinion from the earlier \nopinions that had been crafted without adequate scrutiny within the \nexecutive branch--scrutiny they likely could not have survived: \nremember the use of the Medicare standard for a torture opinion.\n  In sum, while I believe that the Individual Techniques Opinion does \nnot meet the standards expected of Justice Department attorneys, I \nultimately have concluded that Mr. Comey performed his role reasonably.\n  One key fact corroborates this conclusion. As discussed above, the \nlegality of waterboarding under American treaty obligations and the \nConstitution was the obvious followup question. In fact, the Office of \nLegal Counsel was working on a separate opinion on those very questions \nand would publish it on May 30, 2005. Mr. Comey, however, was \ndeliberately cut out. Though he already had submitted his resignation, \nMr. Comey apparently was enough of a thorn in the side of the enablers \nof torture that they wanted to get around him.\n  It is my judgment, overall, that Mr. Comey was an opponent of torture \nand a defender of the best traditions of the Justice Department and our \nNation. I think he could have done better, but Mr. Comey was on the \nright side. Add to this his clear statements to the committee, his long \ntrack record of public service, and his principled stands on other \nmatters of national importance, and I conclude that Mr. Comey has the \nintegrity, the capability, and the commitment to lead the Federal \nBureau of Investigation. I will work to see his nomination confirmed \nand work with him as he undertakes this new chapter in his public \nservice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, Shortly the Senate will be voting to \ninvoke cloture on the nomination of James B. Comey to become the next \nDirector of the FBI. I will vote to invoke cloture and expect many of \nmy colleagues will do the same.\n\n  The confirmation of a new FBI Director is a serious decision for this \nChamber to consider. As a large Federal law enforcement agency, the FBI \nhas numerous responsibilities and tremendous power. Only with quality \nleadership and proper Congressional oversight will the FBI be best \nequipped to fight crime, terrorism, and espionage.\n  I think the President has made a fine choice in selecting Mr. Comey \nas the next leader of the FBI, and I plan to explain my support for him \nas we approach Mr. Comey's confirmation vote.\n  I recognize there is a level of concern associated with this \nnomination regarding the use of drones by the FBI. I have been at the \nforefront of this issue, raising it last year with the Attorney \nGeneral. The Attorney General gave me an incomplete answer as to the \nFBI's use of drones.\n  Accordingly, after there was disclosure that the FBI was using drones \non U.S. soil for surveillance, I questioned Mr. Comey about the extent \nof that policy. This needs to be addressed by the new director, and I \nhave Mr. Comey's assurance he will review the policy. I will be \nmonitoring this closely, but we need a director in place, and we need \nto confirm this nomination this week.\n  Excellent leadership is only one ingredient in the recipe for success \nat any Federal agency. Another critical element is proper congressional \noversight. And it is this component I fear too many of my colleagues \nhave forgotten. Today, too many seem to believe that advice and consent \nreally means rubberstamp and turn a blind eye. The American people \ndeserve better than this approach to confirmations.\n  Over the last few months, I have observed an alarming pattern. Too \noften, this administration submits subpar nominees while simultaneously \nobstructing any legitimate oversight by this Congress. Sadly, many of \nmy colleagues appear to be choosing to ignore any effort to correct it. \nLet me cite just a few examples.\n  We saw how Mr. Perez, an assistant attorney general, brokered an \nunwritten deal that cost the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. \nMy colleagues on the other side largely ignored the shady deal. Mr. \nPerez tried to cover his tracks, but got caught leaving a voicemail \nthat was recorded. Even then, my colleagues dismissed it. And when he \nwas caught concealing evidence of the deal on his personal email \naccounts, he defied a lawfully issued congressional subpoena and \nrefused to turn over the documentation. Incredibly, his defiance was \nignored. Worse yet, for all this rotten behavior, the Senate rewarded \nhim with a promotion by confirming him as Secretary of Labor.\n  We see the same thing occurring with the nomination of Mr. Mayorkas. \nThe nominee for the No. 2 position at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity is the target of an open investigation by the Inspector \nGeneral of the Department of Homeland Security. The IG is investigating \nallegations that the nominee procured a visa as a political favor, even \nthough the visa was properly rejected.\n  Incredibly, the Senate Committee pressed on with the hearing despite \nunanimous objection from the minority for moving forward in the midst \nof an open investigation.\n  That is incredible to me--a Senate Committee would move forward with \na nominee who has an open investigation into the nominee's conduct. I \nwish this were a unique occurrence, but based on recent experience in \nthe Judiciary Committee, it is not an isolated event. This is exactly \nwhat happened recently in the Senate Judiciary Committee with respect \nto Mr. B. Todd Jones, the nominee to be Director of the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.\n  Earlier this year, I learned the Office of Special Counsel was \ninvestigating Mr. Jones in a complaint that he retaliated against a \nwhistleblower in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of \nMinnesota.\n  In the Judiciary Committee, it has been the Committee's practice when \na nominee is the subject of an open investigation, the Committee \ngenerally does not move forward until the issues are resolved. Because \nof this practice, I objected to holding his hearing last month and \nrequested the hearing be postponed to allow the investigation to \nfinish.\n  My request was denied. I then objected to putting him on the \ncommittee agenda until the non-partisan investigation was complete. \nAgain, my request was rejected. And now, despite the fact there remains \nan open complaint of whistleblower retaliation against Mr. Jones before \nthe Office of Special Counsel, his nomination will soon be considered \nby the full Senate.\n  I want all my colleagues to know what happened because I am quite \nconcerned by the direction it has taken, especially in light of the \nfact this practice seems to be spreading into other Senate committees \nas well.\n  Over the past few months, there has been correspondence between my \noffice and the Office of Special Counsel regarding the status of their \nproceedings.\n\n[[Page S6002]]\n\n  I had previously received a copy of an anonymous letter to the Office \nof Special Counsel making various allegations against Mr. Jones. I sent \na letter to OSC on April 8, asking for an update on those allegations. \nOn April 12, the Office of Special Counsel responded that there were \ntwo pending matters involving the U.S. Attorney's Office, District of \nMinnesota, where Mr. Jones is the United States Attorney. The first \nmatter was a prohibited personnel practice complaint alleging reprisal \nfor whistleblowing and other protected activity. The second matter was \na whistleblower disclosure, alleging gross mismanagement and abuses of \nauthority.\n  The complaint, filed by an Assistant United States Attorney in the \noffice, alleged that personnel actions, including a suspension and a \nlowered performance appraisal, were taken in retaliation for protected \nwhistleblowing or other protected activity.\n  On June 5, OSC provided the committee with an update to the two \npending cases. It reported the whistleblower disclosure case had been \nclosed based on its determination that the information provided was \ninsufficient to determine with a substantial likelihood that gross \nmismanagement, an abuse of authority, or a violation of a law, rule, or \nregulation had occurred. Accordingly, OSC closed that case file.\n  OSC's action to close the whistleblower disclosure case was not based \non any investigation by that office. That action was merely a \ndetermination based on a technical review of the complaint document \nitself. It was not a finding on the merits of the complaint.\n  With regard to the other issue, the prohibited personnel practice, I \nwas informed the complaint was referred for investigation. Subsequently \nthe complainant and Justice Department agreed to mediation. I was told \nthat if mediation was unsuccessful, the case would return to OSC's \nInvestigation and Prosecution Division for further investigation.\n  My colleagues should understand that, of all the complaints received \nby OSC, only about 10 percent of them merit an investigation. This case \nwas one of them. Why did the career, nonpartisan staff at OSC forward \nthe case for investigation? Presumably because they thought it needed \nto be investigated. That says something about the likely merits of the \ncase.\n  Before the hearing, there was disagreement regarding the status of \nthe Special Counsel's investigation. Accordingly, I contacted the \nSpecial Counsel, inquiring as to the status of the complaints. The \nSpecial Counsel confirmed for the second time that the investigation \nremains open. She stated, ``The reassignment of the case for mediation \ndid not result in the matter being closed.''\n  Despite this, and over my objection, on June 11, the committee went \nforward with a hearing on the Jones nomination. We were told Mr. Jones' \nhearing needed to be held in order for him to have an opportunity to \nrespond to the Office of Special Counsel complaints. I would note that \na similar rationale was used to justify the Mayorkas hearing--to \npublicly address the allegations against the nominee. In Mr. Jones' \ncase, in advance of the hearing, the Department of Justice sent a \nletter to me stating: ``Mr. Jones looks forward to answering your \nquestions about these matters during his nominations hearing. . . .''\n  Additionally, Mr. Jones was quoted in the Star Tribune as saying, ``I \nam looking forward to meeting with the Committee and answering all \ntheir questions.''\n  However, as I expected, the hearing provided no information to the \ncommittee with regard to the open Special Counsel investigation. At the \nhearing, Mr. Jones said he could not talk about the complaint. Of \ncourse, this negated the whole reason why the hearing had even been \nscheduled.\n  At his hearing, my first question to Mr. Jones was about the \ninvestigation. This is his reply:\n\n       Because those complaints are confidential as a matter of \n     law, I have not seen the substance of the complaints, nor can \n     I comment on them. I have learned more from your statement \n     today than I knew before I came here this morning about the \n     nature and substance of the complaint.\n\n  A few questions later, I inquired of Mr. Jones, ``Will you answer the \ncomplaints about the Assistant U.S. Attorney--because that is why you \nare here today?''\n  He replied:\n\n       Well, quite frankly, Senator, I am at a disadvantage with \n     the facts. There is a process in place. I have not seen the \n     OSC complaint. I do know that our office, working with the \n     Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys, is in the process of \n     responding to the issues that you have talked about this \n     morning, but I have not had the opportunity to either be \n     interviewed or have any greater knowledge about what the OSC \n     complaint is.''\n\n  So there we were, left with an open investigation of serious \nallegations of whistleblower retaliation. We were told the hearing was \nthe opportunity for us to question the nominee and get these questions \nanswered, but the nominee couldn't even talk about them at all.\n  This put the Committee in the position of either allowing time for \nthe Office of Special Counsel to do its job or looking into the matter \nfor ourselves before proceeding.\n  Strangely, late in the day before the hearing, the Majority offered \nto conduct some interviews the Friday following the hearing. That was \nquite perplexing to me. We were going to begin the investigation after \nthe hearing had concluded. I could not remember when the committee had \never conducted an investigation after a nominee's hearing.\n  The day after the hearing, the chairman's staff indicated to the \nmedia we were conducting a bipartisan probe. The media reported the \nmajority staff had offered to conduct a bipartisan inquiry into the \nmatters before the Office of Special Counsel.\n  However, I am disappointed to report there was no genuine effort to \ngather all the facts. The majority only agreed to jointly interview one \nwitness, the whistleblower himself. However, the majority refused to \nlook into the substance of the whistleblower's claims. Even more \ntroubling, it quickly turned into an inquiry of the whistleblower \nrather than into the alleged retaliatory action done by the nominee.\n  The majority reached its own conclusion that it was not a \nwhistleblower matter at all, but a personnel matter wherein management \nsimply imposed discipline on a disruptive or insubordinate employee. \nHowever, there was never a factual record before the committee to \nsupport this conclusion.\n  The majority determined the whistleblower is an uncooperative witness \nfor being ``unwilling to provide documents''--meaning his personnel \nfile.\n  The whistleblower in this instance is an Assistant U.S. Attorney with \n30 years of Federal service, 24 years of which he has served in the \nU.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Minnesota. He has extensive \nleadership experience and in 2012 received the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral's Distinguished Achievement Award.\n  It should be quite alarming to us all that a staff investigation of a \nwhistleblower's complaint would be twisted around into an apparent \nattempt to investigate the whistleblower.\n  I have worked with many Federal Government whistleblowers over the \nyears and this is exactly the type of treatment that whistleblowers \nfear. It is one of the main reasons they are afraid to come forward. \nThis type of treatment raises serious concerns.\n  Unfortunately, I have come to expect this out of the Federal \nGovernment agencies--attacking the whistleblower rather than \ninvestigate the underlying problem. I have seen it over and over again. \nBut this sort of inquiry shouldn't be the way the Senate deals with \nwhistleblowers or others who come forward to testify.\n  The Senate cannot conduct itself this way. We cannot ignore ongoing \ninvestigations. In my opinion, we are neglecting our constitutional \nobligations. Eventually, one of these situations will embarrass the \nSenate, damage the reputation of the Federal Government, and, \nultimately, probably cost the taxpayers, our constituents.\n  So I urge all of my colleagues to oppose taking further action at \nthis time on the nomination of B. Todd Jones for Director of ATF, \nanother nominee with an open investigation. I will vote no on cloture \nand encourage my colleagues to do likewise. This is about protecting \nthe advice and consent function of the Senate.\n  The Senate should wait until the Office of Special Counsel has \nconcluded its investigation and we know the truth about his retaliatory \nconduct against a protected whistleblower.\n\n[[Page S6003]]\n\nThere will be time to debate the other substantive concerns regarding \nthis nomination. There may be additional reasons why my colleagues \nshould oppose Mr. Jones's nomination. Other Senators may vote to \nconfirm the nominee.\n  But as a starting point, we should all be in agreement that it is \nimprudent and unwise for the Senate to give final consideration to any \nnominee where there is an open investigation into that nominee's \nconduct. The Senate cannot abdicate its duty to advise and consent on \nthese nominees and simply rubberstamp them.\n  As we consider this nomination, as well as a number of other \nnominations this week, I would urge my colleagues to ponder what a \nFederal agency needs in order to be best positioned to succeed. In my \nopinion, a Federal agency needs at least two things: a quality leader \nand proper congressional oversight. I think this is especially relevant \nas we consider the next Director of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation.\n  The Federal Bureau of Investigation is a powerful law enforcement \nagency facing numerous challenges today.\n  First and foremost, the FBI is still undergoing a transformation from \na Federal law enforcement agency to a national security agency. \nFollowing 9/11, the FBI's mission changed. Director Mueller was \nimmediately thrust into the role of reinventing a storied law \nenforcement agency into a national security agency.\n  While Director Mueller rose to the challenge and made tremendous \nstrides in accomplishing this transformation, that job is not yet \ncomplete. It is still adjusting to prevent domestic terrorism. It must \ngrow to combat the growing threat of cybercrimes that threaten our \nnational security, our economy, and our infrastructure. The FBI needs a \nDirector to continue to guide it as it rises to counter these serious \nthreats.\n  Second, the FBI must confront the growing concerns over the use of \ninvasive methods of gathering information on American citizens. One \nexample would be the proper use of drones by domestic law enforcement \nagencies. Last year I raised this issue with the Attorney General. It \nnow appears his response was less than forthright. This year, I raised \nthe issue with Director Mueller and again with Mr. Comey, today's \nnominee.\n  Frankly, it is going to require a Director who is knowledgeable on \nthe subject, the law, and who is willing to work with Congress in order \ncraft the best policy with regard to this technology's potential use in \ndomestic law enforcement.\n  Third, a host of legacy problems at the FBI remain unsolved. The FBI \nhas struggled to develop a working case management computer system. \nManagement concerns remain about the proper personnel balance between \nspecial agents and analysts. It has yet to effectively manage agent \nrotations to the Washington, DC headquarters. A real or perceived \ndouble standard of discipline between line agents and management must \nbe repaired. Significant concerns about internal FBI policies dealing \nwith whistleblower retaliation exist. Each of these matters must be \naddressed as they threaten to undermine the hard work of the employees \nat the FBI.\n  The position of FBI Director is unique in that it is a 10-year \nappointment subject to the advice and consent of the Senate. This 10-\nyear term was extended 2 years ago on a one-time only basis. The \nextension allowed Director Mueller to serve an additional time period \nas the President failed to nominate a replacement. At the time, we held \na special hearing to discuss the importance of a term limit for the FBI \nDirector. One of the reasons Congress created a 10-year term was to \nensure accountability of the FBI.\n  Today, we vote on the nomination of James B. Comey for Director. Mr. \nComey has a distinguished legal career. After graduating from the \nUniversity of Chicago Law School in 1985, Mr. Comey clerked for Hon. \nJohn M. Walker, Jr., U.S. district judge for the Southern District of \nNew York.\n  In 1986, he began his legal career with Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, LLP, \nwhere he focused on civil litigation. In 1987, Mr. Comey became an \nassistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York, \neventually serving as deputy chief of the Criminal Division.\n  He left the Department of Justice to return to private practice in \n1993, joining McGuireWoods, LLP. While at McGuireWoods, he served as a \ndeputy special counsel on the U.S. Senate Special Committee to \nInvestigate Whitewater and Related Matters. During this time, he also \nserved as an adjunct professor at the University of Richmond Law \nSchool.\n  In 1996, Mr. Comey returned to government service as Managing \nAssistant U.S. Attorney in the Office of the U.S. attorney for the \nEastern District of Virginia. By 2002, Mr. Comey was appointed U.S. \nattorney for the Southern District of New York. And in December 2003, \nhe was appointed Deputy Attorney General, a position he served with \nhonor and distinction until 2005, when he left government service.\n  However, I would like to point out, and I think Mr. Comey would \nagree, that perhaps one of the best indicators about his judgment is \nthat he had the smarts to marry an Iowan.\n  At his confirmation hearing, Mr. Comey addressed many concerns raised \nby Senators from both sides of the aisle. His answers were direct and \nthoughtful. On subjects with which he was familiar, he spoke \nintelligently and straightforward. If he didn't know enough, he said \nso. There was no trying to hide the ball or cover for his lack of \nexpertise in a particular area. In short, it was a refreshing change \nfrom the many nominees who come up here and try to parrot to Senators \nwhat nominees think we want to hear.\n  Not so with Mr. Comey. In fact, several times when pressed on his \nviews on a specific FBI policy, such as FBI whistleblower policies or \ndomestic drone use, he confessed he had little or no knowledge of the \ncurrent FBI policy but promised to thoroughly review the existing \npolicies in place and the legal and moral issues surrounding the \ncontroversies. Furthermore, he pledged to work with Congress by being \nresponsive to our inquiries for information.\n  Now, these promises are not unique to Mr. Comey. Almost every nominee \npromises the Senate that he or she will be responsive to our concerns \nand requests for information. Sadly, especially under this \nadministration, once confirmed, we rarely get an adequate response \nuntil right before that individual has an oversight hearing before a \nSenate or House Committee. I can only hope that Mr. Comey's efforts to \nbe more transparent will not be stymied by the Department of Justice.\n  As I said, I think that if any Federal agency, but especially the \nFBI, is to succeed, it needs quality leadership and proper \ncongressional oversight. After examining his record, I think that Mr. \nComey will prove to be that leader. Only time will tell, however, if \nthis administration will allow Mr. Comey to engage the Congress and \nallow us to perform our constitutional duty of oversight to ensure that \nexisting legislation and policies best serve this nation.\n  I thank Mr. Comey for his willingness to return to public service. \nAnd I urge my colleagues to support his nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week the Department of Justice \nannounced that the total U.S. prison population declined 1.7 percent \nfrom 2011 to 2012. I was encouraged to see that sentencing reform at \nthe State level continues to pay dividends by simultaneously reducing \nprison costs and crime rates.\n  I am troubled, however, that the entirety of the reduction in the \nU.S. prison population was attributable to the States. The number of \nFederal prisoners actually increased by almost 1,500 from 2011 to 2012. \nWhile this increase was smaller than in previous years, the Federal \nGovernment can no longer afford to continue on the course of ever-\nincreasing prison costs. As of last week, the Federal prison population \nwas over 219,000, with almost half of those men and women imprisoned on \ndrug charges. This year, the Bureau of Prisons budget request was just \nbelow $7 billion.\n  A major factor driving the increase in the incarceration rate has \nbeen the proliferation of Federal mandatory minimum sentences in the \nlast 20 years. This one-size-fits-all approach to sentencing never made \nus safer, but it has cost us plenty. We must change course. In \nSeptember, the Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing to examine the \neffects of Federal mandatory minimum sentences and measures to reform \nthe system in order to combat injustice in sentencing and the waste of \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  In March, I joined with Senator Paul to introduce just such a \nmeasure. The Justice Safety Valve Act of 2013 will give judges greater \nflexibility in sentencing in cases where a mandatory minimum is \nunnecessary and counterproductive. Since its introduction, the Justice \nSafety Valve Act has received endorsements from a diverse group that \nspans the political spectrum, including articles written by George \nWill, Grover Norquist, David Keene, and the New York Times. I ask \nunanimous consent that these materials be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  In addition to driving up our prison population, mandatory minimum \npenalties can lead to terribly unjust results in individual cases. This \nis why a large majority of judges oppose mandatory minimum sentences. \nIn a 2010 survey by the U.S. Sentencing Commission of more than 600 \nFederal district court judges, nearly 70 percent agreed that the \nexisting safety valve provision should be extended to all Federal \noffenses. That is what our bill does. Judges, who hand down sentences \nand can see close up when they are appropriate and just, overwhelmingly \noppose mandatory minimum sentences.\n  States, including very conservative States like Texas, that have \nimplemented sentencing reform have saved money and seen their crime \nrates drop. It is long past time that Congress follow their lead, and a \nSenate Judiciary Committee hearing on Federal mandatory minimum \nsentences is an important place to start.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Hill's Congress Blog, Mar. 20, 2013]\n\n       Paul-Leahy Sentencing Bill Will Ensure Time Fits the Crime\n\n                 (By Julie Stewart and Grover Norquist)\n\n       Even before the sequester took effect, the Obama \n     administration's Department of Justice was warning that \n     federal prison spending had become ``unsustainable'' and was \n     forcing cuts in other anti-crime initiatives. Despite such \n     warnings, we have seen little evidence of an administration \n     strategy on how to control these costs. Fortunately, Senators \n     Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Patrick Leahy (D-Vt) today are stepping \n     in to fill that void with the introduction of bipartisan \n     legislation to restore common sense to our criminal \n     sentencing laws.\n       The Justice Safety Valve Act of 2013 authorizes federal \n     courts to depart below a statutory mandatory minimum sentence \n     only after finding, among other things, that providing a \n     particular defendant a shorter sentence--say, seven or eight \n     years in prison for a drug offense rather than the 10-year \n     mandatory minimum--will not jeopardize public safety. The \n     bill does not require judges to impose shorter sentences, and \n     for many crimes, the minimum established by Congress will be \n     appropriate. But in cases where the mandatory minimum does \n     not account for the offender's limited role in a crime or \n     other relevant factors, the judge would be allowed to \n     consider those factors and craft a more appropriate sentence.\n\n[[Page S6005]]\n\n       This common sense bill comes at a critical time. The \n     federal government simply cannot afford to continue to house \n     so many nonviolent prisoners for such lengthy sentences. \n     According to a recent Congressional Research Service (CRS) \n     report, the number of inmates under the Bureau of Prisons' \n     (BOP) jurisdiction has increased from approximately 25,000 in \n     FY1 980 to nearly 219,000 in FY2012. BOP prisons are \n     operating at 38 percent over capacity, endangering the safety \n     of guards and inmates alike. Last week, the Inspector General \n     for the Department of Justice testified that it's only going \n     to get worse: the BOP projects system-wide crowding to exceed \n     45 percent over rated capacity through 2018. The economic \n     cost of the prison population boom is staggering. Since FY \n     2000, appropriations for the BOP have increased from just \n     over $3.5 billion to more than $6.5 billion.\n       Locking everyone up costs a lot, but it doesn't always keep \n     us safer. University of Chicago economist and Freakonomics \n     author Steven D. Levitt was perhaps the most influential \n     supporter of pro-prison policies in the 1990s. He later \n     concluded that, as the crime rate continued to drop and the \n     prison population continued to grow, the increase in public \n     safety diminished. ``We know that harsher punishments lead to \n     less crime, but we also know that the millionth prisoner we \n     lock up is a lot less dangerous to society than the first guy \n     we lock up, '' Dr. Levitt recently told The New York Times. \n     ``In the mid-1990s I concluded that the social benefits \n     approximately equaled the costs of incarceration.'' Today, \n     Dr. Levitt says, ``I think we should be shrinking the prison \n     population by at least one-third.''\n       The head of the U.S. Justice Department's criminal division \n     agrees that spending on federal prisons must be scrutinized. \n     Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer recently wrote, ``In \n     an era of governmental austerity, maximizing public safety \n     can only be achieved by finding a proper balance of outlays \n     that allows, on the one hand, for sufficient numbers of \n     police, investigative agents, prosecutors and judicial \n     personnel to investigate, apprehend, prosecute and adjudicate \n     those who commit federal crimes. And, on the other hand, a \n     sentencing policy that achieves public safety correctional \n     goals and justice for victims, the community, and the \n     offender.'' We are lacking that balance today as skyrocketing \n     corrections spending, driven by increasing reliance on one-\n     size-fits-all mandatory minimum sentencing laws, is now \n     crowding out spending on investigators, police, and \n     prosecutors.\n       In short, we are skimping on efforts to arrest and \n     prosecute violent criminals so that we can keep nonviolent \n     offenders behind bars for lengthy prison sentences. This is \n     insanity. Passing the Paul-Leahy bill would enable courts to \n     make sure the time fits the crime in every criminal case. \n     While keeping us safe, it would also save money that could be \n     returned to taxpayers or invested in more effective anti-\n     crime strategies, such as putting more police on the street \n     or expanding the use of proven recidivism-reducing programs \n     in our prisons. We can still be tough on crime, but we do not \n     have to be tough on taxpayers.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 23, 2013]\n\n                       Needed: A New Safety Valve\n\n                        (By The Editorial Board)\n\n       Congress's new bipartisan task force on overcriminalization \n     in the justice system held its first hearing earlier this \n     month. It was a timely meeting: national crime rates are at \n     historic lows, yet the federal prison system is operating at \n     close to 40 percent over capacity.\n       Representative Karen Bass, a California Democrat, asked a \n     panel of experts about the problem of mandatory minimum \n     sentences, which contribute to prison overcrowding and rising \n     costs. In the 16-year period through fiscal 2011, the annual \n     number of federal inmates increased from 37,091 to 76,216, \n     with mandatory minimum sentences a driving factor. Almost \n     half of them are in for drugs.\n       The problem starts with federal drug laws that focus \n     heavily on the type and quantity of drugs involved in a crime \n     rather than the role the defendant played. Federal \n     prosecutors then seek mandatory sentences against defendants \n     who are not leaders and managers of drug enterprises. The \n     result is that 93 percent of those convicted of drug \n     trafficking are low-level offenders.\n       Both the Senate and the House are considering a bipartisan \n     bill to allow federal judges more flexibility in sentencing \n     in the 195 federal crimes that carry mandatory minimums. The \n     bill, called the Justice Safety Valve Act, deserves committee \n     hearings and passage soon.\n       A 1994 federal sentencing law allows judges to reduce \n     sentences for drug crimes if no one was harmed during the \n     crime and if the offender had little or no criminal history, \n     was not a leader in organizing the crime and used neither \n     violence nor a gun. But that law is far too narrow; all \n     felony convictions are disqualifying for a reduction, as are \n     some minor offenses, like passing a bad check.\n       The proposed bill would apply to all federal crimes with \n     mandatory minimums, not just drug crimes, so it would include \n     theft of food stamps and miscellaneous other lesser crimes. \n     It would also let judges consider less-lengthy sentences for \n     drug offenders who don't qualify for a reduction under the \n     current law.\n       The case of Weldon Angelos has long stood for the injustice \n     of mandatory minimums. Mr. Angelos received a 55-year prison \n     sentence in 2004 for selling a few pounds of marijuana while \n     having handguns in his possession, which he did not use or \n     display. In an extraordinary opinion, the federal trial judge \n     said he had no choice but to impose that ``cruel, unjust, and \n     irrational'' sentence. The Justice Safety Valve Act would \n     give courts more leeway to avoid that one-size-fits-all \n     approach.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, June 5, 2013]\n\n        Leahy and Paul Plan on Mandatory Sentencing Makes Sense\n\n                          (By George F. Will)\n\n       Libertarians believe government should have a compelling \n     reason before it restricts an individual's liberty. Today's \n     liberals believe almost any reason will do, because liberty \n     is less important than equality, fraternity, fighting obesity \n     and many other aspirations. Now, however, one of the most \n     senior and liberal U. S. senators and one of the most junior \n     and libertarian have a proposal that could slow and even \n     repair some of the fraying of society.\n       Seven-term Democrat Pat Leahy's 38 Senate years have made \n     him Judiciary Committee chairman. Republican Rand Paul is in \n     his third Senate year. They hope to reduce the cruelty, \n     irrationality and cost of the current regime of mandatory \n     minimum sentences for federal crimes.\n       Such crimes are multiplying at a rate of more than 500 a \n     decade, even though the Constitution explicitly authorizes \n     Congress to criminalize only a few activities that are \n     national in nature (e.g., counterfeiting, treason, crimes on \n     the high seas). The federal government, having failed at core \n     functions, such as fairly administering a rational revenue \n     system, acts like a sheriff with attention-deficit disorder, \n     haphazardly criminalizing this and that behavior in order to \n     express righteous alarm about various wrongs that excite \n     attention.\n       Approximately 80,000 people are sentenced in federal courts \n     each year. There are an estimated 4,500 federal criminal \n     statutes and tens of thousands of regulations backed by \n     criminal penalties, including incarceration. There can be \n     felony penalties for violating arcane regulations that do not \n     give clear notice of behavior that is prescribed or \n     proscribed. This violates the mens rea requirement--people \n     deserve criminal punishment only if they intentionally engage \n     in conduct that is inherently wrong or that they know to be \n     illegal. No wonder that the federal prison population--\n     currently approximately 219,000, about half serving drug \n     sentences--has expanded 51 percent since 2000 and federal \n     prisons are at 138 percent of their supposed capacity.\n       The Leahy-Paul measure would expand to all federal crimes \n     the discretion federal judges have in many drug cases to \n     impose sentences less than the mandatory minimums. This \n     would, as Leahy says, allow judges--most of whom oppose \n     mandatory minimums--to judge. Paul says mandatory minimum \n     sentences, in the context of the proliferation of federal \n     crimes, undermine federalism, the separation of powers and \n     ``the bedrock principle that people should be treated as \n     individuals.''\n       Almost everyone who enters the desensitizing world of U.S. \n     prisons is going to return to society, and many will have \n     been socially handicapped by the experience. Until the 1970s, \n     about 100 per 100,000 Americans were in prison. Today 700 per \n     100,000 are. America has nearly 5 percent of the world's \n     population but almost 25 percent of its prisoners. African \n     Americans are 13 percent of the nation's population but 37 \n     percent of the prison population, and one in three African \n     American men spends time incarcerated. All this takes a \n     staggering toll on shattered families and disordered \n     neighborhoods.\n       The House Judiciary Committee has created an Over-\n     Criminalization Task Force. Its members should read ``Three \n     Felonies a Day: How the Feds Target the Innocent,'' by Harvey \n     Silverglate, a libertarian lawyer whose book argues that \n     prosecutors could indict most of us for three felonies a day. \n     And the task force should read the short essay ``Ham Sandwich \n     Nation: Due Process When Everything Is a Crime'' by Glenn \n     Harlan Reynolds, a professor of law at the University of \n     Tennessee. Given the axiom that a competent prosecutor can \n     persuade a grand jury to indict a ham sandwich, and given the \n     reality of prosecutorial abuse--particularly, compelling plea \n     bargains by overcharging with ``kitchen sink'' indictments--\n     Reynolds believes ``the decision to charge a person \n     criminally should itself undergo some degree of due process \n     scrutiny.''\n       He also suggests banning plea bargains: ``An understanding \n     that every criminal charge filed would have to be either \n     backed up in open court or ignominiously dropped would \n     significantly reduce the incentive to overcharge. . . . Our \n     criminal justice system, as presently practiced, is basically \n     a plea-bargain system with actual trials of guilt or \n     innocence a bit of showy froth floating on top.''\n       U.S. prosecutors win more than 90 percent of their cases, \n     97 percent of those without complete trials. British and \n     Canadian prosecutors win significantly less, and for many \n     offenses, the sentences in those nations are less severe.\n       Making mandatory minimums less severe would lessen the \n     power of prosecutors to pressure defendants by overcharging \n     them in order to expose them to draconian penalties. The \n     Leahy-Paul measure is a way to begin\n\n[[Page S6006]]\n\n     reforming a criminal justice system in which justice is a \n     diminishing component.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the National Review Online, May 24, 2013]\n\n                         Prison-Sentence Reform\n\n                            (By David Keene)\n\n       Some liberal judges back in the 1970s and '80s enraged the \n     public by allowing felons back on the street with little more \n     than a slap on the wrist. In response, Congress and many \n     state legislatures enacted mandatory-minimum-sentencing laws \n     that essentially eliminated the discretion judges had always \n     enjoyed to make the punishment fit the crime. These laws were \n     incredibly popular when first enacted but have created more \n     problems than they've solved.\n       Undoubtedly, the tough-on-crime sentiment these laws \n     reflected has advanced our welcome, two-decade decline in \n     drug-related and violent crime. But I have come to believe \n     that the wholesale adoption of mandatory minimum sentencing \n     hasn't worked as well as everyone had hoped.\n       Like many conservatives, I supported many of these laws \n     when they were enacted and still believe that, in some narrow \n     situations, mandatory minimums makes sense. But like other \n     ``one-size-fits-all'' solutions to complicated problems, they \n     should be reviewed in light of how they work in practice.\n       Fortunately, Senators Rand Paul (R., Ky.) and Patrick Leahy \n     (D., Vt.) have crafted a smart and modest reform bill that \n     will fine-tune these laws to eliminate many of the unforeseen \n     and, frankly, unfair consequences of their application when \n     the facts demand more flexibility. This bipartisan measure \n     deserves conservative support.\n       The bill, the Justice Safety Valve Act of 2013, maintains \n     existing federal mandatory-sentencing laws. It enables judges \n     to depart from the minimums in certain cases, however, such \n     as when the mandatory sentence is not necessary to protect \n     public safety and seems blatantly unfair in light of the \n     circumstances of the offense. In so doing, their proposal \n     fulfills the primary objective of criminal-justice policy: \n     protecting public safety, while promoting our constitutional \n     separation of powers and saving taxpayers the expense of \n     unnecessary and counterproductive incarceration.\n       Many people, conservatives as well as liberals, have come \n     to believe that most mandatory-minimum-sentencing laws should \n     be repealed. These laws give prosecutors nearly unchecked \n     power to determine sentences, even though courts are in a \n     better position to weigh important and relevant facts, such \n     as an offender's culpability and likelihood of reoffending.\n       Federal mandatory-minimum-sentencing laws are especially \n     problematic. Not only do they transfer power from independent \n     courts to a political executive, they also perpetuate the \n     harmful trend of federalizing criminal activity that can be \n     better prosecuted at the state level.\n       For years, conservatives have wisely argued that the only \n     government programs, rules, and regulations we should abide \n     are those that can withstand cost-benefit analysis. Mandatory \n     minimum sentences, by definition, fail this basic test \n     because they apply a one-size-fits-all sentence to low-level \n     offenders, even though the punishments were designed for more \n     serious criminals.\n       Economists who once wholeheartedly supported simple pro-\n     prison policies now believe they have reached the point of \n     diminishing returns. One is University of Chicago economist \n     Steven D. Levitt, best known for the best-selling \n     Freakonomics, which he co-authored with Stephen J. Dubner. \n     Levitt recently told the New York Times, ``In the mid-1990s I \n     concluded that the social benefits approximately equaled the \n     costs of incarceration,'' and, today, ``I think we should be \n     shrinking the prison population by at least one-third.''\n       In other words, the initial crackdown was a good thing, but \n     we are now suffering the effects of too much of that good \n     thing.\n       If Levitt's estimate is even close, right now we are \n     wasting tens of billions of dollars locking people up without \n     affecting the crime rate or enhancing public safety. In fact, \n     spending too much on prisons skews state and federal \n     budgetary priorities, taking funds away from things that are \n     proven to drive crime even lower, such as increasing police \n     presence in high-violence areas and providing drug-treatment \n     services to addicts.\n       The Paul-Leahy bill will help restore needed balance to our \n     anti-crime efforts. Repeat and violent criminals will \n     continue to receive and serve lengthy prison sentences, but \n     in cases involving lower-level offenders, judges will be \n     given the flexibility to impose a shorter sentence when \n     warranted.\n       The Paul-Leahy bill is a modest fix that will affect only 2 \n     percent of all federal offenders, and even they won't be \n     spared going to prison. They will simply receive slightly \n     shorter sentences that are more in line with their actual \n     offenses.\n       The bill will improve public safety, save taxpayers \n     billions of dollars, and restore our constitutional \n     separation of powers at the federal level while strengthening \n     federalism. This is a reform conservatives should embrace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/29/senate-section/article/S6006-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL JUDICIAL COLLEGE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to honor the National Judicial \nCollege. Celebrating 50 years of service and education to the Nation's \njudiciary, the National Judicial College has dedicated itself to the \nadvancement of justice, not only in our Nation, but throughout the \nworld. It is with great pleasure that I recognize the National Judicial \nCollege's distinguished history of providing education and higher \nlearning, especially in light of its recent anniversary.\n  More than 50 years ago, the Joint Committee for the Effective \nAdministration of Justices came together and realized the need for an \nentity to provide judicial education. By 1963, under the leadership of \nSupreme Court Justice Tom C. Clark, the National Judicial College \nopened its doors at the University of Colorado, Boulder.\n  After attending the first course in Boulder, Judge Thomas Craven, \nfrom Reno, NV, enthusiastically brought his experience with the college \nto trustees of the Max C. Fleischmann Foundation located in Reno. In \n1964, with the persistence of Judge Craven and the support of the \nFleischmann Foundation, the college moved to the campus of the \nUniversity of Nevada, Reno, where its permanent academic home still \nthrives today.\n  As the first institution to offer programs of its nature to judges \nnationwide, the National Judicial College has much to celebrate at this \n50 year mark. What started out as a course serving 83 judges in 1963 \nhas become a permanent institution that provides 90 courses and \nprograms serving more than 3,000 judges every year from all 50 States, \nU.S. territories, and more than 150 countries. Since its inception, the \ncollege has awarded more than 95,000 professional judicial education \ncertificates.\n  These judges come together in the college's own state-of-the-art \nfacility on the campus of University of Nevada, Reno, comprised of \n90,000 square feet including an auditorium, classrooms, model \ncourtroom, multimedia room, computer lab, judge's resource room, and \ndiscussion areas, all of which are equipped with the latest technology.\n  The college serves as the one place where judges from across the \nworld can meet to improve the delivery of justice and advance the rule \nof law through professional study and collegial dialogue. The college's \ndedicated boards, faculty, and staff deliver innovative programs and \nservices that improve productivity, challenge perceptions of justice, \nand inspire judicial excellence in the field.\n  The impact of the National Judicial College is immense. Its unique \nrole in educating and developing our Nation's judiciary has improved \nthe judicial system, and will continue to do so in the future.\n  I commend the National Judiciary College's dedication to education, \ninnovation, and advancement of justice, and am honored to congratulate \nthe college for 50 years of serving our Nation's judiciary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/29/senate-section/article/S6006-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6006-S6007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          McCARTHY NOMINATION\n\n  Mr HATCH.

I praise Ms. \nMcCarthy for her extensive experience and expertise in regulating air \nquality at the Federal level as well as at the State level. Throughout \nher career she has been able to be an effective regulator under \nRepublican Governors as well as a Democratic President. Even with the \nopposition she faced during the months leading up to her confirmation, \nit was always clear to me that Ms. McCarthy would be approved.\n  My ``nay'' vote was not against Ms. McCarthy. My vote was against \nPresident Obama's overreaching environmental policies and against the \nEPA. The environmental policies of this administration are clearly a \nwar on fossil fuel and a war on Western jobs.\n  The President's recent announcement of a Climate Change Action Plan \nwill be implemented by EPA and will have a direct impact on jobs and \nthe pocketbooks of the American people. This plan targets coal-fired \npowerplants by proposing Federal carbon emission standards that will \ncost billions of dollars nationwide to implement and will raise the \nprice of electricity for private citizens as well as businesses.\n\n[[Page S6007]]\n\n  The Western United States is rich in coal, oil, and natural gas. We \nneed to make it easier, not harder, to develop those resources. The \ndevelopment of the abundant and affordable energy that we are blessed \nwith as a nation is crucial.\n  The effort by this administration to quell the development of these \nresources is unacceptable. I cannot support them and, that being the \ncase, I am not able to support the nomination of Ms. McCarthy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/29/senate-section/article/S6007-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WEAPONS SALES\n\n  Mr. LEVIN Mr. President, we recently marked 1 year since the tragic \nshooting in Aurora, CO. One year since our nation witnessed innocent \nmen, women, and children streaming out of a movie theater, bloodied and \nin shock. One year since 12 people were murdered and 58 injured at the \nhands of an armed and mentally deranged individual who was able to \nchannel his illness in the most dangerous way: through the barrel of an \nAR-15 military-style assault weapon.\n  Such weapons, according to the Congressional Research Service, were \ndesigned in the aftermath of the Second World War to give soldiers a \nweapon suited for the modern battlefield. They are designed to kill as \nmany people as possible, as quickly as possible. And in Aurora, the AR-\n15 did just that.\n  Since that night, all around our country, the gun violence has \ncontinued. But still, we in Congress have done nothing to stem these \ngun tragedies. Today, just like this day 1 year ago, a convicted felon, \na domestic abuser, or a dangerously mentally ill individual can go to a \nprivate seller and legally purchase a deadly military-style weapon just \nas easily as they can purchase a gallon of milk, no background check \nrequired.\n  Take, for example, a recent undercover investigation conducted by a \nteam of National Geographic journalists who wanted to see just how easy \nit is for criminals to obtain guns. What the team found was deeply \nunnerving. Speaking to investigative journalist Mariana van Zeller, \nprivate investigator and former police officer Jesse Torrez put it \nbluntly: ``We should be able to get you involved in a weapons \ntransaction within 30 minutes . . . and that's travel time, too.''\n  He was right. The investigators decided to attempt to purchase an AK-\n47, a military-style assault weapon. On the weapon-selling website \n[www.armslist\n.com], a posting selling a similar firearm for $830 proudly describes \nit, among other things, as ``the standard issue firearm in the Yugoslav \nPeople's Army in 1970.'' But compared to the investigation's findings, \nthat weapon would have been overpriced. In just a few minutes, the \nNational Geographic investigators found an online posting selling an \nAK-47 for $750 in cash. They agreed to meet the seller in a fast food \nparking lot. Under Federal law, background checks are not required for \n``private'' gun sales, so the transaction was completed quickly and \nlegally. The vendor even offered to add ``several'' AR-15 assault \nrifles to the sale as a sort of impulse buy, like candy in a \nconvenience store.\n  Upping the ante, the investigators then searched for a .50-caliber \nsniper rifle, a weapon the team described as ``so powerful that the \nU.S. military uses it to penetrate concrete and steel.'' Again, within \nminutes, they found an internet seller offering a .50-caliber rifle \nfrom a nearby garage. Without any form of background check, the \nNational Geographic team purchased the weapon, along with 11 boxes of \nammunition containing 12 rounds apiece. In the chilling words of the \nprivate seller, ``You have a lot of firepower to start your own war.''\n  Our society should not be a war zone. The purchasers in this case \nwere undercover investigators, but next time, they might not be. They \ncould be felons, domestic abusers, or a mentally deranged individual \nplanning to use the weapon for harm.\n  We owe it to the survivors and the victims of Aurora to keep weapons \ndesigned for war off our streets. We owe it to the American people to \nlisten to the 90 percent of them who support universal background \nchecks on all gun sales. We owe it to our families, our neighbors, and \nour children to stop deadly weapons from getting into the wrong hands. \nWe should take up and pass legislation such as the Assault Weapons Ban \nof 2013, which would stop the flood of military-style weapons into our \nneighborhoods. We should extend background checks to all gun sales by \npassing the Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013. We should, in \nshort, turn common sense into law. But that will only happen if \nCongress acts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/29/senate-section/article/S6007-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO ROBERT S. MUELLER\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Robert S. \nMueller, III, and to thank him for his 12 years of service as the \nDirector of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI.\n  Director Mueller had just settled into his office just a week before \nthe September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. These attacks on the Nation \naffected us all, including in my home State of Maryland. In the \nterrible aftermath of the events of that day, we grieved together. On \n9/11, we were caught unprepared, searching for answers and scrambling \nto find a way to prevent future attacks.\n  After 9/11, the FBI was charged with a heavy responsibility: disrupt \nterrorist plots before they happen by identifying, tracking, and \ndismantling terrorists on U.S. soil. During his term, Director Mueller \nhas provided steadfast leadership, guiding the FBI as it transformed \nfrom a traditional domestic law enforcement agency into a global \ncounterterrorism and crime-fighting force. His guidance has helped keep \nAmericans safe from terrorist attacks here at home and abroad. But such \nleadership is nothing new to Director Mueller. Before he led the FBI, \nhe served our Nation as a decorated marine in Vietnam, and as a Federal \nprosecutor who tackled cases ranging from the bombing of Pan Am Flight \n103 to the prosecution of Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega.\n  Director Mueller has shown unwavering commitment to the FBI and its \nmission. He is the only Director to serve a full 10-year term, and then \nserve another 2 years. From day one, he has fought to make sure the \nhard-working men and women at the FBI have the tools they need to carry \nout their extraordinary responsibilities. As chairwoman of the Senate \nAppropriations subcommittee that funds the FBI and as a member of the \nIntelligence Committee, I am proud to call Director Mueller my \nsteadfast partner in that fight. Together, we have worked to provide \nthe FBI with the capabilities to stop terrorists before they attack us \nhere at home, go after schemers and scammers who prey on hard-working \nAmerican families, prevent cyber terrorists from devastating our \ntechnology infrastructure, and catch sexual predators who seek to harm \nour children.\n  Lastly, Director Mueller has strong integrity. He speaks truth to \npower, even when the truth is unpopular or inconvenient. He is a \nstraight talker--when he tells me that the FBI needs more tools to \ncarry out its national security and crime-fighting duties, I find a way \nto help him get those tools because I trust his judgment, and I trust \nhis leadership. He answered the call to service when President Bush \nasked him to serve as FBI Director in 2001. And he answered the call of \nPresident Obama when asked to serve 2 more years.\n  We live in extraordinarily critical times, and face threats from both \nwithin and outside our Nation. But over the past 12 years we knew that \nhaving Director Mueller at the FBI meant that one of the tested \n``nighthawks'' was guarding our Nation's national security. I speak for \nall Americans when I say that we have been privileged to have such a \ncommitted and dedicated public servant leading the FBI. I will miss my \nsteadfast partner and friend and, above all, wish to send him a \nheartfelt thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/29/senate-section/article/S6007-3", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6007-S6008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         LEWISTON FIREFIGHTERS\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, in one terrifying week this spring, \nLewiston, ME, my State's second largest city, was attacked by arsonists \nwho destroyed nine buildings and left hundreds of people homeless. I \nrise today in tribute to the firefighters of Lewiston who answered \nthose cruel attacks with skill and courage and who saved their city \nwith no loss of life or serious injury.\n  We have always had a deep respect and admiration for our firefighters \nand\n\n[[Page S6008]]\n\nfirst responders. In recent years, however, the American people have \nbeen reminded of the vital protections they provide to our communities. \nFrom the Twin Towers in 2001 to the Boston Marathon in 2013, we have \nseen these heroes rush into danger that others flee. We have seen them \nrisk their lives to save the lives of others.\n  That is precisely what the people of Lewiston have seen since their \nfirst fire company was established in 1849. Through the years, fire has \nclaimed textile and lumber mills, stores and schools, homes and even \ncity hall. Yet never has a fire, no matter how fierce, been allowed to \nspiral out of control into a conflagration. The willingness of the \npeople of Lewiston to always rebuild is testament to the confidence \nthey have that their valiant firefighters will protect their property \nand their lives.\n  That protection comes at a high price. The Lewiston Firefighters \nMemorial bears the names of nine men who made the ultimate sacrifice in \nthe line of duty.\n  Today, under the leadership of Fire Chief Paul LeClair and \nInternational Association of Firefighters Local 785 president Rick \nCailler, the Lewiston Fire Department is recognized as one of the best \nin Maine, known for its professionalism, efficiency, and dedication. In \nthe special language of the firefighter community, the Lewiston \nfirefighters are considered ``the toughest Jakes on the job.''\n  They are tough yet filled with community spirit and compassion. \nThrough the generosity of its members, the Local 785 Community Fund \nsponsors youth sports teams, charities, and the arts, and provides \nchildren in need with Christmas toys. Their annual ``Fill the Boot'' \ncampaign raises many thousands of dollars for the fight against \nMuscular Dystrophy.\n  America's firefighters play a vital role in the security of our \nNation and the safety of our people. Whether it is in response to a \nterrorist attack, a natural disaster, or a fire, Americans rely on our \nfirefighters, and our firefighters always answer the call. The \nfirefighters of Lewiston, ME, are a shining example of that commitment, \nand I join the people of their city in saluting them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/29/senate-section/article/S6008-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING TONY PETKOVSEK\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Tony Petkovsek, who \nwill be inducted into the International Polka Association Hall of Fame \non August 3, 2013. Mr. Petkovsek has devoted his life's work to \ncultivating Cleveland-Slovenian music and culture, most notably by \nhosting the longest running daily radio show in the world.\n  Growing up in Cleveland's St. Clair neighborhood, Mr. Petkovsek was \nimmersed in Slovenian culture from a young age. After completing \ncollege and broadcasting school, he began producing and broadcasting \nhis own radio shows on Cleveland's WXEN, on November 23, 1961, which \nwas Thanksgiving Day. Since 1962, his show has been broadcasted daily.\n  Mr. Petkovsek is one of the most prominent ambassadors of Cleveland-\nstyle polka both locally and nationally. In 1967, he originated the \nPolka Tour at Kollander World Travel, which has since taken thousands \nof polka fans all over the world. His annual Thanksgiving celebration \nevolved from a dance in 1963 to a national focal point of Cleveland-\nstyle polkas, attracting polka fans from all over America to join the \nfestivities. Mr. Petkovsek was instrumental in founding the United \nSlovenian Society, the Cleveland-Slovenian Radio Club, the East 185th \nStreet Business Association, and the American Slovenian Polka \nFoundation. Notably, Mr. Petkovsek served on the Ohio Arts Council \nunder Gov. George Voinovich.\n  His contributions to Cleveland-style polka have been widely \nrecognized over the years. Some of these honors have included the \nFederation of Slovenian Homes' ``Man of the Year'' in 1966, his \ninduction into the St. Joseph High School Hall of Fame in 1987 and his \ninduction into the National Broadcasters Hall of Fame in 1991. Mr. \nPetkovsek was also recognized with a merit badge by the President of \nSlovenia, Danilo Turk, in 2012 for his service to the country of \nSlovenia and to Slovenians in Cleveland.\n  I would like to honor Tony Petkovsek for his contributions to \nCleveland-style polka and to the Cleveland Slovenian community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/29/senate-section/article/S6008-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     UCLA BRUINS NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncongratulating the University of California, Los Angeles baseball team \nfor winning the 2013 National Collegiate Athletics Association, NCAA, \nDivision I College World Series. On June 25, the UCLA Bruins capped off \na magical season and earned their first baseball national championship \nby sweeping the Mississippi State Bulldogs.\n  This victory wouldn't have been possible without the determination \nand teamwork of the skilled and dedicated players and the devoted \ncoaching and training staff, led by head coach John Savage. The 2013 \nBruins showed these extraordinary qualities all season, finishing with \na 49-17 record and matching a school record with 21 wins in the Pac-12 \nconference play.\n  During the NCAA Regionals and Super Regionals, the Bruins began their \nundefeated march through the postseason by defeating worthy and \nspirited opponents from San Diego State, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, the \nUniversity of San Diego, and Cal State Fullerton en route to earning \ntheir third trip in 4 years to the prestigious College World Series in \nOmaha, NE.\n  In the College World Series, the Bruins unleashed a historic display \nof overpowering pitching, steady defense, and timely hitting to defeat \ncompetition from Louisiana State, North Carolina State, the University \nof North Carolina, and Mississippi State to capture the first national \nchampionship in UCLA baseball history. The Bruins became the first \nchampionship team to allow one run or fewer in every College World \nSeries game. In total, the Bruins allowed just 14 runs during their \ndominant 10-0 run through the NCAA tournament.\n  True to their reputation as a team of great resolve and \ndetermination, the Bruins were bolstered by contributions from every \nplayer on their roster. They worked together to ensure that the College \nWorld Series trophy will finally make its way to UCLA, a school with a \nrich baseball tradition that includes Jackie Robinson, who honed his \nprodigious skills before becoming a National Baseball Hall of Famer and \nnational hero. With the addition of the College World Series trophy, \nthe UCLA Hall of Champions will now boast an unmatched 109 NCAA team \nchampionships.\n  It is my pleasure to congratulate UCLA students, families, alumni, \nfaculty, and Bruin fans, as they celebrate their 2013 National \nCollegiate Athletics Association Division I College World Series \nvictory and their remarkable and memorable season.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/29/senate-section/article/S6008-3", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6008-S6009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING LUKE SHEEHY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the life of Luke Sheehy, a loving son, devoted friend, and \ncourageous firefighter. Luke Sheehy passed away on June 10, 2013, \nsuccumbing to injuries he sustained while heroically combating a \nwildfire in the Modoc National Forest. He was 28 years old.\n  Luke Sheehy was born in Susanville, CA, graduated from Susanville \nHigh School, and attended the Shasta College Fire Academy. After \nserving as a firefighter with the California Department of Forestry and \nthe Bureau of Land Management's Diamond Mountain Hotshots, Luke became \na U.S. Forest Service Smokejumper, parachuting from airplanes to fight \nfires in remote and hard-to-access areas, helping to train new \nsmokejumpers and earning respect for his strong work ethic and \nleadership abilities.\n  Those who knew him best will remember Luke as a genuine friend who \nloved his family and enjoyed hunting, fishing, snowboarding and the \npiano, guitar and fiddle.\n  My heart goes out to Luke's family, loved ones, and colleagues, and \nmy thoughts and prayers are with them.\n  Luke Sheehy, like all those who fight fires across California, put \nhis life on the line to protect our families and communities. We are \nforever indebted to him for his courage, service and sacrifice, and he \nwill be dearly missed.\n\n[[Page S6009]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/29/senate-section/article/S6009-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING GEORGE PERKINS\n\n Mr.VITTER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the memory of \nGeorge Perkins, a beloved community leader from Hammond, LA, who passed \naway suddenly in April of this year. George was born in 1942 and would \nhave turned 71 on August 17.\n  George was born in Walker, LA, and relocated to Hammond in 1979. He \nimmediately became a community leader in the Hammond area. He joined \nGreenfield Missionary Baptist Church where he served as a deacon, \nSunday school teacher, and member of the male chorus. He cochaired the \nboard of deacons and was in charge of the church's video recording.\n  George was an insurance sales representative and later a cable TV \nfranchise owner by trade, but he was best known as one of the \noriginators of the Tangipahoa Black Festival that began in 1984. In \n1987, the name was changed to the Tangipahoa Parish Black Heritage \nFestival. With the new name, George and other leaders of the \norganization decided they needed a permanent facility and they \ncontacted the parish school system to purchase a boarded-up school on \n7.3 acres of land that was left over from integration. Over the years \nthey have renovated the facility, which has become the Tangipahoa \nParish African American Heritage Museum and Veterans Archive. George \ncould be found there on most days working in whatever capacity in which \nhe was needed--from acting as tour guide to researching records to \ntaking on kitchen duty.\n  He also served his community in other ways. He was a member of the \nadvisory board for North Oaks Hospital and served as the first Black \ncouncilman for District 3 in the city of Hammond. He later served as an \nassistant to State Representative Henry ``Tank'' Powell and was a \nfounding member of the 2nd Saturday breakfast group--a group which \ninvites members of the community to gather monthly regardless of racial \nand social divides to discuss issues of concern to the community. He \nwas a member of the Masonic Order Prince Hall affiliation, the past \nworshipful master of Oak Grove Lodge #117 in Hammond and a grand \nofficer of the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Lodge for the State of \nLouisiana.\n  George Perkins was a man of many talents and music was his passion. \nHe wrote and produced many songs including ``Cryin' in the Streets''--\nhis No. 1 hit. It sold over 1 million copies and provided him the \nopportunity to perform at the Apollo Theater.\n  George will be lovingly remembered by his wife of 42 years, Eloise, 3 \ndaughters, 3 sons, 19 grandchildren, 1 great-grandchild, 6 sisters, 2 \nbrothers, and an entire community. I am pleased to join them in \nhonoring George Perkins, a man who provided a great example of \nleadership through his service to others and his community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/29/senate-section/article/S6009-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2218.

Bush more than fifty years after the war \n     with Congressional Gold and Silver Medals in 2001; and\n       Whereas, the Navajo Code Talkers are now in their eighties, \n     and with fewer than fifty remaining from the original four \n     hundred, the urgency to capture and share their stories and \n     memorabilia from their service in the war is now critical; \n     and\n       Whereas, these American treasures and revered elders of the \n     Navajo Nation have come together to tell their story, one \n     that has never been heard, from their own hearts and in their \n     own words; and\n       Whereas, the Navajo Code Talkers' heroic story of an \n     ancient language, valiant people and a decisive victory that \n     changed the path of modern history is the greatest story \n     never told; and\n       Whereas, the Navajo Code Talkers ultimately envision a \n     lasting memorial, the Navajo Code Talkers Museum and Veterans \n     Center, on donated private land; and\n       Whereas, the Navajo Code Talkers' mission is to create a \n     place where their legacy of service will inspire others to \n     achieve excellence and instill core values of pride, \n     discipline and honor in all those who visit; and\n       Whereas, through the lead efforts of the Navajo Code \n     Talkers' Foundation and many partners and individuals, the \n     Navajo Code Talkers' Legacy, History, Language and Code will \n     be preserved to benefit all future generations: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Legislature of the State of New Mexico, \n     That the United States Congress, Department of the Interior, \n     Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Health and \n     Human Services, Department of Defense, Department of \n     Agriculture, Department of State and Department of Energy be \n     requested to support the preservation of the Navajo Code \n     Talkers' remarkable legacy; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this memorial be transmitted to \n     the President Pro Tempore of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the \n     Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Defense, the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary \n     of State, the Secretary of Energy and the New Mexico \n     Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-62.

to the \n     Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 60\n\n       Whereas, the National Flood Insurance Program provides \n     important and necessary property coverage in the event of \n     flooding for homeowners in St. Charles Parish; and\n       Whereas, President Barack Obama signed the Biggert-Waters \n     Flood Insurance Reform Act into law on July 6, 2012; and\n       Whereas, St. Charles Parish is currently in the process of \n     adopting the revised version of the Flood Insurance Rate \n     Maps; and\n       Whereas, many homeowners of St. Charles Parish constructed \n     and purchased homes in areas based on the existing version of \n     the Flood Insurance Rate Maps which met or exceeded current \n     base flood elevation requirements; and\n       Whereas, many homeowners of St. Charles Parish have \n     benefitted from locally built and maintained flood control \n     features, including functional levees, which have protected \n     the residents of these areas from flooding for decades; and\n       Whereas, the existing version of the Flood Insurance Rate \n     Maps took into consideration the benefits provided by the \n     locally built and maintained flood control features; and\n       Whereas, the proposed revised version of the Flood \n     Insurance Rate Maps do not account for this important source \n     of functional flood protection; and\n       Whereas, the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Act includes \n     provisions that permit the National Flood Insurance Program \n     to increase premium rates for certain policyholders; and\n       Whereas, the increase of such risk-based premium rates is \n     anticipated to result in a total premium increase of between \n     twenty percent to twenty-five percent per year for certain \n     homeowners, during each of the next five years; and\n       Whereas, certain areas of St. Charles Parish will \n     experience extreme, sudden, and unaffordable increases in \n     flood insurance premiums that may lead to personal bankruptcy \n     and foreclosure; and\n       Whereas, the effects of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance \n     Reform Act and the revised version of the Flood Insurance \n     Rate Maps would have significant consequences on the housing \n     market and economic health of St. Charles Parish;

and\n       Whereas, such study shall also research the effects of \n     increased premiums on low-income homeowners and ways to \n     assist such homeowners to afford the increased premiums; and\n       Whereas, the Act directs the Federal Emergency Management \n     Agency to conclude its study and to issue a report by April \n     6, 2013; and\n       Whereas, such study is currently still in progress; and\n       Whereas, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has yet to \n     create a report based upon the findings of such study; and\n       Whereas, increased premiums as a result of the Biggert-\n     Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act will have a significant \n     effect on low-income homeowners;

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States \n     Congress to pass the Strengthen, Modernize and Reform the \n     National Flood Insurance Program Act and the Flood Insurance \n     Implementation Reform Act of 2013; to the Committee on \n     Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 141\n\n       Whereas, the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 was \n     enacted to provide previously unavailable flood insurance \n     protection to property owners; and\n       Whereas, the National Flood Insurance Program continues to \n     provide important and necessary property coverage for home \n     and business owners throughout various Louisiana parishes, as \n     well as counties and communities nationwide; and\n       Whereas, the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of \n     2012 was signed into law on July 6, 2012; and\n       Whereas, the act calls for a revision of the flood \n     insurance rate maps; and\n       Whereas, such revised flood insurance rate maps do not \n     include the discounts granted by the current rate maps to \n     property owners who have taken action to mitigate property \n     damage by installing and maintaining flood control features, \n     in conformity with the most current federal law available to \n     them, and in conformity with current flood insurance rate \n     maps; and\n       Whereas, countless Louisiana property owners have built and \n     purchased homes and businesses in accordance with the current \n     flood rate insurance maps which, under the provisions of the \n     Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012, will soon \n     enter obsolescence; and\n       Whereas, the act also includes provisions, located in \n     Section 207 of such act, that eliminate the \n     ``grandfathering'' of homes that were built after the \n     existing flood insurance rate maps in accordance with then \n     existing laws; and\n       Whereas, by purchasing homes and businesses in accordance \n     with the provisions of the former flood rate insurance maps \n     and by investing in previously owned property to install \n     flood mitigation features, Louisiana property owners relied \n     on their strict compliance with federal and state law to \n     protect their purchases and investments; and\n       Whereas, in light of the provisions of the Biggert-Waters \n     Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012, the reliance on existing \n     flood insurance rate maps that those property owners \n     demonstrated is now to their personal and financial \n     detriment; and\n       Whereas, the passage of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance \n     Reform Act substantially and immediately devalued the \n     investments made in all properties endowed with flood damage \n     mitigation measures and to properties receiving subsidized \n     insurance premium rates; and\n       Whereas, the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act also \n     includes provisions that permit the National Flood Insurance \n     Program to increase premium rates for many policyholders; and\n       Whereas, the elimination of these discounts combined with \n     the certainty of general premium rate increases will result \n     in a premium increase of up to twenty-five percent per year \n     for certain Louisiana property owners over the next four \n     years; and\n       Whereas, under the changes to the National Flood Insurance \n     Program caused by the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform \n     Act, Louisiana property owners will struggle to pay \n     exorbitant amounts of money or will lose their flood \n     insurance; and\n       Whereas, a change in the ability of Louisiana property \n     owners to insure their homes from flood damage without \n     bearing the burden of such a violent rise in cost may lead to \n     financial distress for Louisiana residents and property \n     owners and countless other property owners around this \n     nation; and\n       Whereas, the premium increases to the National Flood \n     Insurance Program, as mandated by the Biggert-Waters Flood \n     Insurance Reform Act, will affect the entire nation's real \n     estate market; and\n       Whereas, the premium increases to the National Flood \n     Insurance Program, as mandated by the Biggert-Waters Flood \n     Insurance Reform Act, will affect the nation's banking and \n     mortgage industry; and\n       Whereas, the premium increases to communities and property \n     owners who made their best efforts to comply with federal law \n     by building property in accordance with soon to be outdated \n     flood insurance rate maps will affect consumer confidence and \n     the entire nation's economy; and\n       Whereas, on May 21, 2013, the Strengthen, Modernize and \n     Reform the National Flood Insurance Program Act (SMART NFIP) \n     was introduced by Senator Mary Landrieu to address the flaws \n     of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act; and\n       Whereas, SMART NFIP, if passed, would delay premium \n     increases, repeal provisions preventing new owners of sold \n     homes to continue subsidized rates, and allow the rebuilding \n     of key community facilities destroyed in a disaster that lie \n     in velocity zones; and\n       Whereas, on May 23, 2013, the Flood Insurance \n     Implementation Reform Act of 2013 was introduced by \n     Congressman Cedric Richmond in an effort to also address \n     flaws of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act; and\n       Whereas, the Flood Insurance Implementation Reform Act is \n     co-sponsored by Congressmen Bill Cassidy, Rodney Alexander, \n     Charles Boustany, and Congresswomen Doris Matsui and Maxine \n     Waters; and\n       Whereas, the Flood Insurance Implementation Reform Act, \n     would, if passed, in some cases delay, up to five years, \n     major components of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform \n     Act, including delaying the increasing of rates previously \n     ``grandfathered''; and\n       Whereas, these instruments would address many of the \n     concerns addressed herein; and\n       Whereas, the United States Congress should consider the \n     passage of the Strengthen, Modernize and Reform and National \n     Flood Insurance Program Act and the Flood Insurance \n     Implementation Reform Act of 2013, or, should neither of \n     these acts pass, the United States Congress should consider \n     the amendment or the repeal of Section 205, Section 207, and \n     all such sections of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance \n     Reform Act which provide for the increase of premium fees for \n     policyholders of the National Flood Insurance Program, in \n     order to prevent the unduly hazardous effects it will have on \n     home and business owners who invested in property prior to \n     the adoption of the new federal legislation and flood \n     insurance rate maps: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to undertake the amendment or repeal of all \n     relevant provisions of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance \n     Reform Act of 2012, including passage of the Strengthen, \n     Modernize and Reform the National Flood Insurance Program Act \n     and the Flood Insurance Implementation Reform Act of 2013; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to, in the absence of \n     the amendment or repeal of all relevant provisions of this \n     Act, suspend adoption of new flood insurance rate maps in \n     order to allow communities with a substantial percentage of \n     participation in the National Flood Insurance Program to work \n     with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the National \n     Flood Insurance Program to provide for the creation of new \n     flood insurance rate maps which do not unjustly and \n     inequitably dispose of the rights created under existing rate \n     maps; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to, in the absence of \n     the amendment or repeal of all relevant provisions of this \n     Act, provide for a one-year period during which time property \n     owners, in conjunction with the Federal Emergency Management \n     Agency and the National Flood Insurance Program, may enter a \n     special enrollment period wherein property owners may sign up \n     or renew their current National Flood Insurance Program \n     policy using the current flood insurance rate maps on which \n     they relied to purchase and build their homes and businesses; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, that a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-65.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States \n     Congress to take such actions as are necessary to give \n     ``qualified mortgage'' status to all balloon loans held in \n     portfolio by a bank; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \n     and Urban Affairs.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 143\n\n       Whereas, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recently \n     released its ``ability-to-repay'' rule as mandated by the \n     federal Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection \n     Act of 2010, which was passed by the United States Congress; \n     and\n       Whereas, the ``ability-to-repay'' rule provides specific \n     criteria for mortgage lenders to follow in order to make a \n     good faith determination that a borrower has the ability to \n     repay his mortgage loan; and\n       Whereas, as part of the rule, the Consumer Financial \n     Protection Bureau created ``qualified mortgages'' which are \n     mortgages with characteristics that are presumed to be in \n     compliance with the ``ability-to-repay'' rule; and\n       Whereas, loans designated as ``qualified mortgage'' loans \n     give lenders important legal protections by deeming those \n     loans to have complied, or giving them a presumption of \n     compliance, with the borrower ``ability-to-repay'' \n     requirements contained in the Dodd-Frank Act; and\n       Whereas, mortgage loans made that do not receive the \n     ``qualified mortgage'' status will be subject to increased \n     scrutiny and subject those lenders making them to increased \n     potential liability, possibly causing many lenders to stop \n     making nonqualified mortgage loans; and\n       Whereas, it is vitally important that the Consumer \n     Financial Protection Bureau and the United States Congress \n     adopt proper criteria for qualified mortgage loans to ensure \n     that lenders continue to make certain loans and to avoid a \n     potential decrease in access to credit for some consumers \n     that may already have few credit options and that want and \n     need certain loan features; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana bankers, especially in rural areas, are \n     very concerned with the narrow ``qualified mortgage'' \n     designation provided by the Consumer Financial Protection \n     Bureau for balloon loans held in portfolio by the bank and \n     the effect this narrow definition will have on customers; and\n       Whereas, for various reasons, many consumers do not qualify \n     for loans that can be sold into the secondary market and a \n     balloon loan made and held in portfolio by the local bank may \n     be one of the only options for those consumers; and\n       Whereas, community banks have prudently, consistently, and \n     historically made balloon loans in order to serve the \n     specific needs of customers; and\n       Whereas, balloon loans held in portfolio by a bank are \n     generally acknowledged as very safely underwritten loans with \n     lower default rates than other loans because the bank making \n     the loan retains all of the credit risk; and\n       Whereas, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \n     ``ability-to-repay'' rule provides that beginning January, \n     2014, only banks predominately in rural or underserved areas \n     can qualify for balloon loan qualified mortgages; and\n       Whereas, only nineteen parishes in Louisiana will likely be \n     considered ``rural'' areas under the definition used by the \n     Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; and\n       Whereas, as provided in the Consumer Financial Protection \n     Bureau definition, parishes excluded are those in \n     metropolitan statistical areas, or micropolitan statistical \n     areas adjacent to a metropolitan statistical area, as those \n     terms are defined by the United States Office of Management \n     and Budget; and\n       Whereas, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \n     commentary states that counties (parishes) included in the \n     definition of ``rural'' will only result in nine and seven \n     tenths percent of the United States population being included \n     in the definition; and\n       Whereas, if the United States Congress and the Consumer \n     Financial Protection Bureau do not act to broaden the \n     definition of ``rural'' currently being used in the rules, \n     many bank customers in Louisiana could be negatively impacted \n     by diminished access to credit: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to give ``qualified mortgage'' status to all \n     balloon loans held in portfolio by a bank and to urge and \n     request the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to expand \n     the definition of ``rural'' for balloon loan qualified \n     mortgages; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America, to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation, and to the director of the Consumer Financial \n     Protection Bureau.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-67.

The citizens of this \n     State have the right to hunt, fish, and harvest wildlife \n     traditionally pursued, subject to laws and regulations \n     promoting sound wildlife conservation and management as \n     prescribed by the General Assembly. Nothing in this section \n     shall be construed to abrogate any private property rights, \n     existing state laws or regulations, or the state's \n     sovereignty over its natural resources''; and\n       Whereas, with regard to the management of the state's Black \n     Sea Bass (Centropristis Striata) population, South Carolina's \n     Department of Natural Resources along with the state's \n     commercial and recreational fishermen are prime examples of \n     responsible resource stewards, as they place an extremely \n     high value on the quality and existence of our nation's \n     coastal waters and freshwater resources. The Department of \n     Natural Resources, as well as commercial and recreational \n     fishermen respect this species' marine and freshwater \n     habitats because they know that in order for these ecosystems \n     to sustain healthy populations of this species, these must be \n     protected and carefully managed; and\n       Whereas, allowing the State of South Carolina to manage the \n     state's Black Sea Bass (Centropristis Striata) population \n     would provide the best protection for this population so that \n     it may remain a natural resource for current and future \n     generations: Now, Therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, the Senate \n     concurring, That the members of the General Assembly \n     memorialize Congress to enact legislation that gives the \n     State of South Carolina authority to manage its stock of \n     Black Sea Bass (Centopristis Striata) in both state and \n     federal waters; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be forwarded to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and each member of \n     the South Carolina Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-69.

A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Idaho urging the Secretary of the United States \n     Department of Agriculture to declare the Frank Church-River \n     of No Return Wilderness and adjacent national forest lands to \n     be a Natural Resources Disaster Area; to the Committee on \n     Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                       House Joint Memorial No. 1\n\n       We, your Memorialists, the House of Representatives and the \n     Senate of the State of Idaho assembled in the First Regular \n     Session of the Sixty-second Idaho Legislature, do hereby \n     respectfully represent that:\n       Whereas, the State of Idaho and the vast Frank Church-River \n     of No Return Wilderness and contiguous national forests have \n     suffered numerous and frequent large destructive forest and \n     range fires, most recently in 2012; and\n       Whereas, the fires have not only incrementally expanded the \n     total burned acreage but have also reburned huge areas one or \n     more times; and\n       Whereas, the cumulative effect of numerous large fires has \n     resulted in tremendous damage and destruction to the \n     watersheds, streams important to the recovery of anadromous \n     fish, wildlife habitat, scenic values, recreational use, loss \n     of native plant species, historic structures, public access \n     and safety, air quality and public health, the trail network \n     and other values and benefits for which the national forests \n     and wilderness were established; and\n       Whereas, the cumulative and growing loss of wilderness \n     values and attributes is also resulting in serious economic \n     impact to surrounding communities, counties, the State of \n     Idaho and the businesses dependent upon the natural resources \n     inherent in wilderness and the national forests; and\n       Whereas, hundreds of miles of trails have been severely \n     damaged, blocked, rendered unsafe for travel or simply wiped \n     out by fire, and the continuing destructive aftermath of \n     blowdown, washouts and landslides have not been opened, \n     cleared, repaired or replaced. The backlog of critical \n     restoration work is rapidly growing each year and far exceeds \n     the work performed annually; and\n       Whereas, the cumulative impact of fires has resulted in the \n     loss of soil and native vegetation and the replacement of \n     native species with noxious and undesirable plants that will \n     also prevent or retard reestablishment of desirable native \n     plants; and\n       Whereas, the United States Forest Service has \n     underestimated the huge cost of trail and resource \n     restoration when making decisions on active fire strategies \n     in the wilderness due to a decision bias toward minimizing \n     suppression expenditures for wilderness fires at the expense \n     of long-term restoration; and\n       Whereas, the United States Forest Service has not placed \n     the necessary emphasis and priority on restoration of proper \n     watershed and vegetative conditions within the wilderness, \n     and has also not considered the negative effect of vegetative \n     type conversion resulting from intense and/or repetitive \n     burns; and\n       Whereas, the United States Forest Service has not placed \n     emphasis and priority on training for forest supervisors, \n     rangers and staff on the importance of safe and effective \n     saddle and pack stock use and management, and the field \n     conditions necessary for reasonable and safe public and \n     employee access to and within the wilderness; and\n       Whereas, the United States Forest Service has not placed \n     emphasis and priority on eliminating barriers to effective \n     and streamlined contracting procedures and effective use of \n     volunteers in order to respond to the crisis in the \n     wilderness and maximize fieldwork accomplishment; and\n       Whereas, the Secretary of Agriculture and the Chief of the \n     United States Forest Service have not placed the necessary \n     emphasis and priority of the requirement of Section 5(b) of \n     the Central Idaho Wilderness Act to clear obstructions from \n     all trails within and adjacent to the wilderness on at least \n     an annual basis; and\n       Whereas, the Chief of the United States Forest Service has \n     not programmed on a continuing basis even normal repair, \n     replacement and maintenance of the trail system and trail \n     structures such as bridges, trail tread, drainage, associated \n     signing and other essential actions to enable safe public \n     use, full and unimpeded public access by foot and horseback \n     and the public services that are vital to public use and \n     enjoyment of the wilderness, in order to prevent cumulative \n     deterioration of the system under even non-fire conditions; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Chief of the United States Forest Service has \n     not placed emphasis on efficient and economical methods of \n     trail restoration and maintenance, and has in fact \n     aggressively limited methods and tools by Forest Service \n     crews, contractors and volunteers that would greatly increase \n     accomplishment and lower costs without adverse effect on \n     wilderness values or visitors; and\n       Whereas, use of outfitter and guide permittees, contractors \n     and volunteers from various organizations to accomplish trail \n     work is well below potential due to a lack of emphasis by the \n     United States Forest Service on using innovative ways to \n     offset permittee fees and streamline and simplify contracting \n     procedures: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the members of the First Regular Session of \n     the Sixty-second Idaho Legislature, the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate concurring therein, That we \n     urge the Secretary of the United States Department of \n     Agriculture to declare the Frank Church-River of No Return \n     Wilderness and adjacent national forest lands to be a Natural \n     Resources Disaster Area; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we urge the Secretary of Agriculture and the \n     Chief of the United States Forest Service to recognize the \n     dire conditions prevailing within and adjacent to the Frank \n     Church-River of No Return Wilderness and adjacent national \n     forests, and further urge that the necessary priorities and \n     emphasis be placed on prompt and practical actions to prevent \n     further cumulative loss of the unique values of the \n     wilderness; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we urge compliance with the specific \n     requirements of the Central Idaho Wilderness Act mandating \n     annual clearing of obstructions from the trail system; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the House of \n     Representatives be, and she is hereby authorized and directed \n     to forward a copy of this Memorial to the President of the \n     Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of \n     Congress, the congressional delegation representing the State \n     of Idaho in the Congress of the United States, the Secretary \n     of the United States Department of Agriculture and the Chief \n     of the United States Forest Service.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-71. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Michigan memorializing the President and the \n     Congress of the United States to support the continued and \n     increased development and importation of oil derived from \n     North American reserves; to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n\n[[Page S6014]]\n\n                   Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 6\n\n       Whereas, The United States relies--and will continue to \n     rely for many years--on gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel, as \n     well as renewable and alternative sources of energy. In order \n     to fuel our economy, the United States will need more oil and \n     natural gas while also requiring additional alternative \n     energy sources; and\n       Whereas, The United States accounts for 20 percent of world \n     energy consumption and is the world's largest petroleum \n     consumer. The U.S. consumes more than 18 million barrels of \n     oil each day, and forecasts suggest this will not change for \n     decades. Current imports amount to over 8 million barrels \n     each day, approximately 50 percent of the United States' \n     requirements. Even with new technology, oil discoveries, \n     alternative fuels, and conservation efforts, the U.S. will \n     remain dependent on imported energy for decades to come. A \n     secure supply of crude oil is not only needed for Americans \n     to continue to heat their homes, cook their food, and drive \n     their vehicles, but to allow the U.S. economy to thrive and \n     grow free from the potential threats and disruptions of crude \n     oil supply from less secure parts of the world; and\n       Whereas, The growing production of conflict-free oil from \n     Canada's oil sands and the Bakken Formation in Saskatchewan, \n     Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota can replace crude \n     imported from countries that do not share American values. \n     However, additional pipeline capacity to refineries in the \n     U.S. Midwest and Gulf Coast is required; and\n       Whereas, Increasing energy imports from Canada makes sense \n     for the United States. Canada is a trusted neighbor with \n     stable democratic government, strong environmental \n     standards--equal to that of the U.S. and some of the most \n     stringent human rights and worker protection legislation in \n     the world; and\n       Whereas, Improvements in production technology have reduced \n     the carbon footprint of Canadian oil sands development by 26 \n     percent on a per-barrel basis since 1990. Oil sands \n     production accounts for 6.9 percent of Canada's greenhouse \n     gas (GHG) emissions and 0.1 percent, or one-thousandth, of \n     global GHG emissions. Total emissions from Canada's oil sands \n     sector was 48 megatons in 2010, equivalent to 0.5 percent of \n     U.S. GHG emissions. Oil sands crude has similar carbon \n     dioxide emissions to other heavy oils and is 9 percent more \n     carbon-intensive than the average crude refined in the U.S. \n     on a wells-to-wheels basis; and\n       Whereas, The 57 refineries in the Gulf Coast region provide \n     a total refining capacity of approximately 8.7 million \n     barrels per day (bpd), or half of U.S. refining capacity. In \n     2011, these refineries imported approximately 5 million bpd \n     of crude oil from more than 30 countries, with the top four \n     suppliers being Mexico (22 percent), Saudi Arabia (17 \n     percent), Venezuela (16 percent), and Nigeria (9 percent). \n     Imports from Mexico and Venezuela are declining as production \n     from these countries decreases and supply contracts expire. \n     Once completed, TransCanada's Keystone XL and Gulf Coast \n     Expansion projects could displace roughly 40 percent of the \n     oil the U.S. currently imports from the Persian Gulf and \n     Venezuela; and\n       Whereas, The Keystone XL pipeline project has been subject \n     to the most thorough public consultation process of any \n     proposed U.S. pipeline. It has also been the focus of \n     multiple environmental impact statements and several U.S. \n     Department of State studies. These analyses have concluded \n     that it poses the least impact to the environment and is much \n     safer than other modes of transporting crude oil; and\n       Whereas, Pipelines are the safest method for the \n     transportation of petroleum products when compared to other \n     methods of transportation. The Keystone XL pipeline will \n     replace the equivalent of 200 ocean tankers per year. This \n     will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 19 million \n     tons, or the equivalent of taking almost 4 million cars off \n     the road; and\n       Whereas, The original Keystone pipeline, which spans across \n     the northern part of Missouri, supplies over 435,000 barrels \n     of North American crude oil to American refineries in the \n     Midwest. The Keystone XL pipeline will, when completed, carry \n     700,000 barrels of North American crude oil to American \n     refineries in the Gulf Coast region which will make its way \n     back to Missouri in the form of gasoline, diesel, and jet \n     fuel; and\n       Whereas, The Keystone XL project will create approximately \n     9,000 construction jobs. The Gulf Coast project is a $2.3 \n     billion project that will create approximately 4,000 \n     construction jobs. Combined, they support yet another 7,000 \n     manufacturing jobs. Seventy-five percent of the pipe used to \n     build the Keystone XL in the U.S. will come from North \n     American mills, including half made by U.S. workers. Goods \n     for the pipeline, valued at approximately $800 million, have \n     already been sourced from U.S. manufacturers: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That we:\n       1. Support continued and increased development and delivery \n     of oil derived from North American oil reserves to American \n     refineries;\n       2. Urge the United States Congress to support continued and \n     increased development and delivery of oil from Canada to the \n     United States;\n       3. Urge the President of the United States to support the \n     continued and increased importation of oil derived from the \n     Bakken Formation in Saskatchewan, Montana, North Dakota, and \n     South Dakota, as well as Canadian oil sands; and\n       4. Urge the U.S. Secretary of State to approve the newly-\n     routed pipeline application from TransCanada to reduce \n     dependence on unstable governments, create new jobs, improve \n     our national security, and strengthen ties with an important \n     ally; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the U.S. Secretary of \n     State, the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker \n     of the United States House of Representatives, and the \n     members of the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-72. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Commonwealth of Kentucky urging the \n     President of the United States to encourage oil and natural \n     gas production off the northern coast of Alaska, and to \n     approve the construction of the TransCanada Keystone XL \n     pipeline project; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 122\n\n       A Resolution urging the President of the United States to \n     encourage oil and natural gas production off the northern \n     coast of Alaska, and to approve the construction of the \n     TransCanada Keystone XL pipeline project.\n       Whereas, high oil prices are having a major detrimental \n     impact on families, farms, and businesses in Kentucky and are \n     likely to undercut the prospects for an economic recovery; \n     and\n       Whereas, the United States currently imports almost half of \n     its oil and petroleum products, making it dependent on \n     foreign sources and subject to interruptions and price \n     fluctuations stemming from geopolitical forces; and\n       Whereas, such instability has damaging consequences both \n     for our economy and our national security; and\n       Whereas, the United States Geological Survey estimates a \n     resource of up to 27 billion barrels of oil in the Chukchi \n     and Beaufort Seas of Alaska, providing a vast domestic oil \n     reserve, but opposition and regulatory hurdles are keeping \n     energy producers from accessing these resources; and\n       Whereas, the TransCanada Keystone XL pipeline project seeks \n     to link expanded oil production from the Canadian oil sands \n     to refineries in the United States and to facilitate the flow \n     of oil from the Dakotas to the Gulf Coast, thereby decreasing \n     our dependence on oil from outside of North America; and\n       Whereas, Canada is a close friend and ally, with whom we \n     share links of infrastructure and energy networks and other \n     ties, so that dollars spent on Canadian oil will likely \n     contribute to the success of the American economy; and\n       Whereas, the TransCanada pipeline project is projected to \n     create construction and manufacturing jobs in the United \n     States, adding billions of dollars to our economy: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the General \n     Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:\n       Section 1. The House of Representatives of the Commonwealth \n     of Kentucky calls upon President Barack Obama and \n     administration officials to support the increased importation \n     of oil from Canadian oil sands and to approve the newly \n     routed TransCanada Keystone XL pipeline to reduce our oil \n     dependency on unstable governments, strengthen ties with an \n     important ally, and create jobs for American workers.\n       Section 2. The House of Representatives of the Commonwealth \n     of Kentucky calls upon President Barack Obama and \n     administration officials to support and facilitate permitting \n     for oil production off the northern coast of Alaska to \n     decrease our dependence on foreign oil and spur investment in \n     the American economy.\n       Section 3. A copy of this Resolution shall be sent to the \n     President and Vice President of the United States of America, \n     the Secretary of State of the United States of America, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and \n     each member of the Kentucky delegation to the United States \n     Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-73. A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     Virgin Islands petitioning the United States Congress to pass \n     and adopt H.R. 92, which would authorize a grant of \n     $100,000,000 to the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority \n     to alleviate the energy crisis in the Territory and for other \n     purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                          Resolution No. 1794\n\n       Whereas, the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority \n     (``the Authority'') generates electricity through the use of \n     fossil fuel refined into diesel; and\n       Whereas, studies have shown that electricity generation \n     accounts for approximately sixty eight percent of total \n     energy usage in the Virgin Islands; and\n       Whereas, in the last decade the cost of fuel used by the \n     Authority to produce electricity has risen from $32.06 per \n     barrel in October 2003 to $138.50 per barrel in February \n     2013; and\n       Whereas, the current consumer cost of electrical power in \n     the Virgin Islands, at $.52 per kilowatt hour for residential \n     customers and $.58 per kilowatt hour for commercial \n     customers, is the highest under the American flag; and\n\n[[Page S6015]]\n\n       Whereas, the average monthly electricity bill for Virgin \n     Islands households is $254, five times the national average; \n     and Whereas, residential and commercial consumers are \n     particularly ill-placed to absorb the high and rising costs \n     of electricity as the per capita income in the Virgin Islands \n     is approximately fifty three percent of the national average; \n     and\n       Whereas, the increasingly unsupportable cost of electricity \n     has resulted in an exodus of residents and the closure of \n     businesses, including the territory's last remaining dairy \n     operation; and\n       Whereas, the Virgin Islands Public Services Commission \n     which regulates public utilities in the territory, has \n     publicly stated that the high rates of electricity are \n     depriving the local economy of between $150-250 million \n     annually and that the current electrical rates cannot be \n     sustained for a significant time without substantial harm to \n     the economy of the Virgin Islands; and\n       Whereas, the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority's \n     (``the Authority'') efforts to convert to alternate fuels and \n     renewable energy sources cannot be effectuated immediately \n     but will require some years to implement; and\n       Whereas, the conversion of equipment to burn alternative \n     fuels will cost the Authority millions of dollars; and\n       Whereas, the major supplier of fuel to the Authority closed \n     its doors and is not refining fossil fuels; and\n       Whereas, the planned conversion of the Authority's \n     generating plants to utlize less expensive fuels including \n     Liquified Petroleum Gas and Liquified Natural Gas are not \n     expected to result in lower electricity rates until at least \n     mid 2014; and\n       Whereas, the Virgin Islands Delegate to Congress, Donna \n     Christian-Christensen, has introduced legislation, H.R. 92 in \n     the House of Representatives that would authorize a grant of \n     $100,000,000 to the Authority should it apply and $15,000,000 \n     for fiscal years 2013 through 2017 for the conversion of fuel \n     oil (diesel) to liquefied natural gas or liquefied petroleum \n     gas; and\n       Whereas, the fiscal stability and survival of the \n     territory, including hotels, gifts shops, restaurants, bars \n     and the average business is dependent on cost effective \n     electricity to generate a profit and pay taxes which in turn \n     keep schools, hospitals and government department and \n     agencies running; and\n       Whereas, the territory's efforts at economic recovery and \n     industry recruitment are severely hampered by the high rate \n     of electricity, which discourages new investment and business \n     development: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Legislature of the Virgin Islands:\n       Section 1. The Legislature, on behalf of the People of the \n     Virgin Islands respectfully urges the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States to adopt \n     H.R. 92 to authorized a one hundred million dollar grant to \n     the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority and a grant of \n     fifteen million dollars to convert from fuel oil to natural \n     gas.\n       Section 2.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Nevada urging Congress to enact the Lyon County \n     Economic Development and Conservation Act; to the Committee \n     on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 14\n\n       Whereas, The Lyon County Economic Development and \n     Conservation Act, H.R. 696, was recently introduced in the \n     113th Congress; and\n       Whereas, The intent of this proposed legislation is to \n     promote the preservation of wilderness and develop a \n     sustainable development plan to enable all persons to benefit \n     from the use of land adjacent to the City of Yerington for \n     potential commercial and industrial development, mining \n     activities, recreational opportunities and expansion of \n     community and cultural events; and\n       Whereas, The provisions of the Lyon County Economic \n     Development and Conservation Act propose to convey federal \n     land to the City of Yerington for the purposes of sustainable \n     economic and industrial development; and\n       Whereas, Commercial and industrial development of the \n     federal land would enable the community to benefit from the \n     transportation, power and water infrastructure that would be \n     put in place with the concurrent development of commercial \n     and industrial operations; and\n       Whereas, The federal land proposed for conveyance to the \n     City under the Lyon County Economic Development and \n     Conservation Act is adjacent to the boundaries of the City \n     and would be used to enhance recreational, cultural, \n     commercial and industrial development opportunities in the \n     City; and\n       Whereas, The provisions of the Lyon County Economic \n     Development and Conservation Act propose to designate federal \n     land as wilderness and as a component of the National \n     Wilderness Preservation System, to be known as the ``Wovoka \n     Wilderness''; and\n       Whereas, The proposed Wovoka Wilderness is named in honor \n     of the Northern Paiute spiritual leader and founder of the \n     Ghost Dance, and contains landscapes and wildlife habitat \n     that have been enjoyed by hunters, outdoor enthusiasts and \n     explorers since John C. Fremont camped along the East Walker \n     River in 1844; and\n       Whereas, The Lyon County Economic Development and \n     Conservation Act will create an estimated 1,300 jobs and \n     provide much needed economic development for the City of \n     Yerington and Lyon County; and\n       Whereas, The designation of the proposed Wovoka Wilderness \n     will preserve invaluable prehistoric cultural and natural \n     resources, thereby preserving those resources for future \n     generations: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of Nevada, \n     jointly, That the members of the 77th Session of the Nevada \n     Legislature hereby urge Congress to enact the Lyon County \n     Economic Development and Conservation Act; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of \n     the United States as the presiding officer of the Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives and each member of \n     the Nevada Congressional Delegation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon \n     passage.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-75. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Utah declaring and asserting the jurisdictional \n     right of the State of Utah and its political subdivisions to \n     respond to and take action when conditions on federally \n     managed land in the state adversely affect, or may adversely \n     affect, the health, safety, or welfare of the people; to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                       House Joint Resolution 15\n\n       Whereas, in its Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \n     decision, released June 2012, the United States Supreme Court \n     reaffirmed the position of the states as ``separate and \n     independent sovereigns'';\n       Whereas, the court made it clear that the federal \n     government ``must show that a constitutional grant of power \n     authorizes each of its actions'';\n       Whereas, in contrast, the Supreme Court further explained \n     that ``the same does not apply to the States, because the \n     Constitution is not the source of their power. . . . The \n     States thus can and do perform many of the vital functions of \n     modern government . . .  even though the Constitution's text \n     does not authorize any government to do so'';\n       Whereas, the Supreme Court added, ``Our cases refer to this \n     general power of governing, possessed by the States but not \n     by the federal government, as the `police power.' . .  \n     Because the police power is controlled by 50 different states \n     instead of one national sovereign, the facets of governing \n     that touch on citizens' daily lives are normally administered \n     by smaller governments closer to the governed. The Framers \n     thus ensured that powers which `in the ordinary course of \n     affairs, concern the lives, liberties, and properties of the \n     people' were held by governments more local and more \n     accountable than a distant bureaucracy'';\n       Whereas, the Supreme Court also highlighted a vital role of \n     states' authority in relation to the federal government, \n     stating, ``The independent power of the States also serves as \n     a check on the power of the Federal Government: `By denying \n     any one government complete jurisdiction over all the \n     concerns of public life, federalism protects the liberty of \n     the individual from arbitrary power . . .  In the typical \n     case we look to the States to defend their prerogatives by \n     adopting ``the simple expedient of not yielding'' to federal \n     blandishments when they do not want to embrace the federal \n     policies as their own;\n       Whereas, the Supreme Court, concluding this line of logic, \n     declared, ``The States are separate and independent \n     sovereigns. Sometimes they have to act like it'';\n       Whereas, in 1917, the Court, in Utah Power and Light v. \n     United States, held that ``The power of the United States to \n     protect its property by its own legislation from private \n     trespass and waste does not, and cannot, imply a general \n     police power over the vacant public lands within a State. The \n     section in the Constitution relating to the admission of new \n     States, and the concomitant disposition of the public lands, \n     excludes, by its express terms, any construction by which the \n     United States may claim any additional governmental or police \n     powers within the States in which such public land is \n     situated'';\n       Whereas, Article 1, Section 8, Clause 17, of the United \n     States Constitution states that the federal government will \n     ``exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, \n     over such District (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, \n     by Cession of Particular States, and the Acceptance of \n     Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the United \n     States, and to exercise like Authority over all Places \n     purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State in \n     which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, \n     Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards, and other needful \n     Buildings'';\n       Whereas, the domain of exclusive jurisdiction by the \n     federal government is limited to the District of Columbia and \n     other Places purchased by the Consent of the State \n     Legislatures for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, \n     dock-Yards, and other needful Buildings incidental to the \n     powers expressly granted within the Constitution;\n       Whereas, ``other needful Buildings'' did not include vast \n     acres of undeveloped land;\n\n[[Page S6016]]\n\n       Whereas, although Section 3 of the Utah Enabling Act \n     states, in part, ``That the people inhabiting said proposed \n     State do agree and declare that they forever disclaim all \n     right and title to the unappropriated public lands lying \n     within the boundaries thereof,'' the state of Utah did not \n     disclaim its jurisdiction;\n       Whereas, during the Eisenhower Administration, the United \n     States government published a report entitled ``Report of the \n     Interdepartmental Committee for the Study of Jurisdiction \n     Over Federal Areas Within the States'' in which four basic \n     areas of federal jurisdiction were identified:\n       1. Exclusive Legislative Jurisdiction: This term is applied \n     when the federal government possesses, by whichever method \n     acquired, all of the authority of the State, and in which the \n     State concerned has not reserved to itself the right to \n     exercise any of the authority concurrently with the United \n     States except to serve civil or criminal process in the area \n     for activities that occurred outside the area;\n       2. Concurrent Legislative Jurisdiction: This term is \n     applied in those instances wherein by granting to the United \n     States authority--which would otherwise amount to exclusive \n     legislative jurisdiction over an area--the State concerned \n     has reserved to itself the right to exercise, concurrently \n     with the United States, all of the same authority;\n       3. Partial Legislative Jurisdiction: This term is applied \n     in those instances wherein a state has granted authority to \n     the federal government to legislate over an area of the state \n     but the State has reserved to itself the right to exercise, \n     by itself or concurrently with the United States, other \n     authority constituting more than merely the right to serve \n     civil or criminal process in the area, or the right to tax \n     private property;\n       4. Proprietorial Interest Only: This term is applied to \n     those instances wherein the federal government has acquired \n     some right or title to an area in a state, but has not \n     obtained any measure of the State's authority over the area. \n     In applying this definition, recognition should be given to \n     the fact that the United States, by virtue of its functions \n     and authority under various provisions of the Constitution, \n     has many powers and immunities not possessed by ordinary \n     landholders with respect to areas in which it acquires an \n     interest, and of the further fact that all its properties and \n     functions are held or performed in a governmental, rather \n     than proprietary, capacity;\n       Whereas, the report also stated, ``It scarcely needs to be \n     said that unless there has been a transfer of jurisdiction \n     pursuant to clause 17 by a Federal acquisition of land with \n     State consent, or by cession from the State to the Federal \n     Government, or unless the Federal Government has reserved \n     jurisdiction upon admission of the State, the Federal \n     Government possesses no legislative jurisdiction over any \n     area within a State, such jurisdiction being for exercise by \n     the State, subject to non-interference by the State with \n     Federal functions. . . . The consent requirement of Article \n     I, Section 8, Clause 17, was intended by the framers of the \n     Constitution to preserve the State's jurisdictional integrity \n     against federal encroachment. The Federal Government cannot, \n     by unilateral action on its part, acquire legislative \n     jurisdiction over any area within the exterior boundaries of \n     a State'';\n       Whereas, an Inventory Report On Jurisdictional Status of \n     Federal Areas Within the States, compiled by the United \n     States General Services Administration, categorizes all \n     United States Forest Service (USFS) and Bureau of Land \n     Management (BLM) land in the state of Utah as #4, \n     Proprietorial Interest Only;\n       Whereas, the USFS and the BLM have caused a public nuisance \n     and safety issue for the people of the state of Utah and \n     Utah's political subdivisions by not removing the condition, \n     persistently in the National Forest and BLM system lands, of \n     imminent fire and not mitigating the effects of recent fires;\n       Whereas, Utah's 2012 Shingle Creek Fire was human caused on \n     USFS land;\n       Whereas, the fire was one-third contained by the operation \n     of one bulldozer;\n       Whereas, four bulldozers were ready for use by 6 p.m. on \n     the day of the fire, but since the fire was on USFS land, \n     only one bulldozer was allowed to operate until 10 p.m. and \n     was only allowed to operate one blade wide and to dig no \n     deeper than two inches;\n       Whereas, as a result, the fire burned more than 8,000 \n     acres, damaged and altered the local watershed, created \n     future risks of debris and mudslides, and will require costly \n     repairs;\n       Whereas, Utah's 2012 Seeley Fire, which was started by \n     lightning, eventually destroyed over 48,000 acres, or 76 \n     square miles;\n       Whereas, debris flow and sediment from the Seeley Fire will \n     be a major issue in the surrounding watershed for the next \n     two to five years, impacting local municipalities, power \n     plants, local businesses, homes, roads, bridges, and farms;\n       Whereas, in one instance, the USFS chose to bulldoze a \n     portion of private land, claiming it was the best place to \n     fight the wildfire;\n       Whereas, these are just two examples of conditions at the \n     community level that have been made worse by the federal \n     government's mismanagement of federal lands;\n       Whereas, the jurisdictional right of states and their \n     political subdivisions to mitigate potential risks to the \n     health, safety, or welfare of the state or a political \n     subdivision should not be fettered by the federal \n     bureaucracy; and\n       Whereas, states should assert their rights to mitigate \n     potential risks to the health, safety, or welfare of the \n     state or a political subdivision and not allow their \n     authority to be eroded by federal government claims of \n     authority: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah declare \n     and assert its jurisdictional right, and the right of its \n     political subdivisions, to respond to and take action when \n     conditions on federally managed land in the state adversely \n     affect, or may adversely affect, the health, safety, or \n     welfare of the people without the intrusion and interference \n     of the federal government on its efforts to respond to the \n     needs of their citizens; and be it further.\n       Resolved, That the Legislature urges the states to declare \n     and assert their jurisdictional rights, and the rights of \n     their political subdivisions, to respond to and take action \n     when conditions on federally managed land in the states \n     adversely affect, or may adversely affect, the health, \n     safety, or welfare of the people without the intrusion and \n     interference of the federal government on efforts to respond \n     to the needs of their citizens; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     President of the United States, the Majority Leader of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, the United States Forest Service, the \n     commissions of each county in the state of Utah, the Council \n     of State Governments, the National Conference of State \n     Legislatures, and the members of Utah's congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-76. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Utah supporting the transfer of \n     administration of the Utah Navajo oil and gas royalties to \n     the Utah Dineh Corporation; to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 11\n\n       Whereas, in 1933, Congress enacted 47 Stat. 1418, which \n     expanded the boundaries of the Navajo Reservation north of \n     the San Juan River, in San Juan County, Utah, referred to as \n     the ``Aneth Extension,'' and directed that 37.5% of all \n     royalties from oil and gas extracted from certain portions of \n     the Aneth Extension ``shall be expended by the State of Utah \n     in the Tuition of Indian children in white schools and/or in \n     the building or maintenance of roads across the [Aneth \n     Extension], or for the benefit of the Indians residing \n     therein'';\n       Whereas, in 1968, Congress enacted Public Law 90-306, 82 \n     Stat. 121, which expanded the beneficiary class to include \n     all Navajo residing in San Juan County, Utah, (Utah Dineh), \n     and which redefined the purposes of the Utah Navajo Trust \n     Fund (UNTF) to include the beneficiaries' ``health, education \n     and general welfare'';\n       Whereas, the 1933 act and the 1968 expansion of the \n     beneficiary (Federal Acts) class effectively created a common \n     law discretionary trust whereby the United States is the \n     settlor, Utah is the trustee, and all Utah Dineh residing in \n     San Juan County, Utah, are beneficiaries;\n       Whereas, pursuant to the Federal Acts, Utah is directed to \n     administer the oil and gas royalties for the health, \n     education, and general welfare of the Navajo Indians residing \n     in San Juan County;\n       Whereas, oil and gas were first extracted in paying \n     quantities from the Aneth Extension during or about the late \n     1950s;\n       Whereas, in 2008, the Legislature of the state of Utah \n     enacted H.B. 352, Amendments Related to Monies Derived from \n     Navajo Nation Reservation Lands in Utah, which in part \n     declared, ``It is the purpose of this chapter to provide for \n     a transitional process until congressional action designates \n     a new recipient of the Utah Navajo royalties'';\n       Whereas, H.C.R. 4, Concurrent Resolution Encouraging \n     Congressional Action to Designate a New Recipient of \n     Royalties from Navajo Reservation Lands in Utah, also passed \n     by the Utah Legislature in 2008, noted that ``the state first \n     received monies from the 37.5% of the oil and gas royalties \n     in 1959 and litigation related to those royalties began \n     almost immediately'' and that ``the litigious environment \n     surrounding the state's administration of the oil and gas \n     royalties harms the relationship between the state and the \n     San Juan Navajos and complicates all parties' ability to meet \n     the needs of the San Juan Navajos'';\n       Whereas, H.B. 352 incrementally reduced expenditures under \n     the trust duties;\n       Whereas, H.B. 352 resulted in the establishment of what \n     became known as the Navajo Royalty Holding Fund (NRHF) no \n     later than July 1, 2008, into which all oil and gas royalties \n     monetary assets and future royalty payments would be placed;\n       Whereas, Utah law, established by H.B. 352, was amended in \n     2012 by S.B. 155, Transition for Repealed Navajo Trust Fund \n     Act, to allow expenditures from the NRHF for the education of \n     certain beneficiaries up to January 1, 2014;\n       Whereas, on June 30, 2010, net assets then being held by \n     the state of Utah in the NRHF totaled $51,352,590;\n       Whereas, this includes a $33,000,000 court settlement, the \n     final installment of which is to be paid by the state of Utah \n     in 2013;\n       Whereas, litigation is now pending in United States \n     District Court seeking to force the state of Utah to resume \n     active administration of the oil and gas royalties for the \n     health, education, and general welfare of the beneficiaries;\n       Whereas, the health, education, and general welfare of the \n     beneficiaries would be improved by continuing projects \n     previously\n\n[[Page S6017]]\n\n     funded, wholly or partially, with oil and gas royalties \n     funds, including housing, water development, range \n     improvement, delivery of education, healthcare, and other \n     social services;\n       Whereas, beneficiaries seeking secondary education are \n     currently unsure whether college financial aid will continue \n     to be available through the NRHF;\n       Whereas, in certain carefully selected instances, and in \n     partnership with other governmental and private financial \n     institutions, the beneficiaries would benefit from the \n     expenditure of oil and gas royalty money for economic \n     development in San Juan County;\n       Whereas, the oil and gas royalties should be actively \n     administered in these areas of need for the health, \n     education, and general welfare of the beneficiaries;\n       Whereas, the Federal Acts provide no mechanism for the \n     state of Utah to resign as trustee of the oil and gas \n     royalties;\n       Whereas, legislation to amend the Federal Acts to name a \n     successor trustee was introduced in the 111th and 112th \n     Congress, but did not become law;\n       Whereas, no legislation to amend the Federal Acts to name a \n     successor trustee has been introduced in the 113th Congress;\n       Whereas, the Legislature of the state of Utah and the \n     Governor stated in H.C.R. 4 that the ``removal of the state \n     as a go-between provides an opportunity for Navajos'';\n       Whereas, the Utah Dineh Corporation (UDC) is a nonprofit \n     organization formed under the Utah Revised Nonprofit \n     Corporation Act;\n       Whereas, the UDC is organized exclusively for charitable, \n     religious, educational, and scientific purposes, including \n     the making of distributions to organizations that qualify as \n     exempt organizations under IRC Section 501(c) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code;\n       Whereas, UDC's proposed amended bylaws ensure transparency \n     and accountability at every level of corporate administration \n     and prohibits real and apparent conflicts of interest, \n     including nepotism, at every level of corporate \n     administration;\n       Whereas, the UDC's proposed amended bylaws position the \n     Utah Dineh to play important roles in oil and gas royalties \n     administration and oversight, require that the overall value \n     of the oil and gas royalties' assets, currently estimated at \n     approximately $55,000,000, be maintained and, if consistent \n     with applicable law and oil and gas royalties' purposes, \n     grown;\n       Whereas, the UDC's proposed amended bylaws require that any \n     oil and gas royalties' assets made available for economic \n     development be limited in amount, comprise only a minor \n     portion of any single funding package, be partnered with \n     loans from other chartered financial institutions, be offered \n     only as loans at current market rates for any amount over \n     $300, and occur only after it is expressly determined that \n     the expenditure will actually promote the beneficiaries' \n     health, education, or general welfare;\n       Whereas, the UDC's proposed amended bylaws provide that if \n     all oil and gas royalties administrative and fiduciary \n     obligations are transferred to the Utah Dineh Corporation, a \n     Request For Proposals addressed to large, chartered financial \n     institutions will be issued immediately, and every three \n     years thereafter, for performing fund management, investing, \n     and auditing services;\n       Whereas, the members of each Utah chapter of the Navajo \n     Nation have previously resolved to support the UDC's effort \n     to become the trustee of the oil and gas royalties;\n       Whereas, this support will again be ensured by means deemed \n     reasonable and reliable prior to any transfer of oil and gas \n     royalties administration to the UDC;\n       Whereas, the San Juan County Board of Commissioners \n     unanimously supports transfer of administrative and fiduciary \n     obligations for the oil and gas royalties to the UDC;\n       Whereas, the UDC Board of Directors will include \n     representatives elected from each Utah chapter of the Navajo \n     Nation and from one chapter organized to represent Utah Dineh \n     that currently do not reside within Navajo Reservation \n     boundaries;\n       Whereas, the UDC intends to administer the oil and gas \n     royalties pursuant to all applicable laws and regulations, \n     including the common law of Indian trusts that imposes strict \n     and exacting fiduciary obligations upon any trustee \n     administering the property of Native Americans; and\n       Whereas, any transfer of oil and gas royalties \n     administrative and fiduciary obligations to the UDC must \n     ensure that the state of Utah is indemnified and held \n     harmless for any liability, damages, or litigation costs \n     resulting from oil and gas royalties administration: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah, the \n     Governor concurring therein, expresses its support for the \n     transfer of all oil and gas royalties administrative and \n     fiduciary obligations to the Utah Dineh Corporation \n     conditioned on removal of the state as trustee, by an act of \n     Congress or a federal court order that can then be used to \n     encourage congressional action and that indemnifies and holds \n     harmless the state of Utah from any and all legal and \n     equitable claims; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor declare \n     that any transfer of the oil and gas royalties administrative \n     and fiduciary obligations to the Utah Dineh Corporation by \n     Congressional act or federal court order must also indemnify \n     and hold harmless the state of Utah from any and all legal \n     and equitable claims arising from future oil and gas \n     royalties administration by the Utah Dineh Corporation and \n     for litigation costs related to any claims; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor declare \n     that any transfer of oil and gas royalties administrative and \n     fiduciary obligations to the Utah Dineh Corporation should \n     require that the value of fixed and monetary oil and gas \n     royalties assets remain at least at current levels so that \n     funds will be available to promote future generations of oil \n     and gas royalties beneficiaries' health, education, and \n     general welfare and that the

Muskie, Senator George J. \n     Mitchell and Senator William S. Cohen; and\n       Whereas, nationally the Clean Air Act has prevented an \n     estimated 160,000 premature deaths, more than 130,000 heart \n     attacks and over 1.7 million asthma attacks in 2010 alone; \n     and\n       Whereas, reducing air pollution through the Clean Air Act \n     will provide the United States with $2 trillion in benefits \n     and prevent 230,000 deaths in 2020; and\n       Whereas, it is not necessary to choose between improving \n     public health and helping our economy innovate and grow, as \n     evidenced by data showing that between 1970 and 2009 total \n     emissions of the 6 principal air pollutants fell by 63 \n     percent, while private sector jobs and our nation's gross \n     domestic product increased by 86 percent and 210 percent, \n     respectively; and\n       Whereas, the United States Environmental Protection Agency \n     has concluded that the Clean Air Act has produced economic \n     benefits valued at 30 times the cost of regulation; and\n       Whereas, the Clean Air Act is continually threatened by \n     attempts to weaken, block, delay or underfund its important \n     public health safeguards: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, respectfully urge and \n     request that the President of the United States and the \n     United States Congress support the Clean Air Act and fund its \n     enforcement and fund the infrastructure that reduces the \n     dangerous air pollution that crosses into Maine and that \n     ensures the it is safe to breathe for Maine children and \n     adults; and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to \n     the Honorable Barack H.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Maine memorializing the President of the United \n     States and the United States Congress to not require the use \n     of E15 gasoline; to the Committee on Environment and Public \n     Works.\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       We, your Memorialists, the Members of the One Hundred and \n     Twenty-sixth Legislature of the State of Maine now assembled \n     in the First Regular Session, most respectfully present and \n     petition the President of the United States and the United \n     States Congress, as follows:\n       Whereas, federal laws and regulations, including the Clean \n     Air Act, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the national \n     renewable fuel standard program, have contributed to changes \n     in fuel standards, such as the removal of methyl tertiary \n     butyl ether, or MTBE, as an oxygenate in fuel, leading to the \n     use of ethanol as a replacement for MTBE; and\n       Whereas, only reformulated gasoline is now available for \n     purchase at public fuel pumps and typically contains a 10 \n     percent corn ethanol blend, known as El0, and in June 2012 \n     the United States Environmental Protection Agency approved \n     the sale of El5, a mixture of 15 percent ethanol and 85 \n     percent gasoline; and\n       Whereas, using the fuel blend has been promoted as a method \n     of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and our Nation's \n     dependence on foreign oil but these claims are disputed by \n     several automakers and others, such as AAA, which also claims \n     EIS will damage fuel lines and void vehicle warranties; and\n       Whereas, in addition, AAA claims that automotive \n     engineering experts believe that sustained use of EIS, both \n     in newer and older vehicles, could cause accelerated engine \n     wear and failure, fuel system damage and false ``check \n     engine'' lights for vehicles not approved by manufacturers to \n     use EIS; and\n       Whereas, EIS also has 5 percent less energy than gasoline \n     and about 2 percent less than El0 and therefore could \n     ultimately cost consumers more as a result of reduced fuel \n     economy; and\n       Whereas, the production of corn ethanol is wasteful of \n     fossil fuel resources and does not increase energy security \n     and with this production, which uses 10 percent of all arable \n     land in the United States, we see increased degradation of \n     vital land and water resources; and\n       Whereas, corn ethanol's impact on food prices is huge and \n     corn is now trading at an all-time high and this affects food \n     manufacturing and other industries such as animal feed \n     businesses; and\n       Whereas, the burning of corn ethanol increases the \n     emissions of gases and hazardous air pollutants that are \n     probable carcinogens and are the causes of numerous health \n     issues such as asthma, chronic bronchitis and other \n     respiratory problems; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, respectfully urge and \n     request that the President of the United States and members \n     of the United States Congress realize the major problems of \n     corn ethanol as a fuel additive and the numerous negative \n     effects it has on not only Maine citizens but all Americans \n     and we urge and request that the President of the United \n     States and the United States Congress consider reversing the \n     decision of the United States Environmental Protection Agency \n     to move forward with the use of E15; and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to \n     the Honorable Barack H. Obama, President of the United \n     States, to the Inspector General of the United States \n     Department of Energy, to the United States Environmental \n     Protection Agency, to the President of the United States \n     Senate, to the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives and to each Member of the Maine Congressional \n     Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-81. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Michigan urging the United States Department \n     of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to fulfill \n     their obligation to establish a permanent repository for \n     high-level nuclear waste; to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n                   Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 5\n\n       Whereas, Over the past four decades, nuclear power has been \n     a significant source for the nation's production of \n     electricity. According to the U.S. Nuclear Energy Institute, \n     nuclear power provided 19.2 percent of the electricity \n     produced in the United States in 2011. The Michigan Public \n     Service Commission estimates that 22 percent of the \n     electricity generated for use in Michigan is from nuclear \n     energy; and\n       Whereas, Since the earliest days of nuclear power, the \n     great dilemma associated with this technology is how to deal \n     with used nuclear fuel. This high-level radioactive waste \n     demands exceptional care in all facets of its storage and \n     disposal, including its transportation; and\n       Whereas, In 1982, Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy \n     Act of 1982. This legislation requires the federal \n     government, through the Department of Energy, to build a \n     repository for the permanent storage of high-level \n     radioactive waste from nuclear power plants. This act, which \n     was amended in 1987, includes a specific timetable to \n     identify a suitable location and to establish the waste \n     repository. The costs for this undertaking are paid from a \n     fee that is assessed on all nuclear energy produced; and\n       Whereas, In accordance with the federal act, customers of \n     Michigan electric utilities have paid $763 million through \n     September 30, 2010, into the federal Nuclear Waste Fund for \n     construction of the federal nuclear waste repository. Every \n     year, the total Nuclear Waste Fund balance grows by \n     approximately $750 million in direct ratepayer payments; and\n       Whereas, There are serious concerns that the federal \n     government is not complying\n\n[[Page S6019]]\n\n     with the timetables set forth in federal law. Every delay \n     places our country at greater risk for a catastrophe to \n     occur. The large number of temporary storage sites at nuclear \n     facilities across the country make us vulnerable to potential \n     problems. The events since September 11, 2001, clearly \n     illustrate the urgency of the need to establish a safe and \n     permanent high-level nuclear waste repository as soon as \n     possible. The Department of Energy, along with the Nuclear \n     Regulatory Commission, must work diligently to meet its \n     obligation as provided by law. There is too much at stake; \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That we urge the United States Department of \n     Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to fulfill their \n     obligation to establish a permanent repository for high-level \n     nuclear waste; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the United States Department of Energy, the Nuclear \n     Regulatory Commission, the President of the United States \n     Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-82. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan memorializing the Congress of the United States to \n     enact legislation to ensure that amounts credited to the \n     Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund are used solely for the \n     dredging, infrastructure, operation, and maintenance of \n     federally-authorized ports, harbors, and waterways; to the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 20\n\n       Whereas, Domestic shippers and importers using Great Lakes \n     and coastal ports pay more than a billion dollars per year in \n     federal harbor maintenance taxes. Congress established the \n     tax to fund harbor operation and maintenance, particularly \n     dredging, at these ports; and\n       Whereas, Despite a nearly $6.4 billion balance in the \n     Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, our nation's dredging needs \n     are not being met. Throughout our nation and particularly in \n     the Great Lakes region, the lack of dredging has forced \n     shippers to operate inefficiently and carry lighter loads, \n     costing them millions of dollars each year; and\n       Whereas, The Obama Administration has only budgeted about \n     half of the revenue collected through the harbor maintenance \n     tax for maintaining our nation's harbors. Last year, nearly \n     $1.6 billion were collected from shippers, but only $860 \n     million has been allocated for dredging harbors in Michigan \n     and other coastal states; and\n       Whereas, During the current turbulent economic conditions, \n     we must make every effort to support economic activity by \n     maintaining the infrastructure necessary for commerce. In \n     essentially using harbor maintenance taxes placed in the \n     Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund to finance and balance other \n     portions of the federal budget, we are breaking our promise \n     to the shippers paying the tax and hurting our nation's \n     economic recovery; and\n       Whereas, Current congressional legislation (H.R. 335 and S. \n     218) would ensure that harbor maintenance taxes are only used \n     for their intended purpose to maintain our nation's harbors: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to enact legislation to ensure that amounts \n     credited to the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund are used solely \n     for the dredging, infrastructure, operation, and maintenance \n     of federally-authorized ports, harbors, and waterways; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-83.

and\n       Whereas, Executive Order 12630, titled Governmental actions \n     and interference with constitutionally protected private \n     property rights, states that the USFWS must analyze the \n     potential implications of designating critical habitat in a \n     takings assessment: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah, the \n     Governor concurring therein, strongly urges the United States \n     Fish and Wildlife Service to recognize and protect private \n     landowner rights and their ability to make viable economic \n     use of their land by exempting or excluding private \n     properties in San Juan County from designation as critical \n     habitat in the proposed listing of the Gunnison sagegrouse \n     under the Endangered Species Act;

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Utah declaring that claims of the United States \n     Forest Service on state waters originating on public lands \n     undermine state sovereignty; to the Committee on Environment \n     and Public Works.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution No. 14\n\n       Whereas, water is essential to life, health, safety, and \n     welfare, especially in Utah and throughout the West;\n       Whereas, in its Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \n     decision released June 28, 2012, the United States Supreme \n     Court reaffirmed that jurisdiction over matters that \n     ``concern the lives, liberties, and properties of the \n     people'' are ``possessed by the States but not the Federal \n     Government'';\n       Whereas, in the exercise of its jurisdiction over water \n     resources within the state, the state of Utah has long \n     established the recognition of water rights to ``first in \n     time'' users of the water who can demonstrate the ability to \n     put the water to ``beneficial use'';\n       Whereas, in short, ``beneficial use'' means water use that \n     includes domestic use, irrigation, stock watering, \n     manufacturing, mining, hydropower, municipal use, \n     aquaculture, recreation, and fish and wildlife, among others;\n       Whereas, in disregard for and disrespect of the long-\n     established state jurisdiction over water resources, the \n     federal government, principally by and through the United \n     States Forest Service (USFS), has engaged in a persistent \n     pattern and course of conduct to exert control and influence \n     over water resources within the state and throughout the \n     West;\n\n[[Page S6020]]\n\n       Whereas, various federal agencies are acting to negatively \n     impact the water resources of Utah and other western states \n     by unilaterally and substantially reducing the number of \n     grazing permits and severely restricting timber harvesting;\n       Whereas, these federal policies, which overly restrict \n     timber harvesting and grazing, build up dangerous wildfire \n     fuel loads and result in inordinate water absorption for \n     unhealthy vegetation densities;\n       Whereas, these federal agencies are also threatening to not \n     renew often long-held grazing permits unless the permittee \n     signs a water right change application over to the federal \n     agency, closing roads and access to water resources, \n     diminishing water recreation opportunities, and imposing \n     onerous permit requirements;\n       Whereas, some specific examples of the disregard for and \n     disrespect of state jurisdiction over water resources by \n     federal agencies include:\n       1. In the spring of 2012, agents of the USFS coerced Tooele \n     County livestock producers to sign change applications on \n     private livestock water rights under compulsion of \n     prohibiting the livestock producers from turning out their \n     cattle onto their Forest Service allotment if the producers \n     did not comply with the federal agency demand.\n       2. Near Scipio, the USFS based its diligence claim filings \n     on use by nineteenth century settlers and then used the \n     filings, and the threat of protracted litigation, to \n     dispossess direct descendants of the settlers from their \n     legitimate water rights.\n       3. For many years, the United States Forest Service and the \n     Bureau of Land Management actively sought to reduce or \n     eliminate the livestock and watering rights of a Nevada \n     rancher. This action resulted in protracted litigation before \n     United States District Court Judge Robert C. Jones, which \n     concluded in the 2012 criminal convictions of two public \n     servants employed by the USFS and the Bureau of Land \n     Management. Both public servants were found guilty of \n     contempt of court and witness intimidation charges. At trial, \n     the regional forester in charge of Utah was found to have \n     lied to the court when asked about the agency's antigrazing \n     plan, which sought to eliminate cattle grazing on public \n     lands.\n       4. From 2011 to the present, federal agents have barred \n     city of Tombstone officials from accessing their water \n     resources established in the Huachuca Mountains as early as \n     1881, which were washed out by monsoon rains on the heels of \n     devastating wildfires exacerbated by unmitigated fuel loads. \n     Local officials were at first denied access to repair their \n     water lines, but were then allowed by USFS agents to only use \n     ``horses and hand tools'' to ascend the mountain on foot in \n     an obviously futile attempt to restore their water services. \n     In attempting to ascend the road they had used for decades to \n     repair their water resources with modern machinery, Tombstone \n     officials were met by armed Forest Service agents and turned \n     back at the threat of arrest and confiscation of expensive, \n     rented heavy machinery. The city of Tombstone is now engaged \n     in protracted litigation with the federal government over its \n     water resources and has been reduced to using arsenic-laced \n     wells that lack the pressure and capacity to withstand any \n     serious fire danger to the wooden town in the middle of a \n     desert in the middle of a drought.\n       5. The United States Forest Service filed suit in Idaho \n     against the Joyce Livestock Company, arguing the livestock \n     water rights were the property of the United States, based on \n     federal ownership and control of the public lands coupled \n     with the Bureau of Land Management's oversight of the public \n     lands under the Taylor Grazing Act. Through protracted \n     litigation, the Joyce Livestock Company proved its water \n     rights to have been in place since 1898. The district court \n     found no evidence that the United States had appropriated any \n     water by grazing livestock. Upon appeal, in Joyce Livestock \n     Company vs. United States, the Idaho Supreme Court \n     unanimously held that the United States did not actually \n     apply the water to beneficial use under the constitutional \n     method of appropriation and, therefore, had no water right.\n       6. USFS efforts to exert control over the water rights of \n     Colorado's ski industry were recently delayed on procedural \n     grounds in a lawsuit brought by the ski industry. The USFS, \n     through a new policy clause in the land use permitting \n     process, seeks to require ski industry interests to provide \n     joint ownership of state water rights, relinquish water \n     rights held jointly with the federal government if the use \n     permit is terminated, and grant ``limited'' power of attorney \n     to the United States to execute documents pertaining to \n     jointly held water rights with the promise that the ski \n     industry will waive any claim against the United States for \n     compensation of water rights lost as a result of the new \n     permit language.\n       Whereas, John Dickinson, one of the Founding Fathers of \n     this nation, warned, ``It will be their own faults, if the \n     several states suffer the federal sovereignty to interfere in \n     the things of their respective jurisdictions'';\n       Whereas, the United States Supreme Court also highlighted a \n     vital role of states' authority in relation to protecting the \n     liberty and property of their citizens by curbing federal \n     government overreach, stating, ``The Independent power of the \n     States also serves as a check on the power of the Federal \n     Government: `By denying any one government complete \n     jurisdiction over all the concerns of public life, federalism \n     protects the liberty of the individual from arbitrary power' \n     '';\n       Whereas, in its recent Patient Protection and Affordable \n     Care Act decision, the United States Supreme Court further \n     admonished states of their jurisdiction to protect matters of \n     health, safety, and welfare, such as the critical life-\n     sustaining issue of water in the West, stating, ``Our cases \n     refer to this general power of governing, possessed by the \n     States but not by the Federal Government, as the `police \n     power.' . . . Because the police power is controlled by 50 \n     different states instead of one national sovereign, the \n     facets of governing that touch on citizens' daily lives are \n     normally administered by smaller governments closer to the \n     governed. The Framers thus ensured that powers which `in the \n     ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties, and \n     properties of the people' were held by governments more local \n     and more accountable than a distant federal bureaucracy'';\n       Whereas, after recounting these fundamental principles and \n     the states' inherent powers as ``separate and independent \n     sovereigns,'' the United States Supreme Court admonished, \n     ``In the typical case we look to the States to defend their \n     prerogatives by adopting `the simple expedient of not \n     yielding' to federal blandishments when they do not want to \n     embrace the federal policies as their own. The States are \n     separate and independent sovereigns. Sometimes they have to \n     act like it'';\n       Whereas, the USFS Intermountain Region Guidance Document \n     states that the federal government will not invest in \n     livestock water improvements, ``nor,'' according to the \n     Intermountain Region Director, ``will the agency authorize \n     water improvements to be constructed or reconstructed with \n     private funds where the right is held solely by the livestock \n     owner'';\n       Whereas, when the USFS allows improvements, including \n     developing, redeveloping, and maintaining a livestock \n     permittee's water rights, all improvements are claimed as the \n     property of the United States, even when the investments are \n     made by individual livestock permittees to allow the \n     permittees to put their livestock watering rights to \n     beneficial use as prescribed under state law;\n       Whereas, the USFS has used pressure tactics to gain control \n     of livestock water rights by seeking change applications from \n     the permittees or joint ownership in water with the federal \n     agency;\n       Whereas, the USFS has threatened to not allow livestock \n     permittees onto its Forest Service grazing allotments until \n     permittees comply with the request;\n       Whereas, pre-existing water rights for livestock permittees \n     on federal lands are protected in both the 1934 Taylor \n     Grazing Act and the 1976 Federal Land Policy and Management \n     Act;\n       Whereas, these actions by federal agencies infringe on \n     recognized state jurisdiction and sovereignty, state law, and \n     water rights established through historic livestock watering \n     on public lands, and Utah's beneficial use doctrine;\n       Whereas, it is the apparent intention of the federal \n     government to further expand its water holdings in the West, \n     including Utah, through the USFS as provided in 16 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 526, which states, ``There are authorized to be \n     appropriated for expenditure by the Forest Service such sums \n     as may be necessary for the investigation and establishment \n     of water rights, including the purchase thereof or of lands \n     or interests in lands or rights-of-way for use and protection \n     of water rights necessary or beneficial in connection with \n     the administration and public use of the national forests'';\n       Whereas, the United States, by and through its various \n     agencies and departments, appears intent upon undermining, or \n     at the very least disregarding, state sovereignty and \n     jurisdiction over water rights and resources, as outlined in \n     the USFS Intermountain Region Guidance Document, which \n     states, ``until the court issues a decree accepting these \n     claims, it is not known whether these claims will be \n     recognized as water rights'';\n       Whereas, in seeking to expand the federal government's \n     interest in the Utah water rights portfolio and exert greater \n     control over the natural resources of the state, the USFS has \n     filed more than 16,000 water rights claims of ownership on \n     livestock watering rights located across the state;\n       Whereas, water rights claimed by the United States, based \n     on its control of public lands, coupled with the Bureau of \n     Land Management's comprehensive management of public lands \n     under the Taylor Grazing Act, do not constitute the \n     application of the water right to beneficial use under Utah's \n     constitutional method of water appropriation and beneficial \n     use;\n       Whereas, these waters are the property of the citizens of \n     the state of Utah under its constitution, and the control \n     falls under the stewardship and jurisdiction of the Utah \n     State Legislature;\n       Whereas, it is recognized and understood that the United \n     States cannot obtain sovereign water rights, nor can it \n     obtain historic livestock water rights established on public \n     lands, through federal laws;\n       Whereas, the consequence of allowing the federal government \n     to exceed its authority over water rights is clearly \n     illustrated by the great difficulty in getting the federal \n     government to acknowledge its encroachment and relinquish its \n     hold on that which the states should have by right;\n       Whereas, it is the sovereign right of the state of Utah, \n     the second most arid state in\n\n[[Page S6021]]\n\n      the nation, to exercise its obligation to protect the scarce \n     water resources within its borders for the health, safety, \n     and welfare of its citizens; and\n       Whereas, to do otherwise would be an abrogation of the \n     Legislature's constitutional responsibility and obligation on \n     behalf of the citizens of Utah, would weaken state authority, \n     and would relinquish to the federal government more control \n     over the water, natural resources, and lands contained within \n     the borders of Utah: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah affirms \n     the rights established in the Utah Constitution related to \n     the citizens' water and Utah's sovereign ownership, \n     jurisdiction, and control over its water; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah \n     declares that 191 the actions related to United States Forest \n     Service claims on state waters originating on public lands \n     undermines state sovereignty and jurisdiction and demands \n     action by the state of Utah to protect its sovereign, \n     recognized water ownership and rights on behalf of the \n     citizens of Utah; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah calls \n     on state, county, and local governments to protect, preserve, \n     and defend their jurisdiction and exercise their \n     constitutional obligation to protect the health, safety, and \n     welfare of the citizens of the state of Utah, particularly in \n     defending and maintaining jurisdiction over the water \n     resources of this state; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     United States Department of the Interior, the United States \n     Forest Service, the United States Department of Agriculture, \n     the Bureau of Land Management, the Utah Department of Natural \n     Resources, each county commission in the state of Utah, each \n     municipality in the state of Utah, and the members of Utah's \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-85. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States \n     Congress to take such actions as are necessary to pass the \n     ABLE Act; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 54\n\n       Whereas, the Achieving a Better Life Experience Act, also \n     known as the ABLE Act, has been introduced as S. 313 and H.R. \n     647 in the One Hundred Thirteenth United States Congress; and\n       Whereas, the ABLE Act would create tax-advantaged savings \n     accounts known as ``ABLE accounts'' for persons with \n     disabilities and provide that funds may be withdrawn from \n     such accounts to cover costs of health care, employment \n     support, housing, transportation, assistive technology, and \n     lifelong education for those persons; and\n       Whereas, ABLE accounts would be subject to the same tax \n     treatment as the popular education savings accounts commonly \n     called ``529 plans'', as they would be created in the same \n     section (Section 529) of the Internal Revenue Code; and\n       Whereas, the ABLE Act would create a powerful incentive for \n     individuals and families to save private funds for the \n     purpose of supporting persons with disabilities in \n     maintaining health, independence, and quality of life; and\n       Whereas, a vital component of the ABLE Act is a provision \n     which stipulates that funds held in an ABLE account do not \n     count toward any maximum limit on a person's assets upon \n     which eligibility for a means-tested federal program may be \n     contingent; and\n       Whereas, savings in an ABLE account would thereby not \n     jeopardize a person's eligibility for programs such as \n     Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program \n     (formerly known as food stamps), the asset limits of which \n     currently force low-income persons into the difficult \n     decision of whether to spend what resources they may have \n     down to two thousand dollars in most cases in order to become \n     eligible for needed assistance; and\n       Whereas, the ABLE Act includes a fiscal safeguard for \n     states by providing that if the ABLE account beneficiary dies \n     or their disability ceases and assets remain in the account, \n     the assets will be distributed first to any state Medicaid \n     plan that provided assistance to the person; and\n       Whereas, as evidenced by the party affiliations of its \n     seventy-eight original cosponsors being almost perfectly \n     balanced, the ABLE Act legislation enjoys broad bipartisan \n     support; and\n       Whereas, the ABLE Act embodies sound economic policy by \n     encouraging savings and asset building; and by providing that \n     every citizen living with a disability has the opportunity to \n     attain independence and an improved quality of life, promotes \n     important values that our nation holds dear: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to pass the ABLE Act; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-86. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States \n     Congress to take such actions as are necessary to repeal that \n     portion of the federal health care reform legislation which \n     imposes a health insurance tax; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 53\n\n       Whereas, beginning in 2014, Section 9010 of the Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148), as amended \n     by Section 10905 of that Act and Section 1406 of the Health \n     Care and Education Reconciliation Act (P.L. 111-152), will \n     impose an unprecedented new tax on health insurance that \n     numerous policy experts agree will be passed on to \n     individuals, working families, employers, and seniors, \n     contradicting a primary goal of health care reform by making \n     health care more expensive; and\n       Whereas, Congressman Charles Boustany (R-LA) and \n     Congressman Jim Matheson (D-UT) have already sponsored \n     bipartisan legislation, H.R.763 of the First Session of the \n     113th Congress, in the United States House of \n     Representatives, to repeal Section 9010 of the Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act which imposes an annual \n     fee on health insurance providers; and\n       Whereas, similar legislation, S. 603 of the First Session \n     of the 113th Congress, has also been introduced in the United \n     States Senate by Senator John Barrasso (R-WY); and\n       Whereas, it has been estimated that the health insurance \n     tax will cause premiums on the individual market to rise an \n     average of two thousand one hundred fifty dollars for \n     individuals and an average of five thousand eighty dollars \n     for families nationally over a ten-year period; and\n       Whereas, it has also been estimated that, in Louisiana over \n     the next ten years, an individual will pay an average of two \n     thousand one hundred twenty-eight dollars more for single \n     coverage and an average of four thousand five hundred twelve \n     dollars more for family coverage, a small group employer will \n     pay an average of two thousand five hundred eighty-nine \n     dollars more for single coverage and an average of six \n     thousand three hundred ninety-one dollars more for family \n     coverage, and a large group employer will pay an average of \n     two thousand eight hundred thirty dollars more for single \n     coverage and an average of six thousand eight hundred thirty-\n     six dollars more for family coverage; and\n       Whereas, it has been further estimated that a Medicare \n     policyholder in Louisiana will pay on average four thousand \n     one hundred eleven dollars more for coverage, all within the \n     same time period; and\n       Whereas, estimates additionally indicate that the health \n     insurance tax will also impact the national economy over the \n     next ten years by reducing future private sector jobs by as \n     much as one hundred twenty-five thousand, with approximately \n     fifty-nine percent for small businesses, and reducing \n     potential sales by at least eighteen billion dollars, with \n     approximately fifty percent for small businesses; and\n       Whereas, higher premiums are a disincentive for everyone to \n     obtain insurance coverage, particularly younger, healthier \n     people, who are likely to drop their policies if they become \n     too expensive, further eroding the risk pool and making \n     coverage even less affordable: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to repeal Section 9010 of the Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act (PL. 111-148), as amended \n     by Section 10905 of that Act and Section 1406 of the Health \n     Care and Education Reconciliation Act (P.L. 111-152), which \n     imposes a health insurance tax, in order to make health care \n     more affordable for working families, individuals, and \n     businesses; and be it further.\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-87. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana memorializing the Congress of the \n     United States to review and consider eliminating provisions \n     of federal law which reduce Social Security benefits for \n     those receiving benefits from federal, state, or local \n     government retirement or pension systems, plans, or funds; to \n     the Committee on Finance.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 40\n\n       Whereas, the Congress of the United States of America has \n     enacted both the Government Pension Offset (GPO), reducing \n     the spousal and survivor Social Security benefit, and the \n     Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP), reducing the earned \n     Social Security benefit for any person who also receives a \n     public pension benefit; and\n       Whereas, Congress enacted these reduction provisions to \n     provide a disincentive for public employees to receive two \n     pensions; and\n       Whereas, the GPO negatively affects a spouse or survivor \n     receiving a federal, state, or local government retirement or \n     pension benefit who would also be entitled to a Social \n     Security benefit earned by a spouse; and\n       Whereas, the GPO formula reduces the spousal or survivor \n     Social Security benefit by two-thirds of the amount of the \n     federal, state, or local government retirement or pension \n     benefit received by the spouse or survivor, in many cases \n     completely eliminating the Social Security benefit even \n     though their spouses paid Social Security taxes for many \n     years; and\n       Whereas, the GPO often reduces spousal benefits so \n     significantly it makes the difference between self-\n     sufficiency and poverty; and\n       Whereas, the GPO has a harsh effect on thousands of \n     citizens and undermines the\n\n[[Page S6022]]\n\n     original purpose of the Social Security dependent/survivor \n     benefit; and\n       Whereas, the WEP applies to those persons who have earned \n     federal, state, or local government retirement or pension \n     benefits, in addition to working in employment covered under \n     Social Security and paying into the Social Security system; \n     and\n       Whereas, the WEP reduces the earned Social Security benefit \n     using an averaged indexed monthly earnings formula and may \n     reduce Social Security benefits for affected persons by as \n     much as one-half of the retirement benefit earned as a public \n     servant in employment not covered under Social Security; and\n       Whereas, the WEP causes hardworking individuals to lose a \n     significant portion of the Social Security benefits that they \n     earn themselves; and\n       Whereas, in certain circumstances both the WEP and GPO can \n     be applied to a qualifying survivor's benefit, each \n     independently reducing the available benefit and in \n     combination eliminating a large portion of the total Social \n     Security benefit available to the survivor; and\n       Whereas, because of the calculation characteristics of the \n     GPO and the WEP, they have a disproportionately negative \n     effect on employees working in lower-wage government jobs, \n     like policemen, firefighters, teachers, and state employees; \n     and\n       Whereas, Louisiana is making every effort to improve the \n     quality of life of its citizens and to encourage them to live \n     here lifelong, yet the current GPO and WEP provisions \n     compromise their quality of life; and\n       Whereas, individuals drastically affected by the GPO or WEP \n     may have no choice but to return to work after retirement in \n     order to make ends meet, but the earnings accumulated during \n     this return to work can further reduce the Social Security \n     benefits the individual is entitled to; and\n       Whereas, retired individuals affected by both GPO and WEP \n     have significantly less money to support their basic needs \n     and sometimes have to turn to government assistance programs; \n     and\n       Whereas, the GPO and the WEP penalize individuals who have \n     dedicated their lives to public service by taking away \n     benefits they have earned; and\n       Whereas, our nation should respect, not penalize, public \n     servants; and\n       Whereas, the number of people affected by GPO and WEP is \n     growing every day as more and more people reach retirement \n     age; and\n       Whereas, the GPO and WEP are established in federal law, \n     and repeal of the GPO and the WEP can only be enacted by \n     Congress: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States of America to \n     review the Government Pension Offset and the Windfall \n     Elimination Provision Social Security benefit reductions and \n     to consider eliminating or reducing them; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize Congress, in the alternative, to repeal the \n     Government Pension Offset and to consider applying the less \n     stringent Windfall Elimination Provision to spousal and \n     survivor benefits; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-88. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Maine memorializing the President of the United \n     States, the United States Congress and the United States \n     Trade Representative regarding the use of trade promotion \n     authority in international trade policy; to the Committee on \n     Finance.\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas, the State strongly supports international trade \n     when fair rules of trade are in place and seeks to be an \n     active participant in the global economy, and the State seeks \n     to maximize the benefits and minimize any negative effects of \n     international trade; and\n       Whereas, existing trade agreements have effects that extend \n     significantly beyond the bounds of traditional trade matters, \n     such as tariffs and quotas, and can undermine Maine's \n     constitutionally guaranteed authority to protect the public \n     health, safety and welfare and its regulatory authority; and\n       Whereas, a succession of federal trade negotiators from \n     both political parties over the years have failed to operate \n     in a transparent manner and have failed to meaningfully \n     consult with the State on the far-reaching effect of trade \n     agreements on state and local laws, even when obligating the \n     State to comply with the terms of these agreements; and\n       Whereas, Article II, Section 2 of the United States \n     Constitution empowers the President of the United States ``. \n     . . by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to make \n     treaties, provided two thirds of Senators present concur . . \n     .''; and\n       Whereas, the trade promotion authority implemented by the \n     United States Congress and the President of the United States \n     with regard to international trade and investment treaties \n     and agreements entered into over the past several years, \n     commonly known as fast-track negotiating authority, does not \n     adequately provide for the constitutionally required review \n     and approval of treaties; and\n       Whereas, the United States Trade Representative, at the \n     direction of the President of the United States, is currently \n     negotiating or planning to enter into negotiations for \n     several multilateral trade and investment treaties, including \n     the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement and the Trans-\n     Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership; and\n       Whereas, proposals are under consideration to review these \n     and future trade and investment agreements pursuant to a \n     fast-track model; and\n       Whereas, the current process of consultation with states by \n     the Federal Government on trade policy fails to provide a way \n     for states to meaningfully participate in the development of \n     trade policy, despite the fact that trade rules could \n     undermine state sovereignty; and\n       Whereas, under current trade rules, states have not had \n     channels for meaningful communication with the United States \n     Trade Representative, as both the Intergovernmental Policy \n     Advisory Committee on Trade and the state point of contact \n     system have proven insufficient to allow input from states, \n     and states do not always seem to be considered as a partner \n     in government; and\n       Whereas, the President of the United States, the United \n     States Trade Representative and the Maine Congressional \n     Delegation will have a role in shaping future trade policy \n     legislation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, respectfully urge and \n     request that future trade policy include reforms to improve \n     the process of consultation both between the Executive Branch \n     and Congress and between the Federal Government and the \n     states; and be it further\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, respectfully urge and \n     request that the fast-track model of consultation and \n     approval of international treaties and agreements be rejected \n     with respect to pending agreements and agreements not yet \n     under negotiation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, respectfully urge and \n     request that the President of the United States, the United \n     States Congress and the United States Trade Representative \n     seek to develop a new middle ground approach to consultation \n     that meets the constitutional requirements for treaty review \n     and approval while at the same time allowing the United \n     States Trade Representative adequate flexibility to negotiate \n     the increasingly complicated provisions of international \n     trade treaties; and be it further\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, respectfully urge and \n     request that the President of the United States, the United \n     States Congress and the United States Trade Representative \n     seek a meaningful consultation system that increases \n     transparency, promotes information sharing, allows for timely \n     and frequent consultations, provides state-level trade data \n     analysis, provides legal analysis for states on the effect of \n     trade on state laws, increases public participation and \n     acknowledges and respects each state's sovereignty; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, respectfully urge and \n     request that each instance in which trade promotion authority \n     is authorized by the United States Congress be limited to a \n     specific trade agreement to help ensure the adequate review \n     and approval of each international trade treaty; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to \n     the Honorable Barack H. Obama, President of the United \n     States, to the President of the United States Senate, to the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, to the \n     United States Trade Representative and to each Member of the \n     Maine Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-89. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California urging the President and the Congress \n     of the United States to exclude social security, Medicare, \n     and Medicaid from being a part of any legislation to reduce \n     the federal deficit; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 7\n\n       Whereas, Social security and Medicare are the foundations \n     of income and health security for older Californians and \n     those with severe work disabilities, providing monthly cash \n     benefits and health insurance to over 5 million Californians, \n     including 3.4 million retirees and nearly 700,000 disabled \n     workers; and\n       Whereas, Social security is the single most important \n     source of life insurance protection for California's children \n     and provides a vital guaranteed income to 370,000 children \n     throughout the state; and\n       Whereas, Social security prevents more than 1.1 million \n     Californians from living in poverty; and\n       Whereas, Social security provides benefits to more than 9 \n     million veterans nationwide, which is roughly four out of 10 \n     veterans; and\n       Whereas, Social security annually contributes nearly $67 \n     billion dollars to California's economy by paying benefits to \n     over 5.1 million residents in the state; and\n       Whereas, Social security's funding is independent of that \n     of the rest of the federal government, and has never \n     contributed to, and by law can never contribute to, the \n     federal deficit; and\n       Whereas, Social security in fact has a surplus of $2.7 \n     trillion dollars today that is expected to grow to $3.1 \n     trillion dollars by 2020; and\n       Whereas, Social security is not in crisis and has \n     sufficient resources to meet all of its\n\n[[Page S6023]]\n\n     obligations through 2032 and has dedicated revenues that \n     would--even in the absence of Congressional reforms--meet \n     three-quarters of promised benefits thereafter; and\n       Whereas, Social security's funding shortfall after 2032 is \n     modest: about one-half of the cost of the Bush tax cuts of \n     2001 and 2003; and\n       Whereas, There are many policy options available to close \n     social security's funding shortfall without cutting benefits, \n     including eliminating the cap on earnings subject to the \n     payroll tax, which would eliminate about 80 percent of the \n     75-year shortfall, or raising the payroll tax rate from 6.2 \n     to 7.2 percent gradually over 20 years, which would eliminate \n     one-half of the shortfall; and\n       Whereas, Americans prefer raising payroll taxes to cutting \n     social security benefits by a margin of 53 percent to 36 \n     percent; and\n       Whereas, Social security's modest but vital benefits, \n     averaging just $12,930 per year in California, are critical \n     to the economic security of those who receive those benefits; \n     and\n       Whereas, Losses of pensions, 401(k) balances, home equity, \n     and earnings have greatly diminished the retirement income \n     prospects of Californians; and\n       Whereas, The social security benefit cuts imposed in 1983 \n     will, when fully phased in, cut benefits by roughly 25 \n     percent; and\n       Whereas, Forty-seven percent of elderly Californians are \n     struggling just to make ends meet and more than one-half of \n     working Californians will not have saved enough to be able to \n     maintain their standard of living in retirement; and\n       Whereas, Proposals to increase the social security \n     retirement age to 69 would cut benefits by an additional 13 \n     percent on top of the 13 percent cut that occurred when the \n     retirement age increased from 65 to 67; and\n       Whereas, The physical demands of a job differ from industry \n     to industry and, on average, the longevity of the lives of \n     individuals differ significantly according to their level of \n     income, education, race, and access to health care; and\n       Whereas, Social security belongs to the people who have \n     worked hard all their lives and contributed to the program, \n     and it is based on a promise that if you pay in, you and your \n     family can collect your money when you retire, experience a \n     severe disability, or die; and\n       Whereas, Medicare insures almost 4 million California \n     seniors for health care at a fraction of the administrative \n     costs of private plans; and\n       Whereas, Medicare has controlled its costs better than \n     private insurance plans; and\n       Whereas, Although increasing the eligibility age for \n     Medicare would save the federal government some money, it \n     would add billions of dollars to what we as a country spend \n     on health care and shift costs onto other governmental \n     entities, businesses, and many individuals who cannot afford \n     those costs; and\n       Whereas, Medicaid is a critical source of protection for \n     over 11 million low-income children, adults, and elderly \n     Californians, many of whom have severe disabilities or are in \n     need of long-term care; and\n       Whereas, Our social security, Medicare, and Medicaid \n     systems are fundamental to protecting against risks to which \n     all Californians are subject; and\n       Whereas, Our social security, Medicare, and Medicaid \n     systems give expression to widely held values, including \n     caring for our families, our neighbors, and ourselves, \n     personal responsibility, hard work, and dignity: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and the Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the California State Legislature \n     urges the President and the Congress of the United States to \n     exclude social security, Medicare, and Medicaid from being a \n     part of any legislation to reduce the federal deficit; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That the California State Legislature opposes \n     cuts to social security, Medicare and Medicaid, and calls on \n     our state's representatives in Washington, D.C. to vote \n     against any cuts and consider improving those systems in ways \n     that will strengthen their protections; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, and to \n     each Senator and Representative from California in the \n     Congress of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/29/senate-section/article/S6023-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. JOHNSON, of South Dakota, from the Committee on \n     Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, with an amendment in the \n     nature of a substitute:\n       S. 534.

Of \n     course it's China's core interest.'';\n       In the seventeenth whereas clause of the preamble, strike \n     ``; and'' and insert a semicolon.\n       In the eighteenth whereas clause of the preamble, strike \n     the colon at the end and insert a semicolon.\n       Insert after the eighteenth whereas clause of the preamble \n     the following:\n       Whereas ASEAN and China announced on June 30, 2013, that \n     official consultations on a Code of Conduct in the South \n     China Sea will commence at the 6th Senior Officials' Meeting \n     and the 9th Joint Working Group on the Implementation of the \n     Declaration of Conduct of the Parties in the SCS, to be held \n     in China in September 2013; Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi \n     reaffirmed that China was willing to advance talks on a code \n     of conduct as part of a ``continual, gradual and deepening \n     process''; and Secretary of State John F. Kerry, \n     participating in the ASEAN Regional Forum Ministerial Meeting \n     on July 2, 2013, expressed the hope that announcement of \n     official consultations between ASEAN and China would be the \n     beginning of sustained and substantive official engagement \n     between the two on developing the new Code of Conduct; and\n       Whereas, from June 17-20, 2013, the 10 ASEAN members and \n     their dialogue partners Australia, China, India, Japan, New \n     Zealand, Russia, South Korea, and the United States jointly \n     participated in the First ASEAN Defense Ministers' Meeting \n     Plus Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) and \n     Military Medicine (MM) exercise, helping to establish a new \n     pattern of cooperation among the militaries of the Asia-\n     Pacific:\n\n  The preamble, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, as amended, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 167\n\n       Whereas the maritime domain of the Asia-Pacific region \n     includes critical sea lines of communication and commerce \n     between the Pacific and Indian oceans;\n       Whereas the United States has a national interest in \n     freedom of navigation and overflight in the Asia-Pacific \n     maritime domains, as provided for by universally recognized \n     principles of international law;\n       Whereas the United States has a national interest in the \n     maintenance of peace and stability, open access by all to \n     maritime domains, respect for universally recognized \n     principles of international law, prosperity and economic \n     growth, and unimpeded lawful commerce;\n       Whereas although the United States does not take a position \n     on competing territorial claims over land features and \n     maritime boundaries, it does have a strong and long-standing \n     interest in the manner in which disputes in the South China \n     Sea are addressed and in the conduct of the parties;\n       Whereas the United States has a clear interest in \n     encouraging and supporting the nations of the region to work \n     collaboratively and diplomatically to resolve disputes \n     without coercion, without intimidation, without threats, and \n     without the use of force;\n       Whereas the South China Sea contains great natural \n     resources, and their stewardship and responsible use offers \n     immense potential benefit for generations to come;\n       Whereas in recent years, there have been numerous dangerous \n     and destabilizing incidents in this region, including Chinese \n     vessels cutting the seismic survey cables of a Vietnamese oil \n     exploration ship in May 2011;\n\n[[Page S6027]]\n\n     Chinese vessels barricading the entrance to the Scarborough \n     Reef lagoon in April 2012; China issuing an official map that \n     newly defines the contested ``nine-dash line'' as China's \n     national border; and, since May 8, 2013, Chinese naval and \n     marine surveillance ships maintaining a regular presence in \n     waters around the Second Thomas Shoal, located approximately \n     105 nautical miles northwest of the Philippine island of \n     Palawan;\n       Whereas the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \n     has promoted multilateral talks on disputed areas without \n     settling the issue of sovereignty, and in 2002 joined with \n     China in signing a Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in \n     the South China Sea that committed all parties to those \n     territorial disputes to ``reaffirm their respect for and \n     commitment to the freedom of navigation in and over flight \n     above the South China Sea as provided for by the universally \n     recognized principles of international law'' and to ``resolve \n     their territorial and jurisdictional disputes by peaceful \n     means, without resorting to the threat or use of force'';\n       Whereas Japan and Taiwan reached an agreement on April 10, \n     2013, to jointly share and administer the fishing resources \n     in their overlapping claimed exclusive economic zones in the \n     East China Sea, an important breakthrough after 17 years of \n     negotiations and a model for other such agreements;\n       Whereas other incidences of the joint administrations of \n     resources in disputed waters in the South China Sea have de-\n     escalated tensions and promoted economic development, such as \n     Malaysia and Brunei's 2009 agreement to partner on exploring \n     offshore Brunei waters, with drilling in offshore oil and gas \n     fields off Brunei beginning in 2011; and Thailand and \n     Vietnam's agreement to jointly develop areas of the Gulf of \n     Thailand for gas exports, despite ongoing territorial \n     disputes;\n       Whereas, on June 21, 2013, the Governments of the People's \n     Republic of China and Vietnam announced that they had agreed \n     to set up and use an emergency fishery hotline to inform each \n     other of any detainment involving fishermen or boats within \n     48 hours, to help quickly resolve disputes and as part of \n     efforts to prevent future incidents from derailing ties, and \n     the Governments of the People's Republic of China and \n     Indonesia on May 2, 2013, agreed to establish a hotline for \n     incidents in their disputed waters;\n       Whereas the Government of the Republic of the Philippines \n     states that it ``has exhausted almost all political and \n     diplomatic avenues for a peaceful negotiated settlement of \n     its maritime dispute with China'' and in his statement of \n     January 23, 2013, Republic of Philippines Secretary of \n     Foreign Affairs Del Rosario stated that therefore ``the \n     Philippines has taken the step of bringing China before the \n     Arbitral Tribunal under Article 287 and Annex VII of the 1982 \n     Convention on the Law of the Sea in order to achieve a \n     peaceful and durable solution to the dispute'';\n       Whereas, in January 2013, a Chinese naval ship allegedly \n     fixed its weapons-targeting radar on Japanese vessels in the \n     vicinity of the Senkaku islands, and, on April 23, 2013, \n     eight Chinese marine surveillance ships entered the 12-\n     nautical-mile territorial zone off the Senkaku Islands, \n     further escalating regional tensions;\n       Whereas, on May 8, 2013, the Chinese Communist Party's main \n     newspaper, The People's Daily, published an article by \n     several Chinese scholars questioning Japan's sovereignty over \n     Okinawa, where key United States military installations are \n     located which contribute to preserving security and stability \n     in the Asia-Pacific region;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     has recently taken other unilateral steps, including \n     ``improperly drawing'' baselines around the Senkaku Islands \n     in September 2102, which the 2013 Annual Report to Congress \n     on Military and Security Developments Involving the People's \n     Republic of China found to be ``inconsistent with \n     international law'', and maintaining a continuous military \n     and paramilitary presence around the Senkaku Islands;\n       Whereas, on April 27, 2013, Chinese Foreign Ministry \n     spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, was quoted as saying, ``The Diaoyu \n     Islands are about sovereignty and territorial integrity. Of \n     course it's China's core interest.'';\n       Whereas although the United States does not take a position \n     on the ultimate sovereignty of the Senkaku Islands, the \n     United States Government acknowledges that they are under the \n     administration of Japan and opposes any unilateral actions \n     that would seek to undermine such administration, affirms \n     that the unilateral actions of a third party will not affect \n     the United States acknowledgment of the administration of \n     Japan over the Senkaku Islands, remains committed under the \n     Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security to respond to any \n     armed attack in the territories under the administration of \n     Japan, and has urged all parties to take steps to prevent \n     incidents and manage disagreements through peaceful means;\n       Whereas, on August 3, 2012, a Department of State \n     spokesperson expressed concern over ``China's upgrading of \n     the administrative level of Sansha City and the establishment \n     of a new military garrison there,'' encouraged ASEAN and \n     China ``to make meaningful progress toward finalizing a \n     comprehensive Code of Conduct,'' and called upon claimants to \n     ``explore every diplomatic or other peaceful avenue for \n     resolution, including the use of arbitration or other \n     international legal mechanisms as needed'';\n       Whereas the United States recognizes the importance of \n     strong, cohesive, and integrated regional institutions, \n     including the East Asia Summit (EAS), ASEAN, and the Asia-\n     Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, as foundation for \n     effective regional frameworks to promote peace and security \n     and economic growth, including in the maritime domain, and to \n     ensure that the Asia-Pacific community develops rules-based \n     regional norms which discourage coercion and the use of \n     force;\n       Whereas the United States welcomes the development of a \n     peaceful and prosperous China, the government of which \n     respects international norms, international laws, \n     international institutions, and international rules; enhances \n     security and peace; and seeks to advance a ``new model'' of \n     relations between the United States and China;\n       Whereas ASEAN plays an important role, in partnership with \n     others in the regional and international community, in \n     addressing maritime security issues in the Asia-Pacific \n     region and into the Indian Ocean, including open access to \n     the maritime domain of Asia;\n       Whereas ASEAN and China announced on June 30, 2013, that \n     official consultations on a Code of Conduct in the South \n     China Sea will commence at the 6th Senior Officials' Meeting \n     and the 9th Joint Working Group on the Implementation of the \n     Declaration of Conduct of the Parties in the SCS, to be held \n     in China in September 2013; Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi \n     reaffirmed that China was willing to advance talks on a code \n     of conduct as part of a ``continual, gradual and deepening \n     process''; and Secretary of State John F.
