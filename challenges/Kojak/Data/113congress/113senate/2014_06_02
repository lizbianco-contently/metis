Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the \nRepublican leader, the Senate will be in a period of morning business \nuntil 5:30 p.m.\n  At 5:30 p.m. there will be a rollcall vote on the motion to invoke \ncloture on the nomination of Keith Harper to be U.S. Representative to \nthe U.N. Human Rights Council.\n\n\n                          Caring for Veterans\n\n  Our esteemed colleague, the chairman of the Budget Committee, Patty \nMurray, has said, ``Caring for our veterans is the duty of a grateful \nnation.''\n  She knows of what she speaks because she led that committee in a very \nvibrant, positive way as chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. I \nhave no doubt every Member of this body agrees with the sentiment she \nexpressed. There is a big difference between nodding one's head in \napproval and actually doing something to take care of our veterans.\n  The chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee today is \nSenator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and he is doing something to help \nour veterans. The junior Senator from Vermont has introduced a bill to \nensure that American veterans are getting the care they need. This \nlegislation allows veterans facing long delays in health care to seek \noutside help, and they can go to private doctors, community health \ncenters or military bases. Additionally, this bill authorizes the VA to \nuse emergency funding to hire new doctors and nurses, which are badly \nneeded.\n  Senator Sanders' legislation increases accountability through the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, holding senior officials responsible \nfor poor job performance. This is very good legislation. This bill will \nimprove the manner in which the United States of America cares for its \nveterans, and I hope all Members will support this. In light of the \nshocking reports of inappropriate practices at the VA, and especially \ntheir hospitals, every Senator should support this legislation.\n  Last week the Veterans Affairs inspector general's office released \nits report detailing many troubling systemic failures which are \nunnecessarily putting our Nation's veterans at risk. They are so wrong, \nand they are putting our Nation's veterans at risk. Instead of \nreceiving the proper care they deserve, thousands of combat veterans \nhave been languishing on nonexistent waiting lists at a VA hospital in \nArizona.\n  The inspector general's report declared that many of these men and \nwomen who have been relegated to health care limbo are ``at risk of \nbeing lost or forgotten.'' The brave veterans of our Nation's Armed \nServices should never be lost or forgotten. These soldiers went to war \nand pledged not to leave their brothers- and sisters-in-arms behind. \nNow, in their moment of need, some of our most vulnerable veterans have \nbeen left behind. We must\n\n[[Page S3320]]\n\nnever allow any servicemember--past or present--to simply fall through \nthe cracks.\n  Now that the Senate has returned from its State work period, we \nshould pass Senator Sanders' bill as soon as possible, ensuring that \nour veterans get the care they deserve. Yet even as Senate Democrats \ntry to improve the reliability of our veterans health care, certain \nRepublican Members of Congress are content to scapegoat the VA. Even \nmore disappointing is the fact that these same Republicans have, \nthrough their obstruction, deprived the VA of essential resources it \nneeds to help veterans.\n  Last February Senate Republicans blocked legislation introduced by \nSenator Sanders which would give the VA the tools needed to meet the \ndemands of a changing veteran population. We tried to break that \nfilibuster. We couldn't do it. We didn't have 60 votes.\n  That bill would help our Nation's veterans by improving health and \ndental care, providing educational and employment opportunities and \naddressing claims backlogs. The legislation that has been introduced \nthis week does the same. That legislation was shot down because as the \njunior Senator from Florida said, it had a cost issue, but that junior \nSenator, a Republican Senator from Florida, was correct--taking care of \nour Nation's wounded veterans does cost money, but it is money well \nspent.\n  Senator Rubio is not alone. The junior Senator from Alabama, along \nwith the rest of his caucus, opposed the same bill because he didn't \nwant to ``bust the budget.'' Republicans didn't worry about busting the \nbudget when they initially sent our troops by the hundreds of thousands \nto Iraq on a credit card, the credit card of the taxpayers of America, \nrunning up--in that war alone--about $1.5 trillion in money that was \nborrowed.\n  Therein lies the problem. Republicans ignore the true cost of \ndemocracy. The lives and well-being of the brave men and women who \nfight to protect our way of life are part of the cost of our democracy. \nInstead, Republicans focus on the monetary costs only, the dollar \nbills, because any money going to our veterans is $1 less going to \nbillionaires, corporations, and unnecessary tax cuts.\n  The American people are tired of the doublespeak coming from the \nRepublican Party when it comes to caring for our soldiers and our \nveterans. If Republicans support our Nation's soldiers, then help us \nprotect our Nation's soldiers and help us support our Nation's \nsoldiers. Instead, there is always an excuse, some exception they find \nto justify prevention of them standing with America's veterans and our \nsoldiers.\n  Let's give American veterans the care and attention they deserve. As \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs works to remedy these serious \nshortcomings, we in Congress must do our part to help. We owe America's \nveterans far too much to leave them behind in their hour of need.\n\n\n                             Eric Shinseki\n\n  I wish to say a few words about the retired Secretary, retired \ngeneral, Eric Shinseki, who resigned in the wake of the Veterans \nAffairs' troubling performance.\n  General Shinseki is a very good man, a devoted, disabled combat \nveteran. Under his leadership the VA drastically improved its care of \nveterans suffering from mental illness, and they addressed the issue of \nveterans' homelessness. He oversaw initiatives which decreased \ndependence on pain killers and other drugs, addressing a problem which \nwas crippling many combat veterans.\n  General Shinseki's work at the VA has also helped cut waiting times \nfor GI benefits down to just 1 week, helping countless veterans get \npaid the aid they were promised. As the Secretary has done his best, I \nam sorry his time as head of the VA ended with his resignation, but I \nunderstand why he felt the need to step aside.\n  Eric Shinseki has served this country for decades: on the \nbattlefield, as Chief of Staff for the U.S. Army, and as Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs. I personally thank him for his service and wish him \nwell as he undoubtedly continues his work for America.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  Would the Chair announce the business of the day.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today the Senate will consider the \nnomination of Keith Harper as the U.S. Representative to the U.N. Human \nRights Council.\n  I am generally deferential to the President's decisions when it comes \nto nominations brought before the Senate for confirmation, but in \nextraordinary circumstances I don't hesitate to oppose them. Given the \nextraordinary circumstances present in this case, I must strenuously \nobject to this nominee.\n  Mr. Harper is the latest State Department ``bundler-blunder'' that is \nslated for a U.S. ambassadorship. Earlier this year we saw the \nadministration nominate several wholly unqualified top Democratic \nfundraisers to serve as ambassadors to various posts around the world.\n  One such fundraiser, Mr. George Tsunis, was nominated to serve as the \nU.S. Ambassador to Norway. During his confirmation hearing, Mr. Tsunis \nrevealed his complete unawareness about the country in which he would \nserve as our Nation's top envoy. For example, he referred to Norway's \nhead of State as their President, not knowing that the country is led \nby a constitutional monarch.\n  Another Presidential pick, Colleen Bell, for Hungary could not answer \na single question at her Senate hearing about U.S. strategic interests \nin that country, but that is OK. I am certain her professional \nbackground as a TV soap opera producer will come in handy while the \ncrisis in Ukraine continues to unfold.\n  Inside the beltway, these nominees are known as ``campaign \nbundlers,'' partisan political operatives who have each fundraised \nhundreds of thousands--if not millions--of dollars for the President's \ncampaign. Mr. Harper is another example of a campaign bundler wholly \nill-suited to serve in the diplomatic post for which he has been \nnominated.\n  According to the Center of Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign \ndonations, Mr. Harper is on a list called ``758 Elites.'' These are \ndonors who combined ``at least $180 million for Obama's re-election \neffort.'' That is a quote from the Center of Responsive Politics. Mr. \nHarper is classified as a bundler of $500,000 or more, and his \ncontribution level matched such notables as actor Will Smith, actress \nEva Longoria, and Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.\n\n  I am not naive as to why some of these ambassadorships are doled out. \nCandidly speaking, Presidents from both parties frequently issue these \ndiplomatic posts as political favors. But I have never before seen an \nadministration this brazen in transmitting individuals who are so \nterribly and fundamentally unfit for foreign service. Traditionally, \naccording to the retired Foreign Service group, about 30 percent of \nambassadorships go to political appointees. Since the election of 2012, \nthat is up to 50 percent. Some go to countries that, frankly, deserve \nbetter than someone whose only qualification is whether they raised \n$500,000 or more for the campaign of President Obama.\n  Some of my colleagues will say that what sets Mr. Harper apart from \nthese other campaign donors is his cultural heritage. They say Mr. \nHarper would be the first Native American in history to hold the rank \nof U.S. Ambassador. They also say he should be\n\n[[Page S3321]]\n\nrewarded for his work as one of the lead class action attorneys in the \nSupreme Court case Cobell v. Salazar.\n  I truly respect that Mr. Harper would be the first Native American to \nserve as a U.S. Ambassador. What concerns me is his character--\nparticularly his conduct in connection with a matter that could rightly \nbe described as one of the greatest mistreatments of Native Americans \nby the Federal Government in recent memory. That matter is known as the \nCobell case.\n  In the 1990s hundreds of thousands of Native Americans, led by \nElouise Cobell, entered into a class action suit against the Interior \nDepartment for mismanaging billions of dollars in land assets that were \nheld in trust for Indian tribes.\n  During my previous tenure as chairman of the Senate Committee on \nIndian Affairs, I worked with my colleague, then-vice chairman Byron \nDorgan, to end the protracted Cobell lawsuit and enact legislation to \nsettle the case in Congress.\n  Ultimately, it wasn't until 2010 that Congress finally passed \nlegislation that compensated the Cobell plaintiffs at $3.4 billion. My \ncolleagues know that Mr. Harper was the co-lead counsel for the Cobell \nplaintiffs and often touted the number of his clients at about 500,000 \nNative Americans. When the lawsuit was settled, Mr. Harper and his \nlegal team stood to earn up to $99 million in attorney's fees that were \nwritten into the Cobell settlement legislation and paid for by the \nAmerican taxpayer. Let me emphasize: For this good work, Mr. Cobell and \nhis legal team were going to earn $99 million in attorney's fees. \nWithout a doubt, the legislation was a massive bonus check for Mr. \nHarper and his team, and he and his team have actually sued the Federal \nGovernment to receive another $123 million--more than the $99 million \nhe already got. Most of the Native American clients will receive about \n$1,000 each, and many are still waiting to receive their first payment \nto date.\n  Unfortunately, my Democratic colleagues conveniently ignore that Mr. \nHarper served on President Obama's 2009 transition team for Native \nAmerican issues while he actively sued the Interior Department. Does it \nconcern my colleagues that several months after the President installed \nhis leadership team at Interior and Justice, the administration \nessentially fast-tracked the settlement with the Cobell attorneys or \nthat just 1 year later Congress enacted the $3.4 billion Cobell \nsettlement legislation as a top White House priority, ending an over \ndecade-long legal battle? Evidently not.\n  Now the administration claims there was no wrongdoing or conflict of \ninterest on the part of Mr. Harper in his service to the President's \ntransition team, and I have no choice but to take their word for it, \nalbeit skeptical. But we do know of at least one appalling and \nunforgivable incident that has dogged Mr. Harper throughout the \nSenate's consideration of his nomination--and rightfully so.\n  When the Cobell lawsuit was settled and Mr. Harper's legal team stood \nto earn tens of millions of dollars, a number of Native American \nplaintiffs--Mr. Harper's own clients--raised grave concerns that their \nattorneys would receive such a sizable payout. They argued that more of \nthe Cobell settlement should go to the thousands of Native Americans \nwho had been wronged by Interior.\n  Four affected Native Americans banded together and filed a lawsuit to \nchallenge the Cobell settlement for this and other reasons. One \nappellate told the court that ``huge fees awarded to class counsel \noften indicate the interests of the absent class members have been \nsacrificed to those of the lawyers.'' As a result of this legal \nchallenge, the court temporarily delayed the Cobell payouts to the \nplaintiffs and, of course, to Mr. Harper.\n  In what can only be described as bullying, the Cobell legal team \nfired back at these four Native Americans. They transmitted a letter \ndated January 20, 2012, to all of their 500,000 clients that listed the \nhome addresses and telephone numbers of the four appellants and urged \nall of Indian Country to call and harass them for challenging the \nCobell settlement. The letter reads:\n\n       Your payments are being held-up by 4 people . . . [each] \n     believes that you are not entitled to the relief (nor the \n     payment of your trust funds) . . . This means you will \n     receive nothing from the settlement: no payment, no \n     scholarship funds, no land consolidation, and no further \n     trust reform . . .\n\n  Here is the best part. In the letter that was sent to 500,000 people, \nit said:\n\n       [If] you want to ask them directly about their motives, you \n     should contact them at the following address or phone \n     numbers.\n\n  I hope my colleagues understand what was done there. These four \nNative Americans received harassing calls, death threats, had their \njobs threatened. One had to disconnect their phone. Another was \nessentially run off her reservation.\n  I will submit two articles for printing in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks. The first is an article from the Missoulian \nentitled ``Objectors to $3.4B Indian trust settlement get angry phone \ncalls,'' which further describes how this letter affected their \npersonal lives. The second is an article from the Native American Times \nentitled ``Cobell Class Members question settlement, attorney \nconduct.''\n  The harassment letter was accessible on the Cobell team's Web site \nduring the Harper committee hearing. It was on his Web site during the \nhearing in the committee, but it was promptly removed the day after I \nquestioned Mr. Harper about it.\n  I will also submit for printing in the Congressional Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks the previously referenced letter provided that \nthe contact information of those four individuals be redacted.\n  At his committee hearing, Mr. Harper adamantly denied any \nresponsibility for the letter and blamed the strategy entirely on \nanother Cobell attorney. However, Mr. Harper has since muddied his \nstory and later admitted he was aware of the letter on the very day it \nwas transmitted. If he didn't pen the harassment letter or approve it, \nas he dubiously claims, he certainly did nothing to retract it or \ndenounce it until his Senate hearing.\n  There is also no disputing that Mr. Harper has held himself out and \nis overly proud of his status as one of the lead counsels on the Cobell \ncase.\n  I would argue that those four Native Americans' human rights were \nabused. People such as Mr. Harper can't be a party to or complicit with \na letter attempting to harass Native Americans for exercising their \nrights and then expect to obtain the Senate's imprimatur to serve as \nour Nation's ambassador on human rights. That is the irony of all of \nthis. He clearly abused these people's human rights, and now he is \ngoing to be an ambassador on human rights?\n  Mr. Harper has not sufficiently answered my questions about his \ninvolvement with the harassment letter or how much in legal fees he has \nprofiteered from Cobell over the years.\n  I will also submit for the Record his written responses to my hearing \nquestions which conflict with his verbal testimony about the harassment \nletter and other matters.\n  I can't in good conscience support Mr. Harper's nomination. The \nglobal community faces serious human rights crises, and this is whom \nthe administration sends to speak on behalf of all Americans, including \nNative Americans? I urge my colleagues to vote against Mr. Harper, and \nI call upon the administration to transmit a nominee who has an \nunblemished record of protecting human and civil rights--a record of \naccomplishment and integrity commensurate with this very important \npost.\n  Here is the situation. Mr. Harper will probably be confirmed today on \na partisan vote--on a party-line vote. He won't get 60 votes. He will \nprobably get 55 or maybe 1 or 2 less. This is another example of a \ndeprivation that is taking place of my right to advise and consent and \nthat of every single Member of the minority. This nomination would not \nhave come to this floor if we still required 60 votes. But, instead, my \ncolleagues across the aisle have decided to deprive Members on this \nside of their right of advice and consent because he will be confirmed, \nprobably, today on a party-line basis despite the fact of a clear \nrecord of abuse of human rights by a majority here in the Senate.\n  I tell my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: If we gain the \nmajority in this Senate as a result of this November's election, I will \ndo everything in my power to restore their rights as a minority--their \nrights of advice and consent. The fact that it was taken away from us \nfor the first time in the\n\n[[Page S3322]]\n\nhistory of the Senate is a despicable and black act that will live in \nhistory.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From Missoulian, Jan. 31, 2012]\n\n    Objectors to $3.4B Indian Trust Settlement Get Angry Phone Calls\n\n                             (By Matt Volz)\n\n       Helena.--Carol Good Bear started getting the calls about a \n     week ago, after the attorneys who had negotiated a $3.4 \n     billion settlement over misspent Native American land \n     royalties published the phone numbers and addresses of the \n     four people objecting to the deal.\n       At first, the resident of New Town, N.D., hung up on the \n     angry voices at the other end. After 15 calls, she unplugged \n     her home phone and started screening her cellphone calls.\n       She said she worries for her safety now that her address is \n     in the hands of hundreds of thousands of people who might \n     blame her for holding up their money.\n       ``To put my name out there for the public, I think that's \n     scary that these attorneys would use this tactic and \n     intimidate me into dropping my appeal,'' Good Bear said. ``I \n     don't have protection. If somebody is upset about all this \n     and comes at me with a gun, what am I supposed to do?''\n       The attorneys who published the Jan. 20 open letter \n     represent up to 500,000 plaintiffs in the class-action \n     lawsuit named after Elouise Cobell, the Blackfeet woman from \n     Montana who spent nearly 16 years trying to hold the U.S. \n     government accountable for more than a century's worth of \n     mismanaged Native American accounts.\n       The lawsuit claims U.S. officials stole or squandered \n     billions of dollars in royalties owed for land leased for \n     oil, gas, grazing and other uses.\n       Cobell died in October, just months after a federal judge \n     approved the largest government class-action settlement in \n     U.S. history.\n       Under the settlement, $1.4 billion would go to individual \n     Native American account holders. Some $2 billion would be \n     used by the government to buy up fractionated tribal lands \n     from individual owners willing to sell, and then turn those \n     lands over to tribes. Another $60 million would be used for a \n     scholarship fund for young Natives.\n       The settlement took a year to push through Congress, then \n     months for final judicial approval. After the settlement was \n     approved, Good Bear and three other people filed separate \n     objections, each for different reasons.\n       Those appeals must be heard by a federal appeals court \n     before any money from the settlement can be distributed, with \n     the first scheduled to be heard Feb. 16.\n       The plaintiffs' attorneys, led by Dennis Gingold of \n     Washington, D.C., wrote in their letter that the ``hopes and \n     wishes of 500,000 individual Indians'' had been delayed by \n     those four people. If it wasn't for them, the first payments \n     would have been made before Thanksgiving, the letter said.\n       ``There is little doubt that they do not share the desires \n     or care about the needs of the class, over 99.9 percent of \n     whom support a prompt conclusion to this long-running, \n     acrimonious case,'' the attorneys wrote.\n       The letter went on to list the names, phone numbers and \n     addresses of Good Bear, Kimberly Craven of Boulder, Co.; \n     Charles Colombe of Mission, S.D.; and Mary Lee Johns of \n     Lincoln, Neb. The attorneys invited people to ``ask them \n     directly about their motives'' and cautioned them to ``please \n     be civil in your communications.''\n       The letter was published in the ``Ask Elouise'' email that \n     updates class members on the settlement and also was \n     published on at least one website dealing with Native \n     American issues.\n       Gingold said Monday that he was preparing for oral \n     arguments and could not comment on the letter.\n       Good Bear and Johns, who agreed to speak to the Associated \n     Press, said they believe the letter was an attempt to \n     intimidate them into dropping their appeals, but it will not \n     work.\n       ``Obviously they don't know me to think I could be brow-\n     beaten into quitting,'' Johns said.\n       Both said they have received phone calls of support \n     interspersed with the angry ones.\n       Craven and Colombe declined to comment, referring questions \n     to their attorneys. Craven's attorney, Ted Frank, said in an \n     email that he took his concerns to the plaintiffs' attorneys \n     and they agreed to stop disseminating the letter.\n       Frank said he was satisfied with that promise and that \n     attempting to have the judge address whether the letter was \n     right or wrong would only distract from the appeal.\n       ``Other than a corrective communication and sanctions, \n     there isn't much else we could get in relief from the court, \n     and neither is worth the distraction from preparation for \n     oral argument,'' Frank said.\n       Each objector is appealing the settlement for his or her \n     own reasons. Craven and Johns both say the settlement does \n     not include an accounting for how much money was lost, which \n     is what Cobell originally set out to accomplish, and that \n     many class members did not understand that they could have \n     opted out of the deal.\n       Johns and Good Bear both object to the class of landowners \n     that the settlement creates, saying each is different and \n     their claims should be assessed differently. Johns added that \n     the tribes should have been involved in the process from the \n     start, not just individuals.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From Native American Times, Feb. 6, 2012]\n\n       Cobell Class Members Question Settlement, Attorney Conduct\n\n                          (By Dana Attocknie)\n\n\nAttorneys released names, addresses and phone numbers of the four case \n         appellants in an email to the public and media Jan. 20\n\n       Washington.--Class Counsel for the Cobell v. Salazar class \n     action lawsuit sent out a letter Jan. 20 to Class Members \n     throughout Indian Country explaining the reason for the delay \n     in their monetary payment rests with four Class Members who \n     are appealing the settlement.\n       ``What they did by sending out this letter is very, very \n     unethical,'' Mary Lee Johns, Cheyenne River Sioux/Lakota, \n     said. ``They sent out this email to all the individuals and \n     listed our names, addresses and telephone numbers. One of the \n     individuals that appealed is getting death threats and now \n     they got her address. This is not the way to conduct business \n     in Indian Country.''\n       Johns is appealing the settlement along with Carol Eve Good \n     Bear, Fort Berthold Reservation, and Charles Colombe, Rosebud \n     Sioux. They are represented by David Harrison, an attorney \n     based out of Albuquerque, N.M. They are in the early stages \n     of their brief, which is due to be filed in March with oral \n     argument set for May 15.\n       Harrison said the suggestion in the letter, dispersed by \n     the plaintiff's counsel, that the appellants don't believe \n     fellow Class Members are entitled to relief or payment from \n     their trust funds is not true. ``It's not that they're just \n     trying to make sure that nobody's paid; they're trying to \n     make sure that this deal is legal,'' Harrison said.\n       Another appeal is from Class Member Kimberly Craven, \n     Sissten-Wahpeton Oyate, who is represented by Ted Frank, an \n     attorney with the non-profit Center for Class Action Fairness \n     located in Washington, D.C. The Craven brief was complete \n     Jan. 6 and oral argument is scheduled for Feb. 16 in \n     Washington, D.C. before a three judge panel.\n       Frank said Craven believes the settlement is illegal and \n     it's in the best interest of the Indian community that it be \n     overturned. He said the Historical Accounting Class is not \n     giving Class Members an opportunity to opt out if they feel \n     their right to an injunction is more valuable than the \n     monetary relief. In addition the structure of the settlement \n     payments contradict what the D.C. circuit said would be \n     permissible in earlier Cobell litigation, because it's not \n     rationally related to the damages Class Members have \n     suffered, he said.\n       ``So you have a problem that Class Members who have \n     suffered the most injury are getting the same as or less than \n     Class Members who have suffered no injury at all,'' Frank \n     said. ``(Also) There's the problem of conflict of interest \n     created by the fact that Ms. Cobell negotiated a settlement \n     that would pay $12.5 million dollars to herself.'' The \n     beneficiaries of the settlement fall into two groups; the \n     Historical Accounting Class and the Trust Administration \n     Class. Harrison's clients also question the fairness of the \n     Accounting Class and the blanket $1,000 payment everyone \n     would receive.\n       ``The courts have been saying all this time, and the \n     plaintiffs have said, the case is about an accounting, we \n     want an accounting, and now they're saying `Oh heck with the \n     accounting, just give everybody $1,000 and we'll call it \n     even,''' Harrison said, adding that some account holders have \n     a great deal of money go through their account while some \n     people have very little. ``One hundred and seven thousand \n     Indians, collectively, only have $15,000 between the whole \n     bunch of them in their accounts in recent years, but every \n     one of those 107,000 people is going to get $1,000. . . to \n     them the settlement probably seems like a very good deal.''\n       Harrison also said the leftover money to be divided between \n     land owners is based on a formula that measures how much \n     money has gone thru a person's account, which would not be \n     fair either. ``They're not going to be paid out based on how \n     much (a person) lost or how much you have coming; it's going \n     to be based on how much you got. The people who got paid \n     improperly; If they got paid more than they had coming they \n     get unjustly enriched again and if they got paid less than \n     they had coming they're going to get victimized again, and \n     that's just the way the formula works.''\n       Last year some Individual Indian Money (IIM) account \n     holders also questioned why their attorneys may receive more \n     money than them from the $3.4 billion settlement. The Class \n     Counsel is requesting $223 million, which is 14.75 percent of \n     the 1.5 million dollars to be dispersed to Class Members. \n     Lead attorneys for the settlement include Keith Harper, of \n     Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP, and Dennis Gingold.\n       Harper toured Indian Country last year with other Cobell \n     attorneys explaining the settlement and defended their \n     request for remuneration. During a March 2010 meeting in \n     Anadarko, Okla., Harper said the amount requested by the \n     attorneys is not double the expenses. He then quoted Gingold, \n     who said they are only asking for what their expenses were, \n     and at the end of the day it's up to the courts to decide \n     what they will get paid.\n       Class Counsel's letter to Class Members stated there is \n     little doubt the appellants do\n\n[[Page S3323]]\n\n     not have the same desires or care about the needs of their \n     fellow Class Members, and the appellants' behavior does not \n     seem to be in the best interest of Class Members.\n       Johns said she hasn't received many calls because of the \n     letter, but most callers were supportive and one person just \n     wanted to understand the settlement and the appeals. ``This \n     has nothing to do with Elouise Cobell, please understand \n     that. People always use her passing away and all that to try \n     and make us feel bad, but this has nothing to do with her. \n     The reason why I did what I did was based upon what I believe \n     was wrong with the suit,'' Johns said. ``Now it has nothing \n     to do with the money, it has nothing to do with any of that. \n     It has to do with the protection. I'm doing it because I \n     believe that they're opening up the gate to a lot of serious \n     problems for Indian Country in the next 20 years.''\n       Johns said she was upset when she initially found out that \n     IIM account holders were, ``jerked into this class action \n     suit without our consent'' and also that tribes weren't \n     involved. She said since the class action was brought about \n     by four individual Indians there was not the unique \n     government-to-government relationship. She feels \n     individualizing Indians will help break up the tribes and \n     references the Dawes Act to illustrate her point. ``You know \n     the intent of the Dawes Act was to break up these tribes so \n     that's one of the reasons why I was very concerned,'' she \n     said. ``We're standing basically by ourselves without the \n     protection of our tribe.'' Another concern is the land. Johns \n     said the settlement was originally supposed to be about an \n     accounting and not about the land. She said the lands were \n     severely mismanaged by the federal government and people put \n     too many cattle on their land so it was overgrazed and ended \n     up with prairie dogs and the grasses were just not the same. \n     ``. . .  the biggest rip off was when the federal government \n     sat down with the Cobell lawyers and made this deal because \n     they were basically getting away free for this amount of \n     mismanagement . . . ,'' Johns said. ``The federal government \n     is winning on this one. They got home free without ever \n     having to restore lands, and they didn't ever have to pay \n     individual Indians for mismanagement of their land. They made \n     this deal, and to me, it's an unholy deal that these \n     attorneys have negotiated with the federal government so that \n     they could collect $99 million dollars. So who loses on this? \n     They keep saying, `Oh, you know, you're going to get this \n     money.' What kind of money? You know maybe everybody is going \n     to get maybe $1,200 dollars . . . and yet look at what we're \n     losing.''\n       Johns said the Cobell attorneys should have made sure the \n     lands were restored back to their original state before an \n     agreement was made. She said Class Counsel sat down with the \n     federal government when they originally lost the case and \n     that's when the government said it would throw in $3.5 \n     billion if an Administration Class was included for the \n     mismanagement of lands, plus some of the money would be used \n     to purchase lands that were fractionated shares. ``Now, \n     there's another part of this that people didn't understand, \n     was this whole $1 billion dollars that they're giving the \n     federal government to buy the land back. That's a bait and \n     switch deal,'' she said. ``Before that land that they \n     purchased for $100 can be given back to your tribe, your \n     tribe has to pay the federal government $100. So basically, \n     all it did was give the federal government $1 billion dollars \n     to buy Indian land . . . to me it's a shell game and the \n     Indians are the ones who are losing out.''\n       Johns other concerns are: the settlement is a complicated \n     process, the Bureau of Indian Affairs could not participate \n     in explaining to the individual Indians what their rights \n     were, and it was not clear how to opt out. She said there are \n     cases, with members of the Three Affiliated Tribes for \n     example, where Indian people are seeking justice in court but \n     because of the class action settlement they cannot seek a \n     claim against the federal government. ``If you didn't opt \n     out, you're forever barred from ever going to court on \n     mismanagement,'' Johns said. ``One of the things that the \n     federal government wanted to do was hurry up and get this \n     done so they could wash their hands of us. They opted out.''\n       Frank also mentioned the case of Ramona Two Shields v. \n     United States, where ``the government is arguing that the \n     Cobell settlement is preventing these Indians from getting \n     their fair recovery.''\n       Johns also questions who the lead plaintiff is now. In \n     other words who is directing Class Counsel? Lead Plaintiff \n     Elouise Cobell died Oct. 16, 2010. The remaining plaintiffs \n     are James Louise Larose, Thomas Maulson and Penny Cleghorn. \n     Johns said people may say she's being unfair by appealing the \n     case but questions who is looking out for the Indian people--\n     ``People like the four of us that really truly want to make \n     sure that this is good for the people,'' she said. \n     ``Everybody's glad that I did it,'' Johns said. ``My tribe \n     passed a resolution that was totally against the Cobell \n     (class action suit/settlement). I feel very confident that \n     what I'm doing is in the best interest of . . . my family and \n     those who got up and objected to Cobell all along.''\n       Cobell spokesperson Bill McAllister told Native Times that \n     Class Counsel is not commenting on the case.\n                                  ____\n\n     From: askelouise@cobellsettlement.com\n     Sent: Friday, January 20, 2012\n     To: Mary Zuni\n     Subject: Ask Elouise Letter\n\n       Dear Indian Country: Following the passing of our leader \n     and friend, Elouise Cobell, Class Counsel is responding to \n     your continuing questions and concerns regarding the \n     settlement of the Cobell lawsuit.\n       What is the current status of the settlement? \n     Unfortunately, notwithstanding the hopes and wishes of \n     500,000 individual Indians and despite Class Counsel's best \n     efforts, the settlement has been delayed by 4 class members, \n     each of whom is challenging the landmark settlement in the \n     U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. We expect that \n     these appeals will be resolved in another 6 months, provided \n     that no appellant seeks further review in the Supreme Court.\n       But for these appeals, your Historical Accounting Class \n     payments would have been distributed before Thanksgiving \n     2011, and it is likely that your Trust Administration Class \n     payments would have been made by Easter 2012.\n       However, because of the appeals, your Historical Accounting \n     Class and Trust Administration Class payments cannot be made \n     until after the appeals have been resolved, provided that we \n     prevail on appeal. No one knows when that will occur. \n     Historical Accounting Class payments should be made within a \n     few weeks after the appeals are decided. Trust Administration \n     Class payments should be made within about 6 months after you \n     receive your Historical Accounting Class payment.\n       Class Counsel understands your increasing frustration and \n     concerns. We know the difficulties many of you face and we \n     have spoken to hundreds of you who are in extremis this \n     winter season. It is with our utmost sympathy and \n     disappointment that we share this unfortunate news.\n       Who is appealing? And, why are they appealing? Your \n     payments are being held-up by 4 people: Kimberly Craven \n     (Sissten-Wahpeton Oyate), Charles Colombe (Rosebud Sioux), \n     Carol Eve Good Bear (Fort Berthold Reservation), and Mary Lee \n     Johns (Cheyenne River Sioux). Notably, Colombe, Good Bear and \n     Johns are represented by David (Davey) Harrison, an \n     Albuquerque lawyer and former BIA employee.\n       Their reasons vary slightly, but are the same on one \n     fundamental point. At bottom, each believes that you are not \n     entitled to the relief (nor the payment of your trust funds) \n     that has been provided in the settlement agreement \n     notwithstanding a century of abuse, malfeasance and breaches \n     of trust by the United States government. Each of the \n     appealing class members has filed papers that will kill the \n     settlement if any one of them prevails on appeal. This means \n     that you would receive nothing from the settlement: no \n     payment, no scholarship funds, no land consolidation, and no \n     further trust reform.\n       Craven has railed against the settlement since it was first \n     announced over two years ago, going so far as to claim: \n     ``after 14 years of acrimonious litigation, the Cobell \n     plaintiffs are entitled to no monetary recovery whatsoever \n     from the courts.'' (http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/\njudicial/112807-bailing-out-the-smartest-guys-in-the-room). \n     Mary Johns has sought to remove the judge who approved the \n     settlement, Thomas F. Hogan. There is little doubt that they \n     do not share the desires or care about the needs of the \n     class, over 99.9% of whom support a prompt conclusion to this \n     long-running, acrimonious case.\n       Why would anybody appeal? I'd like to contact these class \n     members, how do I do that? We know of no explanation for \n     their behavior that is consistent with your best interests. \n     However, if you want to ask them directly about their \n     motives, you should contact them at the following address or \n     phone numbers: Kimberly Craven, Mary Lee Johns, Carol Eve \n     Good Bear, Charles Colombe.\n       Notwithstanding your frustration and difficulties, if you \n     choose to contact any of the 4 appellants, please be civil in \n     your communications.\n       Isn't there something you can do to speed up this process? \n     No. Class Counsel has reached out to the 2 attorneys who \n     represent the 4 appealing class members to resolve or settle \n     whatever issue they may have with the settlement. However, we \n     have been rebuffed or ignored each time. Unless each of the \n     appealing class members withdraws his or her appeal, there is \n     no way to shorten the judicial review process.\n       Haven't you been paid? Class Counsel has not been paid. We \n     are in the same position that you are in--we will not be paid \n     until the appeals have been resolved.\n       Prior Ask Elouise letters can be found on the settlement \n     website: http://cobellsettlement.com/class/ask_elouise.php. \n     There is also a ``frequently asked questions'' section to \n     answer the most common questions received: http://\ncobellsettlement.com/press/faq.php.\n           Kind Regards,\n                                                    Class Counsel,\n     Cobell v. Salazar.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n  Questions for the Record Submitted by Senator John McCain for Keith \n Harper, Nominated to be U.S. Representative to the U.N. Human Rights \n  Council Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing on September 24, \n                                  2013\n\n       1. How long did you serve as ``co-class counsel'' on \n     Cobell?\n       The Cobell class was certified on February 4, 1997, and so \n     I began to serve as class counsel on that date.\n\n[[Page S3324]]\n\n       2. On what date did you first learn about the January 20, \n     2012 ``Ask Elouise'' letter?\n       I learned of the January 20, 2012, ``Ask Elouise'' letter \n     on January 20, 2012, after it was released.\n       3. Did you receive a draft or have prior knowledge of the \n     January 20, 2012 letter before it was published?\n       No.\n       4. As co-class counsel, was it your responsibility to \n     review documents and communications to plaintiffs including \n     the January 20, 2012 ``Ask Elouise'' letter, prior to \n     transmission or publication?\n       No. Lead Counsel--who is a solo practitioner not part of \n     Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP (``Firm'')--was \n     responsible for determining who among the litigation team \n     were responsible for which tasks. Under this arrangement, the \n     principal attorneys each had their own areas of \n     responsibility. The ``Ask Elouise'' letters were not part of \n     my responsibilities.\n       Lead Counsel did not circulate the January 20, 2012, ``Ask \n     Elouise'' letter either to me or, to the best of my \n     knowledge, to any of the lawyers in the Firm prior to its \n     publication.\n       5. How did you become aware of the January 20, 2012 ``Ask \n     Elouise'' letter?\n       I became aware of the ``Ask Elouise'' letter on January 20, \n     2012, after the letter's public release, when a lawyer \n     representing one of the appellants sent an e-mail in \n     objection.\n       6. When the letter became public, why did you reportedly \n     refuse to respond to press inquiries concerning the letter?\n       At the time of the letter's release, we were in active \n     litigation. Although I personally did not support the letter, \n     I was told by a Firm colleague that the Class \n     Representatives, at the time, did support it. Accordingly, I \n     was duty bound to not comment in a manner contrary to the \n     letter and therefore could not express my reservations \n     publicly about the re-publishing of the contact information \n     of appellants.\n       7. What is your understanding of how the January 20, 2012, \n     ``Ask Elouise'' letter was transmitted to plaintiffs? By \n     mail, online, print publishing, email, or other?\n       At the time of the September 24, 2013, hearing, my \n     understanding was that the letter was posted on January 20, \n     2012, on the internet site www.indiantrust.com and that it \n     had not been mailed or emailed to the entire class of 500,000 \n     individuals. I have since confirmed that the letter was not \n     emailed or mailed to the entire class of 500,000 individuals. \n     Rather, I have now been informed that it was emailed by the \n     claims administrator at the direction of Lead Counsel's \n     litigation consultant, on January 20, 2012, to a listserv \n     comprised of those who had requested periodic electronic \n     updates on the litigation. It was also posted on the \n     indiantrust.com website at approximately that same time.\n       Because I was not responsible for managing postings to the \n     website, or distributions to the listserv, I did not \n     understand the precise manner in which the letter was posted \n     and distributed until I was informed by colleagues after the \n     September 24, 2013, hearing.\n       8. Is it correct that you would not receive attorney's fees \n     under the Cobell settlement legislation until the appeal \n     discussed in the January 20, 2012 ``Ask Elouise'' letter was \n     resolved?\n       Yes.\n       9. Is it correct that one of the appellants identified in \n     the January 20, 2012 ``Ask Elouise'' letter appealed the \n     settlement because she determined that plaintiff attorneys \n     were seeking excessive attorney's fees?\n       No.\n       10. What is your connection to the website, ``Indian Trust \n     Settlement'' (www.IndianTrust.com)?\n       My connection to the website was, and remains, of limited \n     scope.\n       The website www.indiantrust.com is owned by a litigation \n     consultant to the Lead Counsel. Lead Counsel and the \n     litigation consultant maintained custody and control of the \n     website content at all times while the case was in active \n     litigation, which ended in December 2012. During that time, \n     the website published material relevant to the case, such as \n     court filings. I and other Class Counsels worked on briefs \n     and other materials, which were filed by paralegals or the \n     litigation consultant. After filing these documents, the \n     litigation consultant to Lead Counsel published them to the \n     website.\n       I understand that the website is presently administered by \n     the Garden City Group (GCG), the official claims \n     administrator for the Cobell case, though the litigation \n     consultant maintains ownership.\n       11. On what date was the January 20, 2012 ``Ask Elouise'' \n     letter (www.indiantrust.com/elo/1_20_12) removed from the \n     Indian Trust Settlement website?\n       After learning of the letter's release, I expressed my \n     misgivings about publishing the letter, especially the \n     contact information of the appellants, to both other Class \n     Counsel and other professionals at Kilpatrick Townsend. I \n     urged my colleagues to facilitate removing the letter and to \n     avoid posting material that could be construed to suggest \n     harassment of appellants. On or around January 21, I was \n     informed by colleagues that discussions about removing the \n     letter from the website would be held with one of the \n     appellant's attorneys who had objected to the letter. I \n     understand from GCG that on January 22, 2012, the litigation \n     consultant for Lead Counsel requested that GCG remove the \n     letter from the website. On or about January 22, I was told \n     by a Firm colleague that the letter was removed from the \n     website. Additionally, my colleagues and I checked the \n     website at that time and there found no link to the letter. \n     Thus, at the time of my testimony on September 24, 2013, I \n     was under the impression that the letter was indeed not on \n     the Indiantrust website.\n       After I was informed on September 24, 2013, that the letter \n     was still available through an Internet search, my law \n     partners requested that GCG delete the letter so that it \n     would be unavailable through an Internet search. I have been \n     told that GCG did so on September 24, 2013.\n       12. Why was the January 20, 2012 ``Ask Elouise'' letter \n     removed from the website when it was and was it removed under \n     your request or direction?\n       After I was informed on September 24, 2013, that the letter \n     was still available through an Internet search, my law \n     partners immediately requested that GCG delete the letter so \n     that it would be unavailable through an Internet search. I \n     have been told that GCG did so on September 24, 2013.\n       13. What is your interpretation of the cap on fees, \n     expenses and costs in the Claims Resolution Act of 2010 for \n     Cobell v. Salazar?\n       While Congress considered capping fees as an amendment to \n     the Claims Resolution Act, it ultimately decided not to do \n     so. The Class Representatives, our clients, did have an \n     agreement with Defendants that neither side would appeal any \n     fee award between $50 and $99.9 million. In addition, under \n     this same agreement, Class Representatives agreed not to \n     affirmatively assert Counsel be paid more than $99.9 million \n     in attorneys' fees.\n       14. Were you part of a petition to federal courts for $223 \n     million in attorney's fees in the class action lawsuit, \n     Cobell v. Salazar?\n       The Class Representatives, our clients, decided that, \n     consistent with the Agreement with Defendants, there would be \n     an express request for $99.9 million in fees. The Petition \n     for Fees specifies that ``Plaintiffs hereby assert a fee of \n     $99.9 million for Class Counsel's work through December 7, \n     2009.'' The Petition went on to explain that the Court had \n     the discretion to award more under the controlling law, but \n     that both Plaintiffs and Defendants agreed not to appeal if \n     the award was between $50 and $99.9 million. The Petition \n     also stated, consistent with client direction, that in \n     comparable cases, awards ranging around $223 million would be \n     consistent with controlling law. I was one of the counsel who \n     signed this petition on behalf of our clients. The Court \n     ultimately awarded the $99 million amount asserted by \n     plaintiffs in the petition for fees.\n       As I understand it, the Class Representatives, especially \n     Ms. Elouise Cobell, believed that it was critically important \n     and consistent with the best interest of the Class to seek a \n     fee award in accord with fee awards for non-Indian class \n     actions of similar size and complexity. She expressed concern \n     that otherwise attorneys would be reluctant to represent \n     Native American plaintiffs without financial means who are \n     deprived of their rights by the federal government or other \n     entities. This was unacceptable to Ms. Cobell and she was \n     particularly sensitive to this point because, as she made \n     clear on the record, she had grave difficulties finding \n     lawyers to bring the Cobell case in the first place.\n       15. Are you associated with a petition for additional fees \n     related to the Cobell settlement? If so, for how much?\n       No.\n       16. Approximately how many hours did you bill your clients \n     for work in relation to Cobell at Kilpatrick and Native \n     American Rights Fund (NARF)?\n       As a partner with Kilpatrick, I worked a total of 4,837.7 \n     hours on Cobell through June 30, 2013.\n       I am no longer at NARF and I do not have access to this \n     information, however, NARF's court filings indicate I worked \n     19,671 hours on the Cobell case.\n       17. Approximately how much in fees have you collected to \n     date in relation to Cobell?\n       On July 27, 2011, District Judge Thomas Hogan awarded \n     plaintiffs $99 million in attorney's fees. Of that amount, \n     Judge Hogan awarded approximately $85 million to be \n     distributed, after all appeals were final, to Class Counsel. \n     Class Counsel included Dennis Gingold, Thaddeus Holt, and \n     Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP. The remainder of \n     approximately $14 million was set aside because other counsel \n     who had worked on the case in times prior were seeking their \n     own award, which in aggregate amounted to approximately $14 \n     million. The Court later ordered that these fee issues be \n     mediated but thus far the mediation has not been fruitful.\n       18. What fees did you secure from tribal governments for \n     work on the class action lawsuit, Cobell, or any other \n     lawsuit against the federal government for mismanagement of \n     tribal trust assets? Please identify each tribal government, \n     the type of fee, and the rate that was negotiated for each.\n       We did not receive any payment for fees from tribal \n     governments for work on the Cobell case. As for tribal trust \n     lawsuits, the Firm received the fees as follows for our four \n     tribal clients:\n       Ak-Chin Indian Community (AZ) agreed to pay the Firm hourly \n     fees on a monthly basis so there was no contingency fee.\n       Tohono O'odham Nation (AZ) agreed to pay discounted hourly \n     fees on a monthly basis plus a 6% contingency fee at the end \n     of the case. The amount of that fee paid to the Firm at the \n     end of the case was $1,425,000 (this was in addition to the \n     fees paid each month since 2006).\n       Initially, in 2006, the Passamaquoddy Tribe of Maine agreed \n     to pay fees in an identical\n\n[[Page S3325]]\n\n     manner as the arrangement with Tohono O'odham. However, \n     within a few months of our engagement, the Tribe asked us to \n     change the arrangement so it would not have to pay the \n     discounted hourly rates on a monthly amount. Accordingly, we \n     modified the agreement consistent with the client wishes so \n     that compensation for attorneys' fees was exclusively through \n     a contingency fee. Unlike other clients, the Passamaquoddy \n     Tribe made no payment of fees on a monthly basis throughout \n     the litigation, thus the contingency fee agreed to was 15%. \n     This is well below the standard of 30%-40% for comparable \n     contingency fee arrangements. When the case settled, the \n     amount paid to the firm was 15% of the settlement or $1.8 \n     million. In an October 1, 2013, letter to Indian Country \n     Today, Passamaquoddy Chief Joseph Socobasin on September 24, \n     2013 confirmed that the Tribe ``was very happy with the \n     settlement representation prepared by Kilpatrick Townsend & \n     Stockton firm.''\n       The Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community (AZ) has not \n     given the Firm permission to disclose the specifics of its \n     fee arrangement. However, we can disclose that they paid \n     monthly fees with a contingency at the end similar to Tohono \n     O'odham.\n       19. In your negotiations with tribal governments over fees \n     referenced above, were tribal governments made aware that the \n     defendant, the federal government, would be responsible for \n     covering or directly paying their fees to you?\n       Yes. Two tribes--the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Tohono \n     O'odham Nation--agreed to have the funds directly paid to the \n     Firm. This was not unusual and indeed the model used in other \n     cases such as the Osage litigation (represented by another \n     Washington, D.C., based law firm). The Tribes had full \n     ability to opt for non-direct payment to the attorneys. The \n     Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, for example, \n     decided to keep the terms of counsel fees confidential and \n     therefore did not seek direct payment to counsel. For the \n     tribes that did authorize direct payment, they did so \n     expressly. Both the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Tohono \n     O'odham Nation expressly authorized direct payment to our \n     Firm in tribal council resolutions approving the settlements.\n       20. Please identify which tribes you negotiated fees \n     referenced in the above questions between 2008 and 2010?\n       None of the fees negotiated for tribal trust cases were \n     negotiated in this time frame. All were negotiated in 2006 or \n     early 2007.\n       21. Did you negotiate Cobell fees at different rates for \n     different tribes? Why is there a variance in rates?\n       No. Cobell fees were not negotiated for or with tribes. The \n     fee in Cobell was determined by the court and paid out of the \n     common fund. Therefore, all plaintiffs in the Cobell case, \n     irrespective of tribal affiliation, were treated the same.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/02/senate-section/article/S3325-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3325-S3329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, today the Obama administration released \na new plan intended to shut down American powerplants. Instead of \ncelebrating his policies in the Rose Garden, President Obama delegated \nthe bad news to the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  Make no mistake about it; what they are announcing today is another \nstep in the President's plan to make electricity rates ``necessarily \nskyrocket.'' Remember, that is what the President promised Americans \nwhen he was running for President the first time in 2008.\n  Of course, when he was elected Congress said no--no to his radical \nplan. Even when the Democrats controlled the House of Representatives, \nNancy Pelosi was the Speaker of the House, and the Democrats had 60 \nMembers of the Senate--even with complete Democratic domination in both \nHouses of Congress--Congress still said: No, Mr. President, this is a \nbad idea.\n  So the President decided he knew better than the American people, the \nelected representatives. He decided to go around Congress and go around \nthe American people.\n  I turn to the front page of today's Wyoming Tribune Eagle out of \nCheyenne, WY, and the headline is: ``Obama Lets EPA Do His Dirty \nWork.'' The subheadline says: ``The president's charge to limit \nemissions has caused him so much criticism that he is no longer leading \nthe pack.'' On the front page of the Wyoming Tribune Eagle they go on \nto say:\n\n       When the Obama administration unveils its much-anticipated \n     proposal to curb power plant emissions, this cornerstone of \n     the president's climate change policy--the most significant \n     environmental regulation of his term--will not be declared in \n     a sun-bathed Rose Garden news conference or from behind the \n     lectern in a major speech.\n       It will not be announced by the president at all, but \n     instead by his head of the Environmental Protection Agency, \n     while President Barack Obama adds his comments in an off-\n     camera conference call. . . .\n\n  Talk about something that is unpopular with the American people, it \nis this.\n  About 1 year ago, the President put out rules limiting carbon dioxide \nemissions from new powerplants--powerplants that were being \nconstructed--but today--today--his Environmental Protection Agency is \napplying tight new limits on the emissions of existing powerplants--\npowerplants that are already there producing energy.\n  The administration says it is going to allow States ``flexibility'' \nin how they meet the new limits. I believe any ``flexibility'' that is \nbeing offered is just an illusion. States will have a severely limited \nnumber of options for what they can do to meet the standards. Every one \nof those options is going to raise the cost of energy for American \nfamilies. That means consumers will not even get the illusion of \nflexibility; they will get higher energy costs.\n  Businesses are going to have to find ways to pay for their own higher \nbills because it is not just going to be families, when they turn on \nthe light switch, who are going to get a higher electric bill. As the \nPresident said, electricity rates will necessarily skyrocket, but \nbusinesses are going to have to find ways to pay for their higher \nenergy costs, which will mean hiring fewer people, laying off people, \npassing on the cost to others.\n  That is why the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says an aggressive policy \ntargeting coal-fired powerplants will lead to less disposable income \nfor families and thousands of jobs lost. So families will have less \ndisposable income and thousands of jobs will be lost.\n  We just learned last week that our economy shrank by 1 percent in the \nlast quarter. The U.S. economy shrank. This is the first time in years \nthe economy actually shrank by 1 percent in the last quarter. It is the \nfirst time it has happened, actually, since 2011. Our labor force \nparticipation rate is at the same level it was when Jimmy Carter was \nthe President of the United States. So now the Obama administration \nwants to put more Americans out of work.\n  The action they are taking today is the height of irresponsibility \nand it is tone-deaf leadership. The Obama administration is going to \ntry to defend their extreme regulations by saying, once again, these \nchanges will help save lives and keep families healthy. The fact is \nthey are totally ignoring the undeniable fact that when Americans lose \ntheir jobs, their health and the health of their children suffer.\n  There is an enormous public health threat from high unemployment, \nspecifically chronic high unemployment. It increases the likelihood of \nhospital visits, illness, and premature death. It hurts children's \nhealth and the well-being of families. It influences mental illness, \nsuicide, alcohol abuse, spouse abuse. It is an important risk factor in \nstroke and high blood pressure and heart disease--major things that \nimpact a family, raise the cost of care. I saw it in my days of medical \ntraining in medical practice, and the White House knows it too.\n  One might say: How does the White House know? The New York Times \nactually ran an article on this in November of 2011--November 17, to be \nexact. The headline of the article was ``Policy and Politics Collide as \nObama Enters Campaign Mode.'' ``Policy and Politics Collide as Obama \nEnters Campaign Mode.'' The article says a meeting occurred in the \nWhite House between the American Lung Association and then-White House \nChief of Staff William Daley, and the meeting was about the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's proposed ozone regulations.\n  In that White House meeting, White House Chief of Staff Daley asked a \nsimple question when confronted with the argument that additional Clean \nAir Act regulations would improve public health. Daley asked: ``What \nare the health impacts of unemployment?'' Well, I have just gone over \nthem with you, Mr. President. Those are the health impacts of \nunemployment. So the White House knows about it--totally aware about \nit.\n  When the Environmental Protection Agency announced these new rules \ntoday, the President himself was reportedly talking off camera--a \nconference call--on the phone with the\n\n[[Page S3326]]\n\nAmerican Lung Association. Someone in that room should be talking about \nthe disastrous public health effects of the unemployment that these \nrules are causing. The fact is that more regulation from Washington is \nnot what America needs right now.\n  States already have flexibility in how they approach environmental \nstewardship, and many of them have come up with creative solutions. \nLast month the Senate and Congressional Western Caucuses issued a \nreport called ``Washington Gets it Wrong--States Get it Right.'' The \nreport showed how regulations imposed by Washington are undermining--\nundermining--the work being done at the State level to manage our \nlands, to manage our natural resources, and to protect our air and our \nwater. It gave success stories--success stories--where the work being \ndone by States is more reasonable, more effective, and less heavyhanded \nthan the rules ordered by Washington.\n\n  America does not need Washington to pay lip service to flexibility \nwhile mandating huge price increases in energy. America wants \nWashington to stop the overreaching regulations and mandates and to \nactually allow the States to get it right. Thousands of Americans have \nalready lost their jobs because of Washington's expensive and excessive \nregulations. Now the President is putting more jobs on the chopping \nblock. That is why I have written legislation that would stop President \nObama's massive increase to the Nation's electric bill. I offered this \nas an amendment last fall. Democrats in the Senate blocked it. I plan \nto offer it again and to keep making the point that the President \nshould not have the power, the authority to impose these burdens on the \nAmerican economy and on American families.\n  My amendment blocks the issuance of new carbon standards for new and \nexisting powerplants. It would actually require the approval of \nCongress--can you imagine that, the approval of Congress, the elected \nrepresentatives of the people--require the approval of Congress for \nregulations that increase Americans' energy bills, such as new rules \nproposed by the Obama administration today.\n  Congress should act on an affordable energy plan, but these kinds of \ndecisions should be for Congress to make, not for the President to make \non his own. That is true whether the President is a Democrat or a \nRepublican.\n  We all know we need to make America's energy as clean as we can, as \nfast as we can. It is critically important though that we do this \nwithout hurting our economy--a struggling economy, an economy where \npeople continue to sacrifice--and do this in ways that do not cost \nhundreds of thousands of middle-class families their jobs.\n  We should look to States that have come up with ways to balance our \nenergy needs, the health of our economy, and our environment.\n  President Obama is taking the wrong approach. These new regulations \nare going to hurt our economy. It is an economy that is already \nshrinking. It is astonishing; our economy is shrinking, and it is \nbecause of the President's other failed policies.\n  The policies introduced today will hurt middle-class families who are \nstruggling to find work or to keep the jobs they have now. They will \nharm the health of many Americans. The President needs to change \ncourse. If he will not do it on his own, Congress must do it for him.\n  So, once again, today we see the headline: ``Obama Lets EPA Do His \nDirty Work.'' ``The president's charge to limit emissions has caused \nhim so much criticism that he is no longer leading the pack.'' Instead, \nhe is hiding. The President today is hiding. If this is something the \nPresident was proud of, he should have been at the White House in the \nRose Garden in front of the cameras making an announcement, not asking \nhis EPA Administrator to make it so he could be on a conference call \nbecause he was ashamed to show his face to the American people because \nof the impact these regulations are going to have on families all \nacross America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the President's Environmental Protection \nAgency today--a group that directly reports to him and which reflects \nhis decisions about environmental matters--has issued a new proposed \nregulation to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing powerplants \nby 30 percent by the year 2030. Those are existing plants, and they \ncannot be operated and have that kind of reduction unless they have \ncarbon capture, and there is no technology feasible with any \nreasonable--there is technology, but it is not feasible economically to \ncapture carbon. So it is a dramatic hammering of a major portion of the \nbaseload electricity production in America. It just is, and it is going \nto drive up costs.\n  What I wish to say first and foremost is I am very worried about our \neconomy. This economy is not doing well, and anybody who has paid close \nattention to it knows we have had one thing--one very important \npositive factor--over the last half dozen years that has helped our \neconomy bounce back and even caused some industries to bring home \nproduction from foreign countries; and that advantage--that positive \nevent--is a decline in energy prices. It is a direct result, primarily, \nof fracking--our ability to produce more energy from existing wells in \na proven-to-be safe and effective way. It is going on over large \nportions of America. Although this administration and the Environmental \nProtection Agency have thrown up a host of roadblocks to try to keep it \nfrom occurring, it is such a powerful, positive event it is virtually \nunstoppable.\n  So that is good. That is helping our businesses prosper. I remember \nin Alabama, north of Mobile where I grew up, there is a group of \nchemical companies on the river. Those chemical companies are \ninternational companies, first-rate companies, that were hammered when \nnatural gas, 10 or 15 years ago, surged in price so much. Many of them \nreduced their capacity, some have closed and were sold, and we lost a \nlot of good jobs.\n  It happened in Ohio. Ohio had a devastation among their strong \nchemical industries. The industry is beginning to come back now because \nof lower natural gas prices. But other industries too are very energy \nsensitive such as the steel industry. We are in a life-and-death \ncompetition to save America's steel industry. Energy is a huge portion \nof that.\n  Electricity is a big portion of that. To eliminate nearly 40 percent \nof our base load, to drive us on a path to drive up those costs \nunnecessarily above what we can rationally achieve, is a mistake, in my \nopinion.\n  Looking at Barron's this week--that is a business magazine. It comes \nout weekly. It has articles that sum up the state of the economy in \nAmerica. Of course we know that first-quarter economic growth was \nrevised downward, downward to negative 1.0 from positive .1. This is \nthe first negative growth in years, since 2011. It was unexpected. \nCorporate profits, excluding the depths of the recession, are the \nlowest in 20 years in America. We have fewer people working today than \nwe had in 2007, although there are 15 million more people in America--\nfewer people working and more of them are working part time than want \nto work part time. We have a surge in part-time employment. That is not \ngood either.\n  Wages are down. Adjusted, probably for inflation, wages are down, \nmedian income is down in America per family by $2,300. Your wages are \ndown. Your job prospects are down. Unemployment remains exceedingly \nhigh, and we are now going to add, in effect, another tax, a regulatory \ntax on the price of energy so a person's electric bill and their gas \nbill are going to go up. That is the inevitable result of this. It just \nis.\n  We have got to be careful about it. Europe is already regretting the \nmistakes they have made. Spain has had to abandon their overly \nambitious plan for renewable energy. German businesspeople are telling \ntheir leaders that if you do not change the energy policy in this \ncountry, we are not going to be able to compete and be successful as we \nhave been in the world markets.\n  So this is not a little matter. It is about jobs. It is about middle-\nincome,\n\n[[Page S3327]]\n\nhard-working Americans. The lower income people in this country pay as \nmuch as 25 percent of their income for energy. Oh, the rich people, the \npeople who travel around in big jets and claim to be concerned about \nthe environment, pay much less. For those making over $50,000 a year, \nyou pay about 11 percent of your income on energy.\n  So higher energy costs are direct negatives for poorer, hard-working \npeople in America. Retired seniors have no ability to have an increase \nin wages, trying to live on Social Security and a little savings. Boom, \nyou have got another $10, $20, $30 a month for the electric bill, the \ngas bill. It erodes their standard of living.\n  Again, it erodes the ability of American business to be competitive \nin the world marketplace. We have got to take back more work. In fact, \nwe are beginning to do that if we would do fewer bad things. We had a \ngood result with lower energy prices and this is going to undermine \nthat. It just is. We have got the pipeline. No, we will not do the \npipeline either. All that does is provide another source of oil and \ngas, oil for America, that forces the existing American big oil \ncompanies to compete with. It helps to bring down the price.\n  If you do not have another source from Canada, you have got less \ncompetition. Competition helps bring down price. I do not believe this \nadministration wants to bring down the price of energy. In fact, I \nthink the opposite is true. In fact, President Obama said, before he \nwas elected, that we could have--if anybody built a coal plant it was \ngoing bankrupt. That is not possible, to phase out the entire coal \nindustry so rapidly. We have done so much to clean it up. They have \nspent billions and billions of dollars reducing the pollutants that \ncome out of smokestacks. It helped a lot. That is why our air is \ncleaner than it has been in years. We have made a lot of progress. A \nlot of money has been spent. But this is an excessive action, in my \nview, focused primarily on CO2, carbon dioxide.\n  We all know about photosynthesis. We know how plants grow. We know \nthey take in carbon dioxide and breath out oxygen. We breathe in oxygen \nand we let out carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is odorless, it is \ntasteless, it is not poisonous, it is not harmful. In fact, plants grow \nfaster if there is more carbon dioxide than if there is less carbon \ndioxide. This is a scientific fact that is not disputable.\n  So what do they say? They say, well, the Clean Air Act gives the \nresponsibility of eliminating pollutants from our atmosphere. It was \npassed in 1970 before anybody even dreamed of global warming. So carbon \ndioxide--when the law was passed, the Clean Air Act in the 1970s, they \nhad no thought whatsoever in the Congress that we would be banning \ncarbon dioxide. John Dingell, a long-term Democratic Congressman, one \nof the longest serving ever, was a Member of Congress who voted on \nthat. He recently said they had no idea we were voting to regulate \ncarbon dioxide.\n\n  So how did it happen? Well, the environmentalists filed a lawsuit. \nThey said the Congress passed a law in 1970. That law said you should \nreduce pollutants. You have a responsibility to reduce pollutants and \ncarbon dioxide is a pollutant. Why? Well, the IPCC, the International \nPanel on Climate Change, said that CO2 creates global \nwarming, this perfectly positive small amount of gas in our massive \nenvironment, that makes plants grow better, is increasing. It is. It is \nincreasing in the environment because of burning carbon fuels.\n  They said this increase is going to warm the planet. We are going to \nhave more storms, more tornadoes, and the coasts are going to flood and \nall of this. Therefore, EPA should regulate it. Must regulate it. By a \n5-to-4 ruling, the Supreme Court agreed. Congress has never voted for \nthat. Congress has voted against global warming legislation multiple \ntimes. It would never ever pass this Congress if it were brought up for \na vote. Never pass.\n  So unelected folks in the Environmental Protection Agency, unelected, \nlifetime appointed Federal judges, at least five of the nine, concluded \nthat this is a pollutant. So here we are.\n  I do not know whether we have got warming. I have assumed it is. \nTemperatures, I believe over the last hundred years, have increased \nabout 1 degree. But I do think we need to be a lot more modest about \nthis. It is well below what the alarmists have been telling us.\n  How did it all happen? Why did the Supreme Court decide that this \nplant food, CO2, is a pollutant? They said it was because \nthese models are saying the planet is warming and all of the scientists \nagree, which is not true. But the scientists have said the planet is \nwarming, so therefore CO2 is a pollutant. They so ruled. But \nthings are not happening as the experts told us. It is just not \nhappening. I am beginning to wonder what is going on here.\n  This chart, the red line--this is zero. The red line is an average of \nall of the computer models that projected what the increase in \nclimate--in temperature would be based on steadily increasing \nCO2 in the atmosphere. Back in dinosaur days, we had a lot \nmore CO2 in the atmosphere than we have today. But it has \nbeen reduced. It has been increasing as we go into the ground, get coal \nand get oil and get natural gas and burn it. That emits more \nCO2. It is released back into the atmosphere, actually. It \nwas sucked out of the atmosphere through plants and animals.\n  This was the chart. Every single climate change model that is the \nfoundation of the argument for dangerous global warming predicted more \nthan has actually occurred in the last 15 years.\n  This is the chart. You go back to about 2000 here. This green line is \nthe actual result from--I believe that is balloon temperature gauges. \nIt actually has not gone up at all since 2001. That is what, 13 years? \nThis is not the temperatures they were predicting. Besides, the charts \nlooks a little more dramatic than they are. This is zero. This is two-\ntenths. They were predicting, from 1979 I believe was their key date, \nthat the temperature would increase 1.2 degrees. It has increased about \nthree-tenths of 1 degree. That is in this part.\n  But if you go here, when the chart is going off here, saying it \nshould be accelerating every year, it has been flat. So I do not know. \nSome people say the Sun is involved in it. Some people have other \ntheories. I do not know. I have assumed we are going to have some \nwarming out there. But it is certainly not coming in at the rate the \nalarmists have told us. That is indisputable fact.\n  We in Congress need to be asking ourselves how much burden we can \nafford to put on the American people at this time. The President--I \nhave got to tell you, one of the most frustrating things and \ndisappointing things to me is that the President in the last several \nyears--he has not in over a year now because I have been asking his \npeople before the environment committee to be sure and tell him not to \nsay it anymore. But he has two times said that the temperature is \nincreasing faster than the experts predicted over the last 10 or 15 \nyears. Think about that. The President of the United States, in the \nface of obvious data to the contrary, is repeatedly going out and \nsaying, it is increasing faster than the red line. That worries me. I \nbelieve the President of the United States has a responsibility, when \nhe advocates for policies, to tell the truth, the whole truth, and \nnothing but the truth.\n  That is not so. It is not increasing faster. It has hardly increased \nat all in the last 10 or so years.\n  Then they say the storms--the President and his team when Sandy hit \ngo out and say this is all a direct result of global warming. See? \nEvery time there is a storm, every time there is a drought, and every \ntime there is a problem, it is always climate change, global warming.\n  Dr. Roger Pielke laid out the numbers. I don't have the details here, \nbut he testified before the Environment and Public Works Committee and \nhe said: It is not so, hurricanes are not increasing. It is not hard to \nsee how many hurricanes you have.\n  You simply go back each year. They are quite calculating. He went \nback and calculated the hurricanes--how many category 5's, 4's, 3's, \n2's, and 1's. The result is pretty astonishing that we have had fewer \nof them. This chart is hard to read. I will quote what it says:\n\n       Hurricanes have not increased in the US in frequency, \n     intensity or normalized damage since at least 1900.\n\n  He has not been disputed either. They have tried to push back and \nattack him, but nobody has produced\n\n[[Page S3328]]\n\ndata that dispute what he says because it is easier to calculate that \ndata.\n  This is important. Dr. Pielke recently produced an analysis that said \nit has been 3,140 days since this country has had a category 3 \nhurricane. Camille was a 5, and we have had some others in the past. \nBut we have had almost 10 years since we had a category 3. Sandy, this \nstorm which hit the Northeast, which was very rare, happened to miss \nthe southeast, missed Florida, and hit the Northeast. It was not even a \nhurricane when it hit land. It was below the speed, I understand, of a \nhurricane. At best, it was a category 1. It just happened to hit the \nNortheast where people are not used to it, and it did a lot of damage.\n  How can it be argued, I ask colleagues, that global warming is \ncausing more storms? Moreover, the 2012-2013 tornado season was one of \nthe lowest in the past 50 years. Only 5 out of 50 years have been that \nlow.\n  We are not seeing an increase in tornadoes. We read about them more. \nWe have The Weather Channel, and they talk about them more. But, in \ntruth, the numbers aren't there.\n  Now, if hurricanes are down--and it has been 3,100 days since we have \nhad a category 3 hurricane--it is about the longest in history that we \nrecorded. It is an unusual drought of big hurricanes. It means a lot to \nme. I live in Mobile, AL, and I remember Hurricane Frederic in 1979 \nbarreling up Mobile Bay. I remember the fear people had who had been \nthere when Camille hit nearby in Mississippi. I know something about \nhurricanes, and they are very real factors. It surprises me we have had \nas few as we have had. We have also not seen an increase in tornadoes.\n  What we are proposing is that we have to carry out a policy that \nwould go beyond our technology to produce electricity in a cost-\neffective manner, and it has the impact of massively closing base-load \ncoal plants. Existing plants are going to be hammered, and new ones \nwill not be built.\n  I am also on the subcommittee of Environment and Public Works that \ndeals with nuclear power. Not a single American since the beginning of \nnuclear power 50 years ago has been killed as a result of a nuclear \npower accident. How many die in natural gas pipelines, drilling rigs, \ncoal mines, transportation of coal, and so forth?\n  We basically shut down nuclear power. I am telling us this is a big \nproblem for our country, the erosion of nuclear power. We had four \nplants close--existing nuclear plants close. They have been hammered \nwith regulations, and they have never been safer. We have never known \nmore about how to operate a nuclear plant safely than we know today.\n  But they know only one or two are being constructed, and this assault \non nuclear power has the potential to erode the 20 percent of our \nelectricity that comes from nuclear power. So if we lose the coal and \nwe lose nuclear power--and most of these plants are 30-plus, 40 or 45 \nyears old, and they will soon be at the end of their lifetime. If we \ndon't replace them, where will our energy come from, pray tell?\n  In any finding, anything that we do today to try to impact \nCO2 is only a drop in the bucket worldwide. They are \nbuilding coal-fired plants in China, India, the East, the Middle East, \nother places, and Africa in large numbers. We are a very small part of \nthe overall picture, and our actions are not going to reverse this \ntrend.\n  I don't know and I don't pretend to know all of the answers, but I \nwould say that if we have more CO2 and we have more global \nwarming and global climate change, how do we know it won't result in \nfewer hurricanes? We have had fewer.\n  How do we know it won't result in fewer tornadoes? We have had fewer \ntornadoes.\n  Life on the planet has tended to be more healthy and prosperous in \ntimes of higher temperatures than lower temperatures. I certainly don't \nwant to see a surging temperature in America and rapidly changing \nconditions. I think we could have real damage. As I said, I don't know \nwhat the full answer is.\n  I am just saying in my judgment, this administration is pushing this \nbeyond what is reasonable. It is going to adversely affect the economy \nof America. It is going to drive up the cost of every household's \nelectric bill, every household's gasoline bill. Every business in \nAmerica that hires American workers is going to try to export products, \nand those products are going to be more expensive because they had to \npay more for their energy.\n  The last thing we need to be doing at this point in American history \nis driving up--artificially--the price of energy. One expert said a \nnumber of years ago that the lifespan--the average lifespan of a person \nin a nation where electricity is readily available--is twice that \nwherever it is not readily available.\n  I have been in poor places in the world where there is not \nelectricity. You see the difficulty they have with water, you see the \ndifficulty they have with cleanliness and so forth, and cooling and \nkeeping food refrigerated and the disease that comes from that.\n  Energy is a positive force. It has made this world--the western \nworld, the developed world--so much more prosperous. It is creating \nwealth that we can then use for good causes--to clean up the \nenvironment, and to produce healthy foods for billions worldwide.\n  I don't think we should see energy as an evil thing. I think energy \nis a good thing, and we don't need to drive the price up. It makes life \nharder for people, especially those of limited income.\n  I thank the Chair for the opportunity to share these thoughts. It \nmeans a lot to me. We will keep working on it. We will analyze in \ndetail, as time goes by, the proposal the President has presented. I \nremain very concerned, as a matter of constitutional order, that this \nis being done without a vote of the people. This is being done by a 5-\nto-4 Supreme Court ruling, an aggressive President, and an aggressive \nEPA.\n  It seems as if there is not enough, and there is an inability in \nCongress to do anything about it. The average American who disagrees \nhas no voice, apparently, in being able to have their voice heard. So \nwe will continue to talk about it and as time goes by, we will look at \nthe trend and hopefully we can reduce some of the excesses that I think \nclearly exist.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, having just come down from the chair, I \nwish to briefly respond to the remarks of the junior Senator from \nAlabama, who engaged in a pretty stunning and broad denial of science \nfor about 15 minutes on the floor of the Senate as part of what I \nimagine will be a pretty robust critique this week of the new EPA rules \nfrom the administration.\n  When we were all schoolkids, we probably had the chance to read the \nplay ``Inherit the Wind.'' It is rather de rigueur for students to \nread. In the end, as Drummond is essentially excoriating Matthew \nHarrison Brady on the stand, the book ends with almost a sense of \nsorrow about the unraveling of Brady's argument and the kind of figure \nhe is portrayed at the end of the book to be.\n  My hope is that the same degree of strange affection may be the \nlegacy of those who come to the floor and engage in the same denial of \nbasic science that is at the root of the Scopes Monkey Trial in the \nbook which made it famous.\n  Our colleague talked about the fact that the jury is still out as to \nwhether the planet is warming. Here are the 10 hottest years on record \nsince 1880: 2010, 2005, 1998, 2013, 2003, 2002, 2006, 2009, 2007, and \n2004.\n  The Senator said that all the science doesn't really suggest global \nwarming is happening. Well, he is right. Ninety-seven percent of \nscientists with peer-reviewed literature have come to the conclusion \nthat the planet is warming and humans are contributing to it.\n  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said this in their last \nreport: ``Warming of the climate system is unequivocal.''\n  My friend said: Well, even if it is happening, we are really only a \nsmall part of the problem. So why is it even necessary for us to act?\n\n[[Page S3329]]\n\n  Well, we are not a small part of the problem. We are 5 percent of the \nworld's population and 25 percent of the world's pollution. And even if \nthe specific actions this week do represent a very small percentage of \nthe ultimate solution when we talk about trying to get the temperature \nof the planet under control, that is a terrible argument in and of \nitself. Is that a reason why none of us should bother to vote--because \neach one of our own actions in and of itself really doesn't affect the \noverall outcome? It is the collection of all of the actions we take in \na democracy that makes the difference, and it is the collection of \nactions we will take as a community of nations and a community of \nindividuals that will ultimately make the difference.\n  I imagine this debate will continue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/02/senate-section/article/S3329-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3329-S3330]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GUN CONTROL\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Thirty-one thousand people a year die across this country \nfrom gun violence. That is 2,639 a month or 86 a day. I have tried to \ncome down to the floor every week--a couple times a month at the very \nleast--and talk about the voices of those victims because if the \nstatistics aren't actually moving this place to action, then maybe we \ncan talk about who these people were. Of course, we have a fresh set of \nstories from Santa Barbara, CA.\n  I don't need to tell the story of young Mr. Rodger. He was a deeply \ntroubled young man who went on a shooting spree, killing six people and \nwounding many more.\n  Katherine Breann Cooper was 22 years old when she was gunned down by \nElliot Rodger. She was a painter, and she was known as Katie by her \nfriends. She had a really outgoing side. She was going to get a degree \nin art history, and she had a smile that ``lit up the room,'' according \nto her friends.\n  What her childhood friends from Chino Hills remember is that she was \nabsolutely unbeatable at foot races. She was the fastest kid in the \nwhole neighborhood. You couldn't beat her at foot races, hide and go \nseek, and you certainly couldn't beat her when the ice cream truck went \nthrough the neighborhood.\n  Her seventh grade teacher said:\n\n       She was one of 2,500 students I've taught over the years, \n     but Katie was a standout.\n\n  Veronika Weiss was 3 years younger--she was 19 years old--but her \nfather Bob said she was wise beyond her years. He said he would \nactually go to his 19-year-old daughter for advice when he was having a \nproblem with one of her brothers, Cooper and Jackson, or maybe when he \nwas having an argument with his wife.\n  She played four sports in high school: cross country, baseball, \nswimming, and water polo. She earned straight A's. Her strength was \nmath. She really excelled at sports, and she didn't let barriers get in \nher way. She didn't want to play softball; she wanted to play baseball. \nThere was a baseball league for kids in her hometown of Westlake, and \nthere were 500 players in that league--499 boys and 1 girl, and that 1 \ngirl was Veronika Weiss.\n  When she got to UC Santa Barbara, she didn't have a lot of friends \nuntil she joined the Tri-Delta Sorority. They became a built-in circle \nof friends for her.\n  Her former coach said:\n\n       We're really shocked. She touched a lot of people. And for \n     someone who's 19 years old to have that many people showing \n     up [at her service], that's a lot to say. There's been kids \n     who say, ``Oh, I was a new kid in school and she came up to \n     me and just started talking to me. I didn't even know her.'' \n     So she was that type of person.\n\n  Christopher Michaels-Martinez's father has had some strong things to \nsay about the inaction of Congress, but he also had a lot of wonderful \nthings to say about his son.\n  His son Christopher was a studious kid. He was an avid reader. He was \nan athlete from a young age, first beginning with soccer and going on \nto play football and basketball. He served as residential adviser at \nhis dorm and was the kind of guy who would welcome strangers into his \nhome and into his room.\n  His father talks a lot about his resilience. He remembers that at 8 \nyears old Christopher decided he wanted to play football. He remembers \nat a practice watching his son being knocked down by a much larger \nteammate, and his father said he remembers thinking:\n\n       My god, he must be hurt. But he was on the ground no more \n     than two seconds. He hopped back up, stomped one foot on the \n     ground and walked determinedly back into the line.\n\n  That's the kind of kid Chris was.\n  Richard Martinez urged the 20,000 people at the memorial for the \nvictims to follow his son's example from the football field. He said:\n\n       Like Christopher on that day, we've been knocked down. And \n     like Christopher on that day, I want you to get back up and \n     walk determinedly forward.\n\n  His father Richard has challenged Congress not to let one more person \ndie because of our inaction.\n  In a lot of ways, the story of Elliot Rodger is a word of caution \nabout the limits of what policy can do, but it is also an invitation \nfor us to look at some of the things we can do.\n  Elliot was an incredibly troubled kid, but he was not a kid who lived \noutside of the mental health system, nor was Adam Lanza, the young man \nwho killed 20 6- and 7-year-olds in Newtown. We can go back with 20/20 \nhindsight and pick apart the decisions--sometimes a very legitimate \ncritique--that Rodgers' parents or Adam Lanza's parents made, but the \nreality is that Elliot Rodger was in and out of the mental health \nsystem and in and out of a number of different schools trying to find \nthe appropriate placement. Adam Lanza had been identified with a severe \nmental illness, and his mother was trying to find treatment for him.\n  We need to do something to improve our mental health system. We have \nclosed down 4,000 mental health inpatient beds in the last 6 years \nalone, while the needs of those with mental illness are skyrocketing. \nWe know the waiting time for especially young adolescents to see a \npsychiatrist or psychologist just for an introductory visit is far too \nlong. So we need to make massive investments in our mental health \nsystem. But the law can help as well when it comes to guns. The fact is \nAdam Lanza should never have been able to possess the high-powered \nweapon that he did, and had he walked into Newtown with a different \nweapon instead of a semiautomatic rifle, there would still be children \nalive today, in the minds of many of those parents.\n\n  It is not clear the law could have changed anything in California, \nbut what we know is that in States that give law enforcement the \nability to take guns away from people who pose a danger to the \ncommunity or deny them to those individuals in the first place, fewer \nmurders happen.\n  Police showed up at the door of Elliot Rodger's house and, had they \nwalked in, they would have found a draft copy of his manifesto and a \nwhole bunch of guns and a whole bunch of ammunition. He likely would \nhave been taken into involuntary custody. His guns would have likely \nbeen taken away. The police didn't make that decision, but in \nCalifornia they have the ability to do that whereas, in many other \nStates they do not.\n  In Missouri, for instance, they used to have a law on the books that \nallowed for local law enforcement to deny gun permits to individuals \nwhom those local law enforcement personnel knew to be a potential \ndanger to society. Well, Missouri repealed that law, and a recent study \nby Johns-Hopkins University shows that controlling for all other \npossible factors that could explain the dramatic increase in gun \nviolence since the repeal of Missouri's background check legislation, \nthe repeal itself accounts for 60 to 80 additional gun murders in \nMissouri every single year.\n  We know that laws that keep guns out of the hands of dangerous \npeople, allow law enforcement to take guns away from dangerous people, \nlaws that prevent military assault weapons from being in the community \nin the first place, save lives. It is not a coincidence. During the \nperiod of time after which the government instituted an assault weapons \nban, we saw a reduction in the number of mass murders in this country. \nAfter it was repealed, we started to see an increase in those mass \nmurders. Assault weapons bans don't have a lot to do with average, \neveryday gun violence, but they can have something to do with mass \nshootings.\n  Edmund Burke said: ``The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil \nis that good men do nothing.'' I believe every single Senator here has \nheard that.\n  I will end with this thought: I think we can pass laws that will \nreduce these\n\n[[Page S3330]]\n\nnumbers. It won't eliminate these numbers, but we can pass laws, \nwhether it is improving our mental health system or changing our gun \nlaws, that reduce the number of people who die and to perhaps lessen \nthe weekly stories we hear of mass violence across the whole country.\n  What is the real risk of doing nothing, not even trying? I submit it \nis like pulling teeth to get any Republican Senators or Congressmen to \neven cosponsor a bill addressing any of these issues, and the real risk \nof doing nothing is that we start to look complicit in these mass \nmurders. I know that is a strong thing to say, but it is not enough for \nthe community itself to rally after these mass murders to shame the \naction when the most important legislative body in the world has \nnothing to say about this dramatic increase in mass gun violence. When \nwe allow these numbers to fester without a single piece of legislation \nto address this trendline passing the Senate and the House, we have \nbecome accomplices because we send a message that we don't think the \nmurders in Aurora, in Tucson, in Newtown, in Santa Barbara, are serious \nenough for us to do anything. That is a real shame.\n  Hopefully, at some point over the time the Presiding Officer and I \nhave the honor of serving in the Senate, if the numbers don't move this \nplace to action, the voices of the victims will.\n  I yield the floor, and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, several years ago when the majority party, \nthe Democratic Party, controlled 60 seats in the Senate and had \nliterally the numbers to do whatever it wanted to do, the majority \nleader tried to push through a new massive energy tax bill known as \ncap-and-trade. Not only did it fail to pass, the majority leader never \neven brought it up for a vote, primarily because members of his own \nparty recognized there would be huge costs associated with this new \nenergy tax, and that the benefits, indeed, on balance did not outweigh \nthe costs or, perhaps most charitably stated, were neutral. There were \nhardly any real benefits to speak of on the plus side, but there were \nplenty of negatives, including lost jobs, lost wages, higher utility \nbills, and a less competitive U.S. economy.\n  Now the Obama administration, we learn, is in the process of enacting \na backdoor energy tax, not through the votes of Members of Congress--\nthe only people who could be held accountable for how we vote--but \nrather through the regulatory process through the Environmental \nProtection Agency.\n  Much like the cap-and-trade bill that collapsed in 2010, the EPA \nregulation that was announced earlier today would impose major new \ncosts on America's economy while doing virtually nothing to improve the \nenvironment. I will explain my reason for saying that in a moment.\n  I will talk about the economic costs in a second, but first I want to \nemphasize that over the coming decades America's contribution to the \ngrowth of worldwide carbon dioxide emissions will be virtually \nnonexistent.\n  Consider these numbers from the Energy Information Agency: Between \n2005 and 2012, America's energy-related carbon dioxide emissions \nactually declined by more than 10 percent. Between 2005 and 2012, our \ncarbon dioxide emissions did not go up but they declined by more than \n10 percent. By contrast, over the same period of time China's energy-\nrelated carbon dioxide emissions grew by nearly 64 percent.\n  So ours went down 10 percent and China's went up by 64 percent. As a \nresult, China is now producing far more carbon dioxide emissions than \nthe United States.\n\n  Looking ahead, the Energy Information Agency has projected that \ndeveloping countries--countries that don't have a developed economy \nlike the United States but do want our standard of living and a better \nlife for their people--will be responsible for 94 percent of the growth \nin global carbon dioxide emissions between 2010 and 2040, with China \nalone accounting for 49 percent of that increase. As for the United \nStates, during that same period of time carbon dioxide emissions will \nbarely increase at all.\n  I mentioned these figures because some of my friends across the aisle \nhave repeatedly declared that President Obama's backdoor energy tax \nwill help us ``fight climate change.'' Given the numbers I just listed, \nit should be clear to us that any rule such as what the EPA is \nproposing would do little to affect global emissions unless developing \ncountries such as China and India do exactly the same--assuming that is \nsomething we would want to make as a priority, and assuming the \nbenefits outweigh the costs.\n  The fact is that China has no interest in sacrificing economic growth \nfor speculative long-term climate benefits, nor do India or other \ndeveloping nations. We have to remember that these countries alone \nstill have hundreds of millions of people living in abject poverty. \nThey want a better and growing economy, so why in the world would they \nimpose these restrictions on themselves? It is not going to happen, and \nthat is what they told us.\n  In short, President Obama's EPA rule would place America's economy--\nan economy that shrunk by 1 percent last quarter--at a competitive \ndisadvantage without having any substantial effect on global climate \nchange or on CO2 emissions overall. In other words, it would \nbe all pain and no gain. As I mentioned, the pain would be very real. \nIt would come in the form of lost jobs due to a slowing economy, lost \nwages, and higher electricity prices.\n  In my State, the month of August gets to be pretty hot, and our grid \noperates at maximum capacity. Due to a variety of EPA regulations, the \nprice of those higher electricity prices is borne by the people who are \nleast able to absorb those costs--particularly people on a fixed \nincome, including the elderly. Also, the job loss would be concentrated \non blue-collar workers in the fossil fuel industries--most notably the \ncoal industry. These workers have already been hurt by EPA regulations, \nbut these new proposed regulations would make that pain even worse. The \nhigher electricity costs and higher utility rates would affect all of \nus, but the heaviest burden would fall on people who are at a low or \nfixed income; in other words, the people who are least able to pay more \nfor their utility bills.\n  If a regulation can't pass the basic cost-benefit test, then in my \nview it has little business being enacted--and it should certainly not \nbe enacted by nameless, faceless bureaucrats who are unaccountable to \nthe American people or for the consequences of what they are passing. \nThat is especially true when our economy is suffering through the \nweakest economic recovery and the longest period of high unemployment \nsince the Great Depression. Why--if this makes sense at any time--would \nwe want to do it now?\n  Median household income has also declined by nearly $2,300 since the \nrecession formally ended. We have had a period of anemic economic \ngrowth in this country, a high unemployment rate, the slowest economic \nrecovery since the Great Depression, and the highest percentage of \npeople who dropped out of the workforce because they are discouraged \nabout the prospect of finding jobs at any time since Jimmy Carter was \nPresident.\n  In the meantime, if you are buying your health insurance in the \nObamaCare exchanges and your health insurance premiums have gone up--we \nknow the cost of fuel and gasoline has gone up, and the cost of food \nhas gone up. The middle class will be disproportionately burdened by \nthis EPA regulation in a way that does not, on net, change the global \nenvironment, and would kill jobs and hurt families in return for \nnegligible, or even nonexistent, benefits.\n  Once again, we see that the President has decided to place ideology--\nhis wish of how the world ought to look--ahead of the numbers. He is \nfamous for saying, let's do the arithmetic.\n  Let's do the arithmetic. The arithmetic does not make the case that \nthese regulations should be passed; indeed, it defeats the argument \nthat they should.\n\n[[Page S3331]]\n\n  Sadly, rather than engage in the normal legislative process that \nwould allow my colleague, the Presiding Officer from Maine, who may \nhave a different view from mine, and others to debate and vote on these \nissues and make policy so we can be held accountable for what we do, \nthe President has decided to skirt the legislative process and instead \nrely on unaccountable bureaucrats to enact measures that would never \npass through Congress. Yet the idea of this President is: I have a \nphone and a pen, and I can go it alone. He can do it by himself.\n  Well, he can't. Our Constitution does not allow that. Sooner or later \nthe American people are going to hold folks accountable for enabling \nthis sort of unilateral activity. In my view this is an unforced error \nthat will damage our economy, hurt our workers, and raise the cost of \nliving for middle-class families and those on a fixed income.\n  I find it astonishing that this misguided regulation is being \nconsidered now when our economy is growing so slowly and so many people \nare out of work or have left the workforce, and the median household \nincome is down, yet costs for health care, food, gasoline, and other \ncommodities are going up.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Gun Violence\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I come to the floor tonight heartbroken at \nthe loss of 6 young people and the injuries to 13 more after a \ndevastating gun violence tragedy that occurred on May 23 in the Isla \nVista community near Santa Barbara.\n  As a mother, grandmother, and Senator representing the most \nunbelievable State in the Union, this latest mass shooting shook me to \nthe core. I was struck by this simple fact: No one is safe in America \nanymore. No one is safe in America anymore--not in their schools, not \nin a movie theater, not in their workplace, not in their home, and not \non a beautiful college campus overlooking the Pacific Ocean where the \nvictims of this latest horrific attack were busy pursuing their dreams.\n  I am going to show the faces of the students we lost. Christopher \nRoss Michaels-Martinez, 20 years old, from Los Osos/Oceano, CA. He was \nan English major who served as a resident adviser in a campus dorm \nwhile maintaining a 4.0 GPA. He was planning to study abroad in London \nnext year, and he dreamed of going to law school like both of his \nparents. His cousin Jaime described Chris as ``smart, gentle, and \nkind,'' but with a competitive spirit he showed on the basketball \ncourt. His high school basketball coach said, ``he was a coach's dream. \nHe was a team player, he had a great attitude and he was a hard worker \nwho would stay after practice and work on his shots.''\n  His father Richard said:\n\n       Chris was a really good kid. Ask anyone who knew him. His \n     death has left our family lost and broken.\n\n  Veronika Elizabeth Weiss, 19, from Thousand Oaks. She loved sports \nand\n\n[[Page S3332]]\n\nhigh school. She played on four teams. She started playing softball at \nthe age of 6, and later turned to baseball and was the only girl out of \n500 players in the Westlake Baseball League. She was a good student who \nearned straight A's in high school and graduated with a 4.3 GPA. She \nwas majoring in pre-financial mathematics and statistics. Her father \nsaid: ``She wanted to be a financial wizard, and use her high aptitude \nwith complicated math.'' She was a member of the Tri-Delta Sorority, \njust like her mom and grandmother, and now she is gone.\n  One of her friends said: ``Veronika was one of the people you knew \nyou wanted to be friends with. She is willing to become friends with \nanyone and everyone. She is the one person who can make you smile \ninstantly.''\n  Then there is Katherine ``Katie'' Breann Cooper, 22, of Chino Hills, \nCA. She was close to her two brothers, and she was weeks away from \ngraduating with a degree in art history. Her friends remember her as \nfun and outgoing, someone who had ``a very bright smile that lit up a \nwhole room.'' And we can see the smile.\n  In the words of one family friend, Katie was the ``kind of girl that \nbrought sunshine on an overcast day.'' She loved soccer and running \ntrack and helped her family deliver Christmas gifts to her neighbors in \nChino Hills every year.\n  She was also a member of Tri Delta, a ballroom dance teaching \nassistant, and raised money for St. Jude's Children's Hospital in \nMemphis. Her friends said she was ``involved in everything'' and \n``never slowed down.''\n  ``She was a self-proclaimed princess and I love her for that,'' her \nfriend Courtney said. ``And I know she has a crown on her head today.''\n  Cheng Yuan ``James'' Hong, 20, San Jose, CA. He was a fourth-year \ncomputer engineering major who spent his time volunteering as a teacher \nassistant at Rainbow Chinese School in Cupertino. He friends described \nhim as a hard-working and bright student who was always willing to help \nothers.\n  His high school drama teacher in San Jose remembered him as a quiet \nstudent who was happy to work backstage to ensure that his classmates \ncould shine.\n  One of his former classmates said that he was ``one of the kindest, \nmost genuine people I have ever met . . . He was never afraid that his \nunrelenting kindness might have led to him being taken advantage of. He \nhelped out everybody he knew, myself included, and never asked for \nanything in return. He was good for the sake of being good, and it is \nincredibly rare to find people that genuine.''\n  Then there is George Chen, 19, from San Jose. He graduated from high \nschool in San Jose and had just finished his second year at UC-Santa \nBarbara where he studied computer science. His father is a software \nengineer, and George wanted to follow in his dad's footsteps. He liked \nswimming and hiking and was close to his younger brother, who is 10 \nyears old, despite their age difference. They would play video games \ntogether and laugh. Friends described George as a ``gentle soul'' who \nhad a fondness for working with children.\n  When he went home to visit his parents during breaks from school, his \nmother said he would always go out of his way to pick up his elderly \nneighbor's mail and take out their trash. He volunteered for the \nBuddhist charity group Tzu Chi and as a camp counselor at the YMCA. And \nhe is gone.\n  Then there is Weihan ``David'' Wang from Fremont, CA, 20 years old. \nHis mother described her son as ``a very, very nice boy,'' the kind who \naced his SATs but never bragged about it. He was an avid basketball \nfan. He played on his high school team in Fremont, and was a big fan of \nthe Los Angeles Lakers.\n  At UC-Santa Barbara, he studied computer engineering and wanted to \nstart a business with his friends. One friend described David as \n``warm-hearted and helpful.'' His parents said that David was ``gentle, \nkind, loving, joyful, peaceful, faithful, and self-controlled.'' He was \nsupposed to return home for the summer break soon to go on a trip with \nhis family to Yellowstone National Park.\n  I say to all families who can hear me: Imagine what that does to a \nmother and father--to a family. David was their only child. His mother \nsaid, ``He was always the joy of the family,'' and now he is gone.\n  These were all bright and talented people who were full of promise \nand passion. Their dreams and futures were extinguished in an instant \nof chaos.\n  Today I join their families, friends, and classmates in mourning \ntheir unfathomable loss. Not only that, I stand with them in staunch \ndetermination to do everything in my power to stop this senseless \nviolence.\n  Richard Martinez, the dad of Christopher, said it best. He said he \ndoes not want or care about sympathy from politicians. He said to us: \n``Get to work and do something.''\n  The parents of James Hong said the same thing in a letter: ``I know \nthere has been a great injustice, and policy can be improved.'' They \nadded that their son ``can't be here to help anymore, but you can.''\n  The mother of George Chen said: ``This is not the first time it \nhappens, a killing spree, but I hope it's the last one. No parent \nshould have to go through this.''\n  And the parents of David Wang wrote: ``It's time to stop gun \nviolence, and be free from fear.'' They are absolutely right. We must \nact. We cannot sit back and simply accept that nearly 90 Americans are \nkilled every day--and 30,000 are killed every year--from gun violence.\n  I well remember the Vietnam War because I got involved in politics to \ntry and stop it. It was horrible. We lost more than 50,000 people over \n10 years, and we ended that war.\n  Mr. President, 30,000 are killed every year from gun violence. When \nare we going to end the war here at home? We cannot accept that every \nday an average of 8 children and teens under the age of 20 are killed \nby guns. We cannot accept the fact that children in the United States \ndie by guns 11 times as often as children in other high-income nations. \nIt is an outrage, and it has to end.\n  We often see the same reaction after mass shootings like this. Some \nwill insist it was just ``the act of a mad man'' and there is nothing \nyou can do to stop a deranged person from going on a rampage. You know \nwhat? History says that defeatist attitude is wrong.\n  Take Australia. In April 1996, a young man killed 35 people and \nwounded 23 others with a semiautomatic rifle in the so-called Port \nArthur massacre, the worst mass shooting in Australian history.\n  Less than 2 weeks later, the conservative-led national government \npushed through fundamental changes to the country's gun laws. \nAustralia's conservative government passed laws that all but prohibited \nautomatic and semiautomatic assault rifles, stiffened licensing and \nownership rules, and instituted a temporary gun buyback program that \ntook some 650,000 assault weapons out of public circulation. The law \nthen required licensees to demonstrate a ``genuine need'' for a \nparticular type of gun and take a firearm safety course. Those actions \nby Australia's leaders made a difference. In the decade before Port \nArthur, Australia saw 11 mass shootings. Since then, there has not been \na single mass shooting, and the gun murder rate has continued to \nsteadily decline.\n  In 2011, Australia had 0.86 gun deaths for each 100,000 people--or 25 \npeople. That year the United States had 10.3 gun deaths per 100,000 \npeople, or 11,101 Americans. Accounting for the population differences, \nthis is insanity.\n  Australia said enough is enough. When are we going to do that?\n  Canadians said enough is enough. In December 1989, a disgruntled \nstudent walked into a Montreal engineering school with a semiautomatic \nand killed 14 students and injured over a dozen others. That tragedy \nprompted the leaders in Canada to ban more than half of all registered \nguns, require all gun owners to be at least 18, and obtain a license. \nYou need a license for a car. Why don't you need a license, public \nsafety course, and a background check for a gun? That is what they did.\n  Canadians said enough is enough, and it paid off. Canada's gun murder \nrate has declined since passage of these laws, with occasional spikes \nin gun violence.\n  In 2009, Canada had 0.5 deaths per 100,000 from gun murders--173 \npeople. The United States had 3 gun murders for every 100,000 that \nyear--that is\n\n[[Page S3333]]\n\n11,493 Americans. Come on--173 out of 100,000 compared to 11,493 people \nout of 100,000? What is wrong with the people here in this country and \nin this body?\n  The United Kingdom experienced tragedies that led their leaders to \nact. In August of 1987, a lone gunman armed with two legally-owned \nsemi-automatic rifles and a handgun went on a 6-hour shooting \nspree roughly 70 miles west of London, killing 16 people and then \nhimself. Britain expanded the list of banned weapons, including certain \nsemi-automatic rifles. They increased registration requirements for \nother weapons. Since then, they have banned all handguns, with a few \nexceptions. The government instituted a buyback program which many \ncredit for taking tens of thousands of illegal or unwanted guns out of \nsupply. Their actions paid off. The UK's gun murder rate since passage \nof these laws is now less than half of what it used to be.\n\n  In 2011 the UK had 0.23 gun deaths per 100,000 people, a fraction of \nthe 10.3 gun deaths per 100,000 in the United States that year. They \nhad 38 gun murders; we had 11,101. What is going on? We have to do some \nof this here. What are we so scared of?\n  I said when I started this speech that no one is safe in America \nbecause we don't take commonsense steps. I am not saying we ban guns or \nwe ban people from having guns--no--but that we have a system where \nthey have to show they need it. We can do the same things here in \nAmerica. We can start. How about this: Pass measures that have nearly \nunanimous support among the American people, wherever they live in our \ngreat Nation. Take background checks. Ninety percent of Americans say \nthey support background checks. Because one gun lobby doesn't like it, \nwe turn our backs on 90 percent of the people. What is wrong with us?\n  We have legislation to expand background checks. It has bipartisan \nsupport. We should take it up and pass it and do the work of the \npeople, 90 percent of whom want us to pass background checks.\n  Assault weapons. Most Americans support banning military-style \nassault weapons: 81 percent of voters, 71 percent of gun owners, and 60 \npercent of NRA members. We should pass Senator Feinstein's legislation \nnow and do the work the American people want us to do.\n  How about high-capacity magazine clips? Seventy-two percent of voters \nsay we should ban the sale of high-capacity ammunition magazines.\n  Mental health. Lawmakers on both sides support taking action. Let's \ndo it now.\n  School safety. I authored a bill with Senator Collins to provide the \nresources needed to make schools safer. Take it up and pass it, and \ndon't load it up with controversy. Pass the things we need to pass. Do \nit for these families and for God knows all the others who are \nsuffering and crying themselves to sleep every single night, bearing a \nloss that will never go away.\n  Here is the situation. In this particular case, we had the family of \nthe gunman who committed the massacre call the police and say: We are \nvery worried about our son. It is haunting to me that they had a \nfeeling about it and they called the police. The police went to \ninterview this troubled young man, and they couldn't see through his \nproblems. They didn't check the gun database we have in California. If \nthey had, they would have seen that he had purchased guns. If they knew \nthat, we would have been in a different circumstance.\n  So we are introducing legislation called the Pause for Safety Act. \nThis is what it does. No. 1, families and others who are very close to \nthe suspected unstable individual can go to court and seek a gun \nviolence prevention order to temporarily stop someone who poses a \ndanger to themselves or others from purchasing a firearm. They can go \nto court and seek a gun violence prevention order. Let's say it is a \ngroup of coworkers who see that this person is threatening or he has \nwritten something. They can actually make the case before a judge and \nget an order, so the person cannot buy guns.\n  No. 2, it would help ensure that families and others close to the \nindividual can also seek a gun violence prevention warrant which would \nallow law enforcement to take temporary possession of firearms that \nalready have been purchased. If those police officers had known this \nindividual had bought those weapons--because we do have that database--\nthey could have gone and gotten the warrant. But under our bill, a \nfamily member could do this. They could go to court and seek that gun \nviolence prevention warrant.\n  No. 3, if law enforcement gets a tip or a warning or a request from a \nfamily member, they can then make full use of a gun registry if it \nexists in their state. It is very important for law enforcement to make \nuse of the gun registry if it exists.\n  I am very pleased that similar legislation has been introduced in \nCalifornia by Assemblywoman Nancy Skinner, Assemblyman Das Williams, as \nwell as State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson.\n  We all remember the shock and outrage we felt after the Sandy Hook \nshooting in Newtown, CT, where a gunman shot 20--babies, I call them--\nchildren--schoolchildren and 6 adult staff members. All of those lives \nlost, and we said we would take action. We wore ribbons and we came to \nthe floor and we cried. Well, since that shooting, more than 28,000 \nAmericans have died from gun violence--90 people every day. Imagine, if \nit was anything else that caused the death of 28,000 Americans, we \nwould be on the Senate floor.\n  The shooting at Sandy Hook and the shooting at UC Santa Barbara are a \nreminder that we have failed our children. Call it what you want. We \nare failing our children. We have a basic task to keep our children \nsafe. They look to us, and they believe we will protect them. We have a \nfunction here, which is to not allow someone who is unstable and \nviolent to get a weapon. So we need to pull together, and we need to \nshow our children we love them, not by making fancy speeches but by \ndoing the right thing, such as this father said we have to do, Chris's \ndad. Don't tell me how you love children; don't talk to me about how \nbad you feel. Do something.\n  Children need to know they are safe in school. People need to know \nthey are safe at work. People need to feel safe in a restaurant--\nanyplace. Let us honor these victims of gun violence by working to end \nthis epidemic. We look at these faces, we look at their eyes, and we \nknow they were just at the start of their adventures, at the height of \ntheir productivity, in their twenties.\n  We have to do something so this doesn't happen again and again and \nagain.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in this work we do so many issues need to \nbe discussed. One of them I have tried to discuss, along with several \ncolleagues, is this incredible threat to our planet caused by climate \nchange. I have participated with my colleagues, Senator Whitehouse, \nSenator Markey, Senator Cardin, and many others, in all-night speeches \nand in hearings.\n  I am so proud to be the chairman of the environment committee. It was \nmany years ago when I took the gavel to become the chairman that I \nstarted to really get involved in the details and in the science and in \nthe predictions of scientists as to what could happen. We came very \nclose to doing something important here in the Senate, but we faced a \nfilibuster, and although the House passed a very important bill years \nago, we couldn't get it done. We fell six votes short.\n  At the time, the press said to me: What are you going to do? Are you \ngoing to do nothing about this? No, I said. Actually, the most popular \nlaw that has ever been passed--I believe it; I haven't taken a poll on \nit, but I can tell my colleagues from looking at studies that the Clean \nAir Act covers all kinds of pollution, including carbon pollution. I \nsaid that even though we weren't able to have a cap-and-trade system \nwhich would put a price on carbon and let people get permits and trade \nthem, I felt that was a good way to work in a capitalistic society, and \nwe didn't go there. I said we have the Clean Air Act. Once an \nendangerment finding is made--it was started during the Bush \nadministration and completed during the Obama administration--we know \nthe President has full authority to act, with or without the deniers \nhere in the Senate and in the House.\n  Now, 40 percent of all the carbon is emitted by powerplants, so \npowerplants are a very important part of the\n\n[[Page S3334]]\n\nproblem we have to address. We already know the President and the \nCongress worked together to reduce the pollution coming out of our cars \nby passing very important fuel economy measures. But this is really the \nlargest problem--those powerplants and the dangerous carbon.\n  The President understands and looks at his kids and he knows if they \nare going to have a world in which they can thrive, we have to do \nsomething about this problem, and we can't just put our heads in the \nsand and say the scientists are wrong. Let's not be like the deniers \nwho said smoking didn't cause cancer. Ninety-seven percent of \nscientists said it did; 3 percent said it didn't. The tobacco lobby \nwent on the side of the bad guys and, for years, we had to fight and \nprod and push. Guess what happened? People got sick and a lot of them \ndied because there was basically a coverup by the tobacco industry.\n  We are facing a similar situation. The big special interests are \ntrying to tell the American people: Don't worry about this climate \nchange. It is no big deal. Well, here is the great news: The President \nhas stepped forward. He has taken on carbon pollution from powerplants.\n  Under current law there is no limit to the amount of carbon pollution \nthat can be released into the air from powerplants. The President's \ncarbon pollution reduction plan is going to change all that. It will \nprotect public health. It will save thousands of lives. It will avoid \nup to 6,600 premature deaths, 150,000 asthma attacks, 3,300 heart \nattacks, 2,800 hospital admissions, and 490,000 missed days at school \nand work will be prevented. Those benefits will kick in.\n  Here is what is important about that. When we clean up the carbon, we \nprotect the air quality. That is why the President went to a hospital \nwhen he announced this. That is why 70 percent of the people--\nincluding, as I recall, a huge majority of Americans--support \nregulating carbon from powerplants and they are even willing to pay for \nit. A lopsided and bipartisan majority of Americans support Federal \nlimits on greenhouse gas emissions according to this new poll. Fully 70 \npercent say the Federal Government should require limits to greenhouse \ngases from existing plants. What is so interesting: 57 percent of \nRepublicans support it, 76 percent of Independents, and 79 percent of \nDemocrats. So this is a plan whose time has come.\n\n  This plan will also create tens of thousands of jobs as we move to a \nclean energy economy. By reducing carbon pollution, we can avert the \nmost calamitous impacts of climate change, such as rising sea levels, \ndangerous heat waves, and economic disruption. If we do not act, we \ncould see a 10-degree Fahrenheit rise in temperature, and that is \ndisastrous, really, for all of our States.\n  I have been so privileged to work on the Senate Climate Action Task \nForce. What is interesting is that I have listened to people from all \nover the country talk about what this climate change means in their \nStates. Coastal States have a certain set of problems, inland States, \nagricultural States, and there are the forest fires that are burning \nout of control. I hope people will watch the documentary ``Years of \nLiving Dangerously.'' It is really a wake-up call if you have not \nalready awakened to this problem. It is happening all over the world--\nfires that do not stop, droughts that the Defense Department is telling \nus are a real problem.\n  Do you know how the House of Representatives deals with climate \nchange? They pass a bill that says the Defense Department cannot act on \nwhat they have already said, which is that climate change is a real, \nserious threat multiplier. They actually said now it could be a cause \nof conflict. Before they said it was a threat multiplier. Now they say \nit is actually a--they use the word ``catalyst'' for conflict. But the \nHouse does not like that, so they just said: It shall be so. We will \nnot talk about this anymore. Stamp my foot--no. Disregard 97 percent of \nthe scientists.\n  Here is the thing I like about the President's proposal: It is \nrespectful of States' roles. It allows major flexibility. Every State \nis going to have its own plan. Some States may say: Coal-fired plants, \nyou can clean up a little bit. We will get a little savings there. But \nwe will also do some energy efficiency so you do not have to burn as \nmuch coal. This is what is envisioned.\n  Eventually, we are going to see lower prices for our folks. They say \nin about 15 years we are going to see an 8-percent decrease. Let me say \nthat again. It is going to shrink electricity bills roughly 8 percent, \nand that is going to happen because we are going to have increased \nenergy efficiency and reduced demand.\n  So this poll is very clear. People want action. And the Clean Air Act \nis very clear.\n  I think it is important to note that under George Bush we wasted 8 \nyears because they kept saying carbon pollution was not covered in the \nClean Air Act. But we had some very smart attorneys who went up there--\nand one of them is sitting here--who said: No, no, no. Just read it. If \nyou read it, you will see.\n  Thank goodness the Supreme Court ruled and said that absolutely \ngreenhouse gas emissions can be regulated if there is an endangerment \nfinding. And there certainly was that. So the Clean Air Act has a \nproven track record.\n  I will close with this. To those people who are in denial, I say: \nWake up because it is not about you; it is about your kids and your \ngrandkids and their kids. So get out of that phase because you are \nhurting people--innocent people. This is your time to do something--not \nto walk away.\n  For those people who say: Oh, the environment, that is not an \nimportant issue to the people--no. It is a big deal. Every time my \nfriends here try to repeal parts of the Clean Air Act, I come to the \nfloor with colleagues. We have stopped them. The House voted 90 times \nwith these terrible riders. We have stopped them every time. Eighty \npercent of the people support the Clean Air Act. We have to protect our \nfamilies.\n  We have seen a country that has thrown the environment under the bus. \nNow they say they are changing, but let's see what a country looks \nlike--instead of listening to my words, let's look at a photo. As shown \nin this picture, this is what life is like in some Chinese provinces. \nThey do not care about the environment. They do what some of my friends \nsay: Oh, repeal this--they do not even have these laws to repeal. They \ndo not care. Just develop, just develop, just develop. Do not pay \nattention. Do not worry about best technologies. Just throw the \nenvironment under the bus.\n  Well, guess what. These people are being thrown under the bus. They \ncannot breathe. And if you cannot breathe, you cannot work. So even \nChina--they are learning they have to do something to clean up their \nenvironment.\n  But we cannot look like this in the future. I am just telling you. \nPeople think, oh, an exaggeration. I had one of my Republican \ncolleagues walk out on me in a hearing because I showed this picture. \nThey said: We do not want this.\n  I am not saying they want it. I am saying that if you repeal all the \nprovisions of the Clean Air Act that they are trying to repeal--and \nthey want, by the way, to stop us from this rule--that is what is going \nto happen, not that they want it to happen. Of course they do not want \nit to happen. They do not think it is going to happen. But this has \nhappened because in China, like us, they have a very big economy, and \nthey are expanding. We want to expand, but we have to do it in a clean \nway.\n  So the people of my home State of California get this. They get this. \nThe oil companies came in and they put millions of dollars to try to \nget us to repeal our cap-and-trade system and our rules and our laws. \nPeople said: No, no, no, we are not going there with you, Big Oil. \nClean up your act.\n  My mother used to say: Clean up your room. The room they are \npolluting belongs to everybody. It is the atmosphere. We all have to \nclean it up. This is not something we take a pass on. This is the \nplanet Earth itself. Somebody said the other day--some scientist--that \nthe Earth will survive. It will look a lot different. The water will be \ndifferent. This will be different. There will not be the same things \ngrowing and forests will be elsewhere. But what about the people? Well, \nthat was not a good story.\n  It is up to us. We have a lot on our shoulders. We really do. I am \nnot saying it is easy. Nothing is easy. My dad\n\n[[Page S3335]]\n\nused to say: Nothing good comes easy. It is true. We have to try to \nfigure it out.\n  But I want to say to this President tonight how proud I am that he \nhas stepped up to the plate. All the screaming and the denials and the \nyelling and the rest and the special interests, which my colleague \nSenator Whitehouse says has a barricade of lies around the Capitol--and \nhe is just looking at his daughters and he is looking at all the young \npeople he meets, and he is saying: You know what, I have to do \nsomething. And he is looking at the military. He is looking at them and \nhe is thinking: I am being told--he is saying--by the Department of \nDefense that climate change is making this an unstable world.\n  Actually, there is a very strong case to be made that was made in a \ndocumentary that a lot of the cause of the Syrian war started out with \nthe farmers rebelling and revolting because they cannot deal with what \nis happening to their lives--the farmers.\n  So whether it is climate change or taking care of our veterans or all \nthe other things facing us--the violence--we have a lot on our plate. I \njust hope we can step up to the plate, with the best of intentions, \nwork across party lines, do our best, stop playing politics. President \nObama says one thing. It does not matter what he says, the other side \nis all over it. How could that be? How could every single thing a \nperson says be controversial? Sometimes I think if the President said \n``Good morning,'' one of the Republicans would say ``It is not; how \ndare you say it is a good morning?'' That is what it is getting to. We \nhave to put that aside. We are only here for a short amount of time, \nand we have to do our best to solve the problems the American people \nface.\n  So I took a long time tonight because I feel there are so many things \nout there that I am so privileged to be able to talk about and, more \nimportant, I can do something about. So I hope our colleagues will come \ntogether on these topics and we can make some progress for the good of \nthe American people.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Energy Policy\n\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to offer my \nstrong support of the Environmental Protection Agency's clean power \nplan to cut carbon pollution from existing powerplants. The EPA's \nproposal is a powerful step in the fight to protect our health and our \nenvironment.\n  We face a crisis. We know that high carbon dioxide levels in our \natmosphere are driving climate change. We know these carbon dioxide \nlevels are increasing the acidity of our oceans, disrupting already \nfragile marine ecosystems. We know that powerplants are responsible for \nabout 40 percent of America's carbon pollution.\n  Add all that up and we have enough to know that reducing carbon \npollution from powerplant emissions will make a real difference in the \nfight against climate change. Pollution from powerplants is also \nassociated with other dangerous chemicals.\n  A study led by the University of Syracuse and Harvard University \nfound that reducing carbon dioxide emissions from powerplants can also \nreduce emissions of other pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen \noxides, particulate matter, and mercury.\n  These dangerous chemicals contribute to acid rain, the destruction of \necosystems, ozone damage to trees and crops, and mercury in fish. These \ndangerous chemicals are also a direct threat to our health, increasing \nthe risk of heart attacks, asthma, and even death. Add all that up and \nwe have enough to know that reducing powerplant emissions will make a \nreal difference in the health of our children, our parents, and \nourselves.\n  Scientists all around the world have collected mountains of evidence \nabout the dangers of carbon pollution. Their basic conclusions are no \nlonger speculative or debatable. Even so, some politicians respond to \nthis evidence by denying it is true, by rejecting scientific evidence \nor by claiming they just cannot understand the science.\n  This country was not built by people who ignored facts. Sure, the \ndeniers can defend their friends in the pollution business, they can \nrail against science or pretend it does not exist, but the facts are \ncatching up with us. This pollution is killing people across this \ncountry. According to the American Lung Association, up to 100,000 \nasthma attacks and 4,000 premature deaths will be avoided in the first \nyear the clean power plan goes into effect.\n  Let the deniers deny the facts, but do not let them deny our children \nclean air to breathe or deny our parents long and healthy lives. The \nEPA's draft proposal based on its authority under the Clean Air Act is \na commonsense approach that builds on work already underway in States \nand cities across the country. Under the proposal, States will work \nwith the EPA to reduce carbon pollution, and they can use a variety of \ntools to do it. The clean power plan encourages States to be creative \nand efficient, to partner with private industry to give our children a \nsafer, healthier world.\n  In Massachusetts, we have seen how effective those solutions can be, \nafter passing laws to increase energy efficiency and encourage \nrenewable energy production. The Commonwealth joined neighboring States \nas part of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. We called it RGGI, \nand since 2005 RGGI has helped member States cut carbon emissions by 40 \npercent.\n  RGGI has shown results and it has done so with bipartisan support and \nthe backing of many members of the business community, members who \nunderstand that taking action against pollution is not only good for \nour public health and our environment, it is also good for business.\n  The fight against carbon pollution is about protecting our health, \nprotecting our communities, and protecting our future. But make no \nmistake, this fight is also about whether this country works only for \nbig energy companies or whether it works for everyone else too.\n  The terrible consequences of failing to act are real. We cannot \nafford to wait. But every time rules are proposed to clean up our air \nand water or to protect our environment, powerful deep-pocketed \ncorporations line up to fight these changes. These opponents and their \nRepublican friends are already attacking the EPA's proposed changes. \nTheir latest move is to argue that the EPA's efforts somehow are not \nlegal. That argument is laughable. Seven years ago, my State of \nMassachusetts led a multistate fight that went all the way to the \nSupreme Court to force the EPA to do its job to address carbon \npollution in this country. We won that case and we started the process \nthat resulted in the Supreme Court ruling that the EPA has the \nauthority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act.\n  Instead of embracing change, instead of working to develop rules to \nreduce pollution and protect the air we breathe, some companies and \ntheir Republican friends have fought change at every step. They loudly \ndefend a world where polluters cut their costs by spewing dangerous \nchemicals and greenhouse gases into our air and water, leaving everyone \nelse to deal with the consequences of their pollution.\n  They loudly defend a world where giant oil companies suck down \nbillions of dollars in subsidies every year, while the green energy \nindustries of the future fight for every scrap of support. They quietly \nwork to tilt the playing field against the technologies of the future \nso that clean energy entrepreneurs and innovators have a harder time \nsucceeding, while dirty energy companies keep raking in the profits.\n  Climate change is real. More than 120 million Americans live in \ncounties that border the shoreline and a rising sea that threatens \ntheir homes and their communities. Millions more live in the path of \nwildfires or will be caught in the drought that will devastate our \nland. But unlike big energy companies, they do not have armies of \nlobbyists and lawyers to protect their interests. They see Washington \nignore those problems and they see a system that is rigged against \nthem. These millions of Americans have only their voices, and they call \non us to fight for them, to\n\n[[Page S3336]]\n\nfight for meaningful action to address climate change.\n  The EPA's new clean power plan is one part of the solution. We must \nbuild on this proposal and continue our efforts to cut carbon \npollution, to improve energy efficiency, and to invest in building a \nclean energy economy.\n  I applaud President Obama and EPA Administrator McCarthy for their \nleadership in stepping up and pushing for meaningful standards, and I \nexpect that a strong final rule will be implemented next year because \nno matter the opposition, no matter how powerful those industries that \nwould let our forests burn, let our crops dry up, let our children get \nsick, and let our cities drown just to protect their own profits, we \nhave no choice but to take real action to fight climate change. The \nsimple truth is that our future depends on it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

RYTTING\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and thank Lt. Col. \nMatthew Rytting for over two decades of service in the U.S. Air Force. \nColonel Rytting will be retiring on June 13, 2014, and I am grateful \nfor his service and dedication to our Nation.\n  Colonel Rytting's career with the U.S. Air Force has been diverse and \nimpressive, and it has included service as a combat control team \nofficer, an F-15C fighter pilot, an F-4 instructor pilot, a chief of \nflight safety, a Civil Air Patrol commander, an Air Force One advance \nagent responsible for logistical and security support for Presidential \ntravel, and most recently as a UV-18B instructor pilot, director of \noperations and cofounder of the Wings of Blue Association at the U.S. \nAir Force Academy. Within just a few years of his graduation from the \nAir Force Academy, while serving as a combat control team officer and \nsquadron commander during Haiti's ``Uphold Democracy,'' he led a \nspecial operations team in providing communications and air traffic \ncontrol in nonpermissive environments, specializing in parachute \ninsertion techniques. Shortly thereafter, he won accolades as the top \nAir Force graduate in undergraduate pilot training at Columbus Air \nForce Base in Mississippi. His many accomplishments since then include \nDistinguished Graduate of the Air Force's Squadron Officer School, Top-\nWingman Awards in Singapore and Alaska as an F-15C Pilot, a Chief of \nStaff of the Air Force Safety Award in May 2007, Outstanding Graduate \nin the top 1 percent of his class from the U.S. Air Force Air War \nCollege, a Civil Air Pilot Meritorious Service Award, and a Big \nBrothers Big Sisters Big Brother of the Year Award in Fairbanks, AK.\n  Colonel Rytting's many accomplishments serve as a representation of \nhis strong sense of duty and commitment to our great Nation. I am \nparticularly impressed by Colonel Rytting's commitment to enhancing the \ncapabilities of our Nation's airmen, both through investigating \ncatastrophic aircraft mishaps in order to prevent future losses and \nthrough devoting years of service to the instruction of students and \nairmen in employing their aircraft and supporting joint, coalition and \nmultinational forces. As recently as 2013, as a safety officer and a \nBD-700 instructor pilot in Afghanistan, Colonel Rytting trained pilots \non how to provide the needed airborne communication bridges to ground \nforces entrenched in enemy areas, ultimately saving American lives. He \nalso instructed German Luftwaffe students in F-4 basic flight and air-\nto-air combat at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, led successful \nsafety programs for 250 aircrew at Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska, \nestablished a facility to train combat aircrews in advanced techniques \nat Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska, and directed 19,000 skydives and \n2,400 accident-free flight hours annually for the U.S. Air Force's \nparachute team Wings of Blue. Throughout his time in the Air Force, \nColonel Rytting set a wonderful example for his family and for the men \nand women who served with him in the Air Force. His commitment to the \nUnited States and his leadership within the Air Force is truly \ncommendable.\n  Colonel Rytting was proud to serve our country, and today I am proud \nto thank Colonel Rytting for his service to this Nation. I congratulate \nhim on his well-earned retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/02/senate-section/article/S3336-3", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE CALENDAR OBJECTION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State, and it has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful farm bills. But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Mahaska County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to secure funding in Mahaska County worth over $1.2 \nmillion and successfully acquired financial assistance from programs I \nhave fought hard to support, which have provided more than $64 million \nto the local economy.\n  Of course my favorite memory of working together has to be working \nwith people like Deb Philpot, executive director of the South Central \nIowa Center for Independent Living, who helps to promote independent \nliving for people with disabilities. There is no substitute for being \nable to live at home, close to your friends and family, and not in an \ninstitutional setting. I look forward to hearing about the kind of \nprogress that has been made in Oskaloosa.\n  Among the highlights:\n  Disability rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf. But I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, and the \nADA Amendments Act, I have had four guiding goals for our fellow \ncitizens with disabilities: equal opportunity, full participation, \nindependent living, and economic self-sufficiency. Nearly a quarter \ncentury since passage of the ADA, I see remarkable changes in \ncommunities everywhere I go in\n\n[[Page S3337]]\n\nIowa--not just in curb cuts or closed captioned television but in the \nfull participation of people with disabilities in our society and \neconomy, folks who at long last have the opportunity to contribute \ntheir talents and to be fully included. These changes have increased \neconomic opportunities for all citizens of Mahaska County, both those \nwith and without disabilities, and they make us proud to be a part of a \ncommunity and country that respects the worth and civil rights of all \nof our citizens.\n  Investing in Iowa's economic development through targeted community \nprojects: In Southeast Iowa, we have worked together to grow the \neconomy by making targeted investments in important economic \ndevelopment projects including improved roads and bridges, modernized \nsewer and water systems, and better housing options for residents of \nMahaska County. In many cases, I have secured Federal funding that has \nleveraged local investments and served as a catalyst for a whole ripple \neffect of positive, creative changes. For example, working with mayors, \ncity council members, and local economic development officials in \nMahaska County, I have fought for $476,000 for nursing and sciences \nteaching laboratories at William Penn University, helping to create \njobs and expand economic opportunities.\n  Main Street Iowa: One of the greatest challenges we face--in Iowa and \nall across America--is preserving the character and vitality of our \nsmall towns and rural communities. This isn't just about economics; it \nis also about maintaining our identity as Iowans. Main Street Iowa \nhelps preserve Iowa's heart and soul by providing funds to revitalize \ndowntown business districts. This program has allowed towns like \nOskaloosa to use that money to leverage other investments to jumpstart \nchange and renewal. I am so pleased that Mahaska County has earned \n$160,000 through this program. These grants build much more than \nbuildings. They build up the spirit and morale of people in our small \ntowns and local communities.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Mahaska County has received $598,650 in Harkin grants. Thank you \nto the leadership of Superintendent Russell Reiter for his ongoing \nsupport in the Oskaloosa Community School District. Similarly, schools \nin Mahaska County have received funds that I designated for Iowa Star \nSchools for technology totaling $89,500.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Mahaska County has received more than $42 \nmillion in loans and grants from a variety of programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as, \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Mahaska \nCounty's fire departments have received over $251,099 for firefighter \nsafety and operations equipment.\n  Wellness and health care: Improving the health and wellness of all \nAmericans has been something I have been passionate about for decades. \nThat is why I fought to dramatically increase funding for disease \nprevention, innovative medical research, and a whole range of \ninitiatives to improve the health of individuals and families not only \nat the doctor's office but also in our communities, schools, and \nworkplaces. I am so proud that Americans have better access to clinical \npreventive services, nutritious food, smoke-free environments, safe \nplaces to engage in physical activity, and information to make healthy \ndecisions for themselves and their families. These efforts not only \nsave lives, they will also save money for generations to come thanks to \nthe prevention of costly chronic diseases, which account for a whopping \n75 percent of annual health care costs. I am pleased that Mahaska \nCounty has recognized this important issue by securing $61,901 for \ncommunity wellness activities.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Mahaska County, during my time in Congress. In every \ncase, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in Mahaska \nCounty, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives. And, of course, \nthis work is never complete. Even after I retire from the Senate, I \nhave no intention of retiring from the fight for a better, fairer, \nricher Iowa. I will always be profoundly grateful for the opportunity \nto serve the people of Iowa as their Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/02/senate-section/article/S3337-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3337-S3338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DECATUR COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State. And it has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful Farm Bills. But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Decatur County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to secure funding in Decatur County worth over $2.7 \nmillion and successfully acquired financial assistance from programs I \nhave fought hard to support, which have provided more than $8.9 million \nto the local economy.\n  Of course my favorite memory of working together has to be our shared \ncommitment to school construction, renovation, and fire safety through \nthe Harkin grant program. Working together with State and local \ncommunities, this funding has ensured Iowa students are learning in \nschools that are safe and modern. I look forward to learning about the \nrenovations made possible in Decatur County.\n  Among the highlights:\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and\n\n[[Page S3338]]\n\nrepair efforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to \nbuilding new schools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served \nas the needed incentive to leverage local public and private dollars, \nso it often has a tremendous multiplier effect within a school \ndistrict. Over the years, Decatur County has received $1,604,352 in \nHarkin grants. Similarly, schools in Decatur County have received funds \nthat I designated for Iowa Star Schools for technology totaling \n$34,578.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Decatur County has received more than $1.4 \nmillion from a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as, \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Decatur \nCounty's fire departments have received over $738,000 for firefighter \nsafety and operations equipment.\n  Wellness and health care: Improving the health and wellness of all \nAmericans has been something I have been passionate about for decades. \nThat is why I fought to dramatically increase funding for disease \nprevention, innovative medical research, and a whole range of \ninitiatives to improve the health of individuals and families not only \nat the doctor's office but also in our communities, schools, and \nworkplaces. I am so proud that Americans have better access to clinical \npreventive services, nutritious food, smoke-free environments, safe \nplaces to engage in physical activity, and information to make healthy \ndecisions for themselves and their families. These efforts not only \nsave lives, they will also save money for generations to come thanks to \nthe prevention of costly chronic diseases, which account for a whopping \n75 percent of annual health care costs. I am pleased that Decatur \nCounty has recognized this important issue by securing over $49,000 in \nwellness grants and more than $1 million for the Community Health \nCenter in Leon.\n  Disability rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf. But I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, and the \nADA Amendments Act, I have had four guiding goals for our fellow \ncitizens with disabilities: equal opportunity, full participation, \nindependent living, and economic self-sufficiency. Nearly a quarter \ncentury since passage of the ADA, I see remarkable changes in \ncommunities everywhere I go in Iowa--not just in curb cuts or closed \ncaptioned television but in the full participation of people with \ndisabilities in our society and economy, folks who at long last have \nthe opportunity to contribute their talents and to be fully included. \nThese changes have increased economic opportunities for all citizens of \nDecatur County, both those with and without disabilities, and they make \nus proud to be a part of a community and country that respects the \nworth and civil rights of all of our citizens.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Decatur County, during my time in Congress. In every \ncase, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in Decatur \nCounty, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives. And, of course, \nthis work is never complete. Even after I retire from the Senate, I \nhave no intention of retiring from the fight for a better, fairer, \nricher Iowa. I will always be profoundly grateful for the opportunity \nto serve the people of Iowa as their Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/02/senate-section/article/S3338-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SCORE ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the 50th \nanniversary of the SCORE Association. SCORE is a nonprofit organization \nsupported by the U.S. Small Business Administration--SBA--dedicated to \nassisting small businesses through education and mentorship. Over the \npast 50 years, SCORE has been educating entrepreneurs and helping small \nbusinesses start, grow, and succeed nationwide.\n  As ranking member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I understand the spirit of entrepreneurs to explore \nbeyond their limits in order to achieve the dream of owning a \nsuccessful small business. Since SCORE opened its doors in 1964, it has \nprovided outstanding mentoring to entrepreneurs across the United \nStates, with 364 local chapters and the help of approximately 11,000+ \nvolunteers nationwide.\n  In addition, SCORE's Treasure Valley chapter in Idaho celebrates its \n43rd Anniversary this year. Since 1971, Treasure Valley SCORE has been \nhelping entrepreneurs and small business owners in Boise, Nampa, Eagle, \nCaldwell, and the surrounding areas. With the help of approximately 45 \nvaluable volunteers, Treasure Valley SCORE assists local Idaho small \nbusinesses through free mentoring and monthly workshops which have \nproduced a great deal of small business success stories from my home \nState.\n  Today, I applaud SCORE on their outstanding service to help local \nstartups sustain struggling businesses, and expand growth for existing \nbusinesses. It is always great to see an organization so dedicated to \nhelping entrepreneurs, particularly those located in rural areas, \nthrive in increasingly competitive global marketplaces.\n  Congratulations to SCORE for celebrating its 50th anniversary and to \nthe Treasure Valley SCORE chapter for celebrating its 43rd anniversary. \nSCORE's work in supporting small businesses and entrepreneurs, the \nbackbone of our great Nation's economy, is deeply valued by Congress \nand the entire nation. I wish SCORE, and especially the volunteers in \nthe Treasure Valley chapter, years of success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/02/senate-section/article/S3338-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/02/senate-section/article/S3338-3", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/02/senate-section/article/S3338-4", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3338-S3339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 3, 2013, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on May 23, 2014, during the adjournment of \nthe Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Denham) had signed the \nfollowing enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 862.
